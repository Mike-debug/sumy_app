4379204,35401,2020-10-15T10:00:00-04:00,"AppFolio faces slowing growth in an increasingly saturated market.
        Yardi and RealPage are now focusing on this segment.
        Aggressive accounting of capitalized software has led to an overstatement of historical earnings.","AppFolio (APPF) is priced for perfection despite facing 1) increasing levels of saturation in its core market, 2) growing competition, and 3) aggressive accounting practices that should, taken together, bring its valuation to far lower levels as these variables exacerbate.According to the company’s 10-K:Its software provides features such as handling maintenance requests, marketing, rental applications, tenant screening, accounting and reporting, online payments, etc.With AppFolio and other vendors’ historical success, the small and mid-sized market has become increasingly penetrated over the years. This can be seen even in AppFolio’s own disclosed data shown below.Property manager customer growth has slowed over time as has property unit growth. AppFolio’s pricing is based on the number of units each client manages. As total growth equals property unit growth plus same customer sales growth, this bodes ill for future growth sustainability.Our discussions with AppFolio customers support this thesis of saturation in the market. Even die-hard customers say that all of their peers have some sort of property management solution and are not just doing things on Excel spreadsheets. With its extreme valuation, I believe the market is not pricing in a saturation scenario for the company.In addition to increasing penetration, new competitors are beginning to enter the small and medium sized customer segment. Yardi, a traditional high-end competitor, is now beginning to increase its focus on the smaller end of the customer universe with its Yardi Breeze product. Saturation at the high end is causing Yardi to look elsewhere for growth and it is now targeting AppFolio’s sweet spot in the market. Similarly modern in its look and feel to AppFolio’s product, Breeze is poised to take market share in the smaller end of the marketplace. Furthermore, RealPage, through its Buildium subsidiary purchased in 2019, is doubling down on this customer segment as well.On its last conference call, RealPage CEO Stephen Winn said:You can see from Buildium’s disclosed numbers that it is growing faster than AppFolio and thus, taking market share. As competition from Breeze and Buildium increases in an increasingly saturated market, we believe growth will slow at AppFolio and the company’s heady valuation will decline.In addition to its top line challenges, we believe that AppFolio’s earnings are overstated due to an aggressive capitalized software policy. The company’s software capitalization has exceeded its amortization for the past five years resulting in a capitalized software asset on its balance sheet of $35.2 million, as you can see here and in the company's latest 10-Q.This accumulation of capitalized software was gradual in 2018, but then accelerated in 2019 and 2020. This high capitalization rate is rare amongst its SaaS software peers, which usually expense the vast majority of their R&D expenses. Examples of SaaS peers with zero software capitalization include Appian (APPN), Anaplan (PLAN), and SmartSheet (SMAR). If AppFolio had expensed its R&D instead of capitalizing it since its inception, earnings would be reduced by $35.2 million, basically wiping out the majority of its stated historical earnings stream. I emailed the company to discuss its capitalized software policy but received no response.Finally, the company’s accounts receivable balance popped up in Q2, from $9.6 million in Q1 to $12.7 million in Q2, a 32% increase. While the company has not explained the phenomenon explicitly, it could be that some customers are not paying due to the financial stress the pandemic is imposing on their businesses. This issue bears watching in future quarters.AppFolio currently trades at an enterprise value to revenue ratio of 18x 2020E revenue. This makes it one of the most expensive stocks in the small-cap universe. On an earnings basis, it trades at a 220x P/E ratio on 2020E earnings. While the company has shown good revenue growth historically, I do not think it has been scrutinized by investors as much as other SaaS companies have been. APPF trades 130,000 shares a day, far fewer than most of its peers. We believe this lack of scrutiny has created an opportunity to short a company whose growth should slow going forward and whose aggressive accounting may be not be given a pass by investors when held up to the light.We believe a fair value for the company should be at 8x 2020E revenue, trimmed from current levels for slowing growth, which would translate to a share price of $70 or 58% downside from current levels."
4338665,35181,2020-04-20T19:20:58-04:00,"AppFolio has strong historical fundamentals, including 35% annual revenue growth and 12% free cash flow margin.The government-mandated shutdown is causing many renters to move in with family or friends because they can't afford rent.While historical performance is strong, I expect that AppFolio's property management platform will take a hit during the pandemic and expected global recession.","AppFolio Inc. (NASDAQ:APPF) has been one of my favorite stock picks this past year. In fact, I gave the company a bullish rating back in early January. The stock price has held up as well as could be expected since then, losing 11% versus the 13% for the S&P 500 in the extremely turbulent market conditions.(Source: Seeking Alpha)AppFolio provides a SaaS platform that primarily focuses on real estate property management. I have been bullish on this company as a result of its great performance, with strong annual revenue growth of 35% and a positive free cash flow margin of 12%. These are factors that would be quite desirable in a strong market.But the pandemic changed everything in a heartbeat. The macroeconomy has shifted dramatically and is undoubtedly putting tremendous pressure on real estate and the housing market. More than 20 million Americans have lost their jobs and the government has not been particularly clear on landlord/renter strategies other than that they should work together:Across the country, only three-fourths of renters would be able to cover one month of their housing expenses with the $1,200 one-time payment by the government. One has to wonder what will happen when the pandemic-driven economic slowdown stretches to six months, one year and beyond.In one survey, a little over 80 percent of respondents have stayed put, while the remainder has moved in with family, a partner or a roommate since the start of COVID-19.(Source: realtor.com)It is also unlikely that very many rental units will be filled during the government-mandated shutdown. Under the current circumstances, it is difficult for prospective tenants to view rental units, and they prefer to see a rental home in person. In all likelihood, many rental units will be empty during the government-mandated shutdown portion of the pandemic.So, despite the recurring revenue business model, I expect that AppFolio will not be immune to the pressures seen by property managers and tenants. Property managers (AppFolio's clients) will most certainly be asking for concessions from AppFolio. Additional pressure on AppFolio's revenue stream may result from usage-based fees from some of the Value+ services.There is one bright side, and that is the company's electronic payment services for rent collection which may become very popular as a result of social distancing.There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher growth stocks are valued more than lower growth stocks and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward sales, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how AppFolio stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the valuation. In this instance, AppFolio is situated slightly above the best-fit line. This suggests that AppFolio is modestly overvalued on a relative basis. However, the overvaluation is so minor that I wouldn't reject investment in AppFolio based on this factor alone.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The metric sidesteps the valuation dilemma for high-growth companies that generally don't show profits. The Rule of 40 allows for both revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) in combination such that they must add up to at least 40%. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can turn a blind eye to negative free cash flow to some extent. On the other hand, if a company grows by less than 40%, then the company should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less than ideal growth.This rule accommodates both young high-growth companies as well as mature moderate growth companies. Young companies tend to have high revenue growth but are burning cash. Mature companies have lower revenue growth, but they make up in terms of free cash flow. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to one of my previous articles.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In AppFolio's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 35% + 12% = 47%AppFolio scores above the 40% needed to fulfill the Rule of 40. Exceeding the Rule of 40 signifies that AppFolio has a healthy balance between growth and profitability.According to the Q4 2019 earnings call transcript, the company management indicated that expenses have risen faster than revenue:The timing for the increased headcount was unfortunate, given the expected economic downturn that will likely affect future results.AppFolio provides software for the real estate market that is designed to meet the operational and business needs of property management companies. This company has great fundamentals, including 35% annual revenue growth, 12% free cash flow margin and handily meets the Rule of 40. But these figures are historical, and it is quite likely that AppFolio will be subjected to the same heartaches as the rest of the real estate market during the pandemic and likely recession to follow. The high unemployment rate is causing renters to have difficulty with rent payments with the end result that many are moving in with family or friends. It is unlikely that many empty rental units will be filled during social distancing. It is unlikely that AppFolio will be completely insulated from the economic damage. Therefore, I am giving AppFolio a neutral rating."
4316100,35181,2020-01-09T23:06:34-05:00,AppFolio is a SaaS provider that primarily focuses on real estate.Sales growth of 30+% is being bolstered by new and expanded features.The stock price is staging a breakout to all-time highs.,"I am a strong believer in market action. When a stock is making a move higher and pushing 52-week or all-time highs, it's best to take notice. AppFolio Inc. (APPF) is one of those stocks.2020 has started out with a bang for SaaS companies. I am like a kid in a candy shop, and I am actually having a difficult time prioritizing which stocks to write about. But AppFolio got my attention simply due to the pretty chart, with today's price jump of almost 3% emphasizing where this stock is headed.Back in July, I had some concerns with AppFolio. I expressed them in this article: ""AppFolio: Every Dog Is Allowed One Bite"". I must confess that some of these concerns still persist, but the stock breakout, coupled with new product features, a great economy, no chance of interest rate hikes, and an impending presidential election which is usually bullish for the stock market, lead me to believe that it is best to embrace this stock while the going is good.For the above reasons, I am adjusting my rating for AppFolio from Neutral to Bullish.As I have explained in recent articles, high-growth companies generally don't measure up based on traditional value metrics. In fact, they often confound analysts, with the result being a lost investment opportunity. In place of traditional value factors, I generally focus on other measures, such as revenue growth, free cash flow margin, and the software company ""Rule of 40%"".AppFolio had an excellent year with trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 33%. The company's 5-year annual growth rate of 48% is also extremely good.(Source: Portfolio123)AppFolio’s free cash flow margin TTM has been positive since the Spring of 2017 and is currently sitting at a very healthy 12.8% of revenues.(Source: Portfolio123)The recent slight decline in free cash flow margin is the result of an increase in headcount due to the new product features that I will discuss a little later in this article.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40%. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40: some analysts use EBITDA and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40% is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In AppFolio’s case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 34.6% + 12.8% = 47.4%Since the calculation comes out at 47.4%, I conclude that the company is in good shape financially.The thrust of the bull case rides on the investments that AppFolio has made in several areas that are expected to impact long-term growth. These include:I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"", also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, AppFolio is over the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is higher than its peers', given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that AppFolio is moderately relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.However, a similar evaluation based on next year's earnings estimate / EV suggests that the company is fairly valued.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)Considering the two evaluations, I believe that AppFolio is overvalued based on its EV/forward sales multiple but fairly valued considering the expected earnings looking forward.While I believe that now is the time to initiate a position in AppFolio, the investment comes with significant risks, as summarized below.While software stock valuations have come down in recent months, they are still high on a historical basis. I would not dismiss the possibility of a dot-com-like crash in the future.There are other uncertainties, such as the rising tension in the Middle East, trade disputes, and President Trump's impeachment, which could cause a market downturn. Software stocks tend to get hit hard during any market turbulence.The new product initiatives described in the previous section may not prove to be as fruitful as company management expects, and this would result in lowered margins and profitability.The Total Addressable Market (TAM) appears to be limited, and future growth will depend upon expansion into Europe, entering new verticals, and increased sales to larger customers. Failure to do so effectively will likely result in stagnation in revenue growth.AppFolio has a history of negative earnings surprises as shown below.(Source: Portfolio123)Negative surprises tend to have an impact on the stock price.AppFolio is a SaaS provider that focuses primarily on real estate (90%), with a minor interest in legal markets (10%). It has a strong YoY revenue growth of 34% and will likely have similar growth during the coming year.The company has a good free cash flow margin, and, combined with good sales growth, scores well on the software Rule of 40%.Several new product features have been introduced, and company management believes that these initiatives will fuel future revenue growth. The company stock price is responding with an apparent breakout to all-time highs. I am a firm believer in embracing positive market action, and I believe that now is the time to turn positive or risk losing the opportunity. For this reason, I am changing my AppFolio rating from Neutral to Bullish.I do have some concerns, including moderate overvaluation and limited TAM. Future success is dependent on how well customers respond to AppFolio's product initiatives and the company's expansion into new markets. This investment should be kept on a short leash."
4344945,104952,2020-05-08T14:54:43-04:00,"AppFolio builds a SaaS offering for only one market, which is the real estate. It has simple pricing, business model, and go-to-market.The simplicity of the business potentially drives the outperformance.Since the IPO in 2015, revenue and shares price have increased by over 3x and 10x, respectively.","AppFolio (NASDAQ:APPF) is an interesting investment opportunity in the SaaS real estate space. Revenue growth and OCF/Operating Cash Flows have been solid, while the business is profitable. Furthermore, the net profit margin has been in steady expansion as share price more than doubled over the last two years. The share price continued to trend upwards in 2020. It had a ~32% run-up to its YTD-high in February, right before the broader COVID-19 selloff. The stock has fallen by ~20% since then, which creates an attractive entry point to pick it up at a bargain.In a nutshell, AppFolio makes money by selling an all-in-one cloud property management/PM software. To a much lesser extent, it also has a presence in the legal industry as it sells a similar software to the small law firm customers. This business is less successful and only makes up less than 10% of AppFolio's revenue. On the other hand, AppFolio's business as a whole has been exceptionally strong. Since the IPO in 2015, revenue has more than tripled, while share price has increased tenfold.(Source: AppFolio.com/pricing)We believe that the key to AppFolio's outperformance is the overall simplicity of the business. Given its focus on cloud-based PM software, AppFolio only needs to focus on one niche market, which is the real estate. The per unit/month pricing scheme is also straightforward and scalable for the customers. Moreover, simplicity would reduce the chance of making major execution mistakes. Consequently, the company's execution has been very solid. While top-line growth already decelerated to +36% towards the end of 2017 from +57% in 2015, the company has maintained growth in and around the +30% level as of the end of 2019.The property management industry also provides an attractive upside, given the inherent digital transformation opportunity existing in any of the companies in the market. AppFolio's focus in this market has allowed it to broaden its offering to include tenant debt collection, renter's insurance marketplace, analytics, and AI through both organic and acquisitions over the last five years. All these solutions target the stakeholders across the property management ecosystem such as the tenants, owners, and property managers.(Source: stockrow)Over time, these activities have resulted in strong market positioning and economic moat. The business turned net profitable at the end of 2017, and since then, the net margin has expanded by over 750 bps. Moreover, shareholder value has also improved exponentially as ROE/Return on Equity grew by over 1,900 bps within the same period.As per the Q1 earnings call, the outlook remains unclear, given the COVID-19 situation. While revenue still grew at 27% YoY, driven by the 18% increase in units under management in Q1, an overexposure to one sector can also amplify the risk. Over 90% of AppFolio's revenue is derived from its real estate PM business. Major property construction delays due to the continuation of COVID-19-related restrictions on business activities, for instance, will create a systemic contraction in demand for AppFolio's products.The stock seems expensive from the P/E perspective. It currently trades at 121x P/E, which implies that a growth expectation of ~120% is required to reach a fair value. At the moment, growth is still relatively very strong at +30% YoY. Moreover, the company's strong bottom-line, ROE, and cash flow generation easily explain the premium. Given the strong growth, it is also more relevant to look at AppFolio from the P/S perspective.(APPF vs PAYC vs HUBS vs FIVN vs BL. Source: stockrow)Among the other cloud software stocks with a relatively similar business model, growth, and size, AppFolio stands out. It is the fastest-growing and the only player aside from Paycom (NYSE:PAYC) with a positive net margin. It is rare to find a profitable company growing at +34% that trades at ~14x P/S.Furthermore, profitability and cash flow generation are also in upward trends as they improve every year. AppFolio is relatively in a flexible position as it plans its corporate strategy going forward to improve the already strong ~32% ROE. It can pay dividends, buybacks, or engage in more M&A deals. Having been down ~20% from its YTD-high where it reached ~18x P/S, the stock is a bargain at 14x P/S today."
4306087,104812,2019-11-13T03:38:15-05:00,"AppFolio reported Q3 earning with impressive 36% revenue growth, while higher spending has pressured profitability.We highlight a decelerating pace of customer count growth as a weak trend suggesting the company will rely more on growing revenue per customer.The stock remains highly speculative, trading at over 10x year-ahead forecast sales.The article highlights recent earnings release and our view on outlook with trends to watch.","AppFolio, Inc. (NASDAQ:APPF) provides cloud-based software solutions for the real estate property management industry along with applications for legal practices. The company, with a history going back to 2006 and publicly traded since 2015, has posted impressive growth benefiting from the ongoing transition by customers increasingly utilizing more software-as-a-service tools to market, automate and manage their operations. The stock is up over 400% in just the past three years, with ongoing momentum supported by recent profitability. The company just reported its latest earnings release, which beat expectations while we raise concerns over the valuation and question how much of the growth outlook is already priced in. This article recaps the latest developments and our view on where the stock is headed next.(Source: FinViz.com)AppFolio reported its Q3 earnings on October 28th with GAAP EPS of $0.14, which beat expectations by $0.05. Revenue of $68 million increased by 35.5% year over year and was also ahead of estimates. This was the strongest quarterly revenue growth rate going back to Q2 2017. On the other hand, earnings were down this quarter from $0.16 in Q3 last year based on higher expenses.(Source: Company IR) Operating metrics for the company include a 19% increase in property manager units under management and an 11% increase in the number of property manager customers. The company also grew its legal vertical customer count by 6%.The story this quarter was really the sharp increase in operating expenses, with most items exceeding the revenue growth rate. Year to date, the income from operations at $6.4 million is down from $16.7 million over the nine months in 2018. Some of this was expected but highlights a new phase in the company's maturity cycle where it's again ramping up spending to maintain growth. Sales and marketing increased 46%, while R&D reached $10.6 million from $6.4 million in Q3 2018. Year to date, the operating margin has declined to just 3.4% from 12.1% last year. Management highlighted the higher costs this quarter as investments towards long-term shareholder value. From the conference call:The company raised its full-year 2019 revenue guidance to be in the range of $254.5-255.5 million, which represents year-over-year revenue growth of over 34% at the midpoint. The guidance target is at approximately the level of current consensus estimates, while the market is forecasting revenues to again grow by 27% in 2021 and 22% in 2022 - otherwise very impressive numbers.Data by YChartsIn terms of earnings, compared to EPS of $0.56 in 2018, the market is looking for a 1-cent increase to $0.57 for the full year 2019, which may reach $0.77 in 2020 and $1.185 in 2021. The estimates here imply a lofty valuation premium considering the current stock price of $100.Data by YChartsOne of the dynamics supporting the growth of AppFolio's software solutions is simply the high adoption rate within its targeted industries. The fastest-growing Software-as-a-Service (""SaaS"") firms, including AppFolio, benefit from what can be described as viral marketing among potential customers. In this case, it's likely most small and medium-sized property management companies along with legal practices in the United States have at least heard of the AppFolio product suite. If the product is good enough, it oftentimes sells itself. The reality is that there are not many completely integrated alternatives to the AppFolio software that is replicated by competitors. AppFolio features a ""cost savings calculator"" that demonstrates potential savings by customers from using the productivity tools compared to traditional and legacy methods.AppFolio continues to invest to build out new features to strengthen the value proposition. With ""Property Manager Plus"", the company offers additional tools and services to streamline more complex operations targeting bigger customers. The tools are core business requirements, and it makes sense for current customers to remain engaged and represents recurring revenue for the company through the foreseeable future. We think the operational outlook for the company is strong, driven by a best-in-class product.(Source: Company website)Considering a 1-year forward P/E and P/S ratio, based on 2020 consensus estimates, APPF trading at 129x and 10.5x 2020 consensus suggests an extreme level of bullishness towards the stock's long-term outlook. Part of the reasoning is the long runway for growth and the potential for future international expansion as a largely untapped market. Still, the multiples here suggest an outlook of at least 5 to 10 years of exceptional growth to justify such premium. The time frame exposes APPF to a number of execution and market cycle risks. As good as AppFolio's market position and growth metrics may be, the concern is how much of the future opportunity is already priced in.Data by YChartsThe uncertainty here is not so much on the revenue side but in terms of how costs and expenses will evolve as AppFolio continues to invest in its software suite to maintain ahead of completion and keep up with industry trends. A potential expansion to international market would likely require local-based sales teams and development of specific features to account for differences in business practices, taxes, and regulations that could involve some significant costs and will come with higher risks.One of the trends we are watching is the deceleration of new customer acquisition. The Property Management Industry vertical customer count increased by 11% year over year, which has slowed sequentially in recent quarter and down from 17% in Q3 2017. The legal industry business new customer growth is also slowing, up just 6% y/y in Q3 compared to a rate of 11% in Q3 2018. We think the market may pay closer attention to these dynamics should the rates dip further below ""double digits"" for Property Management and 5% in legal.(Source: Data by AppFolio Financial Statements / graph by author)This trend is acceptable if the company is able to continuously grow the average revenue per customer by adding features as the relationships evolve and the underlying businesses grow, but highlights the evolving market position of AppFolio in its key markets. The company has passed that early-stage explosive period. The thought here is that at least in the United States, AppFolio may have already captured the ""low-hanging fruit"" of potential customers and will need to reach more marginal businesses to find new customers.The company is betting that it can target larger businesses and move away from relying on small and medium-sized companies, but the market faces different challenges as large corporations may be more committed to legacy solutions. A move towards higher sales and marketing expenses to reach new customers and a trend of less economically significant accounts could represent downside to current estimates.There's also a question over competition. AppFolio markets itself as the best ""all-in-one"" solution. At the end of the day, business management tools for tasks like billing, reporting, communications, payments, etc. aren't exactly rocket science. It is possible an emerging rival can offer similar solutions and gain traction in the market at a more competitive pricing down the line. AppFolio highlights in its annual report that there are a number of alternative software products in the market that feature a ""point"" solution specializing on a particular feature, like billing, for example. In our view, it becomes a question of when, not if, an alternative will gain traction. Overall, there's simply more risk for the company now.Recognizing AppFolio's impressive growth story and market position, we can't escape the valuation multiples, and see the company challenged to really exceed what are already sky-high expectations. The recent profitability pressures from higher investments highlight a new stage for the company in its attempt to capture larger clients, which carries higher risks. We rate shares of APPF as a Sell with a belief that the bullish case is more than priced in.The possibility that the upcoming results show underperformance could open the door for more significant downside. Monitoring points going forward include growth in the core customer count between the two verticals and how the trends in operating expenses evolve."
4233426,24594,2019-01-15T09:05:17-05:00,"APPF has done everything a growth stock investor could want, with impressive revenue increases and enormous margin expansion.But market share in the competitive property management vertical is growing - and operating leverage has slowed.At 11x EV/revenue and 49x EV/EBITDA, AppFolio likely leads another catalyst - and it's not clear where that comes from.","The story at property management and legal software developer AppFolio (APPF) has been everything a growth investor could ask for. Revenue growth has been steady and impressive: 41% in 2016, 36% last year, and a guided 30%+ in 2018 (which given AppFolio's history likely is conservative). Operating leverage has been enormous and almost stunningly quick: Adjusted EBITDA (by my calculations; AppFolio doesn't give non-GAAP figures) was negative in 2015, while YTD margins are 23%+.The concern is valuation. I argued close to two years ago that APPF was flying somewhat under the radar. At this point, however, investors certainly have noticed:APPF data by YChartsEven with a ~one-third haircut from September highs (a pullback likely driven more by market weakness than anything from AppFolio itself), APPF has risen more than 400% from its 2015 IPO price of $15.And as impressive as the story has been, even at a cheaper price, it's tough to get too excited about APPF looking forward. At 11x+ revenue and ~50x 2018 EBITDA, valuation still looks stretched. There are some concerns about competition and growth within the property management space, and the smaller legal business isn't moving the needle. AppFolio still needs another catalyst, and while the company has a move in its back pocket, it's not clear when - or how - it can make that move.As noted, AppFolio serves two markets. The key product is AppFolio Property Manager, a cloud-based platform used in multiple sub-markets (residential, commercial, student housing, community associations) which manages vacancies, communication, billing, accounting, and other aspects of the business.On top of APM, AppFolio continues to roll out what it calls 'Value+' offerings. These include web development, tenant screening, tenant payments, debt collection, renters' insurance, and even qualified leads.On the legal side, the company's MyCase legal software targets solo practitioners and smaller (<20 employees) firms. MyCase allows for management both in terms of caseload and billing, with 'Value+' services including web development and electronic payments.Both units face plenty of competition. In property management, AppFolio faces off against larger RealPage (RP), and privately held Yardi and Buildium. In legal, Thomson Reuters (TRI) and Lexis-Nexis (owned by RELX (RELX)) have a significant share.That said, AppFolio managed competition quite well. In 2017, revenue rose 36%. Value+ revenue increased 42%, and core revenue climbed 31%. Property management customers rose 16.7%, and units under management, 21%.What the numbers show is that the top-line strategy is working. AppFolio is trying to get larger customers - and unit growth is outpacing customer growth (a trend that has continued into 2018). It's trying to add more services per customer and per unit - and revenue, particularly in Value+, is growing faster than customer and unit counts.More impressively, AppFolio has driven that growth while managing spend and creating impressive operating leverage. Sales and marketing expense actually declined less than 1% year over year in 2017, per the 10-K; S&M spend has risen 10% in the first nine months of 2018 but still has leveraged 340 bps. AppFolio has put money behind R&D, which is on track to more than double in three years, but overall operating margin expansion has been impressive. GAAP operating margins were negative 8% in 2016 before improving to ~6.5% last year and 12%+ YTD. Adjusted EBITDA (my calculation, which adds back stock-based comp for comparability and small expenses in 2018 for a legal settlement and acquisition costs) margins went from negative as recently as 2015 to 23%+ in the first three quarters of this year.Particularly in property management, it's a truly impressive growth story; in fact, it's almost textbook. And it's not over yet by any means. Around the time of the IPO, William Blair estimated a total addressable market over $6 billion ($4.5B in property management, $1.6B in legal); 2018 revenue guidance of $187-$188 million suggests only 3%+ penetration. (RealPage cites a TAM of close to $10 billion in its 10-K, which suggests an even longer runway and lower current penetration.) There are more Value+ services to roll out, with the September acquisition of WegoWise moving the company into utilities management. The initial focus on SMBs already has moved upmarket, and AppFolio might be able to target larger customers still. And there's still the plan to at some point find a new vertical beyond the two existing markets.Meanwhile, APPF has pulled back by some 33% from all-time highs hit in September. And there's not really much in the way of company-specific news to support the decline. Q3 earnings in late October did miss consensus EPS estimates, and spend was higher than expected. But management repeatedly has warned that investments behind the business are going to be lumpy, and the 10-Q suggests higher-than-usual spending behind IT services of late. There's a nice case here that investors are getting a discount on a fantastic growth story.Again, a lot of growth seems priced into APPF at the moment. And there are some concerns that are minor in the context of the story, but perhaps loom larger for investors considering paying 11x+ sales for the stock.On the top line, property management growth has been impressive. But there's a real question as to whether AppFolio is benefiting from a shift more broadly to the cloud and to industry-targeted platforms. This, after all, per commentary from AppFolio and other sources, is an industry that quite often managed its business on Microsoft (MSFT) Excel.Unit growth already is decelerating, unsurprisingly, and on that front, a ceiling may be approaching sooner rather than later. RealPage's 10-K cites an estimate of 44.2 million rental units in 2015; three years later, that figure likely is in the 50 million range (assuming ~4% annual growth). That company closed 2017 with 13 million units (albeit with some vacation rental unit contribution). AppFolio closed Q3 with 3.7 million. Buildium had over 1.8 million at year-end, per a recent press release.That's 36% of the market right there - in a market that likely isn't going to be 100% penetrated, or close. Unit growth overall likely continues to decelerate, then.AppFolio can roll out more services, through both organic development and acquisitions like the WegoWise deal. TTM revenue per unit (assuming PM drives 92% of total sales, and using the trailing four-quarter average of units managed) is just $47. RealPage estimates potential revenue of $370 annually for ""conventional multifamily units"", and even more for student and senior housing. But those Value+ services in many cases may pressure margins. Per the Q, third-payment payments have risen $6.4 million YTD - roughly half the total dollar increase in cost of revenue and fully 20% of revenue growth. Gross margins, which had expanded steadily of late (+680 bps between 2015 and 2017), have risen just 90 bps YTD, even backing out the one-time class-action settlement (an ~80 bps impact).Between competition, a potential ceiling on the market, and slowing margin expansion (if only because EBITDA margins already have hit 23%), there are reasons to project deceleration in both revenue and profits in the property management business.And that essentially is AppFolio, at least at this point. As noted, the legal business drives less than 10% of revenue. But it also accounts for 45% of customers, per figures from the Q, which in turn likely suggests higher acquisition costs and lower lifetime values and margins. AppFolio has promised to break out segment-level data when legal gets to 10% of revenue; it hasn't done so yet, meaning 2018 revenue likely is ~$18 million at most.Against a $2 billion-plus market cap, it's tough to see legal moving the needle much here. If property management shows any sign of weakness - whether because low-hanging fruit on the customer acquisition front has been captured and/or competition intensifies/wins - APPF likely takes a hit.There is the possibility of moving into new markets, as AppFolio management has said for some time (including in 10-K filings). An international move could add another growth driver. Stateside, AppFolio could follow the strategy that has been executed so well by Veeva Systems (VEEV), who began with big fish in life sciences and after largely claiming that market has moved into CPG (consumer packaged goods) and chemicals with its Vault. The question for AppFolio is: what market? There hasn't been really any discussion from management on that front (though AppFolio's commentary is more limited than most, particularly in SaaS; not a criticism, just an observation) and there isn't an obvious adjacent and uncrowded vertical into which to move. So much money has poured into SaaS in both the public and private markets over the past few years that it seems highly unlikely there's any virgin territory left.All told, AppFolio seems pretty well reliant on property management. So far, that's been more than good enough. Looking forward, it's not guaranteed that will be the case - particularly at 50x EBITDA and something like 60x 2019 EPS backing out cash.Relative to the space, APPF's valuation isn't necessarily ludicrous: even with the tech weakness seen in Q4, there's no shortage of SaaS plays at 10x+ revenue. 2019 EPS probably is in the range of $1 (consensus is at $0.98), given a likely ~$0.75 this year backing out one-time effects and a roughly $0.05 impact to Q3 earnings from WegoWise (according to details in the Q). That assumes no impact from the January acquisition of ""conversational AI"" provider Dynasty for $60 million.And there's an interesting debate between APPF and RP. Using calendar year guidance for both companies, AppFolio's multiples are roughly double: ~11x sales and 49x EBITDA (the latter my estimate), against under 6x and ~24x, respectively, for RealPage. But AppFolio is growing much faster: RealPage's 10-Q suggests YTD revenue growth pro forma for a number of acquisitions of just 11.5%.That said, it's tough to see either company as notably attractive at the moment. The case for APPF back in 2017 was based on the idea that multiples could expand as the story gained traction and the stock re-rated toward other SaaS plays. That case has played out (and then some at Q3 highs). There are myriad software stocks available at 10-12x revenue with 30%+ growth - many of which are horizontal plays without the potential market constraints AppFolio will face in property management at some point.I don't see much of a case for a short, admittedly: SaaS in general has been a graveyard for shorts betting against valuation (save for the past few months in most of the space). Execution, as noted, has been fantastic of late. And AppFolio does have the international and new vertical cards to play (ask VEEV shorts, of which I was once one, about betting against that potential).But it's tough to reconcile the valuation with even the attractive story here. Growth has been impressive - but it's likely to slow at some point. AppFolio has moves to make - but it's not clear what those moves will be, or when they will happen. $61 is cheaper than the $90+ on offer in September. But I'm not sure it's really cheap - or close to cheap enough."

AppFolio (APPF) is a SaaS player operating in niche vertical markets like real estate management and law practice management.Santa Barbara, California-based AppFolio was founded in 2006 by Klaus Schauser and Jon Walker to focus on efficient property management for small-to-medium businesses. It launched its flagship product AppFolio Property Manager in 2007. It later expanded to the legal practice management vertical with the acquisition of MyCase in 2012.Today, it offers AppFolio Property Manager, AppFolio Property Manager PLUS and AppFolio Investment Management for the real estate market and legal practice management software MyCase. It also offers Value+ services, such as its website design, electronic payment services, tenant screening, insurance, contact center, premium leads, and tenant debt collections services.For the recent second quarter, AppFolio reported revenue of $63.6 million, up 35%, just short of analyst estimates of $63.7 million. GAAP net income was $23.2 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, which includes an income tax benefit of $21.3 million, primarily related to the release of its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. Analysts estimated earnings of $0.11 per share. The company ended the quarter with cash balance of $43 million and total debt of $49.4 million.Core solutions, or subscription-based revenue, grew 28% to $20.8 million. Value+ services, or fee-based revenue from optional services, grew 36% to $39.1 million. Property manager customers grew 12% to 13,737, while legal customers grew 6% to 10,631.Full-year revenue is expected to be in the range of $253-255 million.In May, AppFolio completed its $54 million acquisition of Dynasty Marketplace, a leading provider of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for the real estate market. Based on this acquisition, AppFolio recently released Lisa, an AI Leasing Assistant. Lisa is designed to help deal with a high volume of rental inquiries. It helps provide thoughtful, personable responses via text messages and email to prospective renters in real time. It also tracks leasing performance with accurate data. Founded in 2016, Los Angeles-based Dynasty had an estimated annual revenue of $1 million. It had raised an undisclosed amount from Lowercase Capital in 2016.AppFolio also launched Utility Management, which is based on its 2018 acquisition of analytics platform WeGoWise for an undisclosed amount. Utility Management is a Value+ service designed to increase efficiency by automating utility bill processing and resident billing. Founded in 2010, Boston-based WeGoWise had raised $4.9 million in funding from Boston Community Capital and had an estimated revenue of $1.4 million.With both these acquisitions and products, AppFolio is upselling to target large portfolio property managers and owners. I like the way the company is scaling via capital-efficient acquisitions.AppFolio went public in 2015 at a list price of $12 and raised $74 million in the IPO. Before going public, it had raised $30 million in five funding rounds from Kevin Milden, e.ventures, Investment Group of Santa Barbara, Cisco, Ospre Point Capital, and Dragoneer Investment Group.The stock is currently trading around $95.06 with a market cap of $3.24 billion. Its 52-week range is $51.15-109.89Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4370355,21702,2020-08-24T05:27:06-04:00,"AppFolio has a P/E of 225 and is priced for absolute perfection - and then some.Yet underlying customer growth in its property management and legal segments were up only 9.3% and 6.3%, respectively, yoy.Earnings for Q2 were actually down 17% yoy.While there were some temporary or one-time charges in the current quarter, even without the charges the EPS growth rate would not substantiate the current valuation.Shares could easily drop 30% on a market correction.","Property managers use AppFolio's (APPF) powerful cloud-based property management software to get their work done remotely while maintaining connections to their teams and customers. The company also provides services to legal firms to help manage and grow their businesses. The stock has been on an absolute tear over the past year (up ~70%). That's partly due to growing revenue but mostly due to the market rewarding any company operating in the tech/cloud sectors - sometimes without regards to the fundamentals like growth in revenue and earnings. As a result, AppFolio has - according to Seeking Alpha - a P/E of 225. Considering AppFolio is no startup, that kind of sky-high valuation is indicative of a company that is ripe for a sharp correction in its stock price.One might think from the company's stock price performance that AppFolio is growing earnings at a rapid clip. That certainly wasn't the case in the most recent Q2 report:Source: Q2 EPS ReportAs can be seen by the graphic, revenue for the first 6 months of 2020 compared to the first 6 months of 2019 was 27% higher. That would be encouraging if it wasn't for the fact that total costs and operating expenses rose 22%. Expenses noticeably rose across the board: Sales & Marketing, R&D, G&A, and D&A.Combined with other charges, net income was actually 21% lower over the same time frame.GAAP net income was $19.3 million or $0.54/share. That included an income tax benefit of $13.5 million attributable to tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation expense and R&D tax credits. Also included in the Q2 results was a $2.8 million non-cash charge related to stock-based compensation (increases in estimates for annual performance accruals).It is quite surprising that AppFolio's expenses have risen so fast. One of the advantages of most successful cloud-based software companies is the ability to rapidly increase revenue while development costs stay relatively low - or at least increase at a much slower pace as compared to revenue. That doesn't seem to be the case at AppFolio despite the fact they have been in business for more than 5 years.On the Q2 conference call, CFO Ida Kane mentioned the company has 1,300 employees. Annualizing Q2 revenue equates to ~$250,000 in revenue per employee. That bodes well for the future if APPF can get a grip on its expenses and keep growing revenue.AppFolio also said headcount grew 15% year-over-year to support new offerings. That's quite a jump in headcount given the apparent lack of visibility into 2H revenue.The company also reported it ended Q2 with 15,011 real estate property manager customers compared to 13,737 customers reported one-year ago (+9.3%). Those managers ran as aggregate of 4.9 million units in their portfolios. That compares to 4.23 million units under management reported one year ago (+15.8%).One reason G&A increased by ~$6.5 billion in Q2 versus Q2 FY2019 was a $4.25 million expense related to a potential settlement relating to a previously disclosed FTC investigation into AppFolio's tenant screening value plus service. The company said it believes that to be ""a reasonable estimate based on information currently available to us.""The balance sheet is relatively strong. The company closed the quarter with $80.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. Including a Q1 2020 drawdown on its revolving facility in the amount of $49 million, the company ended Q2 with $97.1 million of total debt.The primary use of cash during the quarter was cap-ex of $6.3 million related to the build-out of a new corporate headquarters building in Santa Barbara that was substantially completed during the quarter. The other big spend was capitalized software development costs of $5.9 million in connection with continued investment in its technology and service offering.In the Q2 report, the company said it was:So, investors don't have any guidance to go off of. The company did remark on the conference call that it had added 3D-tours to the portfolio and expanded the AppFolio Property Manager's capabilities to include AppFolio virtual showings: a virtual leasing experience that allows customers to conduct leasing operations even during times of social distancing. The company said:The virtual app is a positive development given the current environment and could help lead to adoption of AppFolio by new customers wanting to offer a virtual leasing experience.The company is also working to add more support for property managers and real estate investment professionals to:In the AppFolio legal vertical, the company ended the quarter with 11,305 customers, up from 10,631 one year ago (+6.3%). To help legal firms acquire new clients, APPF released online lead capture forms that enable customers to more easily collect information from prospective clients and manage the resulting lead to its MyCase app. The company also expanded the functionality of e-signatures as law firms, their clients and the court systems increasingly rely on technology to support remote interactions in a COVID-19 environment. It should be noted that these trends will likely remain after COVID-19 in that they are quicker, cheaper, and more efficient.Valuation is risk #1 for AppFolio. Even if we add back the expenses for the new headquarters ($6.3 million) and FTC settlement charges ($4.25 million), Q2 net income would have been only an estimated $0.30/share higher, or $0.84/share. So, best case and all else being equal, that's an estimated 29% higher than the year earlier period and doesn't come close to substantiating a P/E of 225.Looking at if from another angle, even if we annualize the recent Q2 revenue ($81*4=$324 million) and assume 40% net margins (~$130 million net income), with 36 million shares outstanding that is still only $3.60/share of EPS. With a generous P/E of 30x that equates to a stock price of ~$108, some 34% lower than the current price. And those are some generous assumptions given the growth rate demonstrated by the company over the first 6 months of this year as compared to last.Meantime, the company is not operating in a vacuum, there is plenty of competition in the property management software space:Other than IBM, most of these companies are private and many of them claim to be a, or ""the"", market leader.Note on the Q2 conference call, there were no analysts calling in to ask questions. Yahoo Finance shows no consensus quarterly or annual estimates for revenue or earnings. That said, the revenue and earnings growth demonstrated in the Q2 EPS report and 6-month YTD comparisons mentioned earlier come nowhere near the current valuation of AppFolio.On the positive side, the company has a solid balance sheet and a nice recurring revenue stream from what is essentially a software-as-a-service (""SaaS"") business model.Another risk for those considering shorting the stock is that the market rally in tech stocks continues unabashed. Also note that Seeking Alpha reports that there is currently a 9.15% short position in the stock. Those shorts may have to cover if the stock continues higher, which would squeeze it higher still.AppFolio has a SaaS business ripe for continuing innovation and revenue growth. Currently, it is suffering from some one-time growing pains - like building a new headquarters in pricey Santa Barbara. It also took a charge and related to a possible settlement regarding an FTC investigation. Hopefully, that too will be a one-off not to be repeated. However, even if we back out those one-time expenses and add them directly to Q2 net income, the shares would still be massively overvalued.Going forward, it would appear that the company's demonstrated growth in revenue and clients simply doesn't justify the supremely high valuation. More concerning is the fact that customers in its real estate Property Management Segment grew only 9.3% yoy. Its Legal Segment clients grew only 6.3% yoy. That kind of growth doesn't validate a P/E of 225. While AppFolio's software development team is working on some excellent new functionality for its apps, functionality that will save time and money for its customers even in a post COVID-19 world, the company needs to demonstrate an ability to grow much faster and more profitably before being rewarded with such a lofty valuation.Bottom line: This stock could easily drop 30% in a market correction."
4065992,24594,2017-04-28T09:08:45-04:00,"AppFolio software targets SMB customers in the property management and legal verticals - with more industries likely to come.The growth runway seems reasonably large, the company already is driving some leverage, and sales are increasingly nicely.Valuation is a concern, at 6x+ the midpoint of 2017 guidance, however.Relative to other cloud growth stories, APPF looks attractive. But then again, the space as a whole looks stretched.","Valuation aside, the story at AppFolio (NASDAQ:APPF) looks very interesting. AppFolio began by building a ""ground-up"" cloud software package for property managers. AppFolio Property Manager ('APM') launched in 2008. In 2012, the company acquired MyCase and entered the legal market for both solo practitioners and small firms.There's a clear logic to the growth case here. APM and MyCase are targeting legacy, largely desktop-based, applications that often don't work well with one another. And AppFolio is consistently expanding its offerings on what it calls ""Value+"" services - in property management, features like electronic payments and tenant screening services. So there's a three-legged stool in terms of growth opportunities:The concern, unsurprisingly, is valuation. At $26+, APPF trades at just over 6x the midpoint of 2017 revenue guidance and over 100x trailing Adjusted EBITDA. And there are a few concerns as to whether the AppFolio model is quite as sticky - and quite as valuable - as those of larger SaaS plays with similar, or higher, multiples.Overall, however, there's enough to make APPF a very intriguing play for growth investors. The stock remains somewhat underfollowed - and on a peer basis, at least, there's room for more upside. More broadly, as we've seen in the SaaS space, if the story holds, the stock usually does as well. And AppFolio's story seems like it should hold.The OpportunityThe story at AppFolio is a smaller version of that at high-flier Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV). While Veeva focused on the life science vertical (and major players), AppFolio is targeting smaller customers, primarily in property management. (The legal business remains below 10% of total revenue, per the 10-K, and based on customer growth and other data points, was probably in the $9 million range in 2016.) But the broad outlines of the strategy are roughly similar: focus on a single vertical to limit upfront sales and marketing expense (and improve revenue growth); provide a cloud-based platform that outperforms legacy desktop-based systems; and use the core platform as the ""tip of the spear"", then add other functionalities and products to generate incremental revenue.So far, the strategy appears to be working reasonably well. Revenue has increased from under $13 million in 2012 to $105.6 million last year, with guidance implying ~30% growth in 2017. Revenue growth figures are outpacing customer increases, implying greater ARPU (without a specific breakdown of PM/legal revenue, exact calculations aren't available). Similarly, units under management increased 25% in 2016 against a 22% increase in customer count, implying some success in getting larger customers after the reverse occurred in 2015. And Value+ revenue growth (50% in 2016 and 69% in 2015) is outpacing core revenue (36% and 43%), further evidence of greater per-customer spending and success in getting add-on sales.The numbers so far have been solid, save for a modest deceleration in the back half of 2015 that led to some concern. And that's led APPF to better than double off post-IPO lows in late February 2016:Source: finviz.comThere's good reason to think AppFolio can keep its growth going. The company estimated a combined total addressable market of at least $7 billion in its S-1: $5 billion in property management (20-3,000 units) and $2 billion in legal (firms under 20 employees). Unlike Veeva, which faced TAM concerns relative to its core CRM offering, AppFolio seems to have a reasonably long runway, given that 2017 guidance implies sub-2% market share. (That's plenty of room even if AppFolio's estimates are on the high side.)Competition is tough but not impossible to manage. Privately held Buildium raised $65 million last year, and some reviews call it superior to AppFolio. Data on Buildium is limited, but it does appear its customer count, while higher than that of AppFolio (12.5K vs. 10K), is growing at a slower rate. Buildium's ""About Us"" page says it hit the 10K mark in 2014, implying low double-digit annual customer growth the last two years against 22% and 40% for AppFolio. Yardi, RealPage, and other smaller firms also compete in the space - and smaller customers, in particular, can develop DIY solutions off programs like QuickBooks and even Google Docs.In legal, the landscape is relatively similar. There are a number of options, including Thomson Reuters' (NYSE:TRI) Firm Central and LexisNexis's (a unit of RELX PLC (NYSE:RELX)) PC Law. But MyCase seems very well-reviewed (see here and here) and at the least a viable competitor.AppFolio doesn't seem to have the path to dominance that Veeva had in CRM, for instance, or that other SaaS high-flyers like Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) or (to a lesser extent) Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA) have in their fields. But neither PM nor legal necessarily is a ""winner take most"" space, and there's enough to go around for at least a couple of winners (albeit not everyone). There's enough at the moment both anecdotally and fundamentally at the moment to project that AppFolio will be able to take its share.The ConcernsCompetition and valuation aside, there are a few concerns related to APPF's growth profile. A core criticism of the valuation - particularly on a relative basis to SaaS high-flyers - is that AppFolio may not necessarily drive the same type of 'sticky' recurring revenue as other cloud players. Subscriptions generally last one month to one year, and a chunk of Value+ revenue comes from relatively one-off sales (web design, onboarding fees, and screening services among them).Similarly, APPF doesn't have the same gross margins as most SaaS providers: AppFolio's gross margin was 58%+ in 2016, even on a non-GAAP basis against ~67% at VEEV and 70-80%+ elsewhere in the space (SPLK is near 90%, for instance). That in turn likely puts a ceiling on EBITDA margins below cloud-based peers (or at least the highest-valued ones) and should, in theory anyway, argue for a lower multiple.The primary concern relative to revenue probably lies beyond property management. Revenue per customer in the legal vertical is substantially lower: legal customers were 45% of the 2016 total but, as noted, generated less than 10% of revenue. It's one thing to have the option of moving into new verticals - but the question is whether there are adjacent (or at least somewhat close) industries where the opportunity is as attractive as it is in property management. Legal lifetime values would seem to be much lower, given apparently far lesser ARPU, and it seems unlikely that acquisition costs are that much lower, particularly given competition from major firms like TRI and LexisNexis with existing legal customer bases for other products.The sum of these concerns is an argument that an investor can't simply match AppFolio's revenue growth rate to other peers and assign a similar revenue multiple. AppFolio's long-term opportunity might not be as valuable as traditional SaaS players, given lower gross margins, more competitors, and concerns about verticals beyond project management. There's probably some truth to that - but I don't know if there's enough truth to break the bull case just yet.ValuationA 6x+ forward revenue multiple actually is in line with median figures in the SaaS space at the moment, and how an investor feels about that fact likely informs a great deal of his or her sentiment toward APPF. From a long-term fundamental standpoint, it is tough to get terribly excited about AppFolio's valuation. But it's worth pointing out that some of the gross margin weakness comes from scale problems - the figure did expand 300 bps year over year and should continue to increase as revenue grows - and that AppFolio already is driving some operating leverage.Impressively, the 41% growth last year came on the back of just an 11% increase in sales and marketing expenditures (on a GAAP basis). G&A did spike, but much of that increase (60%+) came from higher stock-based compensation after the 2015 IPO. Headcount year over year increased just 9.2%.While there are some concerns about margins and growth longer term, the core SaaS operating leverage is starting to show here. And there's a case that if AppFolio continues on its current path, earnings can support the share price relatively quickly. Assuming $400 million in 2022 revenue (an admittedly aggressive 23.8% CAGR from the midpoint of 2017 guidance), 60% GM (a possibly conservative 200 bps+ increase), 10% inflation in S&M and G&A, and 15% in R&D, 2022 EBIT would reach $113 million and net income at a 38% tax rate would be about $70 million. That's a bit over $2 per share and could support a valuation in the $55-60 range (given that the company still should have a decent-sized growth runway ahead of it), putting current fair value at about $39 (discounted 8%).That's probably an aggressive model - but it's not exactly implying perfection, at least on the margin front. Sales and marketing spend already has slowed a bit, and G&A should have plenty of leverage. Obviously, a deceleration in revenue destroys this model - but that's pretty much the case for every growth stock ever. The point is that if AppFolio can continue to drive market share gains in property management, in particular, the valuation isn't nearly as obscene as 6x revenue and 100x+ EV/EBITDA implies at the moment.And as far as growth stories go in this market, out-year valuation seems relatively reasonable. As more investors and analysts follow the story - there wasn't even a questioner on AppFolio's Q4 conference call - that valuation may look more attractive and drive upside. Earnings next month will give better color on 2017 projections and could be a positive catalyst for APPF stock. But from a near- to mid-term standpoint, it sure looks like the stock should rise as long as AppFolio keeps executing. And that's usually all growth stock investors can ask for.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

The stock is priced for significant growth, but the company is backed by a proven leadership team, standout culture, and financials that are improving with scale.Appfolio headquarters in Santa Barbara, CA. Image Source: GlassdoorMany investors are on a quest to find the next multibagger – an investment that can gain several times its original value. To identify such stocks, an investor must employ a methodology based on quantifiable performance indicators.We have regrouped 10 key performance indicators identified by gurus, from Peter Lynch (One Up on Wall Street) to David and Tom Gardner (The Motley Fool Investment Guide), that can help investors identify potential multibaggers among small caps.After reviewing hundreds of companies, we are thrilled by how Appfolio has performed in our scorecard.Let’s review.Image source: Appfolio WebsiteCriteria: Companies that have $500 million or less in annual sales still have a lot of room to grow and are more likely to deliver multibagger performance over the next few years.Results: With $165M revenue TTM, Appfolio passes the test of being still small enough of a business to have our attention.Source: Appfolio Q2 Form 10-Q. Chart by authorCriteria: Focusing on companies with at least 7% profit enables us to identify in a quantifiable way a company that is conducting a healthy business.Result: With 11%, Appfolio is once again successful in that regard, thanks to its own niche and highly reviewed products.Criteria: Growth is an obvious KPI in the quest to finding a multibagger. Peter Lynch himself recommends 20 to 25% as a screener to identify the best performers.Results: Sales Growth = 32%. Earnings Growth = 167%. Appfolio easily passes the test as a fast grower.Criteria: Tom Gardner often says that insider holdings is an attractive attribute in a stock. It’s a strong indicator that the founders and employees believe in their own company.Results: % Held by insiders = 8%. Once again Appfolio is successful in that regard, well above most blue chip companies that have already delivered their story.Criteria: We want to find companies that are still “undiscovered.” Low Institutional ownership is a good start. Average daily dollar volume under $25 million is another great way to identify an “under the radar” stock.Results: Average Daily dollar Volume = $12 million. % Held by Institutions = 62%. Another win for Appfolio.Criteria: Positive Free Cash Flow is a fundamental KPI to know that management can grow the business. It signals a savvy management team and a strong business.Results: +$33M, good to go.Criteria: The single most important factor in a company's success is the team that's leading the company. A simple look at the CEO reviews on Glassdoor can give us confidence that the company’s future is in good hands.Result: Jason Randall is one of the Top CEOs of 2018 according to Glassdoor with a 100% approval rate.Image Source: GlassdoorCriteria: Another way to identify companies that are more likely to be under the radar are those followed by fewer analysts. With fewer people covering the stock, the success story is more likely to be undiscovered.Results: Only 3 analysts currently referenced on Yahoo Finance. Appfolio is a hidden gem.Criteria: With so many valuation approaches, we have chosen the one that has it all. The Price to Earnings Growth ratio (PEG). Below 1, the company is potentially still undervalued, even with a high PE ratio.Results: With a Forward PE of 70 and a Q2 FY18 earnings growth of 167%, Appfolio’s PEG comes naturally below 1.Criteria: Winning businesses with winning stocks tend to keep winning over time. Rather than a sign of overvaluation, David Gardner likes to see stocks that have momentum with them to find best-in-class opportunities.Results: Almost up 90% so far in 2018. The stock is clearly on an upward trajectory and is stating being noticed.Here is a quick summary at how Appfolio did in our Small Cap Scorecard to identify potentially undiscovered growth stories that could turn into multibaggers:Source: Financials from Form 10-Q and Yahoo Finance. Chart by author.We have yet to identify another company that can achieve 100% in our Small Cap Scorecard.Some other companies that are very high on our Score Card:The Trade Desk (TTD) has an Overall Score at 90%, coming short on the average daily volume criteria (above $100M). That makes The Trade Desk a growth story that is slightly less under-the-radar compared to a company like Appfolio. Given that The Trade desk just had a 150% run in the last 52 weeks, numbers speak for themselves.Paycom Sofware (PAYC) has an Overall Score at 80%, coming short on the average daily volume (above $100M) and the PEG (1.2). Paycom Software just had almost a 100% run in the last 12 months.Of course, a company reaching a high score should not be blindly invested in. Investors should always be mindful of single stock exposure and keep a balanced, diversified portfolio exposed to many different markets, sizes, sectors and industries.These growth stories can take years to fully materialized and should be considered only by investors willing to stay invested until the full story unfolds over several years.As a caveat, Peter Lynch himself is excluding financial institutions from his growth story research. Most likely because many of them would achieve a high score on the above criteria without necessarily delivering multibagger performance.Do you find the score card compelling? Have you identified companies that would score as high as Appfolio on such a scorecard? Let us know in the comments below."

APPF also offers optional, but often mission-critical, Value+ services, such as APPF's professionally designed websites and electronic payment services, which are seamlessly built into its core solutions.Business management softwareBusiness management software, which initially served to differentiate competitors, is now critical to any business's survival and success in an increasingly connected and online world.The ability of SMBs to capitalize on the power of software to interact with their clients, vendors and other industry participants, and to mine the data and insights gleaned from these relationships, is integral to their ability to compete more effectively in commerce today, not only with other SMBs but also with larger enterprises. SMBs need an intuitive, reliable and fully integrated software solution that brings superior technology and services to their specific industry workflows and meets their key operational requirements.Intellectual propertyAs of March 31, 2015, APPF had eight issued U.S. patents that directly relate to APPF's technology that expire between 2026 and 2031, and APPF had three pending patent applications in the United States and two pending patent applications internationally.

4138430,104119,2018-01-18T13:15:31-05:00,"AppFolio has a couple of SaaS programs that have gleaned gleaming reviews from customers and programmers alike.
        Market sentiment surrounding its products are is already built into its price.
        I have questions regarding its high executive compensation, capital structure, and a current P/E that is over five times the industry's average.
        With a forward P/E of 79.29, the growth assumption built into its price is 236%--a growth forecast that, in my opinion, leaves investors with too little upside.","AppFolio (APPF), a SaaS software provider that went public in June 2015, is a company offering two software programs: one focused on property management (Property Manager) and the other geared towards law practice management (MyCase, acquired in 2012). Its applications appear to be well respected amongst coders; in 2016, the SIINA CODiE Awards placed APPF's software as finalist for ""Best Real Estate or Construction Management Solution"" as well finalist for ""Best Legal Intelligence Solution,"" for Property Manager and MyCase, respectively.Customers seem to have favorable opinions of the programs, giving the software, by and large, top reviews. For Property Manager:MyCase has also received largely positive reviews:It seems that AppFolio has honed in on two markets that it understands well, and has achieved a decent amount of respect for its products in those markets.In spite of the fact that net income margin is in the low single digits ($5.85M net income vs. $133.92M revenue, or 4.4%), earnings are at least increasing in tandem with its sales--to a correlation of 0.835 (source). The company is - slowly - turning its sales growth into profitability growth.That's what I love to see.So, the company makes products that the market seems to have embraced. Sales are growing nicely, along with net income (although net income margin remains stubbornly low). Those factors suggest that investors have some reason to be optimistic about the shares. I think, however, that it may be a little premature to buy shares of APPF at its current valuation.Let's not forget that, no matter how amazing APPF's products are, the positive sentiment regarding its products is already built into its price. This public information is not news to the market. Consider the behavioral finance research into attribution bias:Source: Advances in Behavioral Finance, edited by Richard H. Thaler, pg. 42.Here's what, in my opinion, this research means for us. When we read positive information about a company, like the positive reviews above, we need to be careful. If we were already bullish on APPF, that positively-reinforcing ""news"" will asymmetrically increase our bullishness, while any negative information is discounted away to have less of an influence on our beliefs--even if it is as salient as the bullish news.So even though it's not news to the market that APPF has well-regarded software - nor is it news that its earnings are increasing - we can still be tempted by a compelling narrative. Yet investing, in my opinion, shouldn't be about nice narratives. It should be about paying a good price for a company's future earnings. So let's get into why, at the moment, shares of APPF may be overvalued.At a current P/E of 266.56 and a forward P/E of 79.29, APPF is valued at over five times the industry's average P/E (51.67). That suggests to me that there is too much optimism built into APPF's price. Based on the above numbers, the market is assuming a 236% increase in earnings over the next year. Although earnings growth has indeed been very impressive for APPF - in particular, APPF's quarterly growth has been about 18%, which is an annualized rate 193%! - the current forecast, in my opinion, remains too optimistic still. We should note that, while APPF's net income is correlated with revenue growth (0.835), so is its COGS (0.992) and its SG&A (0.921)--and those correlations are even stronger (source). That means that, as APPF increases its sales, it is increasing its COGS and SG&A in tandem. That leads me to question whether it needs that increase in SG&A to increase that marginal dollar of sales.Next, let's take a quick look at APPF's balance sheet.Source: YCharts. Quarterly numbers up to 09-2017.APPF's goodwill - the amount spent over and above the net value of the tangible assets of an acquisition - is high at 5.1% of its total assets. Other intangibles - the non-physical assets it owns - is worse yet, making up about 14.7% of total assets. Source: Authors's work from numbers reported by YCharts.Together, goodwill and intangibles make up nearly 20% of the company’s capital structure. With the risk of goodwill write downs, this is something investors need to be aware of as a risk to shareholder value.By and large, I don't like it when company boards decide to offer retiring CEOs large incentive-based bonuses, simply because I don't think this is the best way to create value for shareholders.Now, consider the compensation agreement for former CEO Brian Donahoo, who worked for the company for less than a decade (and retired early):Source: Company filing, author's emphasisI was similarly troubled to learn that APPF paid CFO Ida Kane $2.265M in total compensation in 2016--a year in which net income was in the red:Source: Salary.com, company's 10-kExcessive executive compensation alone is not a reason to avoid a company, but I think investors would do well to ask themselves whether this is a shareholder friendly business or not. In theory, I like the idea of boards trying to use compensation contracts to align executives' actions with company success. In this case, however, $2.265 million in compensation when the company failed to turn a profit is not an example of a shareholder friendly compensation scheme, in my opinion.I think APPF may have growth potential in the future. Nevertheless, investors would be wise not to overpay for that growth potential. Investors would do well to take a hard look at whether APPF is creating value for shareholders with its current executive compensation scheme. At a P/E of 266.56 and an assumed growth rate of 236%, I believe at its current price investors will be paying too much for future growth. My advice: put it on the watchlist and buy it at 25% lower price."

3293735,25120,2015-07-01T11:02:16-04:00,"AppFolio saw a nice opening day gain after the demand for the IPO has been relatively modest.The company's SaaS solutions are translating into real revenue growth as relative losses are coming down.While growth is high, growth rates are trending down as the company has focused on a small niche in a very competitive marketplace.While I recognize the potential opportunities going forward, I am cautious amidst elevated valuation multiples and many emerging risks.","AppFolio (APPF) jumped 17% on its first day as a publicly traded business last week. The SaaS provider saw modest opening day gains after shares have been priced at the lower end of the preliminary offer range.While I like the strong pace of growth and positive trends in terms of margin improvements, there are plenty of risks in this offering besides the premium valuation alone. Given these concerns, I have a cautious stance on the prospects for the shares. To become enthusiastic I look for confirmation of growth trends and margin improvements going forward before potentially initiating a position.The BusinessAppFolio provides cloud-based software solutions for small to medium sized companies. The company focuses to provide these applications to the property management industry, yet its applications are used by legal firms as well. Further development and refinement of the software create opportunities in other ""verticals"" as well.The company has developed ""AppFolio Property Manager"" for the real estate industry and acquired software company MyCase in order to target the legal industry. In the case of the Property Manager solution, AppFolio's software allows for tracking and posting of tenant vacancies, administration of maintenance and repair works, and accounting, among others.AppFolio recognizes that many small to medium sized businesses cannot afford the development costs of complex tailored IT solutions, which create inefficient workflows. These workflows only divert the attention away from the end customers.The OfferingAppFolio and the underwriting syndicate priced the IPO of the company at $12, the lower end of the $12-$14 preliminary price range. While the pricing has been somewhat disappointing, shares did see a nice opening day gain as they closed just above the $14 mark.The company sold 6.2 million shares in the offering, which has been sufficient to generate gross proceeds of $75 million. With 32.3 million shares outstanding after the IPO, AppFolio is now valued at roughly $455 million.Potential And Recent PerformanceAppFolio deliberately targets small and medium sized businesses as these organizations are generally time and resource constrained while they work with legacy or underperforming software solutions. These businesses often do not have the resources to invest large sums in state-of-the-art software packages while a SaaS software solution requires fewer cash outlays, which are furthermore spread over time.AppFolio itself believes that its solutions for small and medium sized businesses for property management alone represents a $5 billion market opportunity. If it counts larger companies as potential clients as well, this opportunity is even larger.This means that the company has ample growth opportunities as revenues for the year of 2014 came in at $47.7 million, equivalent to just 1% of the addressable target market. These revenues have grown at a rate of nearly 80% over the past year.AppFolio posted an operating loss of $8.6 million in 2014, which marks a modest increase compared to the year before. These losses have been coming down on a relative basis. Operating losses were equivalent to 18.0% of sales, which marks a more than 10 percent point improvement compared to the year before.The start to 2015 has been somewhat mixed. While revenue growth has slowed down to 61%, this is still an appealing growth number as revenues totaled $15.8 million in absolute amounts. It has been disappointing to see an increase in operating losses. AppFolio posted a $3.5 million operating loss, which it attributes to higher general and administrative costs, partially the result of the preparations for the IPO.Ahead of the offering, AppFolio held $12 million in cash while the offering will raise these cash holdings to roughly $75 million. With no debt outstanding, the enterprise valuation comes in around $380 million. This values the business at roughly 8 times the sales being reported for 2014, although these multiples are still falling fast.A Look At The RisksExcept for the current losses and the steep valuation multiples, there are other risks to consider as well. AppFolio is still a relatively small company in a very competitive field. Fortunately, the company focuses on niche segments, as the property management solutions are generating roughly 90% of total revenues. While niche market positions make it easier to compete and to differentiate solutions from mainstream software packages, it does create concentration risks as well.The company offers subscription services, which is liked by the investment community as they do allow for potential predictable revenue streams. The only issue is that most subscriptions are less than a year, thereby not creating real long-term visibility in terms of expected future revenues.Pricing might be another concern. The company claims that it has nearly 6,500 property customers at the end of the first quarter. The company posted revenues of $47.7 million in 2014, of which 90% has been generated by the property management solutions. This implies that its solutions are sold at an average of $6-7k per year per customer, which is quite a substantial amount for a small-size property management firm. The relative high price of the software is an often heard complaint on review websites.ConclusionI am neutral on the prospects for this offering. I appreciate the strong growth rates and the substantial improvements being achieved in terms of margins. These developments as well as a strong balance sheet are key attractions of the business from an investor point of view.The most relevant risks about which I worry are the steep valuation multiples and the relative larger slowdown in the annual pace of revenue growth, although growth rates remain very healthy. The question is how effective these solutions can withstand intensifying competition with many companies investing billions into cloud-based solutions. With the absolute valuations being complicated by the losses, there is little imminent appeal based on relative sales multiples.I am largely neutral after putting all my observations together. I will keep an eye on the business going forward. If sales trends continue to be healthy and margin improvement continues, I do potentially see upside potential. At this stage in the growth cycle, it is hard to judge whether AppFolio's solutions will still be used in a significant way in the medium term. To play it safe, I will stay on the sidelines but add the stock to my investment radar."

As of 2015, AppFolio's largest competitors include Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) and LexisNexis. However, Clio is a new market entrant providing cloud-based solutions for companies throughout several industries, including property management software solutions, according to AppFolio's SEC filing.AppFolio Financials: Quarter Ending March 31, 2015Gross Revenues - $15,848,000 (up from $9,834,000 for Q1 2014 - a 61 percent increase year over year) Net Income - (-$3,618,000) (down slightly from a loss of $1,245,000 in Q1 2014) Total Assets - $36,014,000 Total Liabilities - $27,701,000 Total Stockholders' Equity - (-$54,853,000)Recommendation: Hold OffThe APPF IPO has many risks because of its limited operating history and history of losses (noted above) and the dangers of security breaches.We suggest caution, given lack of profitability and relatively small syndicate; APPF could be overshadowed by the other offerings this week."
3285985,80646,2015-06-26T09:21:14-04:00,Appfolio creates a comprehensive digital solution for law firms and property management companies.The company's core product has done very well in their focused niche with strong sales and market penetration.Long-term investors are banking the potential for Appfolio to succeed at selling to other industries.,"OverviewAppfolio (NASDAQ:APPF) is preparing to make its initial public offering and raise between $70 and $80 million in net proceeds. The company focuses on selling a wide-range of digital-based solutions for a few niche industries. The company has built a strong brand amongst small business as their core target market. IPO proceeds may be able to enable the company to expand their horizons and market potential. The company's IPO pricing represents an aggressive valuation, but investors could flock for exciting future prospects.Value PropositionAppfolio's value proposition is the completeness of their solution. The company has chosen to develop a very comprehensive system for a few niche industries that manage a large amount of documentation and workflows. The solution targets law firms and property management companies and provides a large range of functionality and services. Within the core industries the solution has been well received and quickly growing. The future challenge for Appfolio is to continue to penetrate their niches as well as expand their technologies to new markets.Source: Appfolio S-1FinancesAppfolio has posted strong revenue growth trends. The company has averaged over 90% annual growth over the past two years, and based on first quarter 2015 results is on track to post similar results this year. In order to fuel this growth the company has had to invest heavily in sales and marketing. As a result, the company has continually posted an operating loss. Long-term profitability will depend on the company to reach a critical mass and recognize economies of scale.Source: Appfolio S-1Appfolio's current balance sheet shows about $12 million in cash, which is about the annualized operating loss for 2015. The company needs additional capital to continue to fund growth. IPO proceeds are earmarked to help boost the company's cash and working capital positions.ValuationAppfolio's current IPO price would result in a $430 million market valuation. At that valuation, Appfolio would trade at a 9.1x price-to-sales multiple. Most competitors and comparable peers trade at much lower multiples. The peer group is also mostly profitable, and they boast a broader range of clients. The valuation is aggressive, but some investors may justify the price based on potential. A comprehensive solution can become very popular across a wide-range of industries. Source: Google FinanceRisksAppfolio's biggest risk is the narrow markets in which they currently operate. The limited size of the market threatens top-end growth. Future success depends upon the company's ability to venture into new industries. Appfolio has not proven it can be successful in a broad portfolio of industries. The challenges and costs associated with standing up operating outside of their core market may be substantial.SummaryAppfolio has a great product, but a very narrow market and customer base. In order to succeed, Appfolio has to be able to expand their focus to new industries. However, the company's ability to expand is unproven and comes with a large amount of risk. The current valuation leaves very little upside, but investors might flock to the potential upside. Those who decide to invest should closely watch early trading activity."
4274613,35181,2019-07-12T00:17:57-04:00,AppFolio is a SaaS provider that focuses primarily on real estate.The company has strong YoY revenue growth of 33% and intends to have similar growth during the coming year.I believe that future growth potential is limited and that an investment in AppFolio is risky.I have assigned a neutral rating to AppFolio.,"AppFolio, Inc. (APPF) is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provider that focuses primarily on real estate with a minor interest in legal products. AppFolio has some positive factors going for it, including strong revenue growth of 33% YoY and recent acquisitions that will enhance their suite of products. But in my opinion, the company is heading in a dubious direction as there is strong competition, limited Total Addressable Market (NYSE:TAM) and the stock price is overvalued relative to other SaaS stocks. While AppFolio stock price may appreciate in the current SaaS bull market, I would be careful about long-term performance as the real estate software market is saturated with competition. For these reasons, I have assigned AppFolio a neutral rating.Founded in 2006, AppFolio offers software for the real estate market called AppFolio Property Manager (NASDAQ:APM), designed to meet the operational and business requirements of property management companies. Four portfolio types are offered: residential, commercial, student housing and community associations.(Source: AppFolio)APM generally caters to small business but has recently been making a move towards larger businesses with the release of AppFolio Property Manager Plus (APM Plus), AppFolio Investment Management (NYSEMKT:AIM) and the acquisition of Dynasty Marketplace, Inc., a company that provides AI for the real estate market.APM is an extension of AppFolio's core product and is designed for larger businesses with more complex needs.(Source: AppFolio)AIM is a product designed for investors providing a single solution that will more efficiently manage their portfolio of investments. In the words of AppFolio management: “We believe this innovation will transform customers' businesses, improve processes and streamline investors' experiences.”In early 2019, AppFolio acquired Dynasty, a company that gives firms the tools to run their business via natural language. The AI software is designed to communicate with prospective tenants, schedule viewings and forward on the most promising applicants to the property management company.(Source: Dynasty)AppFolio has indicated that the Dynasty team and technology, combined with AppFolio’s internal resources, technology, and data, will serve as the company’s foundation for future artificial-intelligence, or AI, software and services for the real estate market.As I explained in a recent article on Paylocity (PCTY), high-growth companies generally don't measure up based on traditional value metrics. In fact, they often confound analysts, with the result being a lost investment opportunity. In place of traditional value factors, I generally focus on other measures, such as revenue growth, free cash flow margin, and the software company ""Rule of 40.""AppFolio had an excellent year with trailing-twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 33%. The company's 5-year annual growth rate of 48% is also extremely good.(Source: Portfolio123)AppFolio’s free cash flow margin TTM has been positive since the spring of 2017 and is currently sitting at a very healthy 14.8% of revenues.(Source: Portfolio123)AppFolio has excellent control of SG&A expenses which have been steadily declining and are now about 45% of revenues. Most mature software companies have 50-60% SG&A.(Source: Portfolio123)Note however that the SG&A is starting to rise in the most recent two quarters. Investors should be aware that AppFolio is ramping up faster than revenue growth. In the quarter ending March 31, 2019:Remember that revenues grew 33% yet SG&A increased well over 50%. According to company management, the increase was primarily due to an increase in the average headcount to support growth and investments made in advance of expected revenue generation.This is my first beef. SaaS companies normally grow SG&A expenses in tandem with revenues, but rarely do I see expenses growing faster than revenues. I am going to give AppFolio a break on this since they have pretty good SG&A margin and have just acquired Dynasty. However, investors should keep an eye on the expenses for future quarters. I know I will!One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the ""Rule of 40."" It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as the figure is useful in a later part of my analysis.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In AppFolio’s case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 33% + 14% = 47%Since the calculation comes out at 47%, I conclude that AppFolio is financially healthy.Revenue growth plus FCF margin is sometimes referred to as the ""Efficiency Score."" It has been determined that Efficiency Score has a greater than 70 percent correlation to a public SaaS company's revenue multiple, which is the valuation divided by revenue.In order to demonstrate this, I have plotted the EV/Sales multiple versus the Efficiency Score in MS Excel for 48 software stocks from my digital transformation stock list. A linear trendline is plotted through the scatter plot that represents the best-fit valuation multiple for a given Efficiency Score.(Source: Portfolio123 /MS Excel)As can be seen from the above graph, AppFolio sits slightly above the best-fit line through the data points.The rest of this analysis is somewhat controversial. For me, at least, it seems logical to assume higher valuation for higher-growth companies, and I use the best-fit line to gauge a company's valuation relative to the rest of the stocks in the custom universe. This is a relative valuation, not absolute as one would attempt to get using a DCF calculation.Based on the above chart, I conclude that AppFolio's stock price is modestly overvalued relative to the rest of the digital transformation stocks in my custom universe. On this parameter alone, I would not rule out investment in AppFolio, especially with YoY revenue growth of 33%, but it is one factor to consider.AppFolio recently agreed to pay $4.5 million to resolve class action claims that the rental property company was not clearly identifying the source of information it provides on consumers’ credit reports, thus violating federal law. Note that insurance covered all but $1.1 million of the settlement.It appears to me that AppFolio got off light. The suit asserts that AppFolio’s standard practice is to use only partial matching in preparing consumer reports. The partial matching leads to reports which include information about people who are not subjects of the report. You can read more about this case here.The fact that AppFolio settled the suit without admission of guilt, of course, means that there is likely some truth behind the allegations in the suit. Either that or the company decided that the least costly way forward was to settle instead of fighting the case. Either way, the company appears to be guilty in the eyes of public opinion.To make matters worse, AppFolio also received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requesting information relating to compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). While the class action suit has been settled, the FTC investigation is still open.To be fair, AppFolio is not the only company caught with their pants down. RealPage (RP) also settled charges that the company violated the FCRA. RealPage was accused of failing to take reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of tenant screening information and settled with the FTC by paying $3 million.This leads me to my next beef. The Dynasty solution, while impressive, is going to make tenant screening more obscure as it will be performed by AI with little insight into the decision-making process and may use alternative data as opposed to the more straightforward credit reports. Use of Dynasty technology could potentially lead to more violations of the law.Remember every dog gets one bite! AppFolio has already been caught once. If it happens again, it is quite possible that property managers may leave the fold as they are at risk of getting dragged into lawsuits and the FTC may be less tolerant in the future.The company direction is where I really take issue with. The TAM for property management software is limited. According to one report, the global property management software market will only be $1.839 billion by 2026. Keep in mind that the report is about the global market, not the US market where AppFolio operates. Given that AppFolio has revenues of $200 million and there is a great deal of competition in the SMB market, I expect that AppFolio will be hard-pressed to keep its sales momentum going without targeting new markets.According to Appfolio’s annual report, its long-term growth strategy depends upon:Entering a new vertical does not appear to be practical. They already made one move by entering the legal market but that has turned out to be rather so-so with mediocre growth and only generating 10% of total revenues. This move may be more of a distraction than a net benefit to the company.International expansion will not likely occur for a couple of reasons. First of all, the laws and regulations in Europe are much more sophisticated than in the United States. Given the company’s legal difficulties at home, it may not be wise for the company to try to expand across the ocean. They could look to acquire a European company but AppFolio has limited funds and appears to be more interested in buying back stock. AppFolio bought back $21.6 million of Class A shares in 2018 with money that could have been used for an acquisition. And the Board of Directors has authorized a $100.0 million Share Repurchase Program. What’s with that? Mature companies with no growth prospects buy their own shares. This is money that could be used for European expansion.Eliminating new verticals and international expansion, I have to conclude that AppFolio’s growth strategy is based solely on increasing sales to larger customers. And this is supported by recent initiatives including AIM, APM Plus and the new AI initiative. These are features that RealPage and probably a few other competitors already have. AI is only as good as the data behind the application. RealPage is significantly larger than AppFolio and has acquired much more data. RealPage worked on their AI tenant screening application for two years before it was released. I anticipate that AppFolio has a long and difficult road ahead of it. Expect expenses to grow into the foreseeable future. Revenue growth is less certain.AppFolio is a SaaS provider that focuses primarily on real estate (90%) with a minor interest in legal markets (10%). The company has strong YoY revenue growth of 33% and intends to have similar growth during the coming year.However, I view this to be a risky investment because there is limited growth potential in the SMB software real estate market, a great deal of competition and the only place growth can occur is if the company successfully moves into the large property management market. There is also a great deal of competition, including RealPage, which already has an AI-based tenant screening application based on a two-year development cycle and a much larger dataset than AppFolio has.In addition, AppFolio is under the watchful eye of the FTC for tenant screening violations. Adding AI into the mix may be the second dog bite that results in further legal action and potential loss of reputation and business.Growing into new verticals or internationally does not appear practical at the moment. Cash is limited after the recent Dynasty purchase and recent stock buyback.Expect expenses to grow this year with the likely result that there will be negative earnings surprises as having occurred for the last three quarters.(Source: Portfolio123)As a result of the above difficulties listed above, I reluctantly give AppFolio a neutral rating. I am reluctant because the historical growth rate is strong, I just feel that investing in the company is too risky.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"

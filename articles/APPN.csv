4369154,105503,2020-08-17T09:40:11-04:00,Appian sells software aimed at enabling enterprises to automate business processes faster.Cloud revenues are up but operating margins are on the negative side and there have been four equity offerings in as many years.The company has product strength and strong partnerships to channel offerings to customers.There is a competition but automation is a fast-growing enterprise software segment globally.The stock should appreciate in the medium term but it is better to wait for a reasonable price to step in.,"Appian Corp. (APPN) is widely known for its low-code automation platform which makes the development of IT applications easier and faster by enterprises. In addition, revenues are strong compared to the same quarter last year.However, this is a loss-making company.Still, due to the fact that product offerings are cloud-based signifies higher prospects for Appian's solutions to be more widely adopted as per the trend seen in the aftermaths of COVID-19.Also, the fact that the stock has beaten the technology sector ETFs points to some strong positives.Figure 1: Stock price evolution compared with sector ETFsTherefore, there is a need for a detailed analysis of the finances, product as well as competitive challenges.I start by dissecting the revenue and profitability figures.As per the software companies I have covered so far, my key take has been that the cloud has become a facilitator in enabling thousands to work from home.Even in places where COVID-19-led social distancing measures have been lifted, this preference for the cloud model goes unabated and this has translated into additional revenues for Appian.In this case, revenues have grown from $65.3 million in Q2-2019 to $70.8 million taking into consideration the adjustments for the $4 million of on-prem revenues that were originally expected to be closed in Q2-2020, but, instead, was done earlier as part of Q1-2020 deals.However, customers opting for cloud deployments sometimes do so at the expense of on-prem (on-premises) based subscriptions depending on how fast the company is able to add more customers.Hence, the challenge for Appian's sales team is to be able to expand cloud-based revenues faster in order to cover shortfalls in on-prem subscription revenues especially in an environment characterized by social distancing.Figure 2: Revenue per segment with accounting adjustments for on-prem and total done in red for comparison's sake.Source: Seeking AlphaNow, on-prem revenues have decreased by $2 million while cloud revenues increased by only $1.2 million in Q2-2020.This means that the transition from on-prem to cloud revenue model is taking more time to materialize for customers utilizing Appian's software.This could be explained by the sales team not being able to move due to travel restrictions. In fact, according to the executives, customer engagements both for cloud and on-premises were performed remotely.Moreover, there is also mention in the Q2-2020 earnings transcript that there has been some cost reduction due to less travelling and this is evident in the SG&A costs being down compared to the first quarter.Figure 3: Appian's quarterly income statementSource: Seeking AlphaOn the other hand, SG&A (Sales General and Administrative) costs are 57% (40.5 divided by 70.8) of total revenues, which is very high as it is resulting in the company incurring an operating loss.Moreover, the gross profit margins of 68% consist of two components, subscriptions (89%), and professional services (36%).Figure 4: Gross profits from subscriptions and professional services.Source: Seeking AlphaThe high gross profit margin in subscription shows that Appian is basically milking the cow out its automation products.However, a large part of these high gross profits is being lost in the professional services segment. Going forward, even the 36% level achieved in Q2-2020 will not be sustained and, according to the executives, will ""return to the upper 20s"".The reason provided was an expected increase in the amount of services performed by subcontractors as opposed to internal staff as well as the additional intake of university graduates in the third quarter.Furthermore, with the company aggressively hiring software engineers and sales professionals, I believe that the management is giving priority to growth and, therefore, I do not see operating margins coming on the positive side during this year.The last quarter revenues also benefited from $600K of foreign exchange gains compared to about $100K losses in Q2-2019. With the appreciation of both the euro and GBP compared to the USD holding on in the international FOREX markets, the third quarter should also benefit from favorable currency tailwinds.As to cash position, it stood at $256 million as of June 30 compared to $159.8 million as of December 2019. Most of the cash increase came from an equity offering of $107.9 million done in June 2020.Before that, the company raised $236.9 million through three equity offerings done between 2017 and 2019.Additionally, total deferred revenues stand at $92.1 million with the majority of customers invoiced on an annual basis and the company has $20.0 million in the revolver.The company used a cash amount of $3.1 million (instead of generating cash) for operations during Q2-2020 and had a total debt of $52.7 million as of June 30.Consequently, taking into consideration existing cash, borrowing facilities, the deferred revenues to be collected, and cash use of the order of $7 million (a rough estimate I made from H1-2020) for the second half, there should be enough liquidity to last for the next 12 months.Therefore, despite those operating losses and share dilution, Appian cannot be discarded as a potential investment especially when taking into consideration adequate cash position and those highly profitable subscription revenues.Hence, I take a deeper look at the products and the way these are channeled to customers.First, according to some customers on Trustradius (a technology review platform), the main purpose of Appian's applications is in the area of approval and processing like, for example, employees making requests for laptops aimed at supporting them in their work.Then, using Appian's workflow automation, a supervisor with no coding knowledge can rapidly create an approval process.Interestingly, the offerings by the automation company have earned it a top spot in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for low-code applications.Figure 5: A leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Low-code applications.Source: primobonacina.comHence, customers are able to create solutions for their respective business cases within hours instead of days.In addition, the company has been able to leverage a partnership model for rapidly boosting sales.It is also worth mentioning that the R&D team has rapidly developed a data-driven solution to help employers to better track employees and facilities with the aim of doing contact tracing (knowing who has been in contact with an infected person) with the aim of limiting the risk of infection in the workplace.The solution has already been brought to market, but I see significant potential because currently this tiresome procedure is mostly done with pencil and paper or in Excel, and with second wave concerns, a systematic approach using an application makes more sense.More importantly, the solution is based on a survey Appian commissioned at the beginning of August and showed that automation of response through a data-driven approach can reduce infection risks and save lives.Figure 6: COVID-19 HR survey, returning the work-force to the workplace.Source: Appian.comI now check the competition as well as any risks as a result of the economic downturn following the coronavirus.Appian is often compared with Pega Systems (PEGA) on technology reviews websites with around the same scores being allocated to the two companies in terms of product strength.Figure 7: Comparing with the competitionSource: Trustradius.comAmong the customer reviews I went through, I noted that the approval workflow offerings by both of these companies were very popular. However, I was not able to find any one product area where one company was better than the other.Investors will also note that Appian was positioned as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant as of July 2019 compared with Pega System's visionary status. Some will argue that this is history and I agree with them but at least, this provides some indication of strength.Also, automation of business processes is more of an emerging market in contrast to the more matured ones where there is cut-throat competition and consequently there is more than sufficient space for two companies to grow.Also, Appian has extensive international operations namely in the EMEA (European Middle East and Africa) region. The company obtained 37% of total revenues from foreign countries and its low-code automation platform was selected in Europe in response to the need for quickly deploying a mobile application for COVID-19 contact tracing.A comforting fact in this context is that apart from the UK where Appian derives 13% of revenues, there were no individual foreign countries from which more than 10% of total revenue was attributable.Furthermore, the fact that the federal government in the US is using the automation's solution provides some cushion against risks of economic downturn. In terms of revenues, government agencies represented 19.0% of the total.Additionally, since most companies that use Appian's solutions aim to simplify their complex procedures spanning across several departments means that these are large corporate clients and in a better economic position to weather the COVID-19 storm.On an even more positive note, the industries using the company's automation products are life sciences where the bookings almost tripled in the third quarter compared to Q2-2019.This strong presence in the life sciences industry coupled with the return-to the-workplace application the company developed can result in significant revenue synergies and the valuations will certainly be impacted accordingly.Revenue growth, when compared to Pega, is on the higher side and should further increase above the 20% level as of Q1-2021 as Appian continues to benefit not only from COVID-19 but also the wider corporate drive towards automation.To achieve this aim, the company is aggressively building up competencies in software development and marketing.Figure 8: Comparing Pega Systems and AppianSource: Seeking AlphaAlso, compared to Pega systems, Appian's higher valuations in terms of trailing EV/Sales ratio are justified taking into consideration prospects for higher revenue growth.Moreover, with a debt to equity of only 17.63, Appian can contract more debt to power growth.Consequently, my target price for Appian is $58-62 given its history of four successive earnings beat.In this respect, with the guidance of ($0.18)-($0.16) for Q3-2020 compared to the ($0.15)-($0.14) achieved for Q3-2019 and with the company benefiting from COVID-19 momentum, I envisage an earning beat in November but not by much, taking into consideration that there will be additional expenses (contractor and hiring) I mentioned earlier.Now, for traders vying for a point of entry, since the variation of the stock price is closely related to the earnings date which is next scheduled in November, the stock should fall back to the $44-45 range.Figure 9: Appian stock price, EBITDA, and revenue.Data by YChartsAppian also makes for a suitable investment but is not a stock for risk-averse investors keen on debt or those currently looking for profitability as the management's agenda is clearly to prioritize growth.For others, looking to invest in high-growth stocks, it is also important to be on the watch-out for the SG&A expenses relative to total revenues (currently at 57%).In this context, growth always comes at a cost but this should be reasonable and sustainable.Finally, in addition to being in Gartner's Magic Quadrant, the company has also been recognized as a vendor alongside big names like Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) as being capable of delivering end-to-end automation by combining complementary technologies to augment business processes.This puts Appian in another league altogether.Last but not least, the timely development of data-driven solutions designed to facilitate return to the workplace could prove instrumental in balancing the need to attend work with, doing so safely."
4346273,103480,2020-05-12T08:30:00-04:00,"Shares of Appian pulled back ~7% after reporting Q1 earnings.Even after this decline, Appian is still up nearly 30% year-to-date despite a -10% decline in the S&P 500.The full extent of the coronavirus impact on this company are still unknown, with Appian yanking its full-year guidance. Appian notes that sales cycles have lengthened.Appian expects revenue growth to swing negative in Q2.Shares look fully valued at ~11x forward revenues.","Appian's (APPN) popularity in the market may be in the process of unraveling. The software development platform company, which advertises its capacity to help non-technical business users automate business processes in a ""low-code"" manner, has just reported Q1 results. Despite a strong beat to Q1 expectations (most of which was due to non-recurring deals, which we'll discuss in detail later in this article), Appian's uncertain stance on the impacts of the coronavirus and its decision to eliminate its full-year outlook have cast some weakness on the stock.Prior to Q1, Appian was vastly outperforming the broader market like many of the remote-work stocks, despite no clear tailwind to sales as we had in companies like Twilio (TWLO), Bandwidth (BAND), and Zoom (ZM). And even after the ~7% drop this quarter, Appian is still up nearly 30% year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500 by a non-trivial forty points.Data by YChartsIn my view, it's unclear why Appian continues to outperform and trade at a double-digit valuation multiple. There are a number of bearish headwinds against the stock outside of the immediate impact of the coronavirus, including:Steer clear here, especially with how expensive Appian's current valuation is given its year-to-date outperformance.At present share prices just under $50, Appian trades at a market cap of $3.35 billion. After netting out the $149.2 million of cash on Appian's balance sheet, its resulting enterprise value is $3.20 billion. Prior to Appian pulling its full-year forecast, it had guided to revenues of $296-$298 million for the year, representing 14% y/y growth. Its forecast for Q2, which it did provide, calls for revenue growth to be negative in Q2. Now, despite weak conditions across many tech companies, very few SaaS companies (especially in the high growth space like Appian) have gone so far as to suggest revenues would decline.Figure 1. Appian guidance updateSource: Appian Q1 earnings releaseWall Street estimates per Yahoo Finance, meanwhile, have a wide range of revenue expectations for the current year, ranging from $255.6 million (-2% y/y) to $298.0 million (+14% y/y, the high end of Appian's original outlook), reflecting the lack of clarity around this company's growth trajectory. Consensus is calling for $285.6 million, or +10% y/y. Against this revenue view, Appian trades at a steep 11.2x EV/FY20 revenues. Meanwhile, many other SaaS companies that are expected to grow in the low teens and even low 20s have sunk to mid single-digit multiples:Data by YChartsAppian is worth far from a double-digit multiple, especially with the uncertainty surrounding a potential revenue decline. Steer clear here.Let's now discuss Appian's first-quarter results - take a look at the earnings summary below:Figure 2. Appian Q1 resultsSource: Appian Q1 earnings releaseAt face value, Appian's revenue of $78.9 million, or +31% y/y, appeared to hit it out of the park - blasting past Wall Street's expectations of $70.3 million, or +17% y/y. But several deal timing occurrences in Q1 helped to artificially boost this quarter's revenue.Per CEO Matt Calkin's own description of this circumstance on the Q1 earnings call:As such, Appian recorded about $5.8 million of non-recurring revenue this quarter, $4 million of which would have rolled over into Q2. If we normalize the timing of these deals, Q1 revenue would have been $5.8 million lower and grown at +21% y/y, while Q2 guidance would be $4 million higher at $64.0-$65.0 million - but this still represents a -4% y/y revenue decline in Q2 versus 2Q19 revenue of $66.9 million.Unlike many other software companies, Appian made no comments on the monthly linearity of its sales performance (most SaaS companies have reported weak March sales, as expected, but also that business more or less resumed as normal beginning in mid-April). Calkins did note, however, that ""we’re inevitably going to face some disruption in some predictable ways and some unpredictable. It’s likely that some sales cycles will lengthen and also likely that services revenue will be lower than we previously expected.""This makes sense because Appian's app-development platforms represent discretionary IT spending that takes less precedence versus making offices remote-work ready. With most companies cutting capex and IT budgets this year to conserve cash, Appian's new deal cycles are likely to suffer.Expansion rates within Appian's existing customer base, meanwhile, remained at a net upsell, but sank eleven points year-over-year to 115% versus a net retention rate of 126% in the first quarter of last year:Figure 3. Appian net retention trendsSource: Appian Q1 earnings releaseWe note as well that Appian's services revenue remained at a high 36% of overall revenues, dragging down overall gross margins to 69% on a GAAP basis (versus most other software companies in the mid-70s).The good news is that Appian notched some wins on the profitability front this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, Appian's primarily profit measure, saw losses halve from -$7.3 million in the year-ago quarter (a -12.1% margin) to just -$3.6 million this quarter - an approximately eight-point improvement to -4.6% margins. However, a large portion of this margin upside was likely due to the fact that Appian pulled in an unnatural ~$6 million revenue into the quarter, as the company still notched substantial increases in sales/marketing and general and administrative expenses. Unlike many other struggling technology companies, Appian has not yet unveiled any plans to reduce operating costs or headcount this year.With only ~$150 million of cash left on its balance sheet, Appian could run tight on liquidity. Q1 free cash flow was relatively modest at just -$4 million (but again, this might have been helped by the quarter's revenue pull-ins). Appian has yet to become cash-flow profitable, and last year, its FCF burn totaled -$41.3 million (though the majority of that burn is due to a headquarters build-out). None of this suggests that Appian will need to raise capital in a hurry, but its cushion is significantly lower than other companies that are trading at double-digit revenue multiples that investors have deemed ""safe"".Many red flags are emerging for Appian, especially as it expects to enter a rare revenue decline in Q2 with little indication of when and how the business will normalize. Appian's premium valuation multiple is invalidated by its souring growth rates, its high percentage of services revenue pulling down overall gross margins, and the heavy competition in its space. A stock with such weak fundamentals trading at ~11x forward revenues has a lot of air to be let out of its balloon."
4336798,35181,2020-04-09T05:20:49-04:00,High level of SG&A expenses and poor free cash flow margin suggest that either Appian is not using its own tools or not using them effectively.High level of professional services indicates that the product is not low friction. Appian may not be able to take advantage of the massive work-from-home movement as a result.Appian has significant competition from big players such as ServiceNow and Salesforce.,"Based on the title ""Never Trust A Skinny Chef"", readers might think this article is about a restaurant chain. Far from it. Today, I am covering Appian Corporation (NASDAQ:APPN), a company at the heart of the digital transformation movement. Appian provides tools for business process management (BPM) meant to revolutionize BPM by introducing digital process automation, dynamic case management, and a low-code development environment.(Source: Appian)The article title is quoting a famous saying that implies that you should avoid restaurants where the chef doesn't sample or eat his (or her) own food preparations.(Source: DrSue.ca)With this allusion in mind, I am going to suggest that Appian either isn't using its own BPM tools or isn't using them to advantage. Appian should be its own poster boy, but it isn't, and therefore you might not want to trust its product.A company using next-generation BPM should demonstrate good operating margins. But Appian appears to be burning an excess amount of cash and also has a poor free cash flow margin. The skinny chef is akin to Appian's bloated financials, and the company is missing the best marketing opportunity: demonstrating its BPM product on its own financials.Also, if Appian were using its own software internally, then the development of such software could be capitalized, something that some S/W companies are doing to improve their margins and free cash flow. I am not seeing any reference to capitalized software in the annual report, so I assume that it is not being capitalized.Another issue is that Appian was late to the party with regards to accounting standards, specifically with implementing FASB Topic 606. The standard was in effect at the beginning of 2018 for public business entities. Appian IPO'ed in May of 2017, but did not implement ASC 606 until January 2019. One would think that a leader in BPM would be on the ball with regards to accounting regulations, but what do I know? I study and write about more than 100 stocks, and to my recollection, Appian is the only company that is still referencing ASC 605 in its literature and making excuses for why the company's reported revenue is less than it would be without the accounting change.(Source: Appian latest earnings call presentation)I indicated that Appian is burning too much cash, and here is why I believe that this is the case. I assess a company's cash burn by examining the SG&A expense relative to sales.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)Appian has an SG&A expense margin of 83%, which means that more than 4/5ths of revenue intake is being spent on SG&A expenses (plus R&D). This figure is likely to go up during the remainder of the year if revenue growth is subdued as a result of the impending global recession which will put further pressure on margins.One of the most disappointing factors with Appian's financials is the free cash flow margin. This company is quite underwater with a -16% free cash flow margin. Appian has never achieved free cash flow as a public company.(Source: Portfolio123)Moving on to Appian's stock valuation, I use a custom technique to estimate the relative valuation of the stock price versus the remaining stocks that I track. The technique consists of creating a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth. The plot below illustrates Appian's stock valuation relative to the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red on the scatter plot and represents a typical valuation based on next year's sales growth. As can be seen from the scatter plot, Appian is situated almost on top of the best-fit line suggesting that the company is fairly valued on a relative basis.But remember my observation regarding Appian's bloated financials? If I substitute next year's earnings estimates for forward sales, then my assessment changes.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The results shown on this second scatter plot indicate that Appian is overvalued based on next year's earnings estimates. This re-assessment is a direct result of the high SG&A expense margin.My last observation for today has to do with Appian's high level of professional services, services that are described in the annual report:At present, professional services account for approximately 39% of total revenue and aren't decreasing significantly over time.(Source: Appian)While it is interesting that the company can extract such a high level of non-recurring revenue from its customers, the situation results in some issues.The first issue is that Appian's prime selling point is ""low code development"". It appears that low code development doesn't translate to easy implementation, hence the high level of services performed to integrate the Appian BPM application into the customer platform.Secondly, the high level of professional services implies that this is a high friction application. There are significant upfront costs that may deter customers from onboarding. This is particularly relevant during the work-from-home movement during the pandemic. I expect that Appian will not benefit as much as other digital transformation companies simply due to the high friction onboarding.Let us not forget that Appian operates in a market with minimal barriers and significant competition:Appian provides next-generation tools for the BPM market, tools that are designed to vastly improve business processes. But I am not seeing the results reflected in the company's operating performance. SG&A expenses are high and the free cash flow margin is poor. And to boot, the company was very slow in the implementation of ASC 606. Apart from having a skinny chef, it appears that Appian's product is not low friction, meaning that customers have to spend a lot upfront with presumably a lot of time involved in the onboarding process. In the absence of competition, this may be acceptable and maybe even desirable if it can get away with it. But Appian is competing with big players such as ServiceNow (NOW) and Salesforce.com (CRM) and the high cost of professional services will likely be a drag on forward revenue growth. During the Covid-19 panic, I believe that Appian will not benefit as much as other cloud companies due to the necessary professional services. For these reasons, I am giving Appian a neutral rating."
4326648,103480,2020-02-24T12:55:12-05:00,"For the second time in a row, shares of Appian dropped in double-digit percentages after reporting earnings.Appian missed on Q4 revenues, which showed a sharp deceleration in subscription revenue growth. 2020 guidance also looked weak.Appian is also still unable to shake off high loss margins.With weak fundamentals, it's difficult to justify Appian's ~10.5x forward revenue multiple.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha’s service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.One company that I've consistently called out as having a bloated valuation is Appian (APPN), the self-labeled ""low-code"" development platform that helps companies automate business processes without too much technical knowledge. Appian came in really hot immediately after its IPO in 2017 at just $12 per share, with many investors pointing to the company's red-hot growth rates as evidence that it was transforming the workplace. In more recent quarters, however, Appian's luster has begun to dull, and its clout against much larger platform competitors such as Salesforce (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW) are in question.Appian just closed out its fiscal 2019 with a disastrous fourth-quarter earnings report that missed on revenues. As most investors in software companies know, missing on revenues is the one cardinal sin that a high-growth tech company cannot do - companies usually set their guidance bars low enough that they can produce a comfortable ""beat and raise""; and indeed, I'd say ~95% of all software companies meet their guidance expectations. As a results, share of Appian dropped more than 20% after reporting, and that's also after dropping ~30% post-Q3 earnings:Data by YChartsIn my view, these harsh post-earnings reactions represent the air finally going out of the Appian bubble. Investors have come to realize that what was initially a cool product premise actually has far weaker fundamentals. Can we justify a 10.5x forward revenue multiple for a company that is decelerating so sharply in subscription revenue growth, relies so heavily on unprofitable services revenue for more than a third of its revenues (whereas other software companies typically have a 10-15% mix), and is in competition versus other Pass providers that are much larger and more reputable?The bottom line on Appian: don't be tempted to buy this stock on the dip. Appian is just now self-correcting to what its valuation should be, and even that correction hasn't gone far enough.Let's cut to the heart of the problem: Appian's subscription revenue growth has continually weakened over successive quarters this year. Take a look at the trends below:Figure 1. Appian subscription revenue trendsSource: Appian Q4 earnings deckAppian's subscription revenues in Q4 clocked in at just $43.1 million, barely any higher on a nominal basis than Q3 (even though Q4 is typically a much larger quarter for most software companies, due to the tendency of corporate IT departments to exhaust their budgets in the tail end of the calendar year). On a year-over-year basis, Appian's growth slid to 28%, ten points weaker than 38% in the prior quarter. It's also the first tie that Appian's subscription revenue growth slid below 30%.Now, Appian did face a tough comp from 4Q19, which CFO Mark Lynch noted on the Q4 earnings call:Still, even a seven-point deceleration to 31% y/y growth in Q4 would have been quite terrible. Note as well that on an overall revenue basis, Appian's revenue of $68.6 million (on the new ASC 606 basis) missed against Wall Street's expectations of $69.8 million.Figure 2. Appian revenue mixSource: Appian Q4 earnings releaseAppian's subscription revenue disappointment is especially relevant to this company because of its heavy reliance on professional services revenue. In Q4, services revenue made up 39% of its overall revenues. While that's marginally better than 42% in the year-ago quarter, it's also still a much higher mix than the typical software company. Because services revenue comes in at a much lower margin than subscription revenues, this disparity in mix means that Appian's overall gross margins continue to be significantly lower than most of its peers in the software sector. Part of the bullish thesis on Appian relied on the company making up that gap.The good news is that services margins have been rising somewhat, but that's offset by some decay in subscription margins. A slightly more favorable subscription mix has allowed Appian to grow gross margins to 68% - but still, that's ten to fifteen points weaker than most software companies.Figure 3. Appian gross margin trendsSource: Appian Q4 earnings deckIf Appian's gross margins have this large of a deficit to software peers, can we really justify a 10.5x forward revenue multiple for its stock (essentially in-line or at a premium to other software companies growing in the mid to high 20% range) - when theoretically, its revenue stream is 10 to 15% less valuable than that of competing software companies?The airline sector faces a similar disparity. American Airlines (AAL) has long had an operating margin deficit to Delta (DAL), long considered the industry leader in profitability - but as a result, American Airlines' stock has far underperformed Delta for years and trades at a discount to Delta. Appian is the American Airlines in this scenario, even though its revenue multiple doesn't (yet) sit at too deep of a discount to peers.Making matters even worse is the fact that Appian disappointed so sharply in its 2020 guidance. Take a look at the company's guidance update below:Figure 5. Appian guidance updateSource: Appian Q4 earnings deckThe company is projecting total revenues of just $296-$298 million, which represents meager 14% y/y growth over 2019's ASC 606 revenue of $260.4 million. Wall Street, meanwhile, had expected consensus revenue of $309.3 million for the year, or five points stronger than the guidance at +19% y/y.Also darkening the story is Appian's adjusted EBITDA guidance of -$34 to -$32 million, representing a -11.1% adjusted EBITDA margin at the midpoint of both the EBITDA and revenue ranges. While that's about 350bps better than FY19's margin of -14.6%, we'd expect a much stronger profitability improvement given the expectation of steep deceleration. In a market environment where investors are sensitive to tech companies' bottom lines, the twin issues of continued losses and deceleration aren't too appealing.Steer clear of Appian. With the marketing teetering from all-time highs, investors are positioning themselves into high-quality and proven stocks - and Appian, with its towering percentage of services revenue and decelerating subscription growth, and with no certain path to profitability, is anything but. The correction still has plenty of room to sting deeper."
4347312,104952,2020-05-13T17:24:28-04:00,"We continue to question the long-term potential of Appian's low-code business.Despite the strong Q1 that saw revenue grew by 31%, we do not think it is still in a turnaround phase just yet.Growth has slowed down to merely ~15% in recent times, though the company consistently spends +40% of revenue on marketing and sales and is yet to turn cash-flow positive.As of Q1, cloud software business only makes up ~50% of Appian's total revenue.","Despite the solid Q1 beat, we are still unsure about Appian's (APPN) long-term potential. We covered the stock in November last year when we shared our skepticism on the long-term validity of its low-code application development business. Since then, the stock has been quite volatile and been up by ~15% to-date. Though the performance should have dismissed our concern, we still do not think that the main issue is out of the woods yet. When we dive deeper into the fundamentals and the business activities, we see an inherent weakness that encourages us to keep staying on the sideline.While our skepticism on the low-code application market may be an overstatement, we believe that the market does not seem to offer attractive upside opportunities. The numbers tell us that Appian is a less interesting growth story than those of the other cloud players of similar sizes.(APPN. source: tikr.com)Appian has never had a history of a strong double-digit growth phase despite consistently spending over 45% of revenue on sales and marketing. Last year, revenue grew by ~15% to $260 million. Relative to the scale of the business, it is not an impressive growth. Likewise, the +60% gross margin is relatively weak for any SaaS player. In Appian's case, it is the result of the business's over-reliance on professional services revenue. With a gross margin of 28% - 35%, the professional services segment is not a recurring business and not as profitable as the cloud and on-premise segments.(source: Q1 earnings slide)The cloud and on-premise business combined, on the other hand, has an average gross margin of 90%. Last year alone, however, professional services revenue made up almost 42% of Appian's business and used to be higher than that of cloud subscription. In Q1, cloud subscription finally caught up as it reached $28.4 million of revenue. However, as discussed, the growth also remains lackluster. The profitability, scale, and growth rate at which Appian operates indicate that the offering has not been disruptive.Given that we have seen some issues with longer sales cycles in the business, including in Q1, we hypothesize that Appian's low-code platform may not be mission-critical enough. In our most recent post about ServiceNow (NOW), we discussed how its workflow automation offering has a strong product-market fit in the enterprise ITSM, which gives it a mission-critical element that transfers to other areas such as HR and CSM. Eventually, one of these expansions also led to the acquisition of SkyGiraffe in 2017, which built a similar low-code solution to Appian. In that sense, we can judge the order of mission criticality of each offering by the order at which ServiceNow expanded its business. Penetrating the enterprise market through ITSM sounds very strategic in the context of digital transformation, given that a streamlined IT process is a prerequisite for a company-wide digital transformation.Based on the Q1 report, there will be a new CRO (Chief Revenue Officer) joining Appian. This will potentially add a better structure to the sales organization and improve go-to-market execution beyond Q1. The company was also able to land new clients with COVID-19 related use cases as Q1 revenue grew by 31%. Despite our thesis on the lack of mission criticality, consistently strong sales execution will potentially prove us wrong in the long run.Based on our understanding of the overall growth narrative, we remain uncertain about Appian's ability to sustain the 30% growth it had in Q1. At the current 12x P/S, Appian appears overpriced given the unimpressive fundamentals and questionable moat. In particular, profitability and cash flow generation have been weak. Over the last five years, Appian has never turned cash flow positives.(APPN. source: seeking alpha)Despite all the investments it has made over the years, including spending +40% of revenue on marketing, it also still arguably has a minor presence in the low-code app development market. The share price has been up 6% since the Q1 earnings call. However, its share price has historically been choppy. It is probably a good buy at any price below 9x P/S, which is the level it used to trade for the last two years."

Digital transformation refers to the application of digital technology across the organization to drive innovation and creativity in specific domains so that organizations can expand market reach and improve customer experiences. Reston, Virginia-based Appian (NASDAQ: APPN) is among the leading players in this space.Appian has had an interesting journey so far. It was set up in 1999 by Marc Wilson, Matthew Calkins, Michael Beckley, and Robert Kramer after a series of pivots. I had spoken with Matthew Calkins a few years ago when he talked about the company's growth. Appian was initially set up to provide Personalization services. It developed Bayesian algorithms to match people with items that corresponded to their profile as demonstrated by their prior selections or interests. But the idea was ahead of its time. In 1999, the idea didn't succeed, and Appian made its first pivot into portals and managed to get the Army as its client. As an Army service provider, Appian ended up building a portal for a central place for communications.The portal business didn't last long either. Soon, the founders realized that they needed to make another pivot out of that market because their portal was a feature and not a complete product. They then decided to shift into business process management (BPM). BPM essentially involves defining a flow chart that automates the progress of work through the organization by rule checks and human decisions towards an outcome. Over the next few years, and through a few recessionary cycles, the company continued to improve its BPM interface and offering. Today, Appian has become a global leader in intelligent business process management systems (iBPMS), dynamic case management (DCM), digital process automation (DPA), and low-code development. It continues to focus on simplifying ideas into powerful business applications that can deliver significant value.Appian has built a fully unified platform that unites the capabilities required to deliver impactful, end-to-end processes across an organization. Users can build more powerful apps and increase productivity using its Robotic Process Automation capabilities. Its BPM-focused solution allows users to design, execute, manage, and optimize complex processes while allowing to automate collaborative work and exception handling. With AI capabilities integrated from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT), it helps make applications work harder and smarter.Appian was bootstrapped till 2008 when it finally raised its first round of funding. Overall, it raised $47.5 million in venture funding from investors including New Enterprise Associates and Novak Biddle Venture Partners. In 2017, the company went public and raised $75 million at a valuation of $880 million.Appian recently reported its fourth-quarter results that saw revenues grow 17% to $70.5 million, missing the analyst estimates of $70.8 million. Net loss was $10.8 million or $0.16 per share compared with a loss of $13.9 million or $0.22 per share reported a year ago. On an adjusted basis, net loss was $0.11 per share, marginally better than the Street's forecast of a loss of $0.12 per share.By segment, total subscriptions revenue, which includes sales of its SaaS subscriptions, on-premises term license subscriptions and maintenance and support, increased 26% to $44.3 million. Professional services revenue grew from $25.1 million a year ago to $26.2 million for the quarter.Appian ended the year with revenues growing 17% to $266.3 million. Net loss for the year remained flat at $49.4 million for the year. On an adjusted basis, it reported a net loss per share of $0.50 compared with a net loss of $0.54 per share for the previous year.Appian expects to end the current quarter with revenues of $71-$71.5 million with an adjusted loss of $0.20-$0.18 per share. It forecast revenues of $296-$298 million for the year with a loss of $0.58-$0.55 a share. The market was looking for revenues of $70.8 million for the quarter with a loss of $0.12 per share and revenues of $308.9 million for the year with a loss of $0.36 per share.Appian is looking to expand its market reach by growing its tie-ups with tech and consulting leaders. Earlier this year, it announced an expanded technology partnership with Google Cloud to focus on intelligent document processing. As part of the agreement, Appian will be able to improve its AI offering by giving its customers out-of-the-box AI capabilities that have been pre-configured for Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) use cases. It will package Document AI services from Google Cloud into its solution that will allow businesses to accelerate data processing and draw better insights from data.It also entered into a strategic alliance with Deloitte Consulting to help modernize systems for its clients within commercial, federal, civilian, defense, state, and local government agencies. Deloitte recently established an Appian Solutions Incubator to build application accelerators, templates, and reusable solutions. The tie-up will help accelerate the modernization process to provide clients with a fast and efficient way to revamp business processes and improve workflow. Deloitte and Appian are already collaborating with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to upgrade their legacy systems and implement new technologies by leveraging robotic process automation (RPA).Earlier this year, Appian also made its first ever acquisition by adding the Spanish firm Novayre Solutions SL to its portfolio. Novayre is the developer of the Jidoka RPA platform that is currently the highest-rated RPA software on Gartner Peer Insights. Through the acquisition, Appian will become a one-stop shop for Automation for workflow, AI, and RPA. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.Appian has also been developing a PaaS offering. It was named by Gartner as a leading platform in low-code automation. Its easy-to-use solution allows developers to create apps using a point and click, drag and drop approach. Developers can develop and launch apps immediately. Appian also operates an AppMarket to allow apps to be offered for free or for a premium. It does not disclose usage statistics about these apps.Appian's stock is currently trading at $31.36 with a market cap of $2.1 billion. It had touched a 52-week high of $63.77 in August last year. The recent turbulence has hurt the stock significantly and it hit a 52-week low of $29.07 earlier last month.Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4313890,103480,2019-12-23T13:51:03-05:00,"Shares of Appian have peeled back more than 30% after releasing Q3 results. Unprofitable professional services revenue drove most of the company's growth.Looking ahead to Q4, Appian expects its core subscription revenues to see sharply decelerating revenue growth to the mid-20s.Due to a failure to raise subscription revenues to overtake professional services, Appian has long maintained a gross margin deficit to peers.The lack of scalability in Appian's business model, as evidenced by its lower margins, will weigh on its stock heading into 2020 in a profit-centric market.","Appian (APPN) has long been a company whose success in the market has been mystifying. The company has long touted that its low-code development platform had the potential to transform the business environment by allowing laymen of limited technical background to automate common business processes. While that may be true, Appian is up against a litany of competition in the platform/process automation space (including from heavyweights like Salesforce.com (CRM)), and its recent trend of decelerating revenue growth shows that Appian's bright star in the market may be waning.Appian was a hot performer in the tech sector earlier this year, its stock having at one point risen over 2x where it started the year. Make no mistake, Appian is still a big winner this year with 57% gains year-to-date, but investors' enthusiasm for the stock has noticeably waned after its third-quarter earnings release at the tail end of November.Data by YChartsAppian has long been distinguished from its mid-cap software peers, and not in a good way: the majority of its revenues come from professional services. This means that as much as Appian claims to be a software company, half of its business also lies in consulting - making it no less plain than technology ISVs like Cognizant or Infosys, and not deserving of a true tech valuation multiple.Part of the appeal of a software company lies in the ability of a software platform to be self-service. Salesforce, for example, can spend billions of R&D dollars to create a single Sales Cloud, and millions of customers can more or less use the same platform (with perhaps some modification for certain industries, consistent with Salesforce's vertical go-to-market push). For Appian, this is more murky - the high degree of professional services revenue in its mix suggests that Appian can seldom be independently implemented without help from Appian. It also suggests that Appian has had trouble engaging technology consultants and ISVs to take on the less-profitable work of helping clients with implementations and custom projects.Though Appian has long portrayed itself as a pure software company, its professional services element (which has pro forma gross margins in the 30s, versus software margins in the 90s) has held down its gross margins and raised questions of the scalability of Appian's business model. This may not have mattered earlier in the year: investors chased growth no matter the cost. But now in the wake of the WeWork fiasco, investors have turned a laser eye to examining tech companies' business models and their path to profitability. For Appian, with heavy service costs weighing on its bottom line, this path to profitability is less clear.Yet the company - in spite of a ~30% correction from peak values notched in August - remains richly valued, as if it were a high-margin, high-growing software stock. At present share prices near $42, Appian trades at a market cap of $2.80 billion; after netting off the company's $165.6 million of cash, its resulting enterprise value is $2.63 billion.For the next fiscal year, Wall Street analysts are expecting consensus revenues of $308.9 million, or +16% y/y growth (per Yahoo Finance). Appian's growth rates have been coming down alarmingly fast, as we'll discuss shortly when we flash Appian's fourth-quarter guidance - and it's growth in the subscription space that is lagging behind, hurting long-term margins. Against this view of revenue, Appian trades at a current valuation multiple of 8.5x EV/FY20 revenues. When we consider the fact that Appian's pro forma gross margin this quarter was only 66% (showing no sequential improvement), which is ten to twenty points worse than software peers which typically have pro forma gross margins in the high seventies to mid eighties, we find this multiple still lofty. There are plenty of software peers in the high 20s/mid-30s growth range that trade at similar or lower multiples, despite having far richer gross margins that don't have a heavy services component weighing it down:Data by YChartsThere's little head room for Appian's stock to rise further as the company grapples with subscription deceleration, stubbornly high services mix, and considerable competition. The risk-reward profile doesn't favor the bull here. Continue to steer clear of this name and invest elsewhere.Previously, Appian might have been able to defend its above-market multiple by touting strong subscription revenue growth. So what if professional services are high - at least the high-margin software subscription revenues are still growing at a rapid clip. This argument, however, may no longer hold as Appian's growth rates slide downward.We saw a hint of this deceleration in Q3. Subscription revenues grew only 38% y/y to $40.4 million, decelerating three points from last quarter's growth rate - and with the exception of a slower Q1, was the first quarter of subscription growth in a year.Figure 1. Appian subscription decelerationSource: Appian Q3 earnings deckThe hardest deceleration, however, will hit in Q4. The biggest reason that Appian shares have been on a downward tumble since November is the fact that its outlook for the fourth quarter is so grim - and by extension, casting a pall over Appian's prospects for 2020. The fourth quarter is always an all-important quarter for software companies because it tends to be the biggest, as IT executives on a December year-end calendar drain the last of their allotted budgets for the year. Unfortunately for Appian, the company has pointed to a steep deceleration to just 24-26% y/y subscription revenue growth in Q4, implying more than ten points of slowdown:Figure 2. Appian guidance updateSource: Appian Q3 earnings deckNow, the company notes that the year-ago Q4 included $1 million of revenue that saw accelerated recognition due to a contract cancellation, and in the absence of this difficult compare, subscription revenue growth would have been 28-30% y/y. Even still, the fact of Appian's deceleration still remains stark. The only uplifting note from Q3 was the fact that Appian's dollar-based net retention rate rose two points to 119%, indicating strong customer engagement within its installed base.Appian's stalling subscription revenue growth, of course, means that its margin deficit to its software peers won't be going away anytime soon. For the second quarter in a row, Appian's pro forma gross margins clung stubbornly to 66%, while gross margins on the professional services side actually fell one quarter to 31% (this chart perfectly illustrates the gap in profitability between the two revenue streams):Figure 3. Appian gross margin trendsSource: Appian Q3 earnings deckWith Appian's subscription revenue growth slated to come down to the mid-20s by next quarter, hinting at a revenue mix rebalancing toward professional services, we might even see overall gross margins fall next quarter and in 2020.The company has also had little luck in closing its gap to profitability. Net losses widened this quarter to -$9.3 million, and the company's forecast of -$0.14 to -$0.15 in pro forma EPS for Q4 sharply disappointed against Wall Street's target of -$0.11.Figure 4. Appian profitability trendsSource: Appian Q3 earnings releaseWith investors elevating software companies that show profit potential over those that show mere growth, Appian is ill-positioned to see a relief rally in 2020 given sinking margins and decelerating growth. Still clinging to a ~8.5x forward revenue multiple despite decaying fundamentals and a ghastly margin deficit to software peers, it's unclear what is still supporting Appian's premium valuation. Don't be tempted to buy the dip on this name."
4286851,103480,2019-08-20T12:10:04-04:00,"Shares of Appian have soared approximately 50% after posting strong Q2 earnings beats in early August.
        Appian's robust rise has vaulted the stock to a ~14x forward revenue valuation multiple, one of the most expensive valuations in the software sector.
        Despite this rich valuation, Appian's revenues are only growing in the low teens.
        Gross margins also continue to lag behind peers, as Appian suffers from a higher-than-average professional services mix in its revenue base.","Most high-flying software stocks have suffered serious pullbacks (and in some cases, a full-on recession) since the macro-driven August selloff has begun. Perennial investor favorites like New Relic (NEWR), Zendesk (ZEN), and Docusign (NASDAQ:DOCU) are all in correction territory, weighed down by sales execution issues and weak global conditions. Some software stocks, however, have vaulted to new all-time highs in spite of the carnage around them - and in this bucket is Appian (APPN), the maker of a ""low-code"" software platform that helps businesses automate processes with minimal technical coding.Appian has quietly been one of the best performers of the sector this year. Year-to-date, Appian has risen about 125%, and the stock has risen about 50% in the last month alone, buoyed by a strong Q2 earnings report:In my view, however, the Appian rally has no legs. I've always been a skeptic on Appian - while PaaS services are growing in popularity and necessity, Appian's rather modest growth rates don't really point to a company that can one day reach a $1 billion revenue scale. And while it's true that Appian delivered strong results on subscription revenues in Q2, I hardly think the company's Q2 performance and guidance increase warrant the massive boost in Appian's share price.A quick check on where Appian is currently trading: at today's share prices around $60, the stock has a market cap of $3.85 billion. After we net out $81.1 million of cash on Appian's balance sheet, we are left with an enterprise value of $3.77 billion. Here's how that stacks up against the company's latest guidance ranges, Figure 1. Appian guidance updateSource: Appian 2Q19 earnings releaseVersus the $261.5 million midpoint of Appian's full-year revenue range, the stock is trading at a wildly expensive multiple of 14.4x EV/FY19 revenues. This puts Appian in the top echelon of enterprise software valuations, alongside names like Atlassian (TEAM) and Coupa (COUP), despite producing just ~15% y/y growth and still being unprofitable. Note as well that Appian's revenue base is of lower quality than many SaaS companies due to the high mix of professional services, which carry virtually no gross margin dollars.Why would we want to pay a double-digit revenue multiple when other SaaS companies that are growing in the ~10-20% y/y growth range are trading for far less? Take, for example, Dropbox (DBX) and Box (BOX), whose growth rates have fallen off to the mid/high teens this year. These stocks trade at a fraction of Appian, despite similar revenue growth rates:We also have to call into question the realism of Appian's full-year guidance. Its range calls for 14-15% y/y growth; however, revenues in the first half of FY19 have grown at only 13% y/y. This implies that revenues would have to accelerate in the back half of FY19, whereas we have only seen a pattern of deceleration in revenues since 2Q18. Of course, we note that 2Q18 benefited from a large $4.4 million public sector win, slightly compressing Appian's first-half growth rates. Still, in order to hit the low end of the company's guidance ($260.5 million), Appian has to hit a 16% y/y growth rate in the second half of the year, which is stronger than the 15% y/y growth rate that Appian notched in Q1 - a quarter unmarred by a large prior-year deal.The bottom line on Appian: the stock is very overpriced for the results it delivers. While its platform has proven popular among large enterprises and public sector clients, there are also many alternatives in the market, including Salesforce (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW) - both companies with far deeper pockets than Appian and entrenched customer bases that can be cross-sold a PaaS solution. Steer clear of this stock.Let's now dive into Appian's second-quarter results:Figure 2. Appian 2Q19 earningsSource: Appian 2Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew a paltry 12% y/y to $66.9 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $63.4 million (+6% y/y) by a comfortable six-point margin. Appian's growth decelerated three points sequentially compared to 15% growth last quarter, but as previously mentioned, 2Q18 benefited from a large $4.4 million federal client onboarding - a perpetual license deal of the type that Appian no longer offers. In addition, investors also cheered a slight sequential acceleration in Appian's subscription revenue growth to 41% y/y, though this only puts the company back in the same growth range it saw toward the back end of FY18:Figure 3. Appian subscription revenue growthSource: Appian 2Q19 earnings deckCEO Matt Calkin credited Appian's reseller partners with many of the new deals that the company signed. Per his remarks on the Q2 earnings call:However, Appian doesn't expect this temporary lift in subscription growth rates to last - its guidance for Q3 calls for just 32-33% y/y growth rates in subscription revenues, which again call into question how realistic the company's full-year guidance is.Despite the strong subscription performance this quarter, Appian's large mix of professional services revenues continues to weigh it down. The good news is that Appian's professional services mix came down to 41% of revenues this quarter, down from 45% last quarter. The bad news is that this is still substantially higher than the ~10-15% professional services mix that is more typical for SaaS companies. In addition, the fact that professional services revenues barely grow means that it will continue to be a headwind for total revenue growth until Appian's subscription revenues become a much larger mix of the total. This large professional services mix has also held down Appian's gross margins in relation to peers. Pro forma gross margins did tick up to 66% this quarter (up two points relative to 2Q18), driven by the more favorable subscription mix - but you can see in the chart below that the huge difference between subscription and services margin is what's driving Appian's pro forma gross margins to be below SaaS peers, which typically see margins in the ~70-80% range. Essentially, not only are we paying a double-digit revenue multiple for Appian's inferior growth, but also its inferior margin profile.Figure 4. Appian margin trendsSource: Appian 2Q19 earnings deckOn the bright side, Appian's operating cash flows improved from a loss of -$23.6 million in the first half of 2018 to a positive $11.9 million this year, representing a 9% OCF margin. However, due to the company's new campus buildout, free cash flow actually sunk to -$15.8 million. Figure 5. Appian cash flowsSource: Appian 2Q19 earnings releaseNote that Appian has a fairly thin cash reserve of $81.1 million on its balance sheet, so if free cash flow trends continue, the company may find itself needing to raise additional capital.Absent its inflated valuation, Appian is a decent company that is producing solid subscription growth in a software sector that is gaining steam. But we can't make investing decisions in a vacuum that ignores Appian's price. A ~14x forward revenue multiple is an egregious valuation to pay for a company that is growing much slower than most similarly-valued peers and is weighed down by a heavy mix of low-margin professional services.Continue to avoid Appian and buy into beaten-down software names that have seen temporary sales weakness, such as New Relic and Zendesk."
4309566,104952,2019-11-27T16:02:47-05:00,"We believe there is an inherent weakness in the company's low-code value proposition in the long run.There will still be a market for Appian, though we feel that its weakened value proposition will result in a very limited upside.We put Appian's long-term P/S at ~7 instead of ~11. Our analysis further puts the company at only 38% upside over 5 years from its current price/share.","We believe that the long-term outlook on Appian (APPN) will seem even more unattractive than its downside outlook for the Q4. The Q3 earnings call saw Appian beating its guidance where overall revenue increased by 26% YoY, driven by the 38% YoY increase in subscription revenue. Aside from the near-term slowdown that reflects the Q4 outlook, we do think that there is a viable market for a solution like Appian today. In the long term, however, we have a bearish view in the company, given an inherent weakness we see in its low-code value proposition as an enterprise platform.In terms of the offering, Appian provides PaaS (Platform as a Service) solutions across generic BPM (Business Process Management) and Case Management use cases. One thing that makes Appian stand out from the other competitors in the space is its low-code enterprise platform. The platform serves as an abstraction layer that ideally simplifies application development across the intended use cases due to minimal coding requirements. Appian generates revenue through both subscription and implementation/professional service fees it charges to clients for onboarding and implementations.As of Q3, we found Appian's traction in several industries and geographic regions to be noticeable. In particular, we saw how revenue from Financial Services clients managed to grow by 48% YoY despite being the largest segment. Surprisingly, the EMEA region appears to be the key growth driver for the outperformance in Q3, despite the overall challenging macro that affected the sales of other cloud software players in the last few months. EMEA region experienced a 60% subscription revenue growth YoY.(source: Appian's Q3 earnings call slide)The $69.4 million revenue in Q3 represents a 26% YoY growth that exceeded the company's guidance. Its Q3 subscription revenue increased by 38% YoY to $40.4 million while professional services revenue increased by 60% YoY to $27.8 million. The 119% net retention also seems strong and is within the expected range of 110% - 120%.Despite the strong momentum that we think will not taper off by too much in Q4, the Q3 numbers have told us a few things about the potential competitiveness of the business going forward. Despite its low-code positioning, for instance, we believe that overall implementations of Appian's solutions still require a lot of hands-on onboarding processes. In Q3, we saw how a staggering 60% YoY growth in Professional Services revenue reflects that. Another thing that can pose as a challenge is Appian's current use cases, where they typically address non-mission critical business areas where the barrier to entry is relatively low. This can eventually affect how the demand side views Appian's positioning relative to other solutions. In Q3, the management's commentary on the current challenges was also in-line with our view:We view this as the root cause of the company's weakening long-term value proposition. Ultimately, all these factors combined will create a huge concern about Appian's ability to maintain its low-code positioning as the demand for enterprise cloud solutions grows and requires a significant increase in complexities across multiple use case scenarios in the future.Amid the soft macro outlook faced by a lot of cloud enterprise players in EMEA, Appian's solid traction in the region has stood out. In particular, Appian's track record in closing complex deals, such as EMEA Financial Services deals, has been relatively strong. With that in mind, Appian's EMEA salesforce and partner network will be a value-add upside in any possible contingency plan such as a takeover. Furthermore, the recent strong adoption in the UK despite Brexit talks may imply that Appian's low-code offering has a recession-proof characteristic to some extent.In a comparable company landscape, we consider Pegasystems, Inc. (PEGA) as a competitor to Appian. Pegasystems trades at TTM P/S of 6.94, which is lower than Appian's ~11.15. In the last year, Pegasystems revenue growth was stagnant and net margin contracted significantly due to the delay in revenue recognition at least until 2020. Though this outlook seems unattractive, the company's involvement in other businesses such as DevOps, CRM, and consulting solutions means it has a more diversified revenue stream than Appian.In the end, both companies are still subject to the same fundamental risk of weakening value proposition, with Appian having the highest long-term exposure to such risk. Consequently, we place Appian's potential long-term P/S at 7, which is at the lower end of the range of Pegasystems and Appian's current P/S. We believe that there will still be a market for a solution like Appian, though we feel that its weakened value proposition going forward will result in a very limited upside. Using the assumption of ~20% forward growth rate and last year's revenue of ~$226.74 million, we believe that Appian's stock should be worth at most $56.16 per share over five years. Ultimately, that would represent only ~38% upside from its current level, representing only ~7% effective YoY growth in price per share."
4369187,103480,2020-08-17T11:16:08-04:00,"Shares of Appian have slid after the company reported Q2 results, despite a beat to Wall Street's expectations.
        Appian's growth has slid to the low teens, and in Q3 that's expected to slow further to the mid single digits.
        The fact that Appian trades at >10x forward revenues, despite similarly-growing comps valued at much lower, is concerning.","Appian (APPN) is a stock that I have long struggled to understand. This platform software company - which specializes in helping businesses adopt a ""low code"" approach to automating business processes - has seen its growth rates unravel this year in the midst of the global pandemic, where few companies are really investing into infrastructure and development and focusing their IT efforts largely on enabling remote work. Yet despite Appian's inability to generate meaningful growth, the stock still clings to its legacy premium multiple. Year to date, Appian has followed other cloud software stocks higher, and is up ~30% on the year despite the fact that A) performance has materially weakened this year, and B) cloud is still a small contributor to Appian's overall revenue base. In my view, there are a lot of negative trends stemming out of Appian's latest results that have not yet worked their way into Appian's share price, which should serve as a wake-up call to anyone still holding onto the stock in the hope of more gains down the road. To me, the most compelling argument against an investment in Appian is a bloated valuation multiple in relation to its growth. At present share prices near $51, Appian trades at a $3.48 billion market cap. And after netting out the $256.1 million of cash on its most recent balance sheet, Appian's enterprise value is $3.22 billion. Versus Wall Street's consensus FY21 revenue estimate of $324.4 million (+13% y/y), Appian trades at a ~10x EV/FY21 revenue multiple. In my view, there are many comps that are similarly growing in the low teens that suggest much steeper downside for Appian. Software stocks like Talend (TLND), Dropbox (DBX), and New Relic (NEWR) all grow at similar mid/low teens rates, and have the low single-digit valuations to match.In short, there's little evidence to suggest support for Appian's current valuation; the pure comps even suggest there could be more than ~50% downside to this name. While I would fall shy of directly shorting this name due to the general enthusiasm for cloud software stocks, note that prices have been crumbling for some of the software sector's top names (Alteryx (AYX) is a good example) and buying puts may be a great strategy to take advantage of downside.It's important to note that Appian's messaging on its growth trajectory has entirely changed. Last year, it was a company that boasted of >30% y/y revenue growth, and spoke of a generational opportunity to help businesses transform their internal processes without any heavy IT development work.Now, however, Appian is citing extreme uncertainty around COVID-19, while its growth rates have faltered:Figure 1. Appian revenue trendsSource: Appian Q2 investor deckWhat's amusing is that to retain the perception of being a growth company, the headlines of all of Appian's earnings press releases focuses on its cloud revenue growth. While it's true that cloud revenues (dark blue bar above) did grow at 30% y/y to $29.6 million in the quarter, it's still a relatively small mix of total revenues, approximately on-par with Appian's contribution from professional services (which, by the way, continues to be a drag on overall gross margins). Appian's overall revenue in Q2, meanwhile, grew at just 2% y/y to $66.8 million and decelerating sharply from Q1's growth rate of 31% y/y. We do caveat here that Appian noted in Q1 that a one-time deal worth roughly $4 million pulled into Q1 from Q2, so if you moved the $4 million between the two quarters, Q1 growth would have been 24% y/y and Q2 would have been 8% y/y - which is still not a favorable story.Nor was everything perfect on the cloud front either. Appian relies on a ""land and expand"" strategy like most other software companies, and unfortunately in Q2 its net revenue retention rates also dropped to a new low at 113% - indicating less success in upselling current customers.Figure 2. Appian revenue retentionSource: Appian Q2 investor deckThat being said, some of the company's qualitative commentary on sales momentum in the quarter did skew positive. Per CEO Matt Calkins' prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:The comment on sales cycle shortening is actually a nice surprise to highlight, as many other enterprise software companies have reported the opposite - which is understandable, as the coronavirus forces companies to delay long-term spending decisions until the macro outlook becomes clearer.In spite of this bullish commentary, however, Appian has still failed to provide a bullish guidance update. Its outlook for Q3 calls for revenue growth to decay even further to 7-8% y/y, with a similar ~1-2 point reduction in cloud growth as well:Figure 3. Appian guidance updateSource: Appian Q2 investor deckOn the profitability front, there's a mixed bag of news to unpack. Due to the fact that Appian's low-margin services business is declining both in dollar terms and as a share of the overall revenue pie, Appian's pro forma gross margins in the quarter bumped up four points to 69%, versus 65% in the year-ago quarter. The bad news is that this is still at a deficit to most SaaS peers in the mid 70s-80s range. While the services mix of revenue is now more manageable at ~38% of Appian's overall revenue this quarter versus closer to a 50/50 split in the past, the fact that services overall still carry only a low mid-30s margin is weighing down the overall total.And while Appian noted it was able to save on operating expenses due to a reduction in T&E (travel and entertainment) spending by its sales teams, Appian's year-to-date cash flows are showing a burning hole of -$7.0 million, versus positive $12.0 million of OCF in the year-ago period. Figure 4. Appian cash flowsSource: Appian Q2 earnings releaseThankfully Appian's ~$256 million of cash balances is enough to absorb this rate of cash burn, but the fact that cash flow profitability is eroding yet again cals into question Appian's premium valuation multiple.Few businesses are investing into overhauling their systems and processes at the moment, and Appian's slowdown in growth to the mid-single digits by next quarter is a reflection of that pinch. It's unclear how Appian is able to hold onto its double-digit revenue valuation multiple when most of its similarly-growing peers trade much more modestly. Avoid this stock."
4342932,21815,2020-05-05T00:21:27-04:00,"The company offers a simple way for companies to digitalize their processes.It has used the pandemic to showcase the speed and ease of building essential processes and it should not face much headwind from the pandemic.Given growth and profitability metrics the shares are not cheap, but selling OTM puts or in installments could offer a way around that.","We liked Appian (APPN), offering low code platform enabling clients to quickly build and host apps back in July 2018 (with the shares up 25%+ since), and we still like it for many of the same reasons.Appian seems one of these essential business software companies that really helps customers to solve otherwise pretty intractable problems, basically offering no-brainer services.In this respect, it's very much like two companies we recently wrote about, Yext (YEXT) and Tufin (TUFN). The particular service that Appian offers is a low code way to design and run applications that offer workflow automation for customers.There are a number of terrific examples of that in the Q4CC and the company has used the pandemic to showcase the speed and comprehensiveness of its solutions.However, the shares are fairly fully valued given that the company is still some time away from profitability (cash is not a problem) and growth is slowing down at least a little, so while we still very much like the company, ideally we would like the shares to come down a little.This can be engineered through purchasing out of the money put options, or otherwise one could buy in batches as we still think the company is a long-term winner.The essence is in the 'low code' part as this brings a triple benefit:The Q4CC is full of examples of the second, where customers were sold on the speed and flexibility of the company's solutions, just for illustrative purposes, describing a sales win of a top-five global elevator company (Q4CC, our emphasis):There are other noteworthy elements in these examples:Partners are increasingly important for the company, leveraging its sales reach. In Q4, doubled the addition of new customers and for the year the increase was 70%. Management doesn't see this plateauing this year but considers it as an ongoing ramp (Q4CC, our emphasis):International is growing considerably faster, as it constituted 32% of total revenue in Q4 versus 27% a year ago. The company also has the opportunity to expand in verticals where it hasn't yet had a considerable position, like energy.A cohort chart would have been instructive illustrating the up-selling that is going on with existing logos, but in any case this is captured in a general sense by its 116% subscription revenue retention rate.Another indication of this is the fact that while the company added 109 new subscription customers in Q4, the revenue per customer hasn't changed (at about $0.5M), and it has been stable for a couple of years despite the company ramping new customers.Management argues that it is able to create ""well in excess of $3M a year"" in value for a substantial customer, indicating the mileage customers can get out of using the platform and the opportunities for up-selling and leveraging their relation with existing customers (Q4CC):And that value proposition is continuously enhanced through R&D and S&M adding new capabilities.The company acquired Novayre, a leading RPA (robotics process automation company) and the developer of the Jidoka platform, the highest-rated RPA software on Gartner Peer Insights.RPA won't be sold on a stand-alone basis but it will be integrated into a single platform (from the PR):Management argues that this confers an advantage because RPA solutions are often sold at a low level of organizations which typically have multiple RPA tools.However, Appian sells its platform high up in the hierarchy, giving this more strategic importance, potentially speeding adoption in what is a market that's still in the early innings. And there are other advantages (Q4CC):As an example of the seamless integration, management discussed a governmental agency, registering, processing and adjudicating veteran benefits, which became a new customer in Q4 (Q4CC):The funny thing in this example is that the RPA platform mentioned in this example (Blue Prism) is a competitor for Novayre, but Appian was offering a number of independent RPA solutions and this relationship might now become a little more problematic.On March 9, the company announced Appian RPA, running on Appian Cloud, so integration went pretty fast. Novayre was the company's first acquisition.Although it keeps offering on-premise licenses as well, the company is increasingly cloud-centric, which management claims is a competitive differentiator, especially with new customers (Q4CC):Appian Cloud operates in 19 regions (5 were added this quarter) and 14 countries and added cloud certifications for healthcare (HITRUST), cyber security (NIST) and, together with Smartronix IL4 (Impact Level 4) for defense agencies.Partly as a result of accounting changes (see below), management is taking cloud subscription growth as the most important metric of company growth.The company adopted ASC 606 in its 2019 10-K which makes comparing results a little difficult as the company had been reporting in ASC 605 until now. Here are the main differences, from the earnings deck:The main difference is the upfront recognition of roughly 80% of the on-prem subscription revenue (with the rest recognized pro rata over the remainder of the contract as support revenue). From the Q4CC:As a result:There are a few minor additional areas of impact but those inclined can look these up in the filings, earnings deck or company website.There wasn't any talk about the impact of the pandemic during the Q4CC as this was held early February, but the company is since offering a free COVID-19 response management application for business and government organizations which can be configured and adopted within two hours. From the linked PR:Organizations do not have to be Appian customers to be able to use this, but one benefit could be that they might be impressed with the speed, ease of use and flexibility, creating goodwill for the company. It has even organized a webinar for the app.Apparently this was a success as the company introduced a follow-up app last week (PR):This app isn't free, it's available for on-premise and cloud customers and from the description and list of features in the PR it looks like something essential for many businesses and organizations, as there is a lot of stuff for them to figure out before they can open while minimizing the risks.And they did not stop there, the company also introduced an app that helps banks automate lending under the CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program, from the PR:A few days after this introduction, there is a version for the UK enabling its banks to manage the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) applications.Then there is Bexley Health Neighbourhood Care GP Federation, which launched the COVID-19 Command and Control Patient and Workforce Tracker app on Appian's platform, enabling patient, staff and facilities tracking.From the PR, we assume Bexley Health developed the app, perhaps with some assistance from Appian, but it is another showcase for how fast thorough solutions for entirely new and critical processes can be developed on the Appian platform.If any, the COVID-19 pandemic has given the company a chance to showcase the abilities of its low-code platform in quickly automate complex processes with minimal fuss for customers.From the earnings deck:Using ASC 606 is actually a little confusing as previous quarter figures are in ASC 605 but one can find ample quarter-by-quarter corrections on the company website and in the earnings deck. Under ASC 605 (the old way of accounting), 2019 was a pretty good year (earnings deck):Some highlights from Q4:From the earnings deck:Since last year, there is an interesting divergence between operational and free cash flow, which is related to the CapEx for new buildings, but this will dramatically reduce this year to just $5M (from $32.4M last year).In any case, the company has plenty of cash left ($159.8M at the end of Q4) to keep it going for years (with the greatly reduced CapEx).Share-based compensation is fairly moderate, as is dilution.No surprise valuation has come down quite a bit, but the shares have been considerably cheaper before. Valuation looks steep considering that growth is really slowing down quite steeply:However, things are not as bad as the above figure suggests:We do not think the company will face significant headwinds from the coronavirus. We are not aware management having guided for any impact, and the acceptance of digital solutions by the corporate world isn't likely to slow down materially.Yes, some potential clients might postpone purchasing solutions like the ones Appian is offering in order to save scarce means, but there are others who might accelerate the process of digitalization of processes as the online economy has gained renewed importance.The company has also been able to showcase some of their solutions of dealing with the impact of the pandemic on a variety of organizations, and the speed and comprehensive nature of these solutions might have impressed a few potential clients and let them cross the line.We don't disagree with many other observers on Seeking Alpha who consider the shares expensive. While it has ample cash to keep on going for years, it may have to as at present it's not close to profitability and is still bleeding significant amounts of cash.Yet the company has a fairly unique platform that enables its customers to quickly digitalize processes and given the high retention rates, these services are highly appreciated by customers.The trend doesn't seem to be in favor of buying right now, involving lower lows and it's a long way down to $30 where there should be trend support. There is of course no guarantee we will ever get back to these levels.So if you, like us, like the stock but don't like the stock price so much, one way to deal with this situation would be to sell out of the money puts."

The declining professional services revenue (which was viewed as bad news by the market) was actually a positive one, in my opinion, and was consistent with the long-term strategy of the company.However, growing professional services revenue as seen in the company's third quarter performance and management's FY19 guidance make me uncomfortable. Through this article, I explain my reasons for discomfort with this segment and my decision to close-out my position on the stock.Appian reported a 3rd quarter subscription revenue of $40.4 million (growth of 38% over Q3 2018) and a total revenue of $69.4 million (growth of 26% over Q3 2018).Source: Q3 presentationWhile I am happy to see strong subscription revenue growth through FY2019, I am disappointed to see the growing professional services revenues. For a company like Appian, professional services is a necessary evil since it provides guidance and expertise to potential customers and aids them with the adoption. As the company grows, professional services revenues should fade away through partnerships with technology consulting firms and service integrators such as Accenture, KPMG, Deloitte, PwC, etc.Such partnerships simplify the sales strategy and would allow the company to distance themselves from the implementation services and let the company focus on their core business - to develop, enhance, and support their growing cloud platform.Let's take a look at Salesforce's (CRM) revenue. Professional services is under 6.5% of the revenue mix during FY2019.Source: Salesforce FY2019 10-KSource: ServiceNow Form 10-KServiceNow's (NOW) professional services revenue was 7.1% of the sales mix during 2018. Appian's professional services revenue accounts for ~40% of the company's total revenue based on FY2019 guidance. Based on my projections for 2020, the number is still above 30% and the percentage isn't falling fast enough.During the 2nd quarter conference call, Appian reported reduced professional services revenues due to increased partner involvement. In my opinion, this was the right path forward for the company to expand the customer base for its low-code development platform. This formed the basis of my buy recommendation.Based on management's guidance for FY2019, I made the following projections for the business in 2019 and 2020. Professional services continues to form a large portion of Appian's revenue mix. Being a low margin segment and a necessary evil for a platform-as-a-service, this is unhealthy for a company like Appian since it provides a huge advantage to larger competitors.While Appian provides the much-needed low-code development platform, this is provided as an add-on to current PaaS offerings of its competitors - such as ServiceNow's NowPlatform (See Now Platform May Be The Next Chapter In ServiceNow's Growth).Source: 2018 10-K, Q3 report and author's calculationsThe large and growing professional services segment provides an unclear picture about Appian's relationships with technology partners. Further, it raises concerns about the pace of growth ahead.Gartner's latest report of low code application platforms put Appian among the leaders in the space. However, its position has dropped in comparison to prior reports.Source: Gartner ReportWith digital transformation striking all industry types, the demand for low-code development platforms is on the rise. However, large organizations prefer to bundle their subscription services along with their other software and licensing purchases.The presence of competitors like Salesforce, Microsoft (MSFT), and ServiceNow in the leadership ranks raises concerns on Appian's growth story. These companies have a much larger customer base than Appian and hence, the ability to cross-sell the low-code PaaS along with their other cloud offerings may put Appian at a huge disadvantage. Also, these competitors have the ability to offer flexible pricing.This opinion is in some capacity validated by the findings on Gartner's report. According to the report, Appian's reference customers reported below-average satisfaction with its contract evaluation and negotiation, as well as the contract flexibility.Moreover, Gartner's report also rated Appian's rate of customer expansion lower than that of peers in the low-code platform space.In my opinion, this trend is likely to continue as organizations quickly adopt competitor's PaaS platforms. Moreover, platforms of larger cloud PaaS providers like ServiceNow are relatively ""sticky"" (See - ServiceNow: Now Is The Time To Buy and ServiceNow: Keep Calm And Go Long) in comparison.Low code development is a real need in the era of digital transformation. However, heavy revenue dependence on professional services is making me uncomfortable.It is extremely important to partner with service integrators in order to expand a large number of customers. Due to this, in my opinion, it doesn't appear like Appian is well-positioned to capture a large market. Hence, I have closed my position on APPN and am moving on to other opportunities."
4261312,105176,2019-05-08T00:59:53-04:00,"Digital transformation is striking all industry types, causing low code development platforms to be in strong demand.Looking at Appian’s growth story so far, we see rising software revenue, a healthy balance sheet and returning customers.The company has lowered its FY2019 revenue guidance; however, a deeper dive into the story reveals that the company is on track for its long-term strategy.","Appian (APPN) is a small cap cloud computing company that sells platform as a service for building enterprise applications. Its primary targets are business process management and low code development.The software and services offered by Appian place the company strongly in the Digital Transformation initiative that is widely adopted among organizations.Source: Yahoo FinanceAppian reported Q1 results with $59.9 million in revenue in comparison with $51.7 million from Q1 last year. Further, the company updated its FY2019 revenue guidance. These results of missed estimates by 0.17% and updated guidance resulted in the stock going down 10%.This article will cover the growing need for low code development and Appian's growth in this space. Further, the investment thesis will talk about Q1 performance, its significance in Appian's long-term strategy and how the drop represents a good buying opportunity for long-term investors.Low-code development platform is software as a service that provides an environment programmers can use to create application software through graphical user interfaces and configuration instead of traditional computer programming. This comes of high value at a time when every major organization is trying to increase its digital footprint and provide added convenience to its customers.Conventional enterprise application development processes require large number of skilled software developers, testers and support staff. Supply of DevOps staff remains limited. With the abundance of IT platforms and services, it is also getting difficult to hire resources with specific skill set. Low code development provides an opportunity to achieve the digital wins without having to hire a large team. Moreover, low code development is about 20 times faster than conventional methods (Source - Forrester Study)It is noteworthy to mention that low code development is gaining traction among university students as a way to bridge the skills gap that is seen in the industry today.2. Legacy SystemsLegacy enterprise systems, platforms and applications are a major concern for organizations. Due to the nature of their design and deployment, it is really difficult to transition out of them. Moreover, they still hold valuable transaction data that is required for day-to-day operations. Most often, the legacy systems are unable to provide metrics for business to make data-driven decisions.The older the technology, the fewer people have the working knowledge of its internal workings, hence the maintenance requirement (patching, upgrades, vulnerability management) becomes more and more expensive. This makes cyber security a challenge with legacy systems. Low code platforms help tackle the security aspects of the platform in an easier manner. One of Appian’s top selling use cases is to be able to transform legacy apps into cloud-based, data-driven tools that can help the business achieve better efficiency.During Q1 conference call, Appian's leadership reported that more companies are choosing Appian to modernize legacy systems and launch new systems that realize great customer service and differentiate themselves from their competition.3. Digital TransformationDigital transformation is a major initiative by organizations of all types today. Organizations are trying to digitally enhance their services to win consumer loyalty. Low Code platforms make this transformation easier and less expensive.84% of firms with highest enterprise IT requirements and using low code development platforms are seeing the return on their investment.

Below is a list of other players that provide services essential in the Digital Transformation era.The listed companies below do not necessarily offer the same services as Appian, but the idea is to show that Appian is trading at a low multiple of its sales in comparison with these players that are experiencing growth due to enterprise transformation. Source: Data from YChartsAppian announced its Q1 earnings after the market on May 3, with the leadership lowering its revenue guidance for FY2019. From the Q1 conference call, I gather the following data points which resulted in the sharp drop in Appian's stock price:As a company, Appian initially mobilized professional services to strategize and execute the deployment of applications on its platform. The company has now partnered with professional services organizations like KPMG, PwC and Deloitte to provide these services and refer customers to use the Appian platform. Growth in software sales is a positive sign that the strategy is working.The reduced Q1 professional services revenue and the guidance for this segment in FY2019 may look like bad news in the short term. However, this is in line with the long-term strategy of the company.Source: Appian FY2018 Form 10K1. CompetitionIt is worth mentioning that there are several competitors for Appian in the low code development space. At present, the capabilities offered by Appian are industry-leading and well rated by popular technology reviewers. However, the markets for low-code development platforms, business process management, case management software and custom software are highly competitive, rapidly evolving and has relatively low barriers to entry.2. Economic DownturnPoor economy will be bad news for Appian. Though digital transformation is a major priority for organizations today, an economic downturn in the near future may result in companies spending less on IT Transformations, legacy app migrations, etc. This would likely result in lower adoption of the low code platform.3. Revenue Concentration10% of Appian’s subscription customers spent more than $1 million in 2018. Hence, loss of one or more of its significant customers may cause the revenue to decline significantly.In addition, due to Appian’s dependence on a limited number of customers, the company faces a concentration of credit risk. In FY2018, one customer accounted for 6.4% of its accounts receivable. In the case of insolvency by one of Appian’s significant customers, accounts receivable with respect to that customer might not be collectible in time, thereby affecting Appian’s financial system.Appian's stock has dropped due to its lowered revenue guidance for FY2019. However, taking a deeper look at the company’s strategy, the reduced revenue from the professional services segment is in line with the long-term story. Digital Transformation is a major undertaking by organizations of all sizes today and Appian's low code cloud platform, its expanding customer base and its ability to increase revenue from existing customers put the company at a great position to benefit from this trend. Hence, I recommend Appian to investors with a 2-3 year investment horizon."
4218224,103480,2018-11-05T10:45:35-05:00,"Appian shares rose modestly after announcing Q3 results that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom line.This quarter, however, Appian saw its revenue growth drop to just 22% y/y, down from 39% y/y last quarter.Last quarter's growth rate was heavily impacted by a large perpetual license deal with the U.S. Air Force, but this shows that Appian is prone to lumpy results.Thanks to its reliance on low-margin services revenues, Appian also retains a huge gross margin deficit to software peers.The company's cash burn has also nearly doubled from the prior year, and with just ~$100 million of cash left on the balance sheet, Appian may have to raise capital again soon.","Appian (APPN) was a very popular stock when it went public last year at just $12 per share. Investors latched on quickly to the company's promise of transforming enterprise via low-code software platforms that every man can use. This year, however, a lot of cracks have begun showing in the story. Appian has proven largely unable to wean itself off large services and implementation revenues that, while propping up the company's growth rate, are performed at or below cost, hurting margins. Free cash flow losses have widened, and there is no visible path to breakeven just yet.Even before the October pullback, shares of Appian were already struggling. Despite modestly rising after reporting seemingly strong Q3 results, shares of Appian are still down near year-to-date lows:APPN data by YChartsInvestors would be wise to avoid buying this stock in the hopes of a rebound. Plenty of other SaaS names trade at 30-40% below their all-time highs, with much cleaner narratives and much more impressive growth trajectories than Appian. With Appian's growth falling into the low-20s this quarter, it's difficult to even classify Appian as a high-growth tech stock anymore.The pace of Appian's deceleration might come as a shock to some investors. Last quarter, Appian announced a sales re-org that included a new head of Sales, an event that potentially caused customer disruption and deals lost or pushed further out into the timeline. Appian has not yet announced revenue guidance for FY19 (which it's expected to do with next quarter's release), but given that growth this quarter slipped to 22% y/y, it's highly unlikely that Appian will guide above 20% growth, if it follows a normal growth trajectory. After all, the company's original guidance for FY18 called for 14-16% y/y growth (though its latest guidance now calls for 25% y/y growth, though that includes the one-time Air Force deal that tacked on about 2 points of growth by itself).Note also that for next quarter, Appian is guiding to just 9-11% y/y growth:Figure 1. Appian 4Q18 guidanceSource: Appian investor relationsIt's difficult to be bullish on a company that is only expecting growth in the low teens, has an inferior margin profile thanks to a large mix of services revenues, and is still trading at ~7x forward revenues. Investors are far better off buying other fallen angels among recent tech IPOs such as DocuSign (DOCU), Eventbrite (EB), and Dropbox (DBX).Here's a look at Appian's full Q3 results:Figure 2. Appian 3Q18 resultsSource: Appian investor relationsRevenues grew 22% y/y to $54.9 million, outpacing Wall Street's expectations of $49.7 million (+14% y/y) by a wide mile. Note, however, that this quarter's growth rate represents a stark deceleration from last quarter's growth rate of 39% y/y.Last quarter, of course, was benefited by the impact of a $4.4 million U.S. Air Force perpetual license deal. But this quarter, too, benefited strongly from public sector wins. Per CEO Matt Calkin's comments on the earnings call:As a FedRAMP-certified vendor, public sector wins are clearly key to Appian's strategy, and these are highly impactful deals. But they are also unreliable. The big spread between Wall Street's growth expectations this quarter, and Appian's results are a function of the unpredictable nature of its public sector wins. It's unclear what the dollar impact of the two large federal deals were this quarter or whether they are recurring or one-time. My concern is that Appian is unable to sustain ~20% growth on enterprise wins alone, and government deals are just too finicky to rely on.Appian's revenue mix also continues to be heavily tilted toward professional services, though mix improved modestly this quarter. Subscription revenues grew 42% y/y to $30.9 million and represented 56% of revenues, up five points from a revenue share of 51% in 3Q17. That's decent progress, but not yet enough to cure the margin deficit Appian has to other software peers, which typically have gross margins in the 70-80% range. Total gross margins improved by just one point to 64%, helped by a stronger mix of subscription revenues (though subscription margins stayed flat while professional services margins even dropped):Figure 3. Appian margin trendsSource: Appian investor relationsOperating losses in the quarterly more than doubled to -$14.9 million, accelerated by a doubling of general and administrative expenses. R&D costs also shot up by 36% y/y, and sales and marketing costs jumped 30% y/y. All of Appian's major components of operating expenses rose faster than revenues this quarter. As a result, operating margins plunged to -27.0%, much worse than -14.6% in the year-ago quarter.Perhaps most concerning of all, however, is Appian's quickening cash burn:Figure 4. Appian cash flowsSource: Appian investor relationsIn the year-to-date period, Appian has generated operating cash flow losses of -$24.0 million, and after adding in $2.2 million of capex, this amounts to $26.1 million of free cash flow burn. This is up more than 2x from $10.4 million in the year-ago period.Appian's balance sheet holds just $107 million of cash left. As operating margins continue to deteriorate and a path to breakeven doesn't seem to be within sight, Appian might have to resort to a dilutive capital raise in order to continue funding its losses.Appian's product is considered synonymous with a reputation for low code, but it may soon also garner a reputation for low growth. Wall Street has for many quarters now expected growth in the low teens, and were it not for large federal wins this quarter and last, Appian might have missed Street expectations on the top line. Appian's FY19 guidance, due next quarter, is a major downside risk for investors who have gotten accustomed to seeing the company's 20-30% growth rates that may not be able to last into FY19.As software companies' growth rates slow down, it becomes imperative for them to improve margins and stabilize cash flows. Appian, on the other hand, is doing the opposite, with free cash flow losses quickening and operating margins sinking. It's unseemly to pay 7x forward revenues for a company that, for lack of a better term, doesn't quite have its act together."

Portfolio. Appian has performed well since the company IPO'ed in mid-2017 but the stock has significantly underperformed the broader market on a YTD basis.APPN data by YChartsWhile the stock has not performed well over the last 10 months, I still believe that Appian has great long-term business prospects. Therefore, I view the recent pullback as a buying opportunity if you are willing (and able) to hold onto the stock for the next three to five years.Appian is a 'low-cost, low-code' software development company that allows customers to develop applications on its platform. The company's customers are able to use its cloud-based platform to code apps and Appian's approach - simplistic coding that allows for people with limited coding knowledge to easily design, build, and implement apps at attractive prices - really sets itself apart from competitors.Appian has significantly grown its top line since the IPO and I believe that the future looks just as bright.APPN Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsMore importantly, the company has been able to keep the growth going over the last few quarters, as shown by the fact that Appian again reported a top line beat in its most recent quarter. The company reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.14 (beat by $0.03) on revenue of $59.88M (beat by $9.61M) for Q2 2018.Financial highlights from the quarter:It is all about building and expanding at this stage, so there was a lot to like about the company's operating results. 39% YoY revenue growth is something to write home about it, and let's not forget that the net revenue retention figure (119%) shows that management is keeping customers happy.On the negative front, the consolidated margins declined by 100bps (from 65% to 64%) but I do not believe that this is a significant concern given the fact that Appian is still early in growth mode. Earnings, or lack thereof, are taking a backseat and I believe that this will likely be the case for at least the next 12-18 months, if not longer.It is also noteworthy that one firm, Abdiel Capital Advisors LLC, holds a material stake in Appian.Source: FidelityHaving a steady hand own a large chunk of shares should give management time to see their strategy through without worrying about investors jumping ship over short-term noise because, make no mistake about it, Appian is a long-term story.Projections for the low-code market are all over the place but almost every estimate supports the case that the market is expected to experience tremendous growth in the years ahead. For example, according to ResearchandMarkets, the low-code development platform market is expected to grow from $4.32B in 2017 to $27.23B by 2022 (CAGR of approximately 44%).Appian has consistently reported broad-based growth and it does not appear that this company will slow down anytime soon. It also helps that the recent earnings report shows that not only is Appian meeting the needs of its current customer base but that the company is also signing on new customers to material deals.Business highlights from Q2 2018:Nine $1M plus customer wins is meaningful for this small-cap company. Additionally, management expects for Appian to have a strong finish to 2018. It is also important to note that Appian has a strong balance sheet that should support management's long-term growth strategy.Source: Q2 2018 10-QObservations:Simply put, Appian is well-positioned to benefit from the tremendous amount of growth that the low-code industry is expected to experience over the next decade plus. Moreover, in my opinion, digital is the future so it pays to be invested in a company that helps non-tech (and tech) people develop applications that are vital in today's environment.Per Yahoo! Finance, the Street rates Appian as a ""Hold"" but the average price target is $30.00 per share (approximately 20% higher than today's price).And Barclays recently upgraded Appian to ""Equal Weight"" with a price target of $29. I tend to agree with the Street in that I definitely see upside potential but the stock will likely be under pressure in the near term, especially if the broader market continues to pull back.A downturn in the broader market will likely cause APPN shares to be under pressure. A recession will be terrible news for a company like Appian.The company also operates in a highly competitive industry so the major players with deep pockets have the potential to derail Appian's long-term plans. Lastly, another company-specific risk is the potential for equity dilution - see the company's latest stock offering news here.Appian's stock has not performed well lately but I believe that the company's long-term story is still intact. Digitalization is taking over the global economy so, in my opinion, Appian's cloud-based business puts the company in a great position to benefit from several major trends. As such, I believe that investors with a time horizon longer than 2 years should consider adding Appian at current levels.Author's Note: All images were taken from Appian's Q2 2018 Earnings Presentation, unless otherwise stated.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

As such, I believe that Appian shareholders should consider staying the course because the investment thesis for this low-code company is still intact.On February 21, 2019, Appian reported Q4 2018 results that beat the top- and bottom-line estimates. The low-code company reported a GAAP quarterly loss per share of $0.22 (beat by $0.01) on revenue of $60.22M (beat by $4.48M), which also compares favorably to the year-ago quarter.Source: Q4 and Full-year 2018 Earnings PresentationHighlights for the quarter and full year:Source: Q4 and Full-year 2018 Earnings PresentationThere was a lot to like about Appian's most recent earnings report. The company's main focus is its subscription business, and so far the results have been good.Source: Q4 and Full-year 2018 Earnings PresentationIf investors remember correctly, management has well documented the fact that the shift to more of a subscription-based focus will cause some noise in the numbers and the story has played out exactly as it predicted. The overall growth has been received with mixed views but the subscription business has put up some impressive numbers. Moreover, management described during the conference call that 10 out of the 87 net new subscription customers in 2018 purchased $1M or more of software on a TCV basis. Those are meaningful numbers for a company the size of Appian, especially after you consider the company's strong retention figures.Another important point to make is that while the company's overall gross margins are in the mid-60% range, the subscription-related margins have consistently been above 90%.Source: Q4 and Full-year 2018 Earnings PresentationIn my mind, management is indeed focusing on the right area.Now for what caused the stock to drop by 8% when the earnings were released - that is, the mixed outlook.Source: Q4 and Full-year 2018 Earnings PresentationThe outlook is not great by any means, but it is hard to not be excited about a company that is expected to report this type of top-line growth. Additionally, management views the subscription business as the main growth driver for Appian, so unlike the total revenue estimate, it is expected to grow by almost 30%. The earnings (or lack thereof) estimates should not be ignored, but in my opinion, investors should have already baked in expectations for this company to continue to heavily invest in its business.The thesis is simple: Appian is well-positioned to benefit from the tremendous amount of growth that the low-code industry is expected to experience over the next decade plus. Moreover, in my opinion, digital is the future for the global economy, so it pays to be invested in a company that helps non-tech (and tech) people develop applications that are vital in today's environment.Companies operating in the low-code space have a significant market opportunity. For example, the total spending on the category is forecasted to hit $21.2 billion by 2022 (CAGR of ~40%), according to Forrester Research. Another research firm believes that the global low-code market will grow by a CAGR of ~32% through 2023.Source: Market Research FutureI could provide several additional estimates but they would not show anything different, i.e., almost every forecast predicts the low-code market to experience significant growth in the years ahead.In today's competitive environment, Appian and other low-code companies provide a much-needed resource in that the platforms allow for its customers to be extremely flexible with rolling out/adjusting/replacing their digital solutions. If you ask me, the low-code growth estimates may actually turn out to be conservative as the economy continues to become more digitally connected.It also helps the bull case that Appian has a strong balance sheet that will allow for the company to weather any near-term storms (i.e., the calls for an economic slowdown).Source: Q4 and Full-year 2018 Earnings PresentationNo debt, increasing cash and deferred revenue balances, a current ratio over 1.6 - what's not to like?Lastly, and as I recently described, it is also encouraging that Appian has several large shareholder groups.Source: FidelityAnd the institutional investors have been net buyers in the recent past.Source: FidelityThe ""smart money"" is not always right, but instead, I like the fact that Appian has the support of a few steady hands that will either: (1) see the strategy through or (2) push for change, if necessary.The stock is up big over the last few years but I do not recommend getting too worked up overvaluation at this point in time (remember, Appian is still early in its growth stage).Data by YChartsBased on historical price-to-sales metrics, APPN shares are sitting closer to a more reasonable valuation after the recent pullback. I would let the stock dip a little further as I view the 8x-9x range a good entry point.A downturn in the broader market will likely cause APPN shares to be under pressure. A deep recession will be terrible news for a company like Appian, in my opinion (however, I do believe that the company's strong balance sheet will be extremely helpful if a recession does hit).The company also operates in a highly competitive industry so the major players with deep pockets have the potential to derail Appian's long-term plans.Appian reported strong results to finish 2018 and, in my opinion, the main takeaway from the recent earnings release (and management commentary) is that this low-code company appears to be well-positioned for 2019 and beyond.The company operates in a promising backdrop and I believe that the low-code market forecasts could actually turn out to be too conservative. Simply put, Appian's investment thesis is still intact.

The company is not yet profitable and is by no means cheap, as it trades at 10.67x sales at the time of this writing. Only being public for a bit over a year, the stock is very much in its infancy, but Appian is likely to become a major source of providing customized software solutions well into the future. With a streak of strong sales growth and revised, upward forecasts aimed north of $213.8-$215.3 million for the full fiscal year, today’s prices represent an attractive entry point for long-term investors despite the seemingly high valuation.SourceMany businesses utilize a stable of software programs on a daily basis to help efficiently manage and grow their operations, but the problem of not having customized solutions available is all too real of a problem. Furthermore, many companies lack the skilled personnel to develop these unique solutions and there is a severe shortage of qualified software developers. Couple this with the likelihood that the demand for software development likely to grow, and solutions like low-code become a go-to solution for meeting this need. This trend places APPN perfectly for the future and makes it a long-term investment. While the concept of low-code hase been around since the 1980s, it had never really worked as well as promised or intended - until now. Forrester Research expects the low-code market to grow from $3.8 billion in 2017 to $21.2 billion in 2022 as the cloud platform has provided the needed accessibility, security, and usability for low-code to flourish.Revenue growth is increasing with the latest quarter representing nearly a 39% increase year-over-year.SourceJust as important as growth, subscription revenue retention has consistently been well above 100%. This indicates that revenue from existing customers is increasing and is proof that their strategy of “land and expand” is working, where the company looks to get a customer started on one product initially and later gets them to sign up for more subscriptions. SourceThe growth and retention of subscriptions is key, as gross margins are over 90% for this segment of the company’s revenue. This is a sharp contrast to the company’s margins on professional services, which were 31% in the latest quarter. SourceMargins are not as strong on professional services – but management felt that it was neccessary to build out the segment before subscription services as it is monetized quicker. Subscription takes time to develop and grow with the “land and expand” strategy, which is working as evidenced by the subscription revenue retention rate of over 100%.In addition to expanding services to additional customers, APPN is forecasting year-over-year growth in its Q3 subscription revenue of 34% to 35% , which matches the guided full year growth in subscription revenues of 34%. With the high growth and high margins on subscription revenues one may be surprised to see a forecasted loss per share ranging between $0.60 and $0.63 for the year, but profitability is not the determining indicator of success for this company.The loss is attributable to marketing and sales costs which are needed to grow the customer base. Once locked in, the customers need to stay in and purchase the high margin subscriptions. In order for this to happen, APPN must first make potential customers aware and second, APPN must have a sufficient sales program to support customers. APPN is in growth mode in which growing its customer base is the top priority. APPN’s lack of profitability may be enough of a concern for some investors to stay away as the company posted a loss of $0.14 per share in Q2 and a loss of $0.12 in Q1. However, I would caution investors avoiding the company based solely on its lack of profitability, as APPN is focused on growth – not profits. This has been modeled in other successful companies such as Amazon, where it’s about the top line growth – not the bottom line. While reporting a loss in the most recent quarter, revenues were up almost 39% YoY, and beat estimates by $9.61 million. With the top line growing, investors may wonder where all that cash is flowing.APPN has plowed over $50 million into sales and marketing this year so far, spending $27.3 million in the most recent quarter and $25.1 million in Q1 and is on track to spend over $100 million at the current rate this fiscal year. In comparison to total revenue, the company spent nearly 47% of its revenues on sales and marketing for the first half of the year and if run rates persist, will have spent around 49% of annual revenues on sales and marketing. This is a massive, but necessary amount as the company needs to continue to grow and support its sales.As mentioned earlier, growth has been strong and almost 40% year-over-year in Q2. I also find it encouraging seeing that growth is exceptionally strong internationally, where revenues increased 55% for the quarter and 68.9% for the first half of the year on a year-over-year comparison and make up near 30% of total revenues thus far in 2018. For long-term success it is important that APPN continues to geographically diversify its revenues and incorporate international growth into its overall strategy.SourceAPPN’s valuation is a bit more complex since it is unprofitable. However, we can utilize price-to-sales, and see that it looks expensive, as the figure is over 10. While some of you gather yourselves off of the floor, let me remind you that Facebook (FB) priced its IPO at 23.7 times sales - and we all know how that turned out. Now, I am not making any guarantees of any sort, but simply pointing out that unprofitable tech companies in their early stages are impossible to value on traditional metrics. And of the metrics that are used, none should not be taken as gospel or sole determinant of the company's worth. What investors need to do is monitor growth each quarter and ensuring that it keeps tracking upwards at a sufficient pace to justify share prices.If revenues continue to grow at 30% a year they will more than double in three years, if they grow at 39% (as was the case for the most recent quarter) they will double in just over 2 years. Growth is not guaranteed, but is certainly not out of the question with the company’s track record and tailwinds. If growth slows down or stalls, investors will need to rethink this thesis.While the company noted that its long-term goal is to shift the majority of its revenues to subscriptions, it has been utilizing the professional services segment more in the near-term as the revenues are recognized quicker. Unfortunately the professional services margins are considerably smaller than those of the subscriptions. Couple that with the fact that professional services made up nearly 45% of revenues, the margins are a considerable drag on the company’s margins overall. APPN must successfully transition more of its business to the subscription category in the coming years to improve its overall margins. In the recent quarter, margins dropped from 65% to 64%, which isn’t a reason to panic, but something that should note investors to keep tabs on each quarter. Also APPN must be able to retain its customers, espeically now in the early innings where every customer counts. If growth slows or revenue retention dips - the top line is likely to reflect it.APPN has strong growth potential with the need for coding and a lack of qualified individuals to build it. Low-code is a viable solution that is expected to grow substantially over the coming years and APPN is primed to address the need. While it is an unprofitable company, the bottom line is not the key indicator of success at the moment, as the company is focusing on revenue growth. If growth rates are sustained, today’s price is considerably favorable, given the tailwinds of software playing an increasingly vital role in today’s economy and the current shortage of skills required to develop it. APPN must make good however, on transitioning more of its revenues to the subscriptions segment, as margins are considerably larger. I believe management is capable of executing the vision set forth of strong growth and shifting revenues to high-margin subscriptions, getting current customers to spend more, while acquiring new ones; and therefore, I rate APPN as a BUY."
4149900,103480,2018-02-23T05:43:02-05:00,"Appian is off its January highs, but the stock's Q4 earnings have done nothing to justify the company's still-elevated 9x forward revenue multiple.While growth in the quarter exceeded expectations, the company's margins didn't see any lift.Appian's concentration of growth in low-margin professional services has put a dent in its gross margins.The company's guidance for the coming year is weak, implying only 12-14% y/y growth.","Appian (NASDAQ: APPN), the low-code business process management software company, reported Q4 earnings that caused the stock to see a mild ~3% lift in after-hours trading. The move reverses a bit of a downtrend in the stock since February, after a roaring rally that sent Appian to the $40s. Considering that Appian went public last year in May at $12 a share, the company's performance since going public still places it among the top echelon of recent IPOs:APPN data by YChartsThe company was little known prior to receiving so much attention toward the tail end of 2017 from Wall Street, causing a buying frenzy. As I've noted in a prior article, I think much of the enthusiasm in Appian is rather misguided. It's true that the company's growth has picked up since going public - growing at 45% last quarter and 50% this quarter certainly explains some of the positive vibes currently surrounding the stock - but overall, I think Appian's TAM is rather limited.Appian's very business model - which helps companies embark on ""digital transformation journeys"" through a low-code interface - while being billed as SaaS, is one of the least self-service platforms in the industry. You'll notice in Appian's FY17 results that 48% of its revenues came from professional services, not software - due to the volume of revenues that Appian generates from custom implementation services.Why is this important? Revenue is revenue, right? Well, technically yes - but the fact that professional services revenue carries a much lower gross margin than SaaS revenues sort of defeats the notion of valuing a SaaS company at such high multiples of revenue. SaaS businesses are supposed to be low-touch: a SaaS company should be able to add a lot of new customers without too much added cost burden beyond the cost of hosting that customer in the cloud. Appian's model, however, requires a bit more labor and cost to get clients going.To illustrate the point on margins - in FY17, Appian generated only $30.0 million of gross margin dollars on $85.2 million of professional services revenue (a 35% margin), while its subscription business generated $82.1 million of gross margin dollars on $91.5 million of revenues, a 90% margin.It makes sense to value Appian's high-margin, low-cost SaaS revenue stream at a high revenue multiple, while assigning a much lower multiple to the half of its revenue base that derives from professional services. As it currently stands, however, Appian is valued at >9x forward revenues.The premise of this thesis is not that Appian is a bad company - its niche product certainly has merit for companies without robust IT development staffs, and Gartner has named it as a Leader in its space. However, the company's valuation seems rather stretched, and without any hint that the company is making moves toward transitioning to a higher mix of SaaS revenues or achieving greater profitability, it's hard to see the bullish case for Appian at its current price.Let's take a look at the results for the quarter:Figure 1. Appian Q4 resultsSource: Appian investor relationsRevenues grew 50% y/y to $50.6 million in Q4, beating analyst expectations for $41.8 million. This is certainly a large beat margin that deserves some applause, but note that again, professional services is driving too much of that growth. Subscription revenues only grew 42% y/y, while professional services charged ahead by 72% y/y.The result is two-fold - first, clearly, subscription revenues are an even lower mix of Appian's revenues than in 4Q16 - the exact opposite direction that we want Appian to be moving. And second, gross margin dollars grew only 38% y/y to $31.9 million, lagging behind revenue growth. At 63% gross margins, Appian has one of the poorest gross margin profiles in the software sector. Compare this figure to some other bulwarks in the SaaS industry:CRM Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsWhether you're looking at larger SaaS comps like Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) or other recent IPOs that went public in 2017 along with Appian like Alteryx (NASDAQ: AYX) and MuleSoft (NASDAQ: MULE), it's fairly set across the board that Appian's services-heavy business has its gross margin lagging pretty deeply behind peers.Gross margins also fell year on year, with margins at 69% in 4Q16. The fact that professional services revenue is growing much faster than services does have a bona fide impact on profitability.Another issue with Appian's results - despite the fantastic growth, Appian's operating loss margins widened. The company's GAAP operating loss sank to $7.0 million (a -14% margin) versus -$1.8 million (a -5% margin) in 4Q16. Granted, a low-teens operating loss margin still puts Appian ahead of other loss-leading software peers, but it's trending in the wrong direction.The other red flag in Appian's quarterly release - a soft guidance range. Appian is indicating that it'll do just $198.1-$201.1 million in revenues for FY18, indicating a growth range of 12-14%. This stands in stark contrast to the 50% growth it saw this year. And while the numbers probably have a lot of conservatism built into them and Appian will likely adjust the range upward throughout the year, it's not exactly a guidance range to get excited about.Appian, more than most software companies, has seen some volatility in its quarterly growth rates and doesn't follow a neat growth glide path. Its y/y numbers in the past two quarters have been fantastic, but if the guidance for FY18 holds, investors can be in for a shock when Appian's growth falls into the low double-digits.The market saw the headline numbers in Appian's results - a sizable beat to revenues and EPS targets - and bid up the stock modestly in after-hours trading. An inspection under the hood, however, tells us that not all is rosy with the company's performance.Key issues to highlight are: the mix shift away from SaaS revenues resulting in declining gross margins y/y; the buildup of operating losses; and a soft guidance going into FY18. None of these are going to kill the stock, but investors really have to ask themselves: is this stock worth the price it's trading at?At its post-earnings share price of $31.50, Appian carries a market cap of $1.9 billion; netting out $73.7 million of balance sheet cash, its enterprise value is $1.83 billion. This represents a 9.2x EV/FY18 revenue multiple based on the company's guidance midpoint of $199.1 million. This is the same price we'd pay for high-quality SaaS names like Workday and ServiceNow (NASDAQ: NOW), but it's too much for a company with all the issues that Appian has.If you've been lucky enough to hold onto Appian stock since the IPO, now might be a good time to lock in gains. Many other investors are probably thinking the same."
4169803,103480,2018-05-04T10:36:34-04:00,"Appian reported a beat to Q1 earnings, with both the top and bottom lines exceeding analyst expectations by a fair margin.Despite the upside to conservative expectations, Appian showed serious sequential deceleration in the quarter, with only 35% y/y growth versus the 50% growth it saw in Q4.The company is still guiding to just 14-16% total growth for FY18, implying even further deceleration in the back half of the year.This calls into question Appian's premium valuation of 8.5x forward revenues, an extremely high multiple for a company expected to grow only in the mid-teens.Appian is also running low on cash, as it generated free cash flow burn this quarter versus a profit in the year-ago quarter.","Appian (NASDAQ:APPN) is coming up on the one-year anniversary of its IPO, and by all objective measures, the IPO seems to have been a smashing success. Pricing at $12 per share in late May, the company has emerged one year later at almost 3x the price. After trading sideways for a bit this year, Appian's recent Q1 earnings have helped to lift the stock closer again to $30.APPN data by YChartsYet, despite the market and Wall Street's warm reception to Appian throughout its life as a public company, I still struggle to find justification for its ultrahigh valuation. A quick gut check - after jumping ~4% in reaction to earnings and settling at $29.50, Appian currently has a market cap of $1.78 billion. Netting off the company's $61 million of cash on the balance sheet, Appian is sitting at an enterprise value of $1.72 billion.The company recently refreshed its guidance for FY18, now calling for $201-205 million in revenues, or a growth range of 14-16% y/y. Against this guidance range, Appian trades at an EV/FY18 revenue multiple of 8.4x, as shown in the chart above. Make no mistake - this is a premium multiple, far above where the average SaaS company trades at around 6-7x forward revenues. Growth in the mid-teens is nothing to be excited about. Appian has seen >30% growth in each of the three quarters it's reported since going public, but the reversion to growth in the mid-teens (Appian's historical growth rate in FY16 was about 20%, so it seems its hyper-growth phase is coming to a swift end) gives investors a lot less to be excited about. This is a stock with average prospects trading at an above-average valuation.Appian's small-cap nature and the fact that it's a less well-known stock have perhaps allowed it to escape demanding comparisons and retain its premium valuation. But just for some perspective, there are much better investments to make for a much better price in the SaaS software sector. Appian's enterprise value of ~$1.7 billion is approximately equal to that of Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR), which has taken a beating after it announced a sales re-org and a change in its go-to-market approach. For that same enterprise value of $1.7 billion, Cloudera is guiding to ~$440 million in revenues this year (more than twice Appian's scale), and is appropriately trading at a forward revenue multiple of 3.8x.There's no reason, in my opinion, to chase such a premium-valued stock upward. Appian has middling prospects - yes, its low-code BPM software platform has earned strong recognition from customers, but it's unclear how large its TAM is and how much room Appian has left to grow. Clearly, the company is baking in a serious slowdown into its forecast as soon as this year.Appian remains a company to avoid at all costs. An unexplained enthusiasm has buoyed the stock for far too long, and in a market that is seeing increased volatility, the rotation to value stocks can hurt names like Appian especially hard.In looking at Appian's results, it's almost irrelevant that the company beat expectations when we look at how much its growth has decelerated from the last quarter. Again, the bearish thesis on Appian isn't that the company is doomed from a fundamental perspective - it's a pure valuation argument, and with these kind of financials, Appian deserves a far less optimistic valuation.Here's a look at the full Q1 results:Figure 1. Appian Q1 earningsSource: Appian investor relationsTotal revenues grew 35% y/y to $51.7 million, far ahead of consensus expectations of $38.2 million. But we have to ask ourselves - even if Appian exceeded conservative expectations and its own conservative guidance, do we like the fact that its growth decelerated fifteen points from the 50% y/y growth we saw in Q4? A 50% growth stock might be worth 8.5x forward revenues, but a 35% grower probably isn't, and a 14-16% grower (as Appian's guidance would suggest) certainly is not. Given the fifteen points of deceleration this quarter, it does seem that Appian's low-growth guidance scenario for this year will be a reality - the FY18 guidance itself barely moved up from the midpoint of $199 million that the company issued in Q4.Another fact I've always been skeptical of with Appian's results is subscription revenue growth, which is responsible for the majority of its gross margin, has always been much lower than its professional services growth, which is essentially performed at cost (there's a stark difference between the value of these two revenue streams - subscription revenues carried a sky-high 90% gross margin in the quarter, while professional services carried only 26% gross margin). During this quarter, Appian's subscription revenues grew only 26% y/y to $27.0 million, while professional services grew 47% y/y to $24.7 million.This also means that Appian's revenue mix has continued to tilt more heavily in favor of professional services, lowering its overall gross margin. This quarter, subscriptions contributed just 52% of total revenues (professional services made up the full remaining 48%), while in 1Q17, the mix had been 56-44. This has devastating impacts on gross margin - Appian achieved gross margin of just 57.2% this quarter versus 66.9% in the year-ago quarter. Its gross margin is already one of the lowest in the SaaS sector, another reason why this company can't possibly be worth >8x forward revenues.Meanwhile, operating losses have nearly tripled to -$10.2 million, representing a -20% operating margin versus just -9% in 1Q17. This is a company that keeps driving itself into a deeper and deeper hole.Another harrowing fact - Appian's free cash flow in the quarter was -$14.9 million, whereas FCF had been positive $3.6 million in 1Q17. Appian's relatively lower operating losses and positive cash flows had been one of the reasons supporting a higher valuation for the stock - but with the reversion to negative FCF, Appian is starting to look like an average SaaS company with average growth, the usual loss margins, and a much worse gross margin and revenue mix.With just $60.9 million of cash left on its balance sheet, if Appian's current FCF run rate continues (in all likelihood, given current trends, it's likely to worsen), this implies that the company has just one year left of liquidity. Of course, unlike other cash-strapped tech companies like Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) and Tintri (TNTR), Appian has plenty of capital-raising options, with its high stock price (the very subject of this article) creating the possibility of a lucrative secondary offering. A debt raise is also possible, given its balance sheet is currently clean. Convertible debt has been a popular option among high-growth SaaS companies, and one was recently executed by Apptio (NASDAQ:APTI), which went public around the same time as Appian.Despite this, the market doesn't like thin balance sheets nor the possibility of dilutive capital raising strategies. Appian's worsening FCF and cash limitations are going to become a more glaring problem in the near future.Appian remains a company to avoid. Undue optimism has lifted the stock for most of its life as a public company, but as the company reverts into deceleration mode with an expected growth rate of just 14-16% this year, sentiment on the stock can quickly turn negative. After all, Appian's investors are used to seeing 40-50% growth on a quarterly basis.There are many higher-quality names in the software sector's batch of 2017 and 2018 IPOs. With this in mind, I expect enthusiasm for Appian to fade going into the rest of the year."
4195185,103480,2018-08-06T02:09:02-04:00,"Appian, the developer behind low-code PaaS platforms, has reported Q2 earnings that beat on the top and bottom line.Despite this, shares sank nearly 10% as investors continued to process a slowdown in growth and a weak FY18 guidance outlook that calls for only 22% y/y growth in revenues.Investors may also be worried about the transition of Appian's SVP of Sales. Sales re-orgs have led to deal disruption at other software companies.Appian isn't as richly valued as in the past, but in light of its dimming prospects, its ~8.5x forward revenue multiple is tough to swallow.","It's been a rough ride for Appian (APPN) in the past couple of months. After stellar performance in 2017 that took Appian from a $12 IPO to more than 2x that level, the stock has largely traded sideways in 2018 as the company's results begin to show decelerating growth. Here's a look at the one-year chart below:The company is slowing down for good reason, in my view: there just isn't much in the way of positive catalysts to get excited about. This quarter's earnings, while decent, failed to sufficiently impress investors and sent shares into a nearly 10% selloff.Appian even offered a substantial lift to its guidance ranges for FY18. Previously, the company had guided to $201-$205 million in revenues for FY18, implying 14-16% y/y growth. Alongside Appian's Q2 results, it meaningfully bumped up that range to $213.8-$215.3 million in revenues, or 21-22% y/y growth. Still, even the seven-point bump to the growth range was not enough to prevent the stock from melting down. And this makes sense - a company trading at ~8.5x forward revenues is overvalued if it can only manage growth in the low 20s.There's also another potential worry waiting in the wings for Appian: it's bringing in a new SVP of Sales. Note that sales re-orgs are eyed extremely warily in the SaaS sector, given that they have led often to deal disruption and lowered guidance at other SaaS companies in the past (like Cloudera (CLDR) earlier this year when it announced its sales re-org). To be fair to Appian, this transition seems fairly moderate - David Mitchell, the company's pick for the job, has already been with Appian for the past year as a VP, and the outgoing SVP, Edward Hughes, is slated to remain at Appian in ""a new executive position and serve as an advisor to our sales leadership.""Matt Calkins, Appian's CEO, noted the following on the earnings call:Still, the possibility of disruption could have investors on edge.There is good news for the company, however. Appian seems to be doing a good job at pushing its services upmarket, with the company signing nine deals in excess of $1 million in total contract value in Q2. One of these large wins included Bayer, the German pharmaceutical giant that is one of the top five pharma companies in the world. Earlier on in its life as a public company, I had doubts that Appian would be successful among the large enterprise segment, as many have PaaS offerings already installed and less need for low-code development platforms. With wins like Bayer and eight others like it in the quarter, it seems this is not the case.With that being said, however, Appian is a hold at the moment. The company has a unique product that's been recognized both by customers and by Gartner, and its big logo wins have been impressive. Still, the implied deceleration in the company's guidance to low-20s growth, as well as the added risks of a sales transition, make the company's 8.5x forward revenue multiple seem excessive. In my view, the shares still have further to fall.Here's a look at Appian's Q2 results:Figure 1. Appian Q2 earningsSource: Appian investor relationsTotal revenues grew 39% y/y to $59.9 million, which is a massive beat to Wall Street's expectations of $50.3 million (+16% y/y), which were more aligned to Appian's prior guidance view. In light of this massive beat - one of the biggest beat margins in the SaaS sector in Q2 thus far - it's fairly surprising that Appian's shares fell as far as they did. Helping Appian's performance this quarter, however, was a $4.4 million perpetual license deal with the U.S. Air Force. Appian no longer does these kinds of deals, but this one-time effort helped to bump revenue growth in the quarter. Subscription revenues still did well outside of the Air Force deal, however - with growth of 36% y/y to $27.0 million, and a subscription retention rate of 119% - trending toward the high end of Appian's guided range of 110-120%.One of the persistent problems with Appian's growth, however, is the large mix of professional services. Appian made some progress on that front this quarter - professional services revenue of $26.8 million represented 45% of the company's total revenue mix this quarter, versus 49% in the year-ago quarter. Note that professional services carries a gross margin only slightly above cost, and while a ~10-15% services mix is typical for a SaaS company, Appian's large concentration of services within its revenue base greatly dilutes its gross margin. Gross margin this quarter was 64.0% 350bps better than 61.5% in the year-ago quarter - but Appian's gross margin still lags noticeably behind other SaaS companies, which typically boast margins in the mid-70s or low 80s. Given this margin deficit, it becomes increasingly harder to justify Appian's above-market valuation multiple at 8.5x forward revenues.Balancing out the persisting gross margin deficit is the fact that Appian has been able to dramatically improve its operating margin, thanks primarily to a scale-down in both R&D and general and administrative spending. Operating losses in the quarterly nearly halved to -$8.3 million, representing an operating margin of -14% versus -34% in the year-ago quarter. Pro forma EPS of -$0.14, meanwhile, beat Wall Street's expectations on -$0.17.One additional worrying note, however, is the fact that operating cash flows have tumbled in the first half of the year:Figure 2. Appian OCFSource: Appian investor relationsAppian's CFO attributed that loss to a ""delay of a few large payments which were collected in July plus an ERP system migration that delayed invoicing by a few weeks."" He added that the back half of the year would show ""minimum negative cash flow,"" but this is a trend that investors will continue to watch.The main question on the near-term horizon for Appian is just how severe its deceleration will be in the back half of this year. In the six months year-to-date, Appian has already generated $111.6 million in revenues, up 37% y/y. If the company hits the top end of its guidance range of $215.3 million, it would generate $103.7 million in the second half of the year, which would represent just 9% y/y growth.There's probably a high degree of conservatism baked into that guidance range. It's unlikely that Appian will generate less revenue in the second half of the year than in the first, even in the absence of a license deal with the U.S. Air Force. But the fear that Appian's growth could decelerate to the mid-teens level, as well as the added complications from a sales shift, has investors worried.In my view, Appian's risk-reward profile is unfavorably tilted against a long position when the stock is trading at 8.5x forward revenues, especially when its revenue base is still diluted by a high degree of low-margin services. Stay on the sidelines until a better price is reached."
4137130,103480,2018-01-12T06:18:38-05:00,"Appian stock has nearly doubled in the past month on very little news.The low-code BPM (business process management) software provider is growing decently, but not enough to turn heads.Its relative valuation of nearly 11x revenues marks it at an absurd premium over software peers.There's not much more room for the stock to go up, but plenty of room for the stock to go down.","When I last wrote on Appian (NASDAQ: APPN) - the 2017 IPO that is known for its low-code business process management software (a tool that can help businesses automate repetitive and labor-intensive tasks through rules-based software) - the company was sinking to all-time lows. After releasing strong Q3 earnings that featured 33% top-line growth, the company sank on news that it was launching a secondary offering coinciding with the expiration of its lock-up period. The price of the offering: $20.25, below the stock's trading price at the time (and obviously, below its trading price now). Shares tumbled below $20 on the news, compounded by fears that insiders would be dumping shares once their shares were freed from lockup restrictions.If only management had known that merely a month or so later, its stock would hit nearly $40! Rising 80%-plus in the since December, Appian has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market with multiple consecutive days of double-digit gains. Had the company waited until now and priced its secondary at the current market price, it could have raised ~$65 million more ($17/share appreciation since the secondary offering, times 3.8 million shares sold in the secondary). Considering the company had only $72.8 million on its most recent balance sheet and is not yet profitable, that's not an insignificant amount of capital. It didn't raise that secondary on a whim - it was out of need.Here's a look at the stock's fantastic run since December:APPN data by YChartsThe real question for investors now is: what to do with Appian? My take is: don't get greedy. If you've been fortunate enough to hold on to the stock through its period of incredible gains, now is the time to lock in those gains. Unfortunately, it seems that something of a Bitcoin-like mania has taken over Appian stock - bulls rush into the trade because they expect it to go up, come hell or high water. There is no fundamental backing for the stock's rally.Actually, there's a lot fundamentally that's not to like about the company. Yes, its 30%-plus growth is decent - but on the whole, I don't think Appian's target market is that large. It positions itself as a PaaS offering that's easy to use, but in the enterprise space, it faces stiff competition from deeper-pocketed competitors in the likes of Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) and Amazon AWS (NASDAQ: AMZN). The latter two have much deeper ecosystems, and when it comes to positioning platform offerings, the largest ecosystems tend to win out because they are more robust and future-proof.Financially, Appian also derives a large portion of its revenues from professional services fees - yikes! Technology investors buy software stocks and pay high multiples for them for their low-touch, high margin SaaS revenues - they shouldn't be endorsing a company that's essentially an IT consultant with some proprietary software products. To bring home the point on software versus services revenues - Appian makes 90% gross margins on its software revenues, but only 36% on its services revenues. The company's revenue pool is roughly half-and half between software and services, and the company's overall gross margin is in the low 60s - far worse than its SaaS competitors with gross margins in the high 70s and 80s.The company will report Q4 earnings sometime in mid-February, and there's a lot of room for Appian to disappoint here. What you have here is a company that's not exactly growing that fast, and not exactly that profitable (especially when considering its lower-than-peer average gross margins), and without a particularly exciting product. Yes, Appian has some love in the IT markets for its product, and it's a Gartner-designated Leader in Intelligent Business Process Management Suites - but so are Pegasystems (NYSE: PEGA) and IBM (NYSE: IBM), both companies that have been at it much longer than Appian, have far deeper pockets, and have longer-lived client histories. And as recently mentioned, with Salesforce's push into platform offerings (and Amazon, though it's always been there), Appian doesn't exactly have a whole greenfield market to itself with which to sustain 30% growth forever.Let's turn the discussion to Appian's valuation, which is the main red flag in the stock at the moment.Figure 1. Appian trading compsSource: author-created chart; data from public filings, revenue estimates based on extrapolation of management guidance, market caps as of close of trading on January 11Making a broadly strong assumption that the company will grow at 25%, Appian will generate roughly ~$200 million in the forward-twelve months period. With its current $2.2 billion market cap, $72.8 million of cash, and no debt, the company's enterprise value of $2.1 billion represents a ~10.8x EV/FTM revenues multiple.Any time you hear a double-digit revenue multiple, you have to approach it with skepticism. The peers in the chart are other software companies that went public in 2017, with similar revenue scale profiles. You'll notice that Appian's valuation trades several multiples above these peers, even double that of Cloudera (NASDAQ: CLDR) and Yext (NYSE: Yext).Even worse - Appian's 33% growth pales in comparison to its peers - the selection of comps presented here have an average growth of 51%. Even Yext and Cloudera, the lowest-valued among these comps, have ~40% growth that handily outstrips Appian by several points.What's even more astounding - each of these comps, in my opinion, occupies a leadership position in a software sub-vertical that is far more attractive than Appian's foothold in BPM. Yes, a stock like Alteryx has a high multiple - but how many companies are as well-respected in the niche field of data blending and integration as Alteryx is? And for an asset as high-quality as Alteryx, you have to pay ""only"" 8x revenues, a three-turn discount to Appian.The main message here: Appian has been struck by a wave of euphoria, not all too dissimilar than the crypto mania that has taken Bitcoin and Ethereum to new heights. Reality will soon sink in as the stock report Q4 earnings next month (it has a history of falling on earnings announcements).At current levels high above its peers, Appian doesn't have much more room to rise - but it does have plenty of room to fall. The risk/reward profile is wholly unappealing."

Appian's platform automates the creation of data flows, reports, records, and forms, as well as other software elements that typically require coding. Companies are able to easily design, build and implement enterprise-level applications through the platform. The company provides customer and professional support services.Its clients include transportation, manufacturing, energy, media, telecommunications, government, healthcare, and financial services organizations. The company was founded in 1999 and is headquartered in Reston, Virginia.Appian launched its cloud platform in 2007, and it continued to improve the Appian platform with its records data management technology in 2012 and its patented Self-Assembling Interface Layer, also called SAIL, in 2013. The SAIL technology enables customers to develop application immediately for deployment across a full range of desktop and mobile devices. The company introduced Quick Apps in 2016, and this product enables non-professional developers to develop web and mobile application with no coding.In 2016, Appian generated the majority of its revenue through sales of software, subscriptions, and support. To a lesser extent, the company derived revenue from the sale of perpetual software license agreements and related maintenance and support agreements. Subscriptions vary in length from one to five years, with the average being three years.Since its inception, Appian has invested in its professional services organization to help customers build and deploy applications on their platform. Appian has several strategic partnerships with companies, including Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers (NYSEARCA:PWC), and KPMG, that refers clients to Appian for professional services using the Appian platform.Financial HighlightsAppian generates the majority of revenue through subscription as well as professional services. Both revenue streams have been growing, with subscription services growing at a faster rate and accounting for a larger percentage of the total revenue (see table below). Subscription services generates a significantly higher margin, and so it is encouraging to see this growth.

Earlier in the month, Appian released Q3 earnings - which, despite accelerating growth and a beat on the top line, was treated frigidly by investors. Now, the company is preparing for a secondary offering and bracing for the impacts of its lockup expiration. Shares have lost nearly 30% from their all-time highs, as shown in the chart below:APPN data by YChartsI have mixed feelings about Appian. For the majority of its life as a public company, it's been overvalued, trading at 7-8x forward revenues despite a low-quality revenue mix, as I wrote in a previous article - Appian, unlike the majority of true ""SaaS"" companies, derives a large portion of its revenue from professional services revenue - which are the fees it gets for consulting with customers on how best to deploy its low-code platform. The whole idea of the Appian do-it-yourself, no-coding-needed BPM platform kind of gets thrown for a loop when you realize that most customers have to pay Appian consultants to stand over their shoulders to help them implement the platform first.But now, as the stock has been in tanking mode since October, it will probably bottom out sometime in the next few months in the high teens. Revenue mix aside, Appian did achieve accelerating revenue growth last quarter - from 33% in Q2 to 45% in Q3. It's operating at near breakeven margins and, as a PaaS company that provides the underlying platform for technology-enabled business processes, it's a fairly sticky product that is difficult to unplug if it's powering a bunch of business applications that hold a company together.After its pullback, Appian trades at only 5.7x EV/FTM revenues - below its peer multiple of 6x and far below its historical trading averages of 7-8x. See below a comparison of how Appian trades relative to the other software companies of 2017:Figure 1. Appian trading compsSource: author-created chart; market caps as of close of trading on November 17; financial data taken from public filings; forward revenue estimates based on extrapolation of management guidanceAppian is worth at least 6x EV/FTM revenues, implying a $21 price target. I'm shifting my bearish view on the company to a hold. If the lockup expiration drama takes the stock anywhere to the $17 level or below, Appian would be a fairly safe buy. Let's shift gears and discuss the secondary offering for a moment. The lockup expiration/secondary offering combination will probably give investors a chance to get a pullback and go in for a long position. There's precedent here: back in October, Hadoop software company Cloudera (NASDAQ: CLDR) priced its secondary offering at $16.45 (below the stock's current trading price) right as its lockup expiration was coming around the corner, just as Appian is doing now.Why a company would price an offering - even a small one for a couple million shares (in Appian's case, it's about 7% of the company) - below its current market price is beyond me. It causes the price to tank and is basically an admission that the stock price is overvalued and worth no more. Since pricing its secondary at $16.45, Cloudera has tumbled and hovered near the secondary price without recovering:CLDR data by YChartsAppian is likely to follow the same pattern. There will be plenty of selling pressure in November as the floodgates are released on November 21 and insiders can sell their shares for the first time.According to Appian's S-1, 52.4 million shares will become available for sale when the lockup period expires. That's an astonishing 87% of Appian's market cap that will suddenly be for sale, causing temporary instability in the share price. Appian has done extremely well since its IPO at $12, after all - even after the recent pullback, it's nearly doubled since going public. A lot of the execs who have their wealth tied up in Appian stock can finally access liquidity for the first time - and Novak Biddle Venture Partners and New Enterprise Associates, its largest backers who collectively own ~35% of the company, can lock in their gains. Lockup-induced selling pressure will be large in November, and if the Cloudera pattern follows, pessimism will roll over into December and maybe even January as well. If Appian dips as low as $17, that represents a 4.75x EV/FTM revenues multiple - which is unsustainable for a stock that was once a hot commodity. And while the stock probably won't ever reach the near-$30 range in a year or more, it can definitely return to the low $20s - especially if its quarterly outperformance continues.Watch for buying opportunities as Appian continues to rollercoaster in the following month or two. Appian is setting itself up to be a fallen angel that will bottom out and make for a great rebound play."
4077402,25120,2017-05-30T11:48:33-04:00,"Appian's public offering has been a success.Investors do not seem to mind the slower pace of growth and increasing operating losses as of late.While relative sales multiples look reasonable at 5 times' bookings, I think that Appian has a lot to prove at this valuation.","Appian (APPN) has made a successful debut last week, as shares were in demand in the trading sessions, which followed its IPO. Appian offers companies and other non-commercial organizations a platform from which corporate applications can be developed, without the need to have extensive coding knowledge.These applications allow companies to make the transition towards the digital world, and are in demand in this environment. While growth is reasonable, I am not that impressed with the (lack of) operating leverage displayed in recent times.The BusinessAppian describes itself as a so-called low-code software development platform, which allows companies and organizations to develop both powerful and unique applications, needed to fulfill their digital transformation. The company is relatively old for a software IPO as it was formed by four founders back in 1999. Each of these founders are still actively engaged in the management of the business.The main benefit of Appian's platform is the fact that companies can easily build custom-made applications, which require little to no coding, thereby allowing notably smaller organizations to cut significantly on development costs. These applications are used to automate workflows, aid project development and build procurement systems, among others.Appian's platform automatically translates creation of forms, records, and flows into data, which reduces the development process. With the company's Self-Assembling Interface Layer (NYSE:SAIL), these applications can be deployed across mobile, desktop and tablets, without requiring customization regarding different screen sizes.At the end of 2016, Appian claimed to serve 280 customers, of which 225 were commercial entities. The company reported a near 20% increase in revenues last year, as sales have increased to $132.9 million. Roughly half of these sales are derived from ""professional services"" which are mostly related to starting a new customer up and providing support along the way.Subscription revenues, which are expected to comprise the majority of future total revenues, were up 45% last year to $60.0 million. The portion of subscription revenues for customers who have been acquired 3 years ago makes up 90% of total revenues derived from those customers, demonstrating the shift to a subscription-based business model.Growth is driven by the benefits of the Appian platform, which requires little to no coding knowledge, while traditional software packages are too specific and inadequate to help in the digital transition. Of course, it does not hurt to spend a considerable sum on sales and marketing efforts as well in order to boost the top line results.The OfferingAppian priced 6.25 million shares at $12 apiece, raising $75 million in gross proceeds in the process. The IPO took place right in the middle of the preliminary offering range of $11-$13 per share. Following strong aftermarket trading, shares have risen to $17 per share. With nearly 59 million shares outstanding, that values the company at a billion dollars. The company will operate with a net cash position of roughly $75 million following the IPO, roughly equivalent to the proceeds of the offering. That values operating assets at around $925 million.As discussed above, Appian has grown its total sales by 20% in 2016 to $132.9 million. Solid growth did go hand in hand with increasing losses, as operating losses widened from $4.8 million in 2015 to $11.4 million last year. As such, offering proceeds will be necessary and used to finance current losses. Based on the 2016 revenue number, the operating assets are valued at roughly 7 times' sales.Total revenue growth has slowed down to little over 6% in the first quarter of 2017 as revenues came in at $38.3 million. The moderating pace of growth comes as lower margin professional service revenues fell by 17% to $16.9 million. The lucrative subscription, software and other revenues were up 37% year on year to $21.4 million, actually accelerating from the 27% growth rate in Q4.Disappointing is the lack of sales leverage and quality of growth. While the company benefited from overall revenue growth and the shift in the mix, which allowed gross margins to increase by 8 points to 67% of sales, the company posted an operating loss of $3.5 million. This compares to a $1.2 million profit in the first quarter of last year.This loss can largely be blamed on a 52% jump in sales and marketing efforts, costing the company $17 million over the past three months.That being said, the subscription-based model understates current revenue growth. Backlog was up $56 million in 2016, which suggests that bookings came in at $190 million last year. At this valuation, that values the modestly loss-making business at 5 times' annual bookings.Final Thoughts, Avoid For MeThe risks for this billion-dollar company are evident. The company is losing money, which combined with this market valuation creates risks. Other risk include the dual class stock structure, which gives ""regular"" shareholders not their fair share of voting power.Additional risks include the road to profitability and a continuation of the pace of subscription-based sales growth, as probably the biggest risk is competition from sizable players. Appian has to compete with the likes of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and established players like IBM (NYSE:IBM), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), among others.While the 5 times' booking number looks reasonable, in comparison to other SAAS-businesses, I am not that impressed with the pace of growth given the still relatively limited size of the company, and the big increase in marketing efforts. Another big risk is the fact that if Appian succeeds in making its customer make the digital transformation, they might become so big that they employ their own programmers, which makes that Appian could lose its biggest customers over time."
4107751,103480,2017-09-18T15:33:26-04:00,"Appian went public on May 25 at $12/share and traded up 25% on its first day to $15.Since then, elevated hype for the stock has sent shares to >$25.The company's low-code app development platform is a hit with customers, but faces stiff competition against larger PaaS offerings from Salesforce, Pegasystems, and ServiceNow.Trading above 8x forward revenues, Appian is an expensive stock especially considering its muted growth profile relative to other recent software IPO peers.","Appian (NASDAQ:APPN) is one of tech's success stories this year. After filing a small $75 million IPO and selling 6.25 million shares at $12 each, shares quickly traded up to $15 in Day 1 and have been on an unstoppable climb since. The buzz surrounding the company is incredible, with both customers and investors praising Appian's ability to turn non-technical employees into developers, using its low-code app development platform.The below chart shows Appian's phenomenal public market performance since its IPO. After beginning its public life as a relatively small-cap company, the stock has since shot up 72% and now carries a market cap of $1.6 billion.APPN data by YChartsIs Appian the best thing since sliced bread? Or will it eventually face growth pressures and competitive squeezing like the majority of its software peers?Appian is a leading vendor in a sphere of software known as BPM, or business process management. BPM software seeks to take the many processes and functions we incur in our daily work routines across a variety of functions and disciplines and make them more efficient and seamless via software. The trick is that, prior to low-code platforms like Appian's, companies had limited IT resources to dedicate to automating and digitizing every function's work processes. Appian claims to turn that upside down, by allowing line-of-business users to design their own custom applications for their own personalized workflows, without needing to involve IT.Despite the rosy rhetoric coming out of Appian's narrative, I believe the stock has reached a temporary peak. While Appian's low-code development product has doubtlessly gained a foothold in the enterprise technology market, the company is forecasting only 22% y/y growth in FY17 - a far cry below other recent IPO peers who are projecting to achieve growth in excess of 30% or 40%. Appian's elevated multiple is unsustainable - and until it shows it can accelerate its growth further, I would prefer to stay on the sidelines for the stock to cool down.With BPM software, the keyword is ""software-enabled digital transformation."" Think about the cadence of tasks you perform in your day-to-day job: how many of those offline tasks could be made paperless, or more efficient, or automated entirely via software? This is the use case Appian is addressing, across a variety of verticals and functions. In its marketing documents, Appian claims that low-code developers have used the tool to streamline component procurement and speed up drug development.In theory, every company could create these technology-enabled solutions without Appian - they can just send in their IT teams to sit down with lines of business, listen to their specific pain points, and build custom software to speed up workflows. Indeed, this is the standard practice at many established companies, even technology companies. But this approach has two limitations:This is where Appian (and its competitors) come in: offering app development platforms that allow non-technical users to create custom-designed applications with intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces. The non-technical, line-of-business users generally understand their pain points and requirements much better than IT anyway - so if they were given the tools to build their own applications, they would have a higher hit rate of getting it right.The below screenshot from Appian's S-1 shows what Appian's user interface looks like. Using drag-and-drop controls, line-of-business users can create an application that intelligently routes an otherwise complex workflow:Figure 1. Appian UI exampleAppian's offering is considered Platform-as-a-Service, or PaaS - a cloud-delivered tool for creating applications. Forrester, an industry analysis firm, believes the market for low-code development platforms is $3.9 billion in 2017 and will grow to $15.5 billion in 2020. Another leading industry analyst, Gartner, however, places Appian in the lower-growth BPM category, which it calculates at $4.4 billion in 2017 and growing to only $5.0 billion in 2020.The below infographic, taken from Appian's S-1, shows how the platform is intended to be used (read it from bottom-up). Low-code developers, leveraging the enterprise's data residing across on-premise datacenters, cloud, and inside applications, can transform the data into rich applications, which can be delivered to business users on desktop or mobile.Figure 2. Appian use case infographicLike the rest of its cloud peers, Appian sells its product primarily via recurring contract subscriptions, priced per user. Typical contract durations range anywhere from one to five years, with three years being the average. For customers who aren't keen to deploy Appian in the cloud, the company also offers term licenses for on-premise datacenters for specified contract lengths. Perpetual licenses are also available, although these are more rare - as most buyers in the cloud era aren't keen on making heavy upfront IT investments.Appian reports a 95% gross subscription renewal rate (excluding upsets), indicating only 5% churn - which is sturdy, but in line with the churn rates of other enterprise software peers. Appian's dollar-based retention rate, which does include upsell and expansions, stood at 112% at the end of 2016 and 120% as of the most recent quarter, 2Q17.What makes Appian relatively unattractive compared to the majority of its software peers, however, is that a large portion (approximately half) of its revenue base is derived from professional services - basically one-time consulting fees paid to Appian to set up the product. Service revenues are very low-margin, as the company often performs this consultative work at cost, only to get customers in the door. Typical services engagements last 2-6 months, front-loaded toward the beginning of a customer's initial deployment with Appian.While Appian believes services revenues will become a minor part of the business in its long-term model, the fact that Appian derives a disproportionate amount of revenues from professional services is ironic for a company that touts the do-it-yourself nature of its low-code platform.Like other software companies, Appian employs a large direct sales force, with sales and marketing spend consuming 40% of revenues. A network of partners and resellers also sells Appian solutions via the indirect channel and performs consulting and professional services on its behalf. One positive indicator to look out for as Appian scales is if it can manage to ramp up its partner channel - as these third parties often take on the bulk of the lower-margin services work, Appian would benefit greatly from offloading this work to partners while maintaining service availability to give customers more comfort in buying the software.Appian counted 280 customers in its installed base as of December 2016, with 55 of those customers being government or non-profit entities. The chart below shows some of Appian's marquee clients:Figure 3. Appian customersAppian's growth has trended slower relative to its startup peers in enterprise IT. Revenue of $132.9 million in FY16 grew only 20% from the prior year. At the $100 million scale, it's not uncommon for a software company to grow in excess of 40%. See Appian's summary financials below:Figure 4. Appian income statementPart of the reason Appian is being weighed down, as aforementioned earlier in the article, is its reliance on slow-growing services revenues. Subscription revenues grew 32% in 2016 while services revenues grew just a hair, only 9%.Services revenues are also much less valuable to the company - providing only 32% of gross margin, compared to subscription's 89% gross margin. When factoring in unallocated administrative and marketing costs, service revenues generally come at a loss to the company.For a company in the 20% growth range, we would generally like to see some margin improvement and a path to profitability, but Appian fails to deliver in this regard as well. The lack of margin improvement is easy to see in the common-size income statement presented below:Figure 5. Appian marginsWe can forgive the increase in sales and marketing costs, as sales spending is of utmost importance for growth. Likewise, we can forgive the increased R&D expense, as technology leadership is essential to capture IT mindshare and dominate a market. Where Appian disappoints is its spike in general and administrative costs - there's no excuse for a company to sprawl in its admin and exec spending if its growth is falling short.Now, let's turn to Appian's most recent results - the company reported its first earnings as a public company in early August, delivering upside in Q2:Figure 6. Appian Q2 resultsRevenue growth accelerated to 32%, significantly higher than FY16 growth of 20%, and perhaps buoyed by the buzz generated in the IPO (as well as the additional cash firepower provided by IPO proceeds).Diving into the revenue components, however, leads to some more disappointment - the large portion of the growth was in professional services revenues, which are neither recurring nor profitable. Appian can't seem to shake its reliance on services revenues, and with Q2 revenues comprising of 49% services revenues, Appian seems unable of making good on its promise of shifting its revenue base toward more reliable subscription revenues.Nor did margins improve, with every component of operating spend spiking. Sales and marketing grew to 53% of revenues (up 10 points from 43% in 2Q16), R&D grew to 23% of revenue (up 7 points from 16% in 2Q16), and worst of all, general and administrative spend grew to 20% of revenue (up 7 points from 13% in 2Q16). As a result, operating losses ballooned to a -34% margin, down from -14% in the prior year quarter.The company burned through $6 million of cash (operating cash flow of -$5.8 million, plus $0.2 million of capex). While this is nominally a slim number, it's not a meaningless chunk of the company's $77.7 million of cash on the balance sheet (most of which, by the way, was raised in IPO proceeds, not through operating profits, of which there are none).Guidance also left more to be desired. Though the company grew 32% in Q2, Appian guided to only $162.3-163.5 million of revenue for FY17, or 22% growth at the midpoint.This leads to a rather grim conclusion: the Q2 acceleration was more of a one-time event, and the company is forecasting a slower back half of the year, which is traditionally the stronger half for most software companies. Given this lackluster guidance and the mix tilt toward services revenues, it's a small miracle that Wall Street treated Appian's Q2 as a beat, despite the one-off uptick in revenue growth.Appian doesn't exist in a vacuum: though its solutions are admittedly useful products in the enterprise toolkit, it's not alone. Its two primary competitors in the low-code platform space are Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) App Cloud and ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) Now Platform.Both companies are cloud juggernauts, and both are favorites of customers. Both companies also have more resources in their war chests than Appian: ServiceNow generates $1.8 billion in revenues and has $2.0 billion in cash; Salesforce generates $10 billion in revenue and has $3.5 billion in cash. While these companies have large product portfolios and don't focus only on BPM and PaaS, it wouldn't be inaccurate to say these companies are in a different league than Appian.App Cloud and Now Platform are marketed in almost the same way as Appian's platform. Now Platform claims ""anyone from business users to developers can easily build intuitive applications,"" while App Cloud says ""You can quickly deliver innovative apps with quality UX by using reusable building blocks."" Drag-and-drop development features are not unique to Appian.While Appian's brand is more solidly centered around its BPM platform, the selection of software tools is often a matter of preference or intuitive feel, and with 3+ major players in this niche discipline, Appian will have a more difficult time cornering the market.With all of Appian's flaws, it certainly isn't helpful that it trades at one of the highest valuations in the software sector at 8.5x forward revenues. See below a comparison of Appian versus its peers in the software IPO class of 2017:Figure 7. Appian trading compsNote on methodology: market cap based on close of trading on September 15; balance sheet figures taken from most recent quarter; margins and OCF taken from last full fiscal year; forward revenues based on extrapolation of management guidanceAppian trades a turn higher than its already-elevated peer average, despite showing a much lower growth profile than all of its 2017 IPO peers. The only thing that could be said about Appian is that its operating loss was thinner in its last fiscal year, but remember, its losses have ballooned post-IPO.Buying Appian stock is like purchasing a Camry at the price of a Lexus. Much higher quality companies can be had for better value. In this particular group of recent IPOs, I'm partial toward Alteryx and Cloudera. Appian is the last company in this group I would turn to for a bullish position.An appropriate multiple that rewards Appian for its technology leadership, while at the same time factoring in its lower growth profile and dependence on low-margin services revenues would be 6x. This implies a price target of $19 for the stock.By no means is Appian a bad company - it has earned the love of its customers, is still growing (albeit at a slower pace), and has earned a steady reputation in a niche area of enterprise software.It's just not a good stock to buy, given its expensive valuation that is traditionally reserved for companies with better fundamental performance.Appian is scheduled to report Q3 earnings in the first week of November, and unless the company can deliver a blowout quarter and meaningfully increase its guidance, the stock is bound to unwind some of its undeserved gains."
4120068,103480,2017-11-03T10:04:40-04:00,"Appian, the low-code software development platform, reported a decent Q3 that appeared to beat analyst estimates.Revenue growth accelerated to 45% y/y, up from 33% y/y in Q2.Much of the growth, however, was led by low-margin professional services, while subscription revenues showed meaningful deceleration.With more and more of its revenue leaning into one-time service fees, Appian can't be valued like a SaaS company.Appian's lockup expiration, set to occur on 11/21, is a major negative catalyst facing the stock.","Beat, raise, yawn. That's how investors should react to Appian's (NASDAQ: APPN) Q3 print instead of buying shares on the basis of low-quality revenue growth.Revenue isn't created equal, and most savvy investors (especially those dedicated to the technology industry) understand this. We saw an example of this with Twitter (NYSE: TWTR), when the social media giant's CFO noted on an earnings call two quarters ago that each dollar that Twitter generates from data licensing revenue is roughly 3x more valuable than advertising revenues, because of stronger margins on the latter.Appian - which generates revenue from both self-service, SaaS software (the ""good"" kind of revenues) as well as service and implementation fees for basically consulting customers on how to use the software (the less profitable revenue stream) - is kind of in the same boat, with dual revenue streams of unequal true value. More on this later when we dissect Appian's results. Appian has been one of the better-performing IPOs of 2017, which kicked off on the NASDAQ in May at a price of $12/share. Shares popped in their first day of trading and have rewarded investors handsomely in the past few months: APPN data by YChartsAppian, however, faces a major near-term headwind: the expiration of its lock-up period. With shares having doubled from their IPO price, insiders will likely be chomping at the bit to lock in some of their gains, creating selling pressure on the stock. According to NASDAQ, Appian's lock-up period will expire on November 21, and the stock will likely face some turbulence in the days and weeks leading up to it. This quarter's earnings were only spectacular if you glossed over it - reading into the details, there's not too much to be excited about. Importantly, investors had a muted reaction to ServiceNow's (NASDAQ: NOW) earnings as well, a large-cap competitor to Appian, and some of this lack of enthusiasm could carry over into Appian as well. Appian is a stock to be avoided. Its headline growth figures require a little asterisk, and its current trading valuation of 7x EV/FTM revenues valuation - well and above the average for software peers - treats Appian as if it's a pure SaaS company. With professional services fees comprising of half of its revenue base, Appian certainly isn't true SaaS.Not the right kind of growth. That's the key takeaway that investors should draw from Appian's earnings. Wall Street these days is pushing technology companies to become more self-service (aka, more ""SaaS"") and generate as much recurring revenue as possible from low-touch services. Appian - which derives half of its revenues from professional services fees - is in clear violation of this dictum.In Appian's S-1 filing, it notes that: In the boilerplate ""Risk Factors"" section of the S-1, Appian even lists a failure to shift toward subscriptions and away from professional services as one of its key fundamental risks.In FY16, subscription revenues of $70.0 million were only 53% of the total revenue pool of $132.9 million. In 3Q17, Appian reported subscription revenues of $22.7 million - or 51% of the total revenue base. Instead of increasing the subscription mix, Appian has done the reverse and leaned in to services revenues.Why does it matter - growth is growth, right? Well, not really. In Q3, Appian's gross costs for delivery of its SaaS subscriptions was only $2.3 million, indicating a subscription gross margin of 90% - a best-in-class margin. Professional services, however, carried a vastly inferior gross margin - only 36%. After taking into account operating costs, Appian is essentially giving away professional services for free.The margin delta is clearly laid out in this chart, taken from Appian's earnings deck. Evidently, low professional services margins are dragging down the company's overall margins:Figure 1. Appian margin differentialsSoftware companies trade at such high multiples of revenue because those revenues are essentially seen as profits. When revenues carry an 80-90% gross margin, after all, revenue multiples are very similar to standard profit multiples. Most software companies do include professional services as part of their product package and have it as a component of their revenue base. But most software companies still generate 80% or more of their revenues from self-service, high margin SaaS software - not just half. With Appian so heavily anchored on low-margin services revenues, it doesn't deserve to trade at its ~7x multiple. It's only half a software company, and half a consultancy.Revenue trends went the wrong way in Q3. Total revenue of $44.65 million (+45% y/y) beat analyst consensus of $40.9 million, but in the wrong places (it's like adding weight - it can be good or bad, depending on where the weight is gained).Figure 2. Appian revenue growth and mixAppian's subscription revenues of $20.7 million grew 35% y/y, decelerating from 38% y/y growth in Q2. Professional services revenues, on the other hand, grew 68% y/y and accelerated over 40% y/y in Q2.Let's be clear on one thing: professional services revenue isn't bad. It's still cash flowing through the door. It's just not nearly as valuable as subscription revenues. Based on the margin deltas between the two, growth in subscription revenue is 3x more valuable than growth in services. Appian's revenue growth of 45% was an acceleration over Q2's 33%, though it was driven entirely by acceleration in services. The +6% earnings reaction to Appian's stock would have been completely justified if subscription revenue had driven the acceleration; instead, subscription revenues decelerated. This alone should have, in all fairness, made the earnings reaction flat or negative.Subscriptions were 51% of the revenue mix in Q3, as previously discussed; and that's down from 57% in 3Q16 and 53% at the end of FY16. Clearly, the revenue mix is trending the wrong way.This has real profitability implications as well - net losses widened to $6.3 million in Q3, greater than losses of $4.7 million in 3Q17. While this quarter's net margin improved y/y, driven by greater sales and marketing efficiency, companies at a 40%+ growth rate should typically be able to capture more operating leverage and improve margins more substantially. Appian, on the contrary, is held back by its revenue mix that translates into weaker overall gross margins.With the lockup expiration fast approaching toward the end of November, Appian's stock looks like it's teetering on a dangerous high. The +6% earnings reaction was a quick, gut reaction to a quarter that, on the surface, looked good. Fundamentally, however, Appian has not advanced toward its long-term goals (self-defined in its own S-1) of becoming a more self-service SaaS company, the kind that Wall Street values most.With the company trading at ~7x EV/FTM revenues, there's no reason to be bullish now. Thematically, Appian is appealing - it brings the power of software automation, no coding expertise needed, to a wide swath of enterprises. It still has a lot of work to do, however, in becoming a true cloud SaaS company that can scale effortlessly through subscription expansions, instead of relying on headcount-intensive professional services."

Appian generated total revenues of $132,923,000 for the year that ended on Dec. 31, 2016. By contrast, it had total revenues of $111,204,000 for the year that ended on Dec. 31, 2015, and of $88,986,000 for the year that ended on Dec. 31, 2014. The company posted net losses during each of those years, reporting that it had losses of $13,318,000, $7,848,000 and $17,915,000 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.The company identifies several risk factors. It indicates that it has grown substantially in the last few years and may not be able to effectively manage its growth. The company also reports that if it is unable to continue growing its revenue, it may not become profitable. Appian is also dependent on one product, and if its use declines, the company could suffer substantial harm. The company has not determined how it will allocate its net proceeds from the IPO, but it states that it will use them for general corporate purposes and other capital purposes. It also intends to repay some of its debts.CompetitorsAppian identifies numerous competitors, including Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), IBM (NYSE:IBM), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and others. It reports that its competitors include three categories, including other low-code providers, business management and case management providers and custom solution providers.If APPN prices at the midpoint of its proposed range as described in the introduction, and using sales from the last twelve months, APPN could have a P/S of 5.3x.Conclusion: Consider a Modest AllocationAppian has shown revenue growth in the past few years, but the rate appears to be slowing. It has posted successive losses and has not been profitable. The company also has substantial competition from a number of other companies.Despite these risks, the founding team is very strong, and APPN is Goldman-led; we have observed these deals to be quite popular and hear the deal is already oversubscribed. Key referral partnerships with Deloitte, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers are also encouraging.We suggest investors consider a modest portion of this IPO.Don Dion's IPO Insights provides up-to-date information and analysis on the major IPOs each week, along with additional opportunities to invest and short these stocks at their quiet period and lockup period expirations, respectively.

After the IPO, he will own 48.9% of common stock but will have voting shares totaling 54.1%, so will retain control over the company post-IPO.CommentaryThe market for helping businesses to improve their process via software is growing substantially. According to a 2016 report by MarketsandMarkets, global BPM is expected to from $7 billion in 2016 to $13.52 billion in 2021, a CAGR of 14.2%, which is significant.The APAC region is expected grow most quickly by geography; from an industry filter, the banking & financial sectors are forecasted to grow most quickly.Appian has significant competition from large, entrenched players including:ServiceNow and Salesforce are considered direct competitors, as their solutions are also considered ‘low-code’ type systems.One competitive disadvantage that Appian has is that it is effectively a standalone BPM system Other major players such as Oracle, SAP, and IBM have the option to ‘bundle’ their BPM offering with a larger database, ERP or related suite, thus competing very effectively on price as well as providing an integrated system that is more uniform across functions.Appian has been growing revenue, but growth rates are falling:1Q 2017: $38.3 million, 6.3% increase vs. prior2016: $132.9 million, 20% increase vs. prior2015: $111.2 million, 25% increase vs. priorGross margins are high and growing, and the company swung to cash flow from operations positive in 1Q 2017, so those are two mitigating factors.Slowing topline revenue growth rates are a major concern since IPO buyers acquire these types of company offerings because of their growth prospects. If those growth prospects are dimming, then valuation will suffer.And what to expect six months after IPO, when the typical lock-up period ends? Unless Appian reignites its growth rate, I expect significant downward pressure on its stock.And then there is the Class A & B share structure. This is being done more commonly by technology startups where the founders want to retain control. It stems from many venture capitalists who believe that tech companies tend to do better when founders stay in control.That may very well be while they are private, but according to a recent study by Edward Kamonjoh of Institutional Shareholder Services, the results indicated that public companies with a dual class structure underperformed on the basis of:So, with Appian, given its deteriorating topline revenue growth rate, dual share class structure and significant marketplace competition, my opinion is to AVOID the IPO.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

4187794,21815,2018-07-17T13:41:29-04:00,"The company grows at an impressive pace and we believe this is likely to continue as there are plenty of opportunities to add revenue streams.We are also not too worried about the competition, the company could even increase prices.However, the shares are fully valued, there is virtually no operational leverage, the cash bleed is substantial and the road to profitability long.","Appian (APPN) operates in the BPM (business process management) market where it provides simple ('drag-and-drop') solutions to streamline and automate processes. The shares have had a good performance recently:However, while revenues are growing, operationally there isn't much to celebrate, at least not yet:APPN Revenue (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsThat isn't necessarily a disaster if the company continues to prioritize growth over short-term profitability, so we'll have to look at the specifics. The company is based on a PaaS (platform as a service) model, but also offers on premise licenses. During the Q1CC management concisely set out what they believe is their competitive advantage:Despite the simple nature of its solutions, the company relies to a substantial amount on services which are basically a help for customers to set up the product. These services make up almost half of revenues and while they are necessary, they generate much lower margins and are also growing slower. Here is the revenue development split out (from the earnings deck): Subscription revenue is rising at a solid pace (from the earnings deck):With respect to the service income, the company is making two changes:We have yet to see the impact of these changes though. Customers tend to spend far more on services in the first year than afterwards, so service income growth is simply a function of adding new customers.While the company set out as a platform for their customers to build and configure applications, the company is now itself doing this. This is perhaps the main reason why we (and investors in general) really like the these platform business models so much, as it gives the companies so many opportunities to generate new revenue streams. In Q1 management announced two new applications:While the callcenter application is the first app the company is marketing, it does have other up and cross-sell opportunities (like their RPA orchestration functionality) which produce a net dollar retention rate of 119%. Other SA authors are making much of the competition, but we are actually a little less concerned here. Competitors are App Cloud ServiceNow (NOW) Open Text (OTEX) and Salesforce (CRM).The company seems to be able to grow pretty rapidly despite competition, and they're landing some big name customers like Goldman Sachs, Aviva, HCSC, KKR and the like. The company is doing especially well in the financial vertical. What's more, they're actually raising prices, competition can't be that bad if you can grow at 35% annually and raise prices in the process.The difference between their subscriptions and services is rather obvious:There isn't yet much operational leverage. While total revenues increased by 35%, non-GAAP operating expenses increased by 34% to $39M:APPN Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThe increasing cash bleed isn't terribly surprising, given the stage of development, but it's also not very reassuring even if management argues it's lumpy so this quarter might have been especially bad. As one can see, the company lost nearly $13M in cash in one quarter and has just $60.8M left on the books. Then there is substantial share based compensation and dilution to boot:APPN Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsThe FY 2018 guidance is actually raisedAPPN EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsIt's par for the course that we have a SaaS (although, in this case a PaaS) business software platform company growing revenues at 35% a year having a 10x sales multiple. We've seen worse.It's an interesting company, and while we believe the shares are fully valued at the moment, we do see upside in the medium-term future. We think that the company has a considerable growth trajectory ahead of it, and the business model adds numerous options to add to these. The idea of offering their own build apps is especially intriguing and we hope this isn't a one-off. However the company's cash bleed, lack of operating leverage and long path to profitability make us believe there are better platform stocks out there."

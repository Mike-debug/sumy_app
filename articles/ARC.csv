(NYSE:ARC), a small digital printing and graphics imaging company, will remind you why you fell in love with investing, i.e. finding those undiscovered small companies that fell on hard times when no one was looking and few believe that they will come back and regain their lost glory.As a small investor, one has an edge over large institutions in opportunities like these since a lot of institutional investors don't have a mandate to invest in stocks trading below $5 or micro caps.Last week, ARC Document announced that results for the third quarter would be stronger than previously expected. But the announcement was more significant than a usual pre-announcement on the upside. It highlighted the turnaround that was first sighted during the second quarter numbers is firmly established, with revenue growing by 9% sequentially and EBITDA growing over the third quarter last year as well as sequentially.Now that there aren't any threats to the survival of the business, this might be a good time to look at the opportunities that the company can monetize, especially with strong cash flows, a decent balance sheet, and a growing topline.I'm as dismissive about micro-cap value traps as any other investor who's been burned by one, ever in their careers. The key question is whether the 'return on invested brain damage', a term coined by Bill Ackman, is worth it? And in this case, the answer is a firm yes.This one is interesting for a few reasons and the top one is because the business has already turned the corner and growing while generating decent cash flows.Second, the valuation at which the stock is trading is just ridiculous. At the current enterprise value of approximately $95-100 million, the stock is trading near 2x EV/ adjusted EBITDA and 5 times EV/ cash flow from operations during the last quarter. Yes, you read it right, quarter, and not a year.Third, the company has done buybacks and paid dividends in the past and open to the idea of transferring cash back to shareholders.Four, the company is playing it responsibly with the newfound power, i.e. cash. Instead of opting for short-term measures to boost the stock via a hefty dividend or a big buyback that may end up limiting liquidity, management is building a balance sheet, something that always comes in handy in an industry where small local players constitute a big portion of the market and struggling.Just a few months back, the company was struggling for survival. The pandemic hit when the management was busy restructuring the business that was in a secular decline with traditional digital printing and graphics imaging companies with physical store presence facing pressure from digital entrants while competing with local vendors on pricing. The stock that traded near $10, 5-6 years ago, was struggling to stay above $1, resulting in delisting threats.But the business seems to have overcome all three of the major threats, i.e. survival of the business, delisting, and decelerating revenue base.The new ARC is a business that is generating $280 million (Q3 annualized), with 32% gross margins, 15% adjusted EBITDA margins, and decent free cash flow, given the business requires limited capital expenditure, $1.5 million last quarter.Continued listing on the NYSE would require the stock to trade above $1 for 30 days before the end of the current year and looking at the fundamentals, it might not be too difficult to achieve the same, especially after the company delivers results next week.Valuation and cash flows are of limited interest for investors when yields are close to all-time lows, which is why I waited to enter the stock till the business is back to growing its top line again.Yes, one quarter doesn't make the trend, even if the performance was during the worst phase in the history of the industry, but what got me excited were sustainable growth catalysts, namelyNew verticalsJust like Cloud, streaming, gaming, and social media benefitted from lockdown in the digital space, signage printing and graphic industry have benefited from Covid-19-related precautions in the physical world, with a huge increase in notices and signage posted for social distancing, disinfectants, safety, etc., in all physical locations.Growing use of signs in the physical world. Image source: ARC Document SolutionsARC Document Solutions used to be heavily dependent upon architectural, construction, and workplace markets, but post-pandemic, there is a significant jump in business from healthcare facilities, schools, grocery stores, car dealers, real estate managers, shopping malls, etc. Besides growth, the change will help the company diversify its revenue base as well.A bigger share of the customer walletAnother favorable trend for the company, post-pandemic, will be the customers, especially large ones, opting for tech-savvy players with a national presence who can deliver large orders to all their locations, efficiently and remotely.Launching creative new products. Source: ARC Document SolutionsARC Document has already launched touchless printing and converted most of its print ordering systems to the web and mobile apps, which combined with nationwide delivery and a footprint of 190 locations will pose a serious challenge to small local players in the post-Covid world.On top of that, the company now, with an improved balance sheet, will have resources to compete by offering creative products and quick turnaround times.Opportunity to lead consolidationEven though the management has made it clear that acquiring small players will not be a great use of capital right now, but there is no denying that the industry will churn out the weak players over the coming months and ARC, if the current performance momentum continues, will be in a position of strength.Even if the company avoids acquiring competitors, building a bigger portfolio of related services can also help create value for the shareholders.Disclosure: We are Long ARC Document Solutions Inc. stock.

4325835,104333,2020-02-20T16:14:35-05:00,ARC is a small company that is transforming its document solutions business from physical print into digital.The company has steadily deleveraged its balance sheet over the last decade with a stable Free Cash Flow of around 25 million annually.With an enterprise value of $99 million the company trades at EV/FCF of only 4x.The new dividend program combined with ongoing deleveraging should provide investors with good catalysts for a large share price appreciation.In this article I argue ARC is at least 80-140% undervalued.,"ARC Document Solutions (ARC) is a small company operating in the printing business and. Furthermore, it also helps company's effectively manage their digital and physical 'documents'. Up till 2012 the company was known as American Reprographics Company. With the declining importance of the Reprographics technology the company has branched out into new services to offset the revenue decline in its original segment. In this article I will argue that ARC has not gotten enough credit from investors during this transformation. I belief ARC is grossly undervalued and should at least trade a 100% higher.In this article I will first give a short overview of the company's business and its ongoing transformation. Secondly, I will offer an overview of the company's financials. This will include a discussion of ARC's lease arrangements, which are rather difficult. Thirdly, I will discuss ARC's valuation and the possible risks to the bull thesis.In short we can say that ARC is in the business of helping other companies effectively manage their documents, whether they are physical, digital or both. They help companies archive, print, organize, locate and distribute their documents in a variety of ways. While it is quite difficult to pinpoint exactly what they do a few example should help you get an idea:-They can help a small business owner outsource all his physical printing to ARC and then help him archiving all his important documents in the cloud-They sell a variety of printing and imaging equipment to a business that has just opened a new office. ARC also manages the printing and imaging for this new location.-ARC designs and prints banners and other advertising products for a retail company that wants to update its brand image.-The company provides a construction company with detailed high-quality blueprints to effectively manage the project while also enabling that these documents are readily available online to the workers. On top of that ARC produces the construction signage to advertise the work the construction company is doing.These are just but a few examples of what ARC does. I would advise readers to have a look at their website. In my opinion a quick and easy way to see the wide scope of ARC's activities.(Source: Company's website)The most important part of ARC's business is the architectural, engineering, construction and building owner/operator (AEC/O) industry. This was ARC's main industry when it solely operated in the reprographics printing business. As this business is being replaced by different digital technologies the company has transformed its offering as well to retain their AEC/O customers. They are really trying to corner this part of the market by offering companies an extensive range of services. They have more than a 190 offices in North America and provide a lot of their services on site. I think this overview the company gives in its 10-K explains well why investors can be confident in ARC's ability to serve this market in the future:(Source: company's 10-K filling, 2018)It is indeed of great importance that ARC is able to serve the AEC/O industry well since it derives almost 80% of its revenue from this industry. Focusing on this specific industry has served the company quite well though over the last decade.Frankly, ARC's financial position is quite straightforward except for its lease arrangements. In one sentence we can describe ARC's financials as follows: Successfully stabilized the business after plenty of M&A while rapidly repaying its debt.During the big housing bubble that caused the great recession, ARC flourished up till its fiscal 2008. This is not surprising since the AEC/O industry was of course the great beneficiary of the enormous demand for housing. When the crisis hit and the bubble deflated so did ARC's financial performance. Companies that survived the great recession cut costs relentlessly and tried to use new technologies to offset exactly the services ARC usually sold them. In short we can say that the last 10-years ARC has been reinventing its business by incorporating new services and technology into its offerings to remain relevant as a supplier of its ""document solutions"".(Source: Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings, (2019) outlook based on own predictions and guidance given by company. All figures are in millions of dollar)However, investors have been skeptical of ARC's transformation if we look at the company's share price:(Source: SeekingAlpha)The company hit an all-time low of $1.07 a share a few months ago and is currently at a meager $1.20 a share. This gives the company a market cap of just 55 million. I get why investors are not enthusiastic about a company that had 700 million in sales in 2008 while it has been doing around 400 million ever since. However, as seems the case more often than not with these kind of companies, investors have become most bearish when actually the company's financials are currently the best they have been since 2008. If we look at the cash flow statement we see that the company has generated steady Free Cash Flow of around $25-30 million for the last 5-years. It is on track to repeat that performance in 2019. This has enabled the company to steadily deleverage, ARC currently just has 44 million in net debt. A figure that will probably dive under 40 million when Q4 earnings are released. Before I will continue with my argument why I belief ARC is being massively undervalued by investors, we have to address the company's lease arrangements.Everyone who looks at ARC's balance sheet and Cash Flow statement for the first time would notice two things. First, he/she would be amazed by the high operating cash flow of around $50 million and stable CAPEX of $10-15 million a year. A Free Cash Flow yield of 35 million for a company with a 55 million market cap is quite spectacular. Secondly, he/she would notice ARC's elevated net debt position at around $90 million. I also had these two observations when first looking into ARC. Things turned out to be a bit more difficult.ARC accounts for a portion of its leases as ""capital lease obligations"". The way they account for this is by calculating their total capital lease obligations and combining it with their actual debt obligations. Because these lease obligations are now part of their debt load it also means that in the cash flow statement these capital leases only show up in the financing activities. They are treated as regular debt repayments. While there is nothing wrong with using this method, it does complicate the initial analysis of ARC. In short, the company basically has inflated Free Cash Flow and an inflated debt level compared to other companies. As we can see in the financial statements above, ARC has been using this method for a long time already. Average capital lease obligations per year have been between $10-20 million. Total capital lease obligations have risen a bit from 30 million a few years ago to, 46 million currently. Although this is still far away from 2008 levels. Concluding, I think investors are best served to exclude total capital lease from debt while also subtracting annual capital lease payments from the FCF. The company provides these figures every quarter in note 6 and 7 of their 10-Q (note 5 and 6 in their 10-K). So in the way I analyze ARC, net debt sits at 44 million right now and annual FCF has averaged around 30 million. Others might want to value ARC in the way the company reports its financials. Whatever way you choose, the end result should not differ a lot.The lease accounting is just something to be extra aware of, but it does not say anything about the investment worthiness of the company.ARC currently trades at $1.20 a share. With almost 46 million shares outstanding this results in a market cap of almost $55 million. The company's enterprise value stands at $99 million if we include the 44 million in net debt. Let's see how we should value a company like ARC with the following key metrics:(Source: 3rd quarter 2019 10-Q, table by author)I belief a valuation for ARC is quite a straightforward exercise. The easiest way to do it in my opinion is to look into a potential future scenario for ARC. Normally I'm not too keen in trying to predict the future, but with ARC I belief the upside really presents itself if we assume a relatively weak future outlook.(Source: Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings, (2019) outlook based on own predictions and guidance given by company. All figures are in millions of dollar)This scenario above is basically assuming that ARC's average performance over the last decade will not be met anymore. Its assume FCF will stabilize around $15 annually (while 25-30 million has been the average) and CAPEX and lease obligations will remain fairly high. Even in such a world ARC will have a net cash position around 2022-2023 while it sustains its recently initiated dividend program. Such a bearish scenario would still give you a company in 2023 that would be valued at around 4x EV/FCF based on the current share price. In the mean time you would have recouped around 13% of your purchase price in dividends. So even in a bearish scenario I belief the risk of permanent loss of principal is quite low with ARC.I belief the following scenario to be more likely:(Source: Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings, (2019) outlook based on own predictions and guidance given by company. All figures are in millions of dollar)This scenario also assumes a worse performance for ARC in the coming 4 years than it has had in the last decade. I do think a conservative outlook is warranted because the company operates in an industry that is rapidly transforming. The CEO gave us more insight into this during the last earnings call:(Source: Q3 2019 earnings call)How successful ARC is going to be remains to be seen. I view the company as a value play where the sentiment has turned way too negative while its balance sheet hasn't looked better in the last 15 years. ARC is more than likely to acquire a net cash position in the next 2/3 years which will enable it to return extra money to shareholders. The company's recent announcement of the dividend program shows they are serious about this. Furthermore, because of the low share price the dividend yield is already 3.33% annually on a quarterly dividend of just 0.01 a share. This pay-out costs the company just 1.8 million a year. Easily sustainable and the company can afford to grow the dividend as their net debt decreases.The two scenario's above proof that the downside for investors at the current price is very low, especially considering how low I set the bar for ARC in my outlook. In terms of upside I would value ARC at a multiple of 7x EV/FCF. This is more in line with its historical average even though the company had a way bigger debt component in the past. I conservatively estimate average FCF going forward at $15-20 million a year to establish my sell target. This implies an EV of $105-140 million. Assuming ARC will have a net cash position by 2022 this would mean ARC's share price should rise to $2.20-3 a share. Implying upside of 8-140%. How would ARC achieve the change in sentiment necessary for investors to realize they are valuing the company way too low? I think the following three catalysts are the most likely:While ARC's business performance should really deteriorate quickly for investors to become concerned about their fundamentals, there are some real risks to the long thesis. First of all, investors should be wary of ARC's dependence on the AEC/O industry. With 79% of revenue derived from this sector a housing downturn like the one during the great recession could really hurt the company's revenue and cash flow. Such a downturn could also spur an extra urgency for these companies to divert even more to new technologies and digital solutions. Even though ARC has been building up solid capabilities in those new services, competition is higher there. Secondly, California is by far ARC's largest market. The company derives 34% of revenue from this state. As it is its home market and it it's the U.S. largest state in terms of its economic size this is a substantial risk. We all know that California is prone to suffer natural disasters which could seriously harm a relatively small company like ARC. On top of that any local downturn in California would also harm ARC disproportionally. Thirdly, the company still derives a large part of its revenue from the more traditional printing and document services it provides. If the sales decline of these services accelerates without ARC being able to sufficiently offset this with revenue from their new digital services this could impair my long thesis.All in all, ARC is an excellent value investment in my opinion. You pay only 4x EV/FCF while the company's balance sheet is in the best shape it has been. They are more likely than not to be in a net cash position in 2-4 years depending on their performance. The company is becoming more shareholder friendly now its debt levels are more than manageable, resulting in a new dividend program and active share repurchases. On top of all this, the company has proven to be an excellent cash generator over the last decade with stable results of 25-30 million a year. Even if the company would do only half of that, investors should still easily recoup their principal. If the company manages to keep their free cash flow steady at around 20 million, upside should be at least 80-140% from the current share price. If ARC is able to keep its FCF stable in the 25-30 million range upside could be way higher. I therefore view ARC as a perfect stock in any deep value portfolio. A basket of 20 stocks like this should easily outperform the market in the future. Happy value investing!Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

(Source: 2015 Form 10K)As prior articles have discussed, historically, ARC was a rollup strategy reprographics company. Over the years the company has evolved into a strong niche player within the AEC industry with a strong history of relationships for document needs within that industry.I believe ARC common stock is currently significantly undervalued in the market for a variety of reasons. Among these are a lack of analyst coverage, declines in historical print business lines, challenges of navigating to new digital/web-based initiatives, a leveraged balance sheet, exaggerated response to the Q2 earnings report, and exaggerated response to one-time loss of a major customer after telegraphed non-renewal following a merger. After thorough review of company documents, I believe the company is addressing the factors within their control in a manner sufficient to merit a higher valuation for common shares.In this article I will attempt to describe the business in brief, outline the thesis for a long investment, and discuss catalysts for value recognition. I will then briefly outline potential valuation scenarios demonstrating the upside potential for common stock investors at current levels.Understanding Services OfferedOn a slightly more granular level, ARC provides services in the following areas:Managed Print Services - This is essentially an outsourcing offering for printing and document management needs for a variety of business or project locations (services provided on-site). An entire document solutions platform is installed at the customer's location, powered by proprietary software call Abacus that allows for capture, control, manage, print, account for, and store documents. The service is contracted typically for initial terms of 3-5 years, and is billed for with a single consolidated invoice on an a per-use basis.Offsite Services - The company operates approximately 175 service centers in major metropolitan markets, which offer the MPS customers flexibility and overflow capacity. These centers also play a role in the archive services offered by ARC Documents. These sites are leveraged by providing local customers with high-volume, project-related printing services.Archive and information -- This is a cloud-based and searchable archive which allows customers to store information, documents, and intellectual property digitally. Clients are enabled to scan in historical items for cloud digital storage, and are afforded the flexibility to store digital copies of new materials as they are printed. Much of this revenue is driven by clients looking to organize their prior document storage closets, categorize the related items for more efficient retrieval, and locate it digitally for ready accessibility. (See YouTube for a visual representation of this service.)Specialized Color Printing - ARC offers large scale finished color product printing services to retailers, marketing departments, etc, etc.Web-based Document management Apps - This is a collection of proprietary tools named ""SKYSITE,"" designed to facilitate project collaboration across distances, manage print networks, create and maintain project document archives in an organized manner, etc. ARC believes having a suite of offerings developed specifically for construction needs gives them competitive advantages within their AEC niche.Digital Shipping/managed file transfers- This service helps reduce or eliminate shipping costs, by allowing digital content creation and transfer for printing at a distant local site, thereby eliminating or reducing freight costs.Equipment and supplies sales- these are sold primarily to customers in the AEC industry. The sales are often backed by service and maintenance agreements.With this collection of services in mind, ARC believes it is able to provide comprehensive and end-to-end solutions to clients within their offered document management ecosystem, allowing customers to create, access, store, retrieve and distribute any document anywhere in the world. ARC places specific emphasis on the AEC industry which represents approximately 77% of revenues, citing the following strengths within this niche:ARC states:The idea at the heart of ARC's largest business line (service to AEC customers) is to shorten lead times between design, implementation, modification, collaboration efforts, and completion of construction projects. To accomplish this, ARC hopes to leverage the above services into an increasing number and value of relationships within their served industry as AEC customers increasingly desire efficient solutions to their documents management and collaborative efforts. (Note the presentations here and here to get a brief understanding - beyond the capacity of this essay - of what ARC provides for their AEC industry clients to manage workflows.)Understanding Revenue Reporting SegmentsThe preceding service offerings are categorized by ARC for revenue reporting in 4 segments as follows:Construction Document and Information management- this business segment consists of management, distribution, and production of documents and information relating to construction projects; namely blueprints, marketing materials, signage, etc produced in black and white, color, or digitally. This is the location of the above mentioned digital solution SKYSITE. (Pertinent facts: 51.6% of 2015 total company revenues, working through declining physical print revenues and transition to digital products as legacy large-format printed items demand decreases).Company summary of 2015 CDIM performance:Managed Print Services- This segment is contracted to reduce the customer's burden of owning, maintaining, and managing print devices and print networks. It is billed on a per-use basis and provided on-site. Please refer to above. Of note, this service is a contracted and recurring revenue stream, which I will comment more on later. (Pertinent Facts: 33.6% of 2015 sales.)Company summary of 2015 MPS performance:Note: Accounts total 9,000 or growth of 500 year over year, primarily smaller or regional accounts. Expect a decline in 2016 due to non-renewal of large contract after merger activity)Archiving and Information management- This is a service line that performs the capture, management, access, workflow, and use of documents and information that have been produced in the past, while also providing for the storage of new documents as they are printed or created. ""AIM"" is essentially a cloud storage document solution. Sales are driven by a need to organize, leverage past intellectual properties, and a desire to save money by reducing physical storage space needs. (Pertinent Facts: 3.1% of 2015 sales for total company.)Company summary of 2015 performance of AIM segment:Equipment and Supplies - Basically a segment that operates as an OEM reseller of printing equipment to AEC customers. (Pertinent facts: 11.7% of total company revenues in 2015.) (My notes: steady eddy compared to prior two years reporting periods.)Returning to the thesis:Throughout the subsequent valuation scenarios presented, please refer to the following consolidated financial statements, again citing the 2015 Form 10K annual documents:Revenue Stability:Let us get a picture of revenue and profitability stability for ARC. If we limit our discussion to the 3 years described above, we see a picture of steady to slightly increasing revenue trends for total company. In point of fact, revenue grew by a compound annual rate of 2.6% between 2013 and 2015 for total company, and isolating services revenue the CAGR was 3.2%.More importantly, free cash flows in these three annual periods improved sequentially each year at a higher CAGR than revenue, with a 3-year average of just above $37 million (as defined by operating cash flow minus capital expenditures). Of note, 2015 FCF exceeded $45 million.I believe a number of factors should contribute to the stability of revenues in the years to come. Among supporting data to this supposition, ARC has approximately 90,000 customers with a diverse base. None of these represent more than 4% of consolidated revenues. ARC also enjoys strong historical ties to the AEC industry, and has utilized their niche position to develop dedicated product offerings particularly in digital initiatives tailored to these clients' needs. These offerings are now supported by a dedicated Silicon Valley staff of 20 employees responsible solely for the development, maintenance, and support of ARCs proprietary software and cloud offerings. I also expect ARC to benefit from consolidation of the AEC industry, as this promotes larger and more geographically spread firms to contract service providers capable of performing central and comprehensive service. With the diverse services described in some detail above in mind, I believe ARC is well-positioned to compete for these business opportunities. As an added bonus, as this occurs revenue should gradually be directed towards the MPS and AIM lines of service, remembering that these represent longer-term and contracted revenue streams with less volatility than other business lines.While I do expect these to represent the longer term trends, when calculating a valuation for equity at present we cannot ignore more recent trends. Reference the following consolidated statements from the most recent 10Q quarterly report:As of the most recent quarterly earnings report, we find that total sales (and service sales) figures are down approximately 5% year over year for the 6 month figures of 2016 compared to 2015. This reduction accelerated slightly to nearing 7% reduction year over year for the isolated YOY second quarters. While I acknowledge this warrants attention, remember that a sizable portion of this decrease was telegraphed at year end 2015 as a non-renewal of an approximately $10million customer account after a merger activity. Quoted from the most recent Q2 conference call:Taking note of these comments, I can see a route to overcoming the sizable non-renewal as that business can steadily be regained or replaced, and I can live with the reduction of low margin business lines. I also acknowledge with reference to the above 6 month year over year comparisons that cash flow generation continued to be strongly positive and very near prior year levels aided by SG&A expense reductions and interest expense reductions. However, as we dig deeper we must acknowledge that management did update guidance with a downward revision to several metrics.Utilizing the midrange of this new operating cash flow range, and averaging the 3 prior full years cap ex to derive a 2016 FCF estimate, we can obtain a 2016 FCF of $35 million which compares consistently to our 3 years preceding average, though admittedly reduced from last year in a significant way. We will soon use this figure to estimate valuation ranges for ARC.Understanding Effects of Balance Sheet Deleveraging:Please refer to the following snapshot from the most recent 10Q for a summary of currently outstanding obligations:From the annual figures noted in the preceding sections, we can see a reduction in long term debt and capital leases of just over $17 million from year end 2014 to 2015, and referencing the most recent quarterly figures above, we can see another $8.5 million in debt reduction in the 6 months that brings us to present figures (or an annualized $17 million thus far into 2016). We can average into a debt reduction schedule of $17 million annually. At 46 million diluted shares outstanding, this represents $0.37 in annual debt per share elimination. When stated another way, this represents 10.6% of the current share price in annual debt reduction. Additionally, at the current interest rate, for each $17 million debt reduced, the company obtains interest savings of $0.4505 million dollars annually.Combining the above factors into a conservative range of valuation estimates:(Source: Yahoo Finance Interactive charts)As we can see, the stock traded down to approximately $3.10 per share in the days following the downward revision of guidance in early August from recent highs approximating $4.25 before rebounding to the current $3.47 at the time of this writing.To summarize current enterprise value: Based upon current shares outstanding we have a rounded $160 million of equity value, $20.5 million in cash, and $150.1 million in debt for a total enterprise value of $289.6 million. Utilize the charts below to see a few potential valuation metrics, then we will discuss below.Option 1: Free Cash Flow MultiplesUtilizing $35 million in annual FCF, and ignoring for the moment projections into the future for interest payment reductions as a result of debt reductions, as well as translation of debt reductions into equity value, see chart below (chart values in millions of dollars except for the multiplier figure):The midpoint 10.5x represents a 49% upside from current share prices, whereas the 12.5x multiple represents 93% upside. Throw in a year's worth of debt reductions and we have a one year potential of 104% under this scenario. There are positive arguments to be made for the midrange being overly conservative. For example, recall the $17 million in annual debt reductions - this adds an additional nearly 11% to the equity value side of the equation each year, all other things assumed constant PLUS some $0.4505 million dollars in annual interest payment reductions that will flow directly to cash from operations annually. For conservative estimates, I assume essentially a stagnant FCF at this years reduced levels given the confluence of factors (i.e. legacy revenue declines, 3.5 years annualized average cash flows which average below last year's elevated levels, allowing for a period of 2-3 years for digital initiatives to compensate for legacy declines, potential lack of recovery of revenues to offset large account loss, etc). The reader is free to tweak assumptions according to their projections.For comparison's sake, the active reader may utilize R.R. Donnelley and Sons (NYSE:RRD), which trades at a FCF multiple nearer 14.5x and an EV:EBITDA multiple nearer 6.75x.Option 2: EV:EBITDA multiplesUtilizing midpoint of EBITDA guidance from lowered guidance provided in the Q2 report ($61 million):Again, consider the effects accretive to equity value of debt reductions, interest savings, etc. The chart here demonstrates that an EV:EBITDA multiple of 4.75x would justify the current market capitalization, while an increase to 6x multiple would yield 48% returns on equity prior to reaping potential rewards of further substantial debt reductions, interest savings, stability of revenue trends to approximate recent year's trends, or at minimum a gain in smaller local or regional accounts sufficient to offset last year's large account loss to a substantial degree. While I am not a proponent of EBITDA use for valuation estimates, the range here does support a margin of safety in that a company generating the levels of cash flow as ARC has consistently done for 4 years would not have to command a very lofty multiple on this basis to support increases in equity valuation.Bottom Line:While I have to acknowledge the negatives and downward revisions contained in the last quarterly report, I believe the future earnings power of ARC Documents is more stable than the company is currently receiving credit for. Among the factors that contribute to this conclusion are the aggregate view of the business potential from review of recent years, underlying mechanics of reduced revenues and cash flows for this year as compared to consistency in prior years, promising figures on digital initiatives growth to offset legacy declines, and disciplined debt reductions and associated interest savings which will translate into equity value. I believe they are in a competitively defensible niche position serving the AEC market with dedicated products that should gain traction.Collectively, this suggests ARC document solutions is currently undervalued at present with approximately 50% upside now, and up to 120% upside with signs of recovery of FCF power towards that of 2015 levels as digital adoption accelerates in future quarters. The undervaluation being based on conservative estimates of this year's results (in a down year) make this an immediately actionable investment. It is worth stating plainly that Free Cash Flow leverages up nicely in an environment of slightly rising revenues, as prior years demonstrate. Should the company prove successful in replacing lost large contract in 2016 with regional and local accounts our FCF annual assumption of $35 million should prove conservative.Further, I believe much of the risk in shares was removed as a result of recent price declines in response to what I view as short term business declines, as even a gently declining revenue base of 1-2% per year (absent a repeat of one time sizable account losses in this or next year) warrant an equity value of at least the current valuation as debt reductions offset any potential gradual declines in legacy business. I believe the market has priced this stock as though the declines suffered from one-off events of 2016 will be permanent, and I believe the likely scenario approximates equity valuations in line with the 10.5x FCF multiple scenario or the 6x EBITDA multiples outlined above, with debt reduction translating to equity value as the overlooked icing on the cake annually as revenue trends once again stabilize.One last note on potential sources of equity value enhancement: Share repurchasesThe final commentary I offer relates to the active share repurchases. Please refer to above referenced data to confirm the activity. $15 million was approved for share repurchases in February of 2016. There is approximately $10 million remaining, representing 6.25% of current shares outstanding at current prices. If company is able to gobble up shares at prevailing prices, remaining shareholders will be rewarded with increasing equity ownership at a nice clip. Time will tell what future years share repurchase activity will include, but at a stable $35 million in FCF I believe the company can consistently offer $10 million in buybacks while still protecting a cash cushion, investing in the business, and reducing debt at similar levels annually.Risks to the investment thesis would include loss of other large client business representing a trend, contraction of AEC company spending or development of projects, or rapidly accelerating print volume needs decreases and lack of uptake of digital initiatives - all should be monitored closely with all subsequent company reports. I encourage all commentary to challenge this investment thesis or to supplement the overview I have striven to provide here to make us all better informed about the risks and rewards potential, and thank you for reading.Supporting Documents"

It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to the SA PRO archive. Click here to find out more »Current ValuationARC recently appeared in one of my screeners, most likely because the share price has fallen quite a bit in the last few weeks. Following some financials for the last four years:For the last two years revenue has been in a steady decline and net income negative (loss). However, I also noticed thatI therefore turned to the 10K for the respective years to better understand the above and found the followingLet's look at the impact of capital lease in more detail.Capital LeaseA capital-lease payment has two components:As a result capital lease overstate Cash Flow from operations which is used as a basis for the calculation of Free Cash Flow.In ARC's 2015 10K we find that the capital lease obligations for the next 12 months are 11,2M. This is the same as principal payment as interest is shown in a separate line.Adjusted FCFIn a conservative scenario one would adjust FCF for normalized working capital levels and capital lease principal payments:The FCF adjusted in such a scenario is 24,4M and the resulting FCF EV yield is 10,15%. This number is much more realistic than the 18,35% reported by the screener.ConclusionARC is in a difficult spot. It's two most important business lines CDIM (printing of special formats in printing stores) as well as MPS (managed printing services) are in a structural decline. While the company is still able to attract a relatively high number of new clients it does not offset the overall decline in printing volumes. While some have already forecast the death of the printing industry a few years ago I don't want to take my chances at predicting the future.Revenue growth rate is at around -5%. To me this looks like an average business with low margins and an uncertain future. I therefore prefer to wait until the situation has somewhat stabilized rather than trying to put the right price on this one!"
3964552,24361,2016-04-13T07:45:00-04:00,"Although commercial construction activity has been growing, ARC's traditional reprographics business has not, and newer offerings like SKYSITE seem to be able to do little more than slow the erosion.Managed Print Services no longer seems to be a major growth opportunity; ARC has little to offer next to major rivals like Xerox, and overall market growth seems more limited.The valuation suggests low expectations, but ARC really has to prove that it can deliver noteworthy growth again for that valuation to mean much.","While ARC Document Solutions (NYSE:ARC) has reported three straight years of higher free cash flow, the underlying performance trends in the business haven't been as encouraging. It doesn't seem to be leveraging a better commercial construction environment, and it looks as though the company is likely to struggle to make a real dent in the managed print services opportunity. While archiving has been growing for ARC, I believe the company is going to have a hard time making real competitive inroads into this market.It's tempting to say that the worst is over. The shares have bounced off their low, the short interest is pretty small, commercial construction activity looks okay, and the shares seem to trade at low multiples to book, EBITDA, and revenue. That said, I'm concerned that the company is going to continue to struggle to find real traction with its projected growth drivers, and I don't see enough evidence yet to be very positive on this name as a dumpster-diving candidate.Better Construction Activity Isn't Carrying OverWhile ARC Document has been trying to diversify away from its traditional architecture, engineering, and construction reprographics markets, this business still generates around half of the company's revenue on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Although 2015 was a generally solid year for commercial construction, ARC Document's results don't seem to have kept pace.The company's CDIM segment (which houses the legacy reprographics business) saw a 1% decline in the fourth quarter and less than 1% growth for the full year. That was despite a strong construction backlog (as reported by the Associated Builders and Contractors), with an eight-month backlog in commercial/institutional projects. Construction spending was likewise solid throughout the year, and commercial/institutional architectural billings (as reported by the AIA) were healthy throughout the year.Looking at the results, management noted that what growth there was in CDIM largely came from outside the reprographics business (specialized color printing services), as technology adoption continues to replace traditional reprographics. While management has been signing up customers for the company's SKYSITE cloud/mobile document service (400 paid subs for the fourth quarter versus 150 in the third quarter), I don't see the service as achieving much more than replacing what is being lost in traditional repro services.Managed Print Doesn't Look Particularly FitManaged print services was, and is, supposed to be the next real growth engine for ARC Document. The idea here is that enterprises typically spend around 1-3% of their revenue on a variety of printing expenses, but many of these costs are avoidable, or at least reducible. Through careful analysis and monitoring of usage, greater adoption of paperless alternatives, and more careful spending on equipment and supplies, managed print services can reduce those costs by up to a third. Given how many companies are willing to go to almost any lengths to boost margin, reclaiming 1% of revenue is worthwhile to many managers.The problem comes from monetizing the opportunity and gaining share. Terrier Investing has covered some of this in detail already, but ARC Document seems to be struggling to gain traction, and it's not entirely clear to me that this is an especially attractive market to target as a growth driver.While MPS service providers can be paid in different ways, the two most common approaches seem to be per-page (with a monthly minimum) or a share of savings generated. Either way, there's an inherent problem - after the customer achieves that initial savings, the revenue prospects for the business aren't that attractive, as the business is either producing fewer pages or generating a smaller chunk of savings.This introduces another issue I have with ARC Document in this business. Large rivals and leading players in the MPS space, like Xerox (NYSE:XRX), Lexmark International (NYSE:LXK), HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), and Ricoh (OTCPK:RICOY), can offer a host of services that clients value, including security, process optimization, process outsourcing, and analytics. What's more, companies like Xerox, Lexmark, and HP have developed more specialized service offerings for industries like legal, financial services, and healthcare, whereas ARC Document doesn't have much specialization outside of its traditional architectural/engineering target market.Relative to Xerox, HP, Ricoh, and Lexmark, ARC Document comes up short here - so much so, in fact, that IDC, Quocirca, and InfoTrends don't even list the company on their market landscape graphs, and Gartner has the company in the middle of the lower-left square - the one place on the Gartner Magic Quadrant graph you don't want to be. Say what you will about the Gartner Magic Quadrant methodology, it may be flawed and overrated, but a lot of companies pay attention to it when they're evaluating providers. What's more, the fact that ARC Document doesn't merit so much as a mention in the other analyses can't be regarded as a very promising start. While the company does have the advantage of being ""platform-neutral"", as it has no printers, copiers, or supplies of its own to push, that doesn't seem to be a particularly compelling advantage relative to its more limited value-added service offerings.As Terrier Investing also noted, there are valid reasons to worry about the real growth potential of this market. A CompTIA study suggested that the market was already more than one-third penetrated, with large enterprises already more than 50% penetrated. Given that almost no market ever achieves 100% penetration, that would suggest a fair bit of the low-hanging fruit has been picked.With that, I'd note that ARC Document reported a 2% revenue decline in fourth-quarter MPS revenue, while Xerox reported 3% growth in its overall Document Outsourcing business (which includes more than MPS), and Lexmark reported a 4% decline to $233 million (more than six times the size of ARC Document). As the smaller player, ARC should be able to find growth where Lexmark and others cannot, and it seems difficult to support management's prior projections that MPS could be a high-single digit (or better) grower on a long-term basis.Archiving May Have A Similar ProblemUnlike the document management (or CDIM) and MPS segments, ARC's archiving and info management (or AIM) business did grow in 2015 - up 22% in the fourth quarter and full year. There is no doubt that many companies in a wide range of industries need archiving services and the ability to quickly retrieve those documents electronically. The problem is that I see no particular defensible specialty here. Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) offers automated archiving and cloud/digital retrieval, and HP offers some of these services as well. With no obvious edge in service offerings, how does ARC make a dent here unless it is willing to accept lower margins (competing on price)?The Bottom LineA year ago, I was more bullish on ARC Document's prospects for offsetting the limited growth potential of traditional reprographic services with other offerings like MPS and archiving. Since then, it has become more clear to me that not only is the MPS market not likely to be a great opportunity for growth on the whole, but that ARC Document is really facing an uphill climb against the likes of Xerox, HP, et al. I expect the same to prove true in archiving, with revenue growth likely to slow in the not-so-distant future. In short, ARC didn't deliver the performance I expected over the last twelve months, and I don't see a particularly compelling argument for how or why that will reverse.Given the scant expectations that seem built into today's price, I suppose it is fair to argue that a meaningful upturn in revenue and margins will be well rewarded, and it's worth noting that the company has improved its gross margin by four points since 2012 and restored operating margins to the high-single digits. Ordinarily, that would be something investors should really be excited about. The ""but"" is the more lackluster revenue growth prospects and the corresponding not-so-exciting outlook for growth in economic profits. While the low valuation makes this arguably a name worth watching for signs of improvement, I just don't have the confidence in the MPS and archiving business to want to own it today."
3979737,42371,2016-06-06T16:00:00-04:00,"ARC's traditional reprographics industry is currently in decline, and management is in the process of transitioning the company into a cloud-based solutions provider.ARC has made the most out of a currently tough situation, but significant uncertainty remains as to the growth of MPS as well as the competitive landscape for cloud solutions.The stock currently trades at a significant discount to earnings and cash flow. There could be significant upside in the case of a successful transformation, although I don't have conviction.Before getting involved, I'd like to see revitalized growth in MPS as well a stronger indication of competitive advantages the firm may posses in its cloud services operations.","ThesisARC Document Solutions (NYSE:ARC) is the distinguished leader of the currently declining reprographics market. This business essentially makes large blueprints for architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) firms. The company built its dominance through a roll-up strategy that started back in the 1980s. But in recent years, as digital solutions have continually taken the place of traditional print, paper, and reprographics, management has made a conscious shift in company strategy to survive through (and eventually capitalize on) the changes in this industry. Unsurprisingly, this disruption of its core business has left the stock trading at significantly depressed valuations. After my analysis, I came away with the conclusion that the stock actually might be undervalued at current prices. Despite this, there seems to be too much that has to go right (and I don't have significant reason to believe it will) while there are also some things that are undoubtedly working against the company. Given this odd blend of moving pieces, I see the risk of permanent capital impairment as too significant to get involved. I'll be monitoring the company for any signs of traction with its cloud solutions, a recovery in Managed Print Services, or maybe (although I don't expect it) a slowing level of decline for traditional repro.Company OverviewIn the first quarter of 2015, ARC reorganized its segment reporting in order to better reflect the changes going on in the business. The new segments are as follows:Construction Document and Information Management (CDIM): ~51% of salesThis segment contains the traditional business, which is declining around 5%. It's being partially offset by slow growth in color printing as well as more aggressive growth (albeit from a much smaller base) in cloud services. It is home to the company's SKYSITE product, which is ""a cloud-based construction document management solution"". It essentially allows customers to cooperate on a construction project through iPads, iPhones, etc. They can, for example, make changes in a blueprint and it will be updated in real time. Although management is currently seeing strong growth from this solution and steady traction, it is not yet ready to announce an exact growth rate to expect going forward. It was launched in January 2015. As of the company's 4Q 2015 call, it had 400 customers, representing 2,800 users that are engaged in 2,000 construction projects. This product is targeted at more or less anyone who is building anything. This can range from massive, billion-dollar construction firms to a five-man electrical team.Managed Print Services (MPS): ~33% of salesThis segment offers a solution designed to reduce customers' printing costs while making the overall business processes involved with printing more simple and efficient for them. They will move into a customer's office/work site, install the printing equipment they see as most suitable for the job, and manage print volumes, printing equipment, etc. They use a proprietary software called Abacus that allows them to save, download, manage, print, and store documents to allow for better documentation and organization practices. The ""global customers"" portion of this business deals with large, billion-dollar E&C firms and so is notably lumpy. More on that later. The other two (local and regional) have provided a much more consistent and stable source of recurring revenue. The MPS segments sell its services on a contracted basis (usually 3-5 years).Archiving and Information Management (AIM): ~4% of salesThis segment will basically offer to take all of the customer's documents out of some storage facility such as Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) (or maybe their basement), scan them, and upload them to the cloud to make them easy to access for anyone who may need them. The company has found that the application of these services (centered on the company's PlanWell technology) stretches far beyond the AEC industry. Basically anyone who manages a facility (schools, airports, power plants, etc.) can find benefits in this offering. Need to find a certain valve, or details on an emergency procedure? It's much faster to just pull out your iPad rather than rummaging through the piles of paper in the basement.Equipment and Supplies: ~12% of salesFairly self-explanatory, this segment consists of reselling printing, imaging and other equipment to customers.ManagementI would also like to briefly comment on management. The chairman/CEO, Suri Suriyakumar, has been with the company since he co-founded it in 1989. He currently owns almost 10% of the company's stock. Directors and officers as a group (11 people) own 14.16% of the company. Other beneficial owners can be seen in the chart below, taken from the proxy. Suri seems to be an extremely driven and competent leader. He served as president and COO from 1991 until he was appointed CEO in 2007. Other executives also have impressive resumes that you can read about here. It's worth noting that, given the transformation, the company has focused on trying to hire talent with technological expertise (especially with cloud products) on both the Board, executive, and management levels.Operational/Competitive Analysis by SegmentCDIMMPSAIMSome Obstacles and Unanswered QuestionsAlthough the company does seem to be doing everything within its control to make this transformation happen, there are bound to be roadblocks. One of the things that is a bit unsettling to me is the recent environment in MPS, which has been quite challenging. This is a big part of the thesis from a valuation perspective in my opinion (both qualitatively, which I'll explain now, and quantitatively, which I'll get to in a bit). Going forward, we know two things for certain: traditional reprographics is going to continue to decline (perhaps at an increasing rate), and even with strong growth from the technology-based services, it's starting from such a small base that it is going to be tough to move the needle. For this reason, management has repeatedly said that it is going to need to wait at least 24-36 months for the growth in the cloud solutions to offset reprographics. In the meantime, MPS was expected to drive a lot of the growth and help to offset the decline in repro, but this has proven to be easier said than done in the last year or two. Although the business started out growing in double digits, the environment has softened dramatically, and management isn't sure when it's going to pick up again. On the Q1 2016 call, Suri said:So not only is the company not going to be able to drive growth from MPS, but this also impedes its cross-selling abilities, as MPS is arguably its best opportunity (in terms of the relationship it establishes with customers) for capitalizing on that part of its strategy.As hinted at in the above quote, the global portion of the business is what's largely responsible for the stagnation. Given the size of the firms in that part of the market, the orders are just very lumpy as they come in. This is exacerbated by the current environment in oil, gas, and other commodities, which a lot of global E&C firms have heavy exposure to. With a couple big contracts getting pushed to the right in 2015, the company has just really struggled to generate further growth. One particularly concerning example was referenced in the company's recent letter to shareholders, saying:It's unclear why this company made that move and what the implications of that are for ARC's MPS strategy and opportunities.The last point to address about MPS is the operational paradox involved. MPS is designed to help customers reduce print volumes/costs, which in turn hurts the company's sales as the customer is no longer printing as much (especially if this print volume is replaced by someone else's software). As a result, the company needs to offset those print declines by continually signing new clients. Furthermore, it needs to sign these new clients in order to offset the ones that it is losing due to the fact that projects are getting wrapped up and it no longer needs the services. Given all of these factors (plus the fact that the installed base is now larger, so a new contract isn't going to move the needle as much), I think it could be difficult for this segment to return to double-digit growth without a consistent stream of global clients coming in.Furthermore, the rate of decline of traditional repro is just very tough to forecast. With the recent pickup that the non-residential construction market has seen, you would have expected to maybe see a bit of strength from repro. This has not been the case, and management has indicated this is due to a lag (maybe 2-3 quarters) between the construction market and the repro market. We will have to wait and see if this plays out.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowI would like to make some brief notes on the balance sheet and cash flow:Quick Takeaways from Q1 2016ValuationI view this situation as a company that is sort of in limbo. There is a significant uncertainty discount due to the fact that the company is in the midst of a major and difficult transition. It's no surprise that the stock is cheap if you assume that it ends up effectively capitalizing on the shift to digital, MPS comes back, etc. Management expects cash from operations to be in the area of $55-60 million for 2016. If we take the low end of this guidance, and subtract the ~$24 million it's expecting for capex/capital leases (as well as $3m for stock-based compensation), we arrive at a proxy for 2016 free cash flow of $28 million. Consequently, the company only trades at around 7x free cash flow.I will give a brief overview of what I perceive to be potential bear, base, and bull cases based on forecasted EPS three years out, in 2019. Although you will notice there are wild swings in the multiple I apply, this is consistent with the reality of the situation due to the fact that by that time, investors will have a much better idea of whether this is a dying business (justifying a sub 10x EPS) or a competitively advantaged company in the high-growth cloud solutions market (justifying 20x or more).Bull CaseThis scenario includes the following quantitative and qualitative assumptions:This generates a 2019 EPS of $0.32. With a multiple of 20x (which could prove to be conservative depending on the progress made with tech initiatives), that indicates a $6.40 PT and 50%+ upside over the course of the next couple of years.Base CaseHere, I assume the following:This generates 2019 EPS of $0.28. At a multiple of 12x, this brings us a PT of $3.36. The stock currently trades at $4.23.Bear CaseThis generates 2019 EPS of $0.23. With an 8x multiple (reflecting investor concerns around stagnation in MPS, repro declines, and uncertainty around the durability of tech offerings), we arrive at a PT of $1.84, indicating significant downside.Sum of the PartsI believe that performing a sum-of-the-parts analysis is also a useful thought exercise in this situation. I broke the business up into three parts:My growth rates for each area of the business were as follows:I assumed gross margins of 37% for repro, 33% for MPS, and 38% for cloud solutions. I allocated corporate overhead entirely to repro and MPS due to the fact that I am valuing the cloud portion on an EV/Sales basis, so wanted to make sure that the overhead from that segment got factored in.My consolidated operating income numbers for the next couple of years are around $30m (and actually slowly declining). For comparison, the company had operating income of $35m, $30m, and $28m in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. I based my analysis, again, three years out in 2019. The metrics that my valuation were based on are as follows:This leads to a 2019 enterprise value of about $357m. I assumed that the company would continue to generate around $28m of annual FCF in each of the next few years (see the beginning of this section for calculation). Of this, $18m would be spent yearly to pay down debt. The other $10m would go toward share buybacks, at an estimated average price of $5 (this results in 6m shares retired through 2019). Taking the $357m, we subtract the debt of $98m (current debt of $152m minus $18m per year for three years), and add an estimated cash balance of $20m. We get an equity value of $279m, which (based on our new share count of ~41.5m) indicates a 2019 PT of $6.71. This represents a potential CAGR of ~16-17% from current levels.In reality, though, we could have expected this method to generate a bullish result. Based on the SOTP analysis as well as the consolidated EBIT approach, I believe it is clear that this company is trading in limbo. This is due to the fact that some investors are confident in the company's future, and thus likely to value it on a SOTP basis. This method will produce a bullish scenario, as you are applying a realistic multiple to the 75% of the business (everything but repro) that is currently being weighed down by the repro side. On the other hand, you have various investors that are afraid to touch the stock due to concerns around the decline of repro and debt paydown. It is clearly evident that if you assume the cloud and MPS portions of the business will still be around in a couple years (rather than assuming the business is at risk of going under), then this stock is undervalued. That is still a significant question at this point in the game, though.ConclusionAlthough the stock currently trades very cheaply relative to earnings and cash flow, this may be rightly so. Simply put, this is a business that is seeing its well-established, dominant segment diminish while the fate of new initiatives remains uncertain. A highly competent management team is doing everything in its power to make this transition a success, but the fact of the matter is that it's simply been dealt a tough hand. Although I'm not betting on seeing any easing for the decline of repro, I will need to see further traction with tech initiatives and/or revitalized growth in MPS before getting involved.Disclaimer: These are just my opinions and nothing in this article constitutes investment advice; investors are reminded to do their own due diligence.

ARC's core business is a free cash flow machine and it's pursuing tangible growth opportunities. It has come a long way in the last few years in terms of strengthening its balance sheet, restructuring operations, and returning to growth. Meanwhile, its shares trade at just 6.5x FCF on this year's numbers (5.3x next year). In fact, ARC generates so much free cash that its stock will ""mechanically"" return more than +50% in the next 2.5 years at which point the stock would still be extremely cheap. We think the stock conservatively has 80% upside.Mechanical Stock AppreciationBefore drilling into the background and operations of the Company, we might as well begin with the part of the story that initially caught our attention - the mechanical appreciation of ARC's stock.Most investors are familiar with the term ""enterprise value,"" but may not know why it's so important. On the first day of my investment banking internship years ago, I asked my class instructor this very same question. He gave me a confused look and said ""well...obviously because enterprise value looks at the total value of a company irrespective of its capital structure."" I still didn't fully get it; up to then I had only heard of price ratios (P/E, P/B, etc.).Now we were talking about enterprise value multiples. Nonetheless, I decided to shut up before the bank second-guessed its decision to hire me as a summer analyst. I spent time that evening thinking through some real world examples so that I could more easily understand the concept and came up with the following: a home purchase.If one wants to buy a $500k home but has only $100k cash, he has to borrow $400k to purchase the home. In this example, $100k of the purchase price is equity, $400k is debt, and the $500k total price is the home's ""enterprise value."" It's easy to apply this same principal to a company: market cap + debt = enterprise value. I realized that just looking at the market cap of a company was ignoring another major piece of its total value.As I worked through the home purchase example, the mechanics of enterprise value began to make sense: once the homeowner had paid off his mortgage, 100% of the enterprise value would belong to him in the form of equity. Thus, equity of $500k + debt of $0 = $500k enterprise value; $400k of value would transfer to the homeowner as he paid down the mortgage. Big deal though... the homeowner paid a mortgage for 15 years and all he got was his lousy house!I realized however, that there was a huge difference between investing in a business vs. a home: the business generates the cash required to make the debt payments. Each quarter that a company generates cash to offset its debt, more of the enterprise value of the company ""mechanically"" transfers to shareholders, even if the enterprise value of the company remains the same forever. [My wife and I have been arguing over how much home to purchase ever since]If we apply this same principal to ARC, the ""mechanical"" stock appreciation is compelling. ARC currently has a $240m market cap and net debt of $181m for an enterprise value of $421m. In the next 2.5 years, ARC will generate $121m of free cash flow. Thus, even if ARC's enterprise value remains at $421m, $121m will transfer from debt to equity. Since its market cap is only $240m, an additional $121m represents +51% share price appreciation. Even at $7.68 per share however, ARC's shares would still be cheap.The History of ARCARC, formerly American Reprographics, has its roots in reprographics. Reprographics is short for ""reproduction of graphics"" and is a fancy term for printing large-sized documents common in the architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Think Pat Healy (Matt Dillon) in There's Something About Mary.ARC's legacy repro business is the result of a decade long roll-up of regional reprographics companies; in the process, it snowballed to be the largest repro provider in the US by multiples of its nearest competition. With more than 200 locations spread across the country, ARC developed relationships with over 100,000 AEC customers, cementing its status in the industry.Private equity took notice in the early 2000s infusing ARC with even more cash to fuel its acquisition strategy. By mid-decade, the construction market was frothy and ARC was firing on all cylinders. Naturally, its PE sponsors took out a huge chunk of debt against the Company, paid themselves a healthy dividend, and spun ARC into the public market in early 2005. Anyone alive at the time can probably guess how the subsequent years unfolded.In short, the US construction boom intensified and ARC enjoyed significant strength for a couple of years following its public offering. During that time, its stock tripled from its $13 IPO price. Enter: Lehman, housing bubble burst, debt crisis, government shutdown(s), US credit rating downgrade, et al. ARC's business was decimated and its very survival was threatened by the crippling debt load that the PE guys stuffed it with.Adding insult to injury, not only were the number of construction projects down, but the amount of print per project was also declining as a result of the growing digitization of the very documents ARC depended on. Management didn't need a magic 8-ball to tell them ""Outlook Not Good."" ARC's offering would have to adapt to a new reality.Fortunately, ARC was in a unique position to adapt to the changing industry. Large printer manufacturers began evangelizing Managed Print Services (MPS). ARC was already running onsite operations at its large customers based on its proprietary software. ARC saw the opportunity to leverage its technology, nationwide footprint, and >100k relationships to go after the MPS opportunity in its AEC niche.ARC's bet paid off. Its traditional reprographics offerings have fallen to less than 30% of revenue. It has transformed itself from a project-based cyclical business to a more predictable, recurring revenue one. Declining top line has shifted to growth for the first time in years and free cash flow is strong and gaining momentum.Why Does the Opportunity Exist?On the face of it, ARC looks like a highly indebted print company, a profile that would cause the average investor to physically flinch. As outlined above however, its debt is not a result of its operations, and its traditional print business is now less than 30% of revenue.Also, despite having a decent-sized market cap and trading volume, it has virtually no analyst coverage. Of the two analysts that do cover it, one of them (Blair) doesn't pay much attention to the Company, and often makes simple, verifiable mistakes in its estimates. It is one such mistake that sent ARC on its current downward trajectory.In February of this year, ARC's share price was near its five-year high as the Company released its 4Q14 earnings. In this release, ARC's 4Q revenue came in ahead of estimates, and EBITDA was in line. Management also guided FY15 revenue and EBITDA in line with consensus estimates. Its EPS guidance, however, was off by nearly 20% from Street expectations. This is because Blair for some odd reason was using a 16% tax rate vs. management's guidance of 39%. So, while guidance was in line with the Street's models, Blair's tax rate oversight made it look like a huge EPS guide-down.If the sell-side had used management's pro forma tax rate, ARC's EPS guidance would've been in line with estimates. Instead, it looked as though ARC was missing consensus by 22%. Compounding the frustration is the fact that ARC doesn't even pay taxes due to a nearly $100m NOL so any EPS guidance is pro forma for imaginary taxes anyway. Nonetheless, the shares were hammered the following day and have slowly drifted down since.The BusinessARC operates in several segments, which have recently been re-bucketed to highlight its growth-focused areas. Its previous way of reporting revenue is a bit more granular, so we'll start there (FYE2014)Onsite Services (32% of revenue)This revenue line consists of both Facilities Management and Managed Print Services. Facilities management is where ARC has machines and dedicated staff at a customer site. MPS is where ARC is responsible for a firm's complete document solution platform under long-term contracts. Document-related costs are the third largest office expense after people and locations.ARC estimates that their MPS services reduce document-related costs by as much as 30%. ARC is a top 10 MPS provider despite being narrowly focused on the AEC industry and not being a machine manufacturer; rather ARC's service is manufacturer agnostic. This is testament to the mindshare that ARC commands in the AEC space. The Company has exclusive document management agreements with 22 of the top 100 AEC firms in the US and several thousand smaller ones. With 100k+ customer relationships, it has a long runway for growth.Traditional Reprographics (27% of revenue)This segment consists of ARC's 178 service centers that provide high volume, project-related printing of construction documents, and offers overflow capacity to Onsite Services customers during periods of peak workloads. Despite being ""legacy,"" this segment has been rationalized to the extent that 2/3 of the incremental revenue dollar drops to the bottom line.Specialized Color Printing (21% of revenue)ARC's service centers are leveraged for color printing, finishing, and assembly of graphic materials for regional and national retailers, franchises, marketing departments, theme parks, and cultural institutions. Its color printing customers are both AEC and non-AEC firms.Digital Shipping and Equipment (20%)Using ARC's cloud-based software, customers can digitally transmit document files to the closest delivery point and print locally from an ARC service center. Also, equipment sales are just like it sounds - if a customer wants to buy equipment, ARC will sell it to them.Growth Focus - AIMWhile still in its nascent stages, Archive and Information Management (AIM) is a high-margin growth opportunity for ARC. AIM allows customers to store information in a cloud-based and searchable digital archive. ARC again leverages service centers to scan existing paper documents, and combines these with imported digitized documents. Its AIM platform organizes everything, and stores it in proprietary content management software.The software that ARC uses to manage its Onsite Services (Abacus) can also automatically add documents to the digital archive as they're printed. AIM is priced at a steep discount to traditional storage (e.g. Iron Mountain), eliminates inefficiencies of storing/losing physical documents across countless cardboard boxes, and provides for quick digital retrieval and distribution. ARC has mentioned that AIM could be as large a revenue line as Onsite Services, with much better margins.ManagementWe mentioned in the opening that management is skilled, dedicated, and incentivized. ARC's current CEO and COO have been with the company since the early rollup days, and Insiders own more than 10% of the company. During the darkest days of the economic downturn, ARC's officers took voluntary salary reductions and forewent bonuses for years.When ARC executed its debt refinancing(s), the interest savings were substantial and would dramatically improve net income. Thus, the board changed management's compensation structure to be based on EBITDA so they wouldn't be rewarded for an improvement that was nonoperating in nature.Financials and ValuationBased on management's guidance, we project that ARC will generate $37m of FCF this year, representing a 450% improvement in the last three years. The dramatic improvement is a result of improved operating performance and financial restructuring. In fact, in June 2013, ARC generated TTM EBITDA of $38.5m, was 5.7x levered, and had $22m of annual interest payments. ARC has dramatically improved on all of these metrics, yet its enterprise value has fallen since then.Despite growing EBITDA by 90%, reducing cash interest by 70%, and cutting its leverage ratio in half, ARC's enterprise value has fallen by 7%. As discussed above however, if ARC's enterprise value remains the same, ARC's cash flow will necessarily cause shares to appreciate +51%.Even if ARC's shares mechanically appreciate by 51%, it would still be cheap, trading for just 8.4x FCF ($361/$43). So what should ARC trade for? Historically, ARC has traded for between 5-8x EBITDA. Given that it is now a higher margin company with low volatility contractual revenue, significantly reduced balance sheet risk, and at the earlier stages of a commercial construction rebound, we think that the higher end of this range is appropriate.An 8x multiple on 2015 EBITDA results in a $9.50 stock price, which would imply just 10x 2016 P/FCF. By contrast, the Russell 2000 trades at 35x FCF, so I think we're still conservative. To sanity-check the valuation, we also use a DCF adjusted to reflect the long-term cycle, and arrive at an $8.90 target. Averaging these two results in a $9.20 price target, 80% above today's price. Neither of these valuation methods consider how large and valuable AIM can be, rather we believe they're baseline, conservative targets."
3934236,56112,2016-02-27T09:01:51-05:00,"Three months ago, I thought ARC Document Solutions' forecast for Managed Print Services growth was aggressive.My analysis proved correct, even more so than I thought it would - growth in this critical segment appears to have evaporated.Without strong growth in MPS to offset continued pressure in legacy reprographics, it will be a tough few years on the revenue front for ARC.The company continues to gain traction with its new technology products, but competition is significant and it will take time for revenue growth here to offset the core.I do think ARC is meaningfully undervalued on the basis of free cash flow, but I'm not sure the upside is compelling enough to offset the risks.","It hasn't been a fun few months for shareholders of ARC Document Solutions (NYSE:ARC). Over the past few years, the company has done a good job of squeezing everything they could get out of secularly challenged end-markets and starting to build a future in technologically-enabled solutions. ARC's SKYSITE collaboration app for AEC companies faces potential competition from a long list of companies including heavyweights like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Trimble (NASDAQ:TRMB), but has still managed to rack up over 400 customers and 2,800 total users.Unfortunately, the story has hit an unanticipated roadblock, seemingly taking away a lot of the near-to-medium term upside that some investors expected. While I do think that ARC is undervalued, and worth due-diligence for ""cigar butt"" investors, I'm also not in a hurry to buy, as there are plenty of outstanding questions here.Managed Print Services Collides With RealityThe real bombshell in results (and guidance) was the implicit abandonment of former optimism about the growth prospects of Managed Print Services. As an analyst keenly aware of the difference between knowable and unknowable issues, and process vs. outcome, it's not often that I thump my chest or pat myself on the back for a good call. However, on MPS, I thought that ARC management's previous long-term expectation of 8 - 10% growth was highly aggressive and I believe that their results (as well as that of their peers) have borne out my analysis on this issue. Since it's critical to the ARC investment thesis, I've spent some time digging in here, and what I've found isn't inspiring. To be fair, this 8 - 10 % number wasn't their estimate so much as an industry-wide forecast confirmed by Lexmark (NYSE:LXK) in various investor presentations - but if investing was as easy as sticking expert forecasts into a DCF, then markets would be perfectly efficient.Issue 1: Will The Real MPS Growth Rate Please Stand Up?In the real world, of course, things are a little messier, and it pays to think from first principles. Let's assess how realistic this target is/was. You have to disaggregate it into two components - underlying print spend growth (or decline), and share growth by MPS relative to the print TAM. Starting with the first: It appears that underlying the industry's growth expectations in MPS was the premise that print costs will be flat after the initial optimization period (where print costs can decline by 20 - 30% or more). This alone is hopelessly optimistic.Some data points: HP's (NYSE:HPQ) printing segment, in total, declined 5.1% on a constant-currency basis in full-year 2015, with a decline in high-margin supplies (ink) actually outpacing the decline in hardware. Their recently reported Q1 was absolutely dismal, with supplies revenue down a further 8% y/y (in constant currency!) despite HP actually increasing prices - in other words, volumes were down even more. Lexmark and Xerox (NYSE:XRX) are similarly seeing strong declines. Even more concerning, traditionally print-intensive areas like legal appear to be rapidly going electronic. State and local government software vendor Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) continues to see strong traction in e-filing revenues, with e-filing revenue up 28% y/y in the December quarter, and expects continued growth over the medium term. They discussed this area rather extensively on their Q4 call and their discussions with customers indicate that many courts will make e-filing mandatory over the next 3-5 years. All in all, it's pretty clear that modeling anything north of a low-single-digit decline in print spend (and perhaps more appropriately, a mid-single-digit decline) is aggressive. We'll come back to tie this in momentarily.Turning to the second issue, share: Managed print services has room to grow share, but is not exactly a new industry either. This 2014 CompTIA study pegs penetration at 36% overall, with medium and large firms already above this level (at 40% and 53% respectively - see slide 16). I do think that MPS can continue to gain share, as the value proposition appears compelling, but there is probably a natural ceiling to adoption - some firms, for whatever reason, probably won't bother (perhaps because they don't have very high print volumes - that same slide from CompTIA suggests 56% of firms with high print volumes were already MPS adopters). Moreover, some customers may revert to a decentralized print environment. As ARC discussed in the December CEO letter, ""after a recent merger, one of our largest customers decided to revert to a decentralized purchasing model for office print services instead of using an integrated MPS solution to reduce the total cost of print ownership.""Putting everything together: the industry is already decently penetrated, especially among the prize large/print-intensive customers. What does this mean for future growth rates? At a Citi conference last September, Lexmark noted how proud it was of having grown at double digits 13 of the past 15 years - but this year came in high single digits, and as it gleefully pointed out, Xerox and HP were low single digits. It's worth remembering that with underlying print spend declining, you have to capture incremental share just to keep revenues flat - so if you model, say, a 4% decline in print spend annually, then even a robust 8-10% annual share growth only gets you to mid single digit growth in MPS. If MPS penetration is already at 36% of the TAM, it gets hard to predict more rapid share growth than this (particularly since penetration is already higher among large and print-intensive customers.) This ignores one layer of analysis, since many firms that are reported to use MPS have a hybrid approach where they manage some on their own and outsource some to MPS - so you could certainly come up with a more bullish angle than I do - but I think a mid-single-digit growth rate is a more appropriate long-term outlook (even if you're bullish).Issue 2: Competitive Landscape / ARC ExecutionARC has two competitive advantages in MPS that I can identify: first, it is hardware-agnostic, so it doesn't have a conflict of interest. Second, it has a strong presence in the architecture, engineering and construction industry and is well suited to cater to this industry's unique needs. Unfortunately, the rest of the industry aren't exactly slouches. This (partial) report by quocirca suggests that all the major hardware vendors seem to have pretty good offerings.They also have other important competitive advantages that ARC doesn't: Big sales teams and lucrative supplies margins. For example, HP can't seem to mention managed print services without adding the words ""supplies attach."" It wouldn't be a big deal to them to sacrifice a few points of margin to maintain their embedded base and keep the (green) ink flowing.Finally, it's worth noting that MPS business seems pretty sticky - Lexmark mentions a renewal rate of around 96%, for example - so it's likely easier to generate sales growth through ""missionary"" sales rather than competitive takeaways.All told, then, if the industry growth rate moderates to mid single digits (which I believe will be the case), competition for the remaining few big accounts will likely intensify and I just don't see ARC winning more than its fair share of these.Indeed, management appears to have abandoned its own growth target. Growth in MPS was supposed to offset declines in legacy reprographics until such time as new digital revenues were material - but now the tone from CEO Suri Suriyakumar is:That's a big departure. Based on management commentary on the call, it sounds like MPS revenue will be down slightly y/y in 2016. If you assume a modest 2% decline in reported revenue, then adjust for the one major customer lost, it looks to me like revenue would only have increased 4 to 5% in 2016 over 2015. This sounds okay until you add in the other mitigating factor - there was not a whole lot of growth in 2015 because some big contracts kept getting pushed to the right.Valuation: Cheap, But… Cheap Enough?Late last year, I thought ARC's fair value was somewhere around $7 - $8. When the facts change, so do my estimates, and I no longer believe fair value is that high. I was openly bearish on the outlook for MPS relative to management's guidance, but the performance here is substantially worse than I expected, and would have been even if the big $10 million contract hadn't been lost. I will call out specific points to think about as I go through my calculations.Based on diluted shares and the current share price, I get a market cap around $160 million, with an enterprise value south of $300 million after adding net debt. (Please note that I don't treat capital leases as debt here because I don't think it makes sense to do so.) Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $68.5 million (plus or minus $2.5 million). Yes, this is apparently cheap at not much over 4x EBITDA - but it's not that simple. As I understood it, around a quarter of capital expenditures (plus capital leases, don't forget those) were supposed to be related to MPS growth, with the other 75% for maintenance. Yet with MPS expected to not grow this year, total capex is expected to be $24 million - not as material a step down as I thought might be possible.Still, the company looks very cheap on EBIT, particularly since there's a $40 million net deferred tax asset that will shield cash flow. Fully-taxed FCF after interest expense should equate to around $0.50/share, and actual FCF over the next few years will likely be substantially higher due to the aforementioned tax assets.7x fully-taxed FCF (and an even lower multiple of near-term FCF) is admittedly interesting. Despite my extensive discussion of MPS above, I don't think that segment (a third of revenues) is at risk of significant near term revenue declines - it should be somewhat stable - and reprographics isn't going to disappear overnight, although it's certainly headed in that direction. The multiple is somewhat constrained by the leverage (which is never a good combination with a business at risk of terminal decline) - but still, I think somewhere in the neighborhood of 9-10x fully-taxed FCF, or ~$5/share, wouldn't be egregious. This equates to 8x EBIT, which feels a little high to me, but there are the NOLs to take into account.As for capital allocation, whether it's good or bad depends on where you stand. Management has made it clear that their first preference, at this stock price, is to purchase shares rather than devote all cash flow to paying down debt. Admittedly the interest rate on their debt is substantially lower than the free cash flow yield on their stock, but I'd still like to see them be more aggressive in getting their debt levels down. If you're bullish on the company's future, then these repurchases will undoubtedly create significant value - but if there were to be some sort of macro shock, it's not hard for me to come up with a scenario where shrinking EBITDA increases leverage to a level that's somewhat imprudent for a business that can no longer ride the coattails of MPS while it's building out its technology revenues. As I've mentioned before, I do think they have interesting products here, but the competitive environment is fierce and technology is a much more rapidly evolving business than printing (as management themselves noted on the call).Wrapping It UpARC is undoubtedly cheap relative to its current cash flow potential, and it would seem to take a pretty bearish set of assumptions to justify this price. The question is whether those bearish assumptions would be realistic - and I think they well could be, as there seems to be no hope in sight for the printing market.Also, you shouldn't confuse the objectivity of my analysis here with a dislike of the management team - I'm actually inclined to like them. That said, ARC is certainly swimming uphill at this point, and amidst this market sell-off, I have other options. For example, Charles River Associates (NASDAQ:CRAI) is trading very cheaply relative to cash flow, doesn't face any substantial secular headwinds, and has a pristine balance sheet (which it is currently utilizing to conduct a big Dutch Auction tender).If ARC were to fall further and I were to decide to buy it, it would be strictly as a quick value ""trade"" similar to my ownership of Windstream (NASDAQ:WIN) - give me a half-decent price in a reasonable timeframe and I'm getting my capital out of Dodge. I do believe that ARC offers material upside potential, with fundamental downside risk somewhat tempered by the NOL-juiced cash flow in the near term, but prospective investors should be cognizant of the risks here.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

ARC is worth between $10 and $14 per share or 30-80% upside over the next several years.The Street underappreciates ARC's transition to a full-service, cloud-based, managed documents solutions company.The business generates consistent, positive FCF: over the past 9 years, the company has generated > $400m in FCF with no down years.","ARC ($7.52) is trading at a discount to fair value. ARC is worth between $10 and $14 per share or 30-80% upside over the next several years.Per the company's most recent 10-K, ARC (+46%) has underperformed the Russell 200 Index (+106%) and the Managed Services & Publishing Peer Group (+234%) by a significant margin from 2009-2014. This is set to change over the next five years.Why This Opportunity Exists:ARC Documents Solutions (NYSE:ARC) is still remembered as American Reprographics Co. - a roll-up (140 acquisitions) of project-based, cyclical blueprint businesses rather than the company it is becoming - a contractual, recurring document solutions provider with leverage to non-residential construction trends.The Street underappreciates ARC's transition to a full-service, cloud-based, managed documents solutions company. This transition will lead to a much more predictable revenue model. Not only can the company more predictably grow revenues and operating cash flow, but I expect the stock to re-rate higher as a result (from 2005-2014, the average EV/EBITDA range was 6-10x | ARC currently trades @ 7x).The evidence: In 2013, Q4 revenues did not sequentially decline for the first time in the company's history. In fact, on-site revenues became the company's largest segment, reaching 30% of total revenues, whereas the traditional reprographics business represented 29%. This shift has become more pronounced since the end of 2013 as on-site and cloud-based solutions grow in the HSD-LDD range.A Consistent Cash Flow Generator:ARC has a history of positive economic performance despite operating in a cyclical industry. From 2006-2014 ARC (current market cap of ~$365m and an enterprise value of ~$545m) generated $662m of CFFO. Over this 9 year period, ARC generated ~$410m in free cash flow (inclusive of capital lease obligations).And in a sign of the business model's resiliency, the company generated positive free cash flow (FCF) in every single year from 2006 to 2014.Moreover, the capital structure has been aggressively addressed.Balance Sheet:In FY'2014, the company paid down $27m of its term loan. First, the company refinanced its 10.5% coupon debt for a new Term B loan @ 6.25% saving an estimated $7m in interest expense. Then, the company refinanced into a Term A loan @ LIBOR + 250 saving an additional $6m in interest expense. At the end of Q1'15, ARC's leverage ratio dropped from 3.2x to 2.7x in the past year.For the foreseeable future, management intends to use free cash flow to de-lever the company with a goal of reaching a leverage ratio of 1.5x. According to the company's CFO, management expects its ""leverage ratio to decrease even further in 2015, which in turn reduces the spread we pay on our long-term debt."" (Q4'14 Call)NOLs: ARC has $90m in NOLs and does not expect to pay more than $1m in cash taxes for the next several years (""I am saying the next 3-5 years we won't be paying taxes"" -ARC CFO on Q4'14 Call). The company's book tax rate is much lower than the reported 38% used in its financial statements.Valuation:EBITDA margins peaked at 25.6% in 2007 and bottomed in Q2'12 at a still healthy 13.1%. In Q1'15, ARC's adjusted EBITDA margins were 16.1% (FY'14: 17.1%).I estimate normalized EBITDA in the range of ~$100m (20% margin) on ~$500m in sales. Incidentally, management has a goal of reaching 20% adjusted EBITDA margins in the next several years.On the Q4'14 call, management said, ""we have no intention of comprising our operating leverage."" In FY'14, CFFO grew 15% from $47m to $54m YoY. As the CEO explained, ""cash generation remains deeply important to us and as we demonstrated in our 2015 forecast, we expect another year of double-digit improvement in cash flow from operations.""The company will continue to benefit from the closure of service centers and a 10% reduction of its workforce, an uptick in the traditional reprographics business and continued growth in its (now core) contract, on-site services. Longer-term, AIM services should add incremental sales and profits to the bottom line.Assuming an 8x multiple, ARC is worth $13 per share on $100m in EBITDA. Notably, this does not take into account the significant free cash the company generates, which will be used to aggressively pay down its debt over the next several years.Sales have grown for seven straight quarters and gross margins have improved eight of the last nine quarters. This is the first time GPMs have expanded since 2006. EBITDA margins reached 17.1% in FY'2014 after bottoming out at 13.1% in Q2'12. It is clear from listening to the last several conference calls that management believes margins will continue to recover. The company estimates 36% of its costs are fixed as of year-end 2014. There is substantial leverage in the model.ARC expects to generate ~$77.5m in adjusted EBITDA in 2015. Assuming the average low multiple of 6x, the downside is ~$6 or -22%. If the company achieved the high-end of its multiple range, the upside is ~$12.50 or +63%. I believe there is an appropriate margin of safety, largely for three reasons: a) ARC has demonstrated an ability to generate consistent FCF, b) ARC has dramatically improved its capital structure and c) ARC continues to spend on sales/marketing and product development (Abacus, PlanWell, SKYSITE, etc.) to aggressively become the vendor-of-choice in the AEC marketplace as the industry shifts to cloud-based, digital solutions.Inflection Point:After the unrelenting downturn in the non-residential construction market over the past five years, there have been signs that the industry is stabilizing over the past couple of quarters. The American Institute of Architects (AIA) forecasts construction spending will increase 7.7% in 2015 and 8.8% in 2016. In addition, commercial construction spending is projected to increase 11.8% in 2015. This is the first time post-recession that spending in all market sectors is projected to expand (architectmagazine.com, Jan. 29, 2015). The institutional sector saw monthly gains throughout the second half of 2014.ARC's CEO has been making cautiously optimistic statements over the past year and these comments are supported by the company's increasing sales (7 straight quarters):Q1'14 Highlights:Q2'14 Highlights:Overall sales grew +4% YoY in Q2'14 with every business unit except for traditional reprographics (-1% YoY) showing positive growth. Digital services grew +1% YoY, but Southern California's (CA represents 31% of 2013 total sales) digital sales grew +10%.As an indication of the company's leverage to positive sales, Q2'14's +4% top line sales translated into +10% growth in gross profits, +14% growth in EBITDA and +500% growth in EPS. ARC's CEO said, ""I see this pattern acceleration through the P&L continues for the foreseeable future.""Q3'14 Highlights:The company revised F.D. annual adjusted earnings per share outlook from $0.19-0.23 to a range of $0.24-0.27 and revised its adjusted EBITDA range from $69-71m to $71-74m.Q4'14 Highlights:Q1'15 Highlights:Business Description:ARC is a leading document solutions provider to businesses of all types with an emphasis on the non-residential segment of the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. (77% of Q1'15 revenues were AEC customers and 22% were Non-AEC customers). The company's value proposition: reduce customer costs, improve efficiency, access and control of documents by providing a variety of ways to print, produce, distribute, collaborate and store documents.Management believes ARC is the largest document solutions provider to the AEC market in N.A. and the only national provider offering on-site, off-site and cloud-based document solution management solutions for regional, national and global customers.ARC serves its clients on-site in ~8,600 locations, off-site via 178 service centers globally and through a variety of web-based applications and software. The company has > 90,000 customers including most of the largest AEC firms in N.A. and many of the top design and construction companies in the World (Gensler, AECOM, etc.). ARC serves nearly all of the top 100 AEC companies in the U.S. and has long-term contract relationships with 22 of the largest 50 AEC firms.Highlights from the company's 10-K (Competitive Strengths):ARC software like Abacus, PlanWell, AIM, and most recently SKYSITE, are examples of its leadership supporting the specific needs of the AEC industry.Risks (Where I could be wrong):The company still derives 30% of its total revenues from California.Moreover, 36% of the company's costs are fixed. A sustained downturn in non-residential construction would pressure margins.The company continues to invest in sales, marketing and product development to take advantage of the industry transitioning to cloud-based solutions (""nobody is going to do distribution of documents without using the cloud"" -ARC CEO Q3'14 Call). The transition is likely to be non-linear. Further, ARC may not be successful in capturing the opportunity. The ""earlier addressable market was about $4-6 billion; now we have an addressable market of ~$16 billion. Over the next 3-5 years, we will continue to invest in these areas…"" - ARC CEO on Q3'14 CallThe company is concentrating on larger clients as it moves from a point solution (blueprints) to a full service providers (document solutions), which could create some lumpiness in near-term results.The traditional reprographics business peaked near $300m in sales when ARC's sales reached ~$700m in 2007. This business is not likely to return to such levels as the industry shifts to digital solutions. ARC needs to replace high-margin ""blueprint"" business with recurring cloud-based digital solutions, but the transition will take time.The energy complex could impact results in 2015: ""While the outlook for non-residential construction market remains generally positive, the results of the oil and gas flat earlier this year are starting to play out and some questions around the general economy are beginning to emerge."" - ARC CEO on Q1'15 CallCompetition: ARC competes for MPS service contracts with many of its equipment suppliers such as Xerox, HP and Canon. Investors often compare ARC to Xerox, but Xerox does not even have a large format printer to sell to AEC customers. Moreover, Xerox has to outfit customers with enough equipment to meet the customer's max capacity (may only be needed sparingly). On the other hand, ARC can cut max capacity requirements by ~40% since it has 175 service centers to handle overflow needs.Although ARC competes with different firms in its different business lines, its competitors cannot offer integrated software or technology that enables the digital management of documents or centralized cost control management that ARC provides. Equipment resellers are limited to enabling customers' print needs by selling or leasing print equipment, thereby incurring the customer a fixed cost. In comparison, ARC turns the fixed cost into a pay per use model for its customers by using proprietary software, PlanWell and Abacus.Business Units:In Q1'15, ARC changed its reporting segments to the following:CDIM gross margins are expected in the 37-40% range.MPS gross margins are expected in the 32-35% range.AIM gross margins are expected in the 35-38% range.Traditional Reprographics:ARC is the largest reprographics company in the US (scale advantages). The traditional reprographics segment reported its best quarter (-1% YoY sales) in Q2 in several years. In fact, based on current industry trends and management commentary, this segment could start to generate positive sales soon. As the CEO said on the Q2'14 call, ""The project activity is definitely starting to pick up across the country, there is no doubt about that no matter where you go, you are starting to see cranes, especially in large cities.""The business segment is operating at 50% of capacity (even after a significant restructuring of service centers). According to ARC's investor relations, traditional reprographics has 70% incremental margins as the cost of equipment, rent and depreciation are fixed. Traditional reprographics has 35-40% gross margins (in the prior peak they reached 41-42%).Although volume per project is in secular decline (now running 30-40% of prior peak) due to the industry's transition from analog to digital services, ARC will benefit from the high incremental margins as the number of projects increases. Importantly, ARC has not experienced pricing pressure - the decline in this business is volume related.As the CEO recently said,Onsite Services (FM and MPS):Onsite services - facilities management (FM) and managed print services (MPS) have been growing 10%+ for the past three years and are expected to continue to grow double-digits for at least the next three years.Currently, the segment has 30-35% gross margins, but management sees a clear path to 37% over the next 3-6 quarters as the company continues to build out robust tools to efficiently manage its print assets. The company is able to analyze profits per customer or per location and soon will have the data to analyze profits on a per machine per customer per location basis.MPS is an enterprise level sale where ARC takes over a client's entire internal printing operation, i.e. ARC owns and manages the equipment onsite. In many cases, print spend is an afterthought for most businesses; therefore, ARC does not face much competition (see competition section below). ARC has found that many clients have ink cartridges for printers that no longer exist.For example, AECOM, a very large E&C company, has been an MPS customer for four years. When ARC took over, 98% of AECOM's print cost was overhead. Today, overhead is 32% of the costs. AECOM may spend upwards of $9-10m on print per year and ARC has turned this into a variable cost charging what's called a ""click"" rate and thus lowering AECOM's total cost of ownership.ARC is the #1 MPS provider in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry and Gartner ranks ARC as the 9th largest MPS provider in the world.On the Q2'14 call, management estimated MPS's growth rate at 10-15% and FM's growth rate at 5% with MPS making up 60-65% of onsite sales. Management went on to say ""growth continues to remain strong and just as important far less vulnerable to the seasonal activity that characterize our former project-centric business model. This means that our largest offering provides relatively stable recurring revenue.""The Street is missing ARC's transformation. As the CEO recently said,And, ""The majority of our revenue is quickly moving to recurring service based revenue, it's very predictable, very seeable, in contracts that our software-as-a-service based and we're going to continue that ARC over the next 18 to 24 months to be an enterprise content management company."" -ARC CEOArchived Information Management (AIM):ARC has plans to digitize, store and search/retrieve the world's many architectural, engineering and construction documents. Architects are required to keep documents for at least 15 years and in some cases indefinitely. These documents are in dusty boxes in basements or offsite storage facilities and likely not very well organized and certainly difficult to retrieve. ARC intends to change this. ARC competes against companies like Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM). IRM may charge as much as $20,000 per month for its storage services. ARC intends to undercut IRM's pricing by charging something like $17,000 per month for the first 3 years and then drop the pricing significantly from there. ARC estimates it can achieve 40% gross margins during the first three-year period and then 90% margins thereafter.The company is making progress. For example, recent client wins include San Francisco International Airport, Alaska Airlines, Shell Oil in New Orleans and Houston, and TY Lin International, a world renowned engineering firm. As these examples indicate, AIM is expanding ARC's business beyond its traditional AEC customer base.Conclusion:Insiders own ~12% of the stock at ARC and in a sign of good corporate governance; management went six years without accepting a performance bonus. In those six years, the senior management team never took a full salary either.ARC has a long history of positive economic performance (positive free cash flow through the worst of the downturn). It's the undisputed leader in the AEC industry and > 75% of sales are based in North America.The US economy and specifically non-residential construction are doing better (traditional reprographics trends are stabilizing… Q4'14 YoY sales were flat). ARC's largest business unit now (by total sales at 30%) is its faster growing, recurring onsite service business - a business that is expected to show double-digit growth for the next 3 years.In short, old Wall Street memories die hard: ARC's resiliency and ongoing transformation is underappreciated. As investors become more familiar with the positive changes in its business model and begin to recognize the leverage to the uptick in non-residential construction, the stock will re-rate higher and trade into the mid-teens."
3716746,56112,2015-12-01T07:00:00-05:00,"ARC management has done a great job of repositioning the business amidst secular headwinds.However, I believe those headwinds are potentially stronger than bulls (or management) believe.I think ARC stock is undervalued at $5, but have a hard time reaching bull-case valuations of $10+.I will continue to watch ARC and would consider purchasing it at a future time.","More than half a decade into a bull market, having a value bent usually results in reviewing a lot of businesses in mature/unattractive industries that the market has left for dead. ARC Document Solutions (NYSE:ARC), formerly known as American Reprographics Company, is one such name. The legacy reprographics segment (printing blueprints and other large-format documents for the architecture, engineering, and construction industry) faces obvious challenges as document management increasingly moves online. To management's credit, they have been quick to react, building an impressive managed print services business and introducing multiple software solutions to help their clients keep data organized and usable. My question is whether this will be enough to create significant value for shareholders.I Think The Bull Case Is OverstatedI won't spend too much time reiterating the bull case, which has been laid out in multiple Seeking Alpha articles over the past year, such as this one by ACM Research and this one by Ross O'Toole. Briefly, the company's traditional reprographics business is a cash cow that walks and talks like it's in terminal decline, although it may receive a near-term boost from continued strengthening of non-residential construction (with or without a highway bill). Cash flow from this business has been used to rapidly delever the balance sheet, while the company sees growth coming from its Managed Print Services offering as well as new software products.I'll start with MPS. I think the company has numerous advantages in this segment versus OEMs that manufacture hardware, for the simple reason that the company is hardware-agnostic. If a Canon printer is better for certain workflows and an HP inkjet is better for others, ARC is free to mix and match to its clients' benefit - whereas the manufacturer is obviously unlikely to say ""hey, you should buy some printers from our competitors.""There is also opportunity for real value creation for clients in MPS, as print services are often currently managed by ""everyone"" or ""nobody"" - resulting in significant inefficiencies and overhead expense. In the first year, ARC can often reduce print spend for its clients by 10-30%.The problem with this model, of course, is that your entire value proposition is to get your clients to spend less rather than more on printing. For this reason, ARC management has been quite forthright that they require new account sales to achieve their target of high single digit sales growth. The sales process with major enterprise clients can take a while, and the implementation of several major contracts got pushed out, causing MPS sales to decline year-on-year and management to reset adjusted EBITDA guidance to $70 - $73 million.This caused the stock to plummet from $6.50 to under $5.00, but I think it misses the bigger issue. Management insists that they expect managed print volumes to be largely flat after the optimization-caused declines in Year 1 - but I feel this is too optimistic and believe that it is much more appropriate to model a low single digit decline rate until proven otherwise. An assumption of flat print volumes going forward doesn't match up at all with either intuition or data. All my friends under the age of 30 print only when it's absolutely necessary, versus older managers who may prefer to print out 20-page reports rather than reading them on a screen. Even in fields like law which are notoriously print-heavy, the tide is starting to turn towards digital - software vendor Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL), which I've written about previously, sees e-filing as an area of particular strong growth over the next few years. Print isn't going away overnight, but the march towards technology is inexorable and will be hastened by demographics as more and more Boomers retire and are replaced by Millennials.Recent data points from print OEMs don't do much to support the case either; HP, for example, had to cut EPS guidance immediately after splitting its enterprise business from its PC/printers business. While a lot of the double-digit decline is attributable to currency-driven pricing pressures, HP printing segment EVP Dion Weisler's commentary is not exactly inspiring:And as David Rold from Needham, previously bullish on HP, put it after earnings:I know this may come off as flogging a dead horse - but I think it's important. Many of the bullish write-ups, such as this one on VIC, believe that the business merits an 8x EBITDA multiple. That is perhaps not unreasonable if MPS achieves its growth targets - but if existing MPS customers see a 2-3% annual decline in revenue vs. staying flat, then all of a sudden high single digit growth becomes much harder to achieve, particularly as the size of the installed base gets larger and a few new major contracts may not move the needle as much on an annual basis.The Software Is Interesting, But The Space is CompetitiveNow we come to the software solutions - AIM and Skysite. Respectively, these allow companies to digitize their archives and collaboratively share construction documents across device types. The value proposition for both is clear, the software seems well-regarded, and ARC's who's-who roster of clients in AEC provides it with an advantage on the sales side. The market opportunity here is large; construction is one of those industries that in many ways never left the 1980s, and I've been interested in areas like 3D BIM for a while now.From a valuation perspective, though, it's hard to give ARC too much credit quite yet for these products. Not only are the segments in their infancy, but there's also a tremendous amount of competition. I'm less concerned about general document-sharing platforms like Box (NYSE:BOX) or Dropbox, as these are geared more towards general office documents than the specific needs of the construction industry - but companies like AutoDesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) integrate document management into their software packages (ex. here).Finally, it's worth remembering that there will be at least some degree of cannibalization here - the easier it is for customers to manage workflow digitally, the less likely they are to use either on-site or off-site print services. ARC is trying to mitigate this by pushing the software harder with clients who are already using lower print volumes, but it's still worth thinking about.Capital IntensityThe final question I have relates to capital intensity. Over the past few years, the company has been spending ~$30MM annually on capex. Although some of this shows up under operating leases rather than cash capex, if you add the two together, this is a reasonable number to come to for modeling purposes.This capex is mostly concentrated on MPS rather than the legacy reprographics business, where ARC has actually been consolidating operations and have significant underutilized capacity. Management's number for maintenance capex at zero growth is around two-thirds of what they're spending now, or $20MM - which seems high.Using rough numbers, $70 in EBITDA less $20 in maintenance capex leads to $35MM in fully tax-effected run-rate unlevered free cash flow before growth investments. I say unlevered because I'm ignoring interest payments for now, just trying to evaluate the enterprise without capital structure concerns. (Yes, I am aware of the NOLs, but I prefer to think of things in tax-effected terms.)This is certainly a good chunk of cash flow in light of the enterprise value, particularly with the availability of cheap debt… but you have to believe the business is truly stable rather than at risk of declining (which is my assessment of the future prospects of MPS). If you have to keep signing some new clients merely to offset lost volume from existing clients, then true ""maintenance"" capex is higher and the return on growth capex is lower.Summing it UpAll told, I do think ARC is undervalued at $5, and I want to like the story - management has done a great job of controlling what they can, and has a significant portion of their net worth on the line right next to shareholders.But I'm not yet convinced that the headwinds they face are going to let up anytime soon. This is another one of those cheap-if stocks - it's cheap if the reprographics business stabilizes, it's cheap if MPS can achieve high-single-digit growth, it's cheap if the software businesses take off.As I mentioned in my Harte-Hanks writeup, I'm a little gunshy on cheap-if stocks right now. This is both due to experience (I've been involved with several where the ""ifs"" turned out to be more like ""nots"") as well as behavioral economics. I generally think it's a sound idea to discount management expectations a little bit because everyone thinks their company is an above-average child of Lake Wobegon.I forget where I saw it, I think it was a McKinsey report a few years ago - but it was one of those fun infographics where a majority of S&P 500 CFOs simultaneously believed their companies were undervalued and that the S&P 500 overall was fairly to overvalued. A majority of drivers mathematically cannot be above average, but a significant majority believes they are indeed above average and immune to all the foibles that ""other people"" are subject to.So with this framework, it's nothing against ARC management; I actually like them quite a lot. It's just that projecting a flat underlying print volume environment over the long term defies the simple reality that there is less and less need to print stuff with each passing year. A small (2-3%) decline would probably be manageable, but if the rate accelerated to mid-single digits, things could get dicey.That said, ARC is a lot more attractive to me than HHS and some other left-for-dead old businesses, and I don't have much trouble justifying a fair value in the $7 - 8 range. So I agree with the direction of the bull case, just not the scope - given other opportunities available to me, my fair value estimate doesn't provide quite enough upside for me to justify taking on the risk that both traditional reprographics and MPS continue to deliver underwhelming results.ARC is one I will continue to watch, though, and if the price stays where it is, I might consider taking a bite six months down the road once they've paid down a little more debt and are closer to being able to return capital to shareholders."
3047826,24361,2015-04-03T10:15:53-04:00,"ARC has made steady progress in expanding its onsite offerings to the architecture, engineering, and construction market, with a particular focus on managed printing services.ARC can make a valid value proposition to clients on the basis of reduced printing/document costs and greater ease of use through digital archiving and document management.Ongoing penetration of managed print services in ARC's traditional market can support a fair value above $10 with potential upside from a non-resi construction rebound and/or expansion outside traditional markets.","ARC Document Solutions (NYSE:ARC) is still an unknown name to a large swath of Wall Street. Two sell-side analysts cover the stock and there has been no coverage on Seeking Alpha since my piece a year ago. During that year, though, these shares have climbed about 20% as the company has continued to make progress in transitioning from a heavy reliance on architecture/engineering/construction (or AEC)-based reprographics toward managed print services, color printing, and digital archiving.I've been impressed with what I've seen in terms of the company's ability to offer an expanded array of services to its traditional customer base while also trying to expand beyond its roots in the AEC sector. I believe ARC is still poised to benefit from a recovering AEC sector and success in expanding outside of the AEC sector would offer some upside. I think the shares are undervalued below $10 but a disappointing fourth quarter did cost the company some credibility and management needs to rebuild confidence in the prospects for consistent high single-digit/low double-digit EBITDA growth.Still A Play On AECExpanding beyond its traditional market of architecture, engineering, and construction customers is a long-term opportunity for ARC Document Solutions, but the percentage of the company's revenue generated from the AEC sector actually increased from 2013 to 2014 (from 76% to 77%).That ARC managed mid-single digit revenue growth in 2014 wasn't due to a meaningful recovery in the traditional reprographics business (revenue was down about 3% year over year), but rather to an expanded array of services offered to a market that the company knows well and where the company enjoys a good reputation.Onsite services, which includes both project-based printing (related to the traditional repgrographic service offerings) and the growing managed print services business, is driving the growth (up 11% year over year) as management makes its case to clients that it can save them meaningful percentages of their printing costs.While almost all firms have printing costs as a part of their cost of doing business, these are not often particularly well-managed costs and that's even more true for AEC firms, which tend to have printing needs (and costs) above the corporate average. What ARC can do for these firms is step in and manage this part of their cost base. At the simplest level, ARC can take advantage of bulk purchases of supplies and help clients avoid on-demand replacement (which means ordering from Office Depot or the like and paying more). ARC can do a lot more, though, including assessing a client's actual printing needs and making sure that the business has the right number and right type of printers, as well as analyzing and managing workflow in a way to reduce unnecessary printing and printing expenses.Trying To Establish A Competitive AdvantageThis is admittedly a business where it is difficult to establish a proprietary edge, particularly when the company competes against huge printing companies like Xerox (NYSE:XRX), Canon (NYSE:CAJ), Minolta (OTCPK:KNCAY), and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ). I do believe, though, that ARC has some advantages that can support its business growth.First, ARC is not in the business of manufacturing printers/copiers or printing/copying supplies. Consequently, I don't see the same scope for conflicts of interest that a company like Xerox, Canon, Minolta, or HP may have - instead, ARC can structure the business in such a way where it bases its fees/revenue as a percentage of the money it saves for its clients. Likewise, ARC can be ""platform neutral,"" using the best brand/model for one task and the best (but different) brand/model for a different task - does seem as likely that Xerox or HP would be eager to say ""you should really use our rival's product for that job""?Also, it is not fair to say that ARC has no proprietary offerings. The company's Abacus software allows for the capture, reproduction, storage, and management of a variety of document types. The sort of documents that AEC firms need aren't always (or even often) your basic 8.5 x 11, so handling a variety of documents (and facilitating their use on tablets, management via the internet, etc.) is important.I also think ARC can benefit from its knowledge, experience, and reputation in the AEC space. ARC established itself as far and away the largest provider of reprographic services in the country (approximately 10x the next competitor) and I believe that gives the company added insight into the workflow and real printing needs for AEC firms. As managed print services isn't about cutting costs at any cost (to a point where it actually interferes with or compromises the work), knowing how to manage the workflow efficiently could be an underappreciated advantage for ARC relative to Xerox et al.Of course, that industry experience cuts both ways - it serves ARC well within its traditional AEC client base, but it won't help the company as much as it tries to diversify outside of AEC. I do believe that stretching past the AEC sector is important for the long-term health of the company, but the opportunity to offer expanded on-site services within AEC is large enough to support meaningful growth in the short term and midterm, while giving the company time to add the personnel and experience it needs for growth outside the sector.Additional Service Offerings And The Possibility Of Repro RecoveryIn addition to growing its color reprographic business (a segment which has applications outside of the traditional AEC space), ARC has been introducing more archiving and information management services. Archiving documents is one of those tasks that is important and necessary for the long term, but can be tedious and time consuming in the short term. Likewise, accessing those archived documents can be challenging and time consuming. I don't see ARC challenging Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM) anytime soon, but the ability to access archived materials from anywhere (and do so securely) is compelling.There is also the potential of a recovery in basic reprographic services to consider. ARC's traditional operations, reproducing the blueprints and other construction/engineering documents, is still valid and should still offer leverage to an ongoing non-residential recovery. The AEC industry is changing, with more firms embracing electronic/digital approaches, but there is still a need for these services and ARC can leverage that with its growing digital management and archiving service offerings.Steady Growth Can Support A Higher PriceI'm no longer modeling a big upturn in non-residential construction, but I think that a slower, steadier recovery in construction and growing penetration of value-added services like managed print services and digital archiving can drive steady mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth for ARC. At this point, I'm not explicitly modeling a big expansion in non-AEC business, but that does leave success here as a potential source of future upside. The primary reason I'm not modeling this is that we're talking about a pretty small company with limited marketing resources today - I think management will be careful to not over-commit or overextend itself chasing these opportunities but will instead try to expand gradually into ancillary/adjacent markets.On the margin side, I'm looking for steady improvement back into low double-digit FCF margins. While managed print services and archiving aren't likely to support huge margin expansion, it also shouldn't require tremendous ongoing capex investments to support.The Bottom LineDiscounting those cash flows back to today, I come up with a fair value above $10 for ARC shares. A faster/steeper non-residential construction recovery would offer upside, as would faster expansion outside of the AEC sector, and/or a faster uptake of these new service offerings. Given the recovery seen to date and today's price, I don't see ARC as quite as compelling as it was a year ago, but I think management deserves praise for the progress it has made in remaking the business and I think this can continue to be a strong (though maybe not spectacular) story for some time to come."

1713062,24361,2013-09-25T13:51:15-04:00,,"The multi-year decline in commercial construction has been particularly painful for ARC Document Solutions (NYSE:ARC) (formerly known as American Reprographics). Despite having the only national reprographic services business in the country and five to 10 times the market share of its closest competitor, revenue in 2012 was only 40% of what it used to be in 2008 as the company's core architecture/engineering/construction market has gone into deep hibernation.Although I've been writing on companies that I believe can leverage improving construction activity into higher share prices, I'm not completely sure where ARC Document fits into that group. I updated my research and models on ARC hoping to find an overlooked potential gem, but I'm just not sure that's what this is. The reprographics industry is changing and I'm not confident that the margins in the managed print services business will come close to what the company has achieved in the past. Although I can construct a bullish argument that would put ARC Document's potential fair value into the double-digits, my base-case assumption is much lower and not as much of a bargain relative to today's price when factoring in the risks of the company's changing business and end-markets.Reprographics Is ChangingReprographics refers to the reproduction of graphics-intensive documents through a variety of means (diazo, photographic, laser/ink jet, and so on), but in this case it refers specifically to the reproduction of architectural/engineering blueprints. For a typical commercial building project, there can be some fairly hefty document needs, as there will be plans for separate systems (electrical, plumbing, HVAC, etc.) and new plans are needed whenever changes are made.While the market isn't huge (about $4.5 billion by some estimates), ARC has benefited from the fact that the industry is hugely fragmented, with literally thousands of players and most of them small shops that serve local markets. Through acquisitions and a hub-and-spoke network of centers, ARC built a national presence that once had over 20% market share, with about 75% of the revenue coming from the architecture/engineering/construction (AEC) markets.And then came the commercial construction crash. I don't think there's any need to rehash that here; suffice it to say, commercial construction activity has dropped significantly, and taken reprographic demand with it. ARC responded by closing branches and finding new services it could offer, but I nevertheless worry that the industry is continuing to evolve. While ARC does offer technology that allows for the digital management of documents, I do worry that the company's traditional reprographic operations are looking at a major change in the structure and profitability of the business as users move away from physical plans and towards digital options.Can Managed Print Services Fill The Gap?Although ARC Document Solutions consistently posted double-digit free cash flow margins in the good times, those margins have plunged into the single digits on the weaker volume/revenue of recent years. One of my prime concerns is that the company's new focus on managed print services isn't going to help that all that much.For quite some time now, ARC has offered ""facilities management"" services as part of its overall reprographics business - the company would install printers, other equipment, and software management tools in customers' offices (usually in the AEC sector), collecting per-use service fees.Now the company is going a step further and embracing the managed print services (MPS) opportunity. In MPS, a company steps in and manages the printing and document needs for an enterprise client. With enterprises spending about 1% to 3% of their revenue on printing costs and MPS providers advertising cost savings of 10% to 30%, it's an appealing market that I've seen Xerox (NYSE:XRX) estimate at over $130 billion.It's a tricky prospect for ARC, though. While it's no secret that large enterprises are absolutely obsessed with cutting costs whenever and wherever possible, large companies like Xerox, Canon (NYSE:CAJ), Ricoh (OTCPK:RICOY), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), and Lexmark (NYSE:LXK) are already in this market. What's more, companies like Xerox and HP can package a much wider array of businesses services into their pitch, with document management almost a ""throw in"".While it is true that ARC Documents' facilities management business was/is higher-margin than its core reprographics business, picking through the 10-Ks and 10-Qs of these companies doesn't suggest robust margins for their MPS services. Given that a lot of the services are relatively straightforward and not proprietary (better allocating hardware needs, shifting more work to desktop/digital, automating the delivery of supplies like toner), it doesn't strike me as a business likely to offer impressive margins.Growth Is The Big UnknownI have to give credit to ARC Documents for continuing to generate free cash flow through and despite the worst commercial building environment in over 30 years. Likewise, I applaud management's willingness to look beyond traditional reprographics and to MPS and non-AEC color printing services to grow its addressable market and rebuild revenue and free cash flow.I just have some substantial doubts about what the company can achieve in terms of revenue growth and cash flow margins. In particular, I think the growing contribution of MPS and the potential reduced demand for traditional reprographics (due to shifts toward digital and so on) risks capping free cash flow margins in the high single digits.My base-case assumption is for over 7% revenue growth over the coming decade, with over 9% growth in reprographics (with a higher growth rate over the next five years from an expected commercial building rebound) and 8% growth in MPS. With high single-digit free cash flow margins, that works out to about $6 per share today after subtracting the substantial net debt.What about a more bullish scenario? If a sharper recovery in the commercial building market could power a stronger reprographics recovery (12% long-term growth) and the changes in demand (digital etc.) don't seriously compromise past double-digit free cash flow margins, the company could generate over 10% long-term revenue growth, over 20% cash flow growth, and deserve a fair value in the low to mid teens.The Bottom LineI don't come out of this update on ARC Document Solutions quite as bullish as I expected to be, as I really have some doubts about the company's chances of building share in MPS and generating good margins there. Still, my base-case assumptions for the company do not require a huge rebound in commercial construction and still offer decent upside (20%+), particularly if the bullish scenario is at all possible.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

36093,20805,2007-05-21T04:59:39-04:00,,"American Reprographics (NYSE:ARP) is the undisputed leader in the $5bn reprographics industry. Reprographics services typically encompass the digital management and reproduction of construction documents or other graphics-related material and the corresponding finishing and distribution services. The business-to-business services ARP provides to its customers includes document management, document distribution and logistics, print-on-demand, and a combination of these services in its customers’ offices as on-site services, often referred to as “facilities management.” The company serves 73,000 active clients through a network of 230 branches and 3,015 facilities management contracts with a total staff of 4,500. ARP generates 65% of its revenue from the non-residential construction sector with the balance coming from residential construction (15%) and general commercial printing (20%). The Company’s flagship PlanWell software that allows for the creation of online planrooms is well positioned to become the industry standard for managing and procuring reprographics services within the AEC industry. American Reprographics, whose headquarters is in Glendale, California, generates just under half of its revenue within its home state.

The IRgA indicates that the reprographics industry is highly fragmented, consisting of approximately 3,000 firms with average annual sales of approximately $1.5 million and 20 to 25 employees. Since construction documents are the primary medium of communication for the AEC industry, demand for reprographics services in the AEC market is closely tied to the level of activity in the construction industry, which in turn is driven by macroeconomic trends such as GDP growth, interest rates, job creation, office vacancy rates, and tax revenues. According to FMI Corporation, or FMI, a consulting firm to the construction industry, construction industry spending in the United States for 2006 was estimated at $1.2 trillion, with expenditures divided between residential construction 53.1% and commercial and public, or non-residential, construction 46.9%. The $4.5 billion reprographics industry is approximately 0.4% of the $1.2 trillion construction industry in the United States. ARP’s AEC revenues are most closely correlated to the nonresidential sectors of the construction industry, which are the largest users of reprographics services.According to FMI, the non-residential sectors of the construction industry are projected to grow at an average of 8.3% per year over the next three years. Market opportunities for business-to-business document management services are rapidly expanding into non-AEC industries. For example, non-AEC customers are increasingly using large and small format color imaging for point-of-purchase displays, digital publishing, presentation materials, educational materials and marketing materials as these services have become more efficient and available on a short-run, on-demand basis through digital technology. As a result, ARP’s addressable market is substantially larger than the core AEC reprographics market. Key Highlights Key Financial Highlights Key Trading Highlights The obvious negative to the Company is that it is tied to a cyclical sector – i.e., Commercial Construction. However to the Company’s credit, during the previous 2001-2003 downturn, ARP was able to preserve margins while revenues remained flat. The Company’s overseas expansion strategy should be able to smooth out some of that volatility and add a more secular theme to the story. Catalysts  ARP 1-yr chart  Disclosure: none"
229670,21863,2010-10-12T16:03:41-04:00,,"American Reprographics Company (NYSE:ARP)  provides document-management services primarily to the architectural,  engineering and construction (AEC) industries. Since those are cyclical  industries, demand for ARP's services has taken a beating, but not as  much as the company's stock price. The company trades for $360 million,  but has generated operating cash flow superior to that over the last  four years, and expects to generate at least $65 million in cash flow  this year as well.   The company's earnings picture is not so pretty, however. It has  taken large charges as a result of both Goodwill writedowns and annual  intangible amortization. But these are non-cash charges, so while they  make the company's P/E look high and/or negative, they are for items the  company has already paid for, i.e. they do not affect current cash  flow.  These ""items the company has already paid for"" are other firms ARP has  acquired. ARP's strategy is to grow by acquisition and benefit from  economies of scale that such a market share advantage allows (including  spreading out R&D costs over more customers, lowering equipment  purchase prices etc). The company is doing well in that regard, as it  has approximately nine times as many locations as its nearest competitor.   But despite the fact that the company is profitable in a trough-revenue  environment and trades cheaply relative to its cash flow, there are some  risks facing potential investors of this stock. First, the company  financed its acquisition growth using debt. While the company's strong  cash flow has allowed it to reduce its total debt by almost $75 million  in the last five quarters, it still has a net debt position (including  operating leases) of around $300 million. Much of that debt is due in  just over 2 years. As a result, if things turn south for the economy or  the company, it does not have a lot of financial leeway. On the other  hand, management has stated that if revenues do drop further, it does  have the ability to reduce expenses by closing the least profitable of  its almost 300 locations.  In general, the company hasn't made great decisions with respect to  capital allocation. It did a stock buyback in 2007 when the share price  was much higher, and now has to focus on debt repayment when the stock  price is much lower. Furthermore, it ratcheted up its Goodwill balance  during the boom years by buying high (resulting in recent writedowns),  and now lacks the gumption to make acquisitions while target companies  likely sit at much more attractive prices.  As a result, the company's tangible assets are actually negative!  Therefore, one really has to believe in the earnings power of this  company before one invests. That requires understanding this industry,  including the technological risks that are both threats and  opportunities for this company. (Technological advances are making it  cheaper to print higher quality documents, for example. This could  increase volumes for the company, but could also be a disruptive force  in the industry if the company is not on the ball.)  Management incentives do seem aligned with shareholders, as the CEO  effectively owns 17% of the company's shares, dwarfing his salary (which is a good thing).  Many executives also took temporary pay cuts over the last two years as  part of the company's cost reduction plan. At the same time, however,  it should be noted that the company did exchange a bunch of options with  exercise prices averaging $24.50 for options with exercise prices of  just $8 during April of 2009, when the stock market was in rough shape.  This reeks of an employee cash grab, but was fully expensed. And, considering the CEO's ownership position and subsequent pay cut, it may  have been an important incentive offering on his part to retain key  employees through the downturn.  Finally, it is worth noting that the company is managing to increase  market share despite the drop in revenue. This is because of new  initiatives ARP has been pushing, including expanding in markets outside  of AEC by taking advantage of technological advances that are lowering  color printing costs. The company is also growing (albeit from a small  base) in its Chinese operations, and has been successful in a new  initiative where it offers services at the customer's own location. As  such, management is confident that the company is well-positioned to  grow revenues once the AEC market returns to normal.  When tangible book value is low (or in this case, non-existent),  investors cannot rely on a margin of safety in the form of assets. Only  if the company falls within the investor's circle of competence can he  properly evaluate whether the company's earnings power does in fact  offer that margin of safety. If earnings in the future are as they were  in the past, this company is a strong candidate for a value investment.  Disclosure: None"
2121393,24361,2014-04-02T19:34:06-04:00,"Basic document service demand seems to be recovering, with onsite service demand up double-digits.Non-residential construction, a key market for the company's clients, is only just starting to recover.A switch from paper to digital is a threat, but the company's service offerings continue to expand.","ARC Document Solutions (NYSE:ARC) is barely followed on the Street, but this small cap document services company has undergone some pretty compelling changes even as its traditional core market (reprographic services for architecture/engineering/construction) has seen severe stress over the last six or seven years. With the company still generating around three-quarters of its revenue from that AEC end market and non-residential construction picking up, there could be good revenue and margin growth potential for a company that has already shown a good knack for maintaining FCF through tough times.Changes For The BetterARC Document's core (traditional) reprographics business still has not recovered, as revenue fell more than 2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. To add some scale to the discussion, consider that traditional reprographics revenue has fallen from $225 million for the full year 2009 to $117 million for 2013 (a fall of 48%), as overall sales have fallen about 20%. Gross profits have fallen 25% and operating income is still down about 40% over the stretch (after adjusting for impairments and other charges), but I would argue that many companies have done much worse under similar circumstances.ARC Documents has responded to challenges in its core market in a variety of ways. Growing the onsite services business has been a significant part of that, as revenue has grown about 25% since 2009 and grew 12% year-over-year in 2013. This is a higher-margin business than its traditional reprographics services, and it tends to be stickier as well as it offers meaningful convenience and cost containment options.ARC Documents is also using that as a platform for addition services. The company has been expanding its managed print services operations (or MPS), and using its foothold in the AEC industry as a strong starting point.MPS is pretty simple on the face of it. Companies like Xerox (NYSE:XRX) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) basically come in and manage a company's printing and document needs, saving them about 10% to 30% a year on their printing and document costs (which are typically about 1% to 3% of revenue). At the midpoints, 20% of 2% isn't much, but think about what an extra half-point of operating margin can mean to companies desperate to show the Street that they can streamline and reduce costs.Although this does not appear to be a particularly high-margin business on its own, I suspect the incremental margins are quite a bit more attractive when ARC Documents moves from facilities management at existing AEC clients to include MPS - they're already ""in the building"" so to speak.Can Service Growth Outside Of Reprographics Move The Needle?ARC Documents definitely positions itself as more of a universal document services company. The company's digital services include functions like archiving and organizing documents and ""digital shipping"" where companies can use ARC Documents' various service centers to avoid shipping physical documents over long distances. It sounds simple, but it's not something that a lot of companies want to do for themselves (think about a smaller company tasking someone with scanning and archiving drawers full of old documents and files).Color printing services are also a meaningful (20%) component of revenue. It's my understanding that this is one of the operations with a larger non-AEC customer mix, and that offers some diversification. There is always going to be a need for high-quality color printing, particularly when it involves specialized formats that go beyond your basic 8.5 x 11 spiral-bound presentation material.I don't see these services being a major growth opportunity (Xerox's document outsourcing business has grown 4% and 2% over the past two years), but they strike me as credible incremental opportunities. By and large ARC Documents already has the capability to offer these services in place at its service centers, so as long as the incremental business is profitable, why not go for it?Can A Construction Recovery Fuel Better Growth?ARC Documents' core AEC market has certainly undergone changes over the last decade, with many clients increasingly moving from hard copies to digital copies. Just as there is yet no such thing as a truly paperless office, this migration is not 100% for the company's customer base and there is still an opportunity to stay involved with digital document management and so on.I expect a recovery in non-residential construction to spur demand for the company's reprographic services, as well as its digital services and MPS. I'm looking for double-digit revenue growth over the next five years (albeit just barely), with long-term growth still in the mid-to-high single digits. I'm also looking for a meaningful improvement in free cash flow margins, though I have my concerns as to whether the changes in the reprographics market and the shift to MPS and digital services will allow a return to mid-to-high teens FCF margins. As it is, though, I'm looking for low teens free cash flow growth as the company rebounds.The Bottom LineThose basic assumptions still support over a dollar of additional upside to today's share price, and if the non-residential recovery really does bring back the good old days (including double-digit FCF margins), then a low-to-mid teens share price seems possible. These shares have already tripled from their late 2012 and early 2013 lows and while it is sometimes hard to buy a stock that has already had such a big run (and I'm certainly not expecting another short-term triple from here), there seems to be enough upside to make a closer look worthwhile.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

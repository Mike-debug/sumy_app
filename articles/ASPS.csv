With this turn not imminent, there is sufficient time to assess the company's transformation before becoming much more bullish.","Altisource (NASDAQ:ASPS) reported total revenues of US$508M in the first 9 months of 2019, a drop of -18% yoy. Revenues in Q3 were down -31% to US$141M. The majority of the revenue decline in Q3 will be permanent and was driven by the drop in other service revenue following the sale of the Financial Services business, the discontinuation of the BRS business and the termination of information technology infrastructure management services following Ocwen’s (NYSE:OCN) transition to another servicing platform. As a result, other services revenue dropped from an average of around US$41M per quarter in the first 9 months of last year to just US$3.8M in Q3 this year. This will also lead to a large yoy drop in revenues in Q4. Early Stage Business revenues will also drop to close to zero as Altisource is winding down the Owners.com business which generated revenues of US$5.9M in the first 9 months of 2019.Field Services and Mortgage and Real Estate Solutions showed declines of respectively -9% and -11% in Q3 (-6% and -15% 9m19). The decline was driven by a reduction in the size of the Ocwen services portfolio and number of delinquent loans. The trend in average number of delinquent loans serviced by Ocwen has been downwards, although stabilized somewhat in recent quarters. Hubzu inventory has also been on a downward trend.One factor that temporarily affected revenues was the impact of Ocwen’s transition to another servicing system on default related referral volume and REO inventory conversion rates. The Company estimates that revenue was approximately US$7.8M lower in the third quarter of 2019 because of lower REO inventory conversion rates related to Ocwen’s transition to a new servicing system. We expect Marketplace revenues to pick up again by US$8M vs. Q3 as the impact of Ocwen’s transition to another servicing system fades. Assuming flat qoq numbers for Field Services and Mortgage and Real Estate Solutions would result in a total revenue for Q4 in line with Q3 and total revenues for 2019 of US$649M of which US$622M in service revenues. This would be in line with lower end of the company’s potential 2019 scenarios.Sales breakdown by segmentSource: Altisource Form 10-Q September 30, 2019Average number of delinquent loans serviced by Ocwen ('000)Source: Altisource Third Quarter 2019 Supplementary InformationNumber of homes sold on HubzuSource: Altisource Third Quarter 2019 Supplementary Information Hubzu inventorySource: Altisource Third Quarter 2019 Supplementary Information2019 Potential ScenariosSource: Altisource Third Quarter 2019 Supplementary InformationFinancial Services, the BRS business and information technology infrastructure management services still generated revenues in the first half of 2019 and this will drop out in first half of 2020. However, revenues from the remaining core businesses are likely to struggle as well.While New Residential (NYSE:NRZ) will remain an important client of Ocwen in the coming years, we expect the company to continue to gradually shift subservicing internally over time (on new business). As a result, Altisource will need to significantly increase its revenues from other parties if it wants to become less dependent on Ocwen. While non-Ocwen/New Residential/Front Yard Residential Corp. (NYSE:RESI) business is growing, it remains unclear whether this will suffice to offset declining business elsewhere in the current environment. Thus, the most recent data from Black Knight shows November 2019 foreclosure numbers marked a 26% yoy decline. The 33,500 foreclosure number was the lowest monthly number since Black Knight began recording the metric in 2000. The total US loan delinquency rate amounted to 3.53%. The number of properties that are 90 or more days past due but not in foreclosure amounted to 439,000, a decline by 71,000 yoy. It takes a certain period to convert properties past due into actual foreclosures, suggesting a pick up might take time. In its January 2020 US Consumer Finance Outlook, Barclays noted peak delinquency rates on post crisis vintages are trending significantly lower than normalized levels. Historically, a normalized delinquency curve peaks in years 3-5 at between 4 and 6% of total loans written during the vintage years. On business written post crisis, delinquency curves seem to peak at significantly lower rates. A similar observation was made by Auction.com.Core business service revenue from customers other than Ocwen, NRZ and RESI growing Source: Altisource Third Quarter 2019 Supplementary InformationSeveral servicers have expanded into segments where Altisource is active. Mr. Cooper (NASDAQ:COOP) acquired Assurant Mortgage Services in 2018 which is now part of their Xome segment (press release). Xome provides a variety of real estate services to mortgage originators, mortgage and real estate investors, and mortgage servicers, including valuation, title, and field services, and operates an exchange which facilitates the sale of foreclosed properties. Approximately 53% of Xome revenues were generated from third parties in the first 9 months of 2019. Xome recorded total growth of 42% over that period. Third-party generated revenues more than doubled to US$168M. This compares to US$63M in service revenue for Altisource’s core business from customers other than Ocwen, NRZ and RESI. Xome sold 2,453 properties on their Exchange platform in Q3 vs. 2,695 sold on Hubzu. Year to date, Xome sold 7,519 properties compared to 9,673 for Altisource. Similarly as for Hubzu, the number of properties sold declined year on year, which is in line with the trend in foreclosed properties discussed earlier.Source: Mr. Cooper Form 10-Q September 30, 2019 Source: Mr Cooper Form 10-Q September 30, 2019 New Residential Investment Corp. acquired Guardian Asset Management in August 2019 (press release). Guardian Asset Management is a provider of field services and property management to government agencies, financial institutions and asset management firms. The company commented at the time: “The addition of Guardian, coupled with our existing investment in Covius, would allow New Residential to take another step forward in our strategy of building a full suite of ancillary services and growing revenues and earnings for our shareholders.” Covius is a provider of mortgage tech related services. New Residential does not break out these services as Mr. Cooper does but it makes sense for the company to shift internal field services orders to Guardian.Another peer is Auction.com. Its website states it has over 30,000 discounted residential bank-owned and foreclosure home deals which makes it substantially larger than Altisource's Hubzu inventory.Field services is a local market and players like New Residential and Mr. Cooper will still need to use third parties for certain states where they are not active. In an environment of increased foreclosures, capacity constraints will also come into play even in states where they are active.Despite the challenging top-line profile, the company’s valuation is not demanding. The company reported EBITDA/adjusted EBITDA of US$53M/US$55M for the first 9 months or a 10.4%/10.9% margin. The company confirmed it targets cost savings of US$8-10M from moving to the cloud. It also closed Owners.com and moved Pointillist to a separate entity for which it plans to raise outside equity in 2020. These 2 businesses generated a combined US$19M in losses during the first 3 quarters of 2019, according to the company's Form 10-Q filing. While Altisource will still need to take restructuring charges of US$12-15M as disclosed in its most recent 10-Q, we expect the company to be able to achieve an adjusted EBITDA of US$60M next year. Based on our estimates, the company is trading at a 8.5x EV/EBITDA multiple.The company has a share repurchase program for 4.3 million shares of which 2.7 million remain available. The program is valid until 2022. This represents 17% of shares outstanding. During the first 9m of 2019, the company bought 0.6 million shares or close to 4% of outstanding shares. With solid cash generation, the company should be able to continue buying back stock. Moreover, at 1.9 million shares, short interest remains high considering on average 79k shares traded a day in the last 12 months.Given the many uncertainties, we see this as a fair valuation. The real upside for Altisource will come from a turn in the delinquency and foreclosure cycle which is not imminent. Therefore, we do believe there is plenty of time to assess the company’s progress.We expect Altisource’s top-line to continue to decline over 2020. There does not seem to be an imminent rise in foreclosures as delinquencies remain low. While the upside for the industry could be high if and when foreclosures and delinquencies start rising again, we do not expect this to happen soon and thus believe there is sufficient time to wait to see Altisource deliver on the growth of non-Ocwen/New Residential/RESI revenues as well as see the impact on costs and margins from recent restructuring actions."

Once the default cycle turns, ASPS could be a multi-bagger.","One of the big winners of the mortgage crisis of 2008 was Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ:ASPS). The stock rose from $5.60 to over $150 share in less than five years as mortgage delinquencies skyrocketed. Due to the pandemic, mortgage delinquencies are on the rise again. However, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act has put a halt to foreclosures. Subsequently, Altisource has yet to see an uptick in its business, and the inflection point will most likely be in Q1 of next year.Source: Yahoo FinanceIn May, it was reported that the number of borrowers more than 30 days late swelled to 4.3 million, up 723,000 from the previous month. More than 8% of all U.S. mortgages were past due or in foreclosure.Source: BloombergSource: Black KnightThe current surge in delinquencies is even greater than 2009. The five-year period where mortgage delinquencies rose from 1.5% to 5% resulted in a 30X move in the stock price of ASPS. The question is whether this is the beginning of a multi-year cycle for whether the economy will quickly regain its footing in the second half of 2020.Thus far, ASPS has not seen any benefit from the rise in mortgage delinquencies due to the CARES Act. At the height of the pandemic, a temporary halt to foreclosures until August 31, 2020, was enacted. In addition, mortgagees have the option to apply for loan forbearance if they experienced financial hardship due to the pandemic. The loan forbearance can be up to 360 days in length.On the most recent conference call, CEO Bill Shepro noted that there would not be an uptick in business until maybe Q1 of next year.It should also be noted that it takes time for a default to be passed along to ASPS for processing. After the mortgage is in default for 15 days, ASPS sends the first mailing. However, it can take 180 days after a foreclosure for the company to book any revenue from the operation. Thus, there is a long lag time that is further complicated by the CARES Act.ASPS has a market cap of $227 million and an enterprise value of $422 million.I am currently modeling a 40% decline in revenues for 2020. This would result in revenues of $360 million. The company will most likely lose almost $1/share in 2020.The balance sheet is far from pristine. The company has $304 million of debt. Operating cash flow was negative $1.6 million in Q1. With $120 million of cash, ASPS should be able to weather a difficult 2020.If you believe that mortgage delinquency has started a multi-year cycle, ASPS could be a big winner. With a small uptick in mortgage delinquencies, the company could earn $100 million of cash flow in 2021. If you put a 10X P/CF multiple, you come up with a stock that could quadruple. However, ASPS is a company that you want to revisit later in the year to see some signs that the business is at an inflection point. To put things into perspective, the company earned over $1 billion in CF during the 2009 crisis. The upside is enormous for a company with only a $227 million market cap.The prudent move is to wait for signs of inflection before buying shares of ASPS. Despite the fact that mortgage delinquencies are surging, it will take several months for ASPS to see an uptick in the business."
4070621,103084,2017-05-08T11:35:00-04:00,"Language in the ASPS - OCN Services Agreement does not protect ASPS from NRZ directing downstream services.We believe ASPS will lose significant high-margin revenue from OCN.OCN shareholders, and not to mention bond holders, who do not own shares of ASPS should be rightfully concerned about the conflicts of interest between OCN and ASPS.","It has been pointed out that Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ:ASPS) has contracts with Ocwen Financial (NYSE:OCN) that some believe are ""very solid."" These ASPS bulls incorrectly assume that ASPS will be protected from a potential shift of service fee revenue that we believe will occur after New Residential Investment (NYSE:NRZ) acquires $117 billion of UPB in mortgage servicing rights (""MSRs"") from OCN as proposed on May 1, 2017, in a joint press release from NRZ and OCN (the ""MSRs Transaction""). We believe that the language in the ASPS, OCN Services Agreement (dated August 10, 2009) and two subsequent amendments (dated October 1, 2012, and March 29, 2013, respectively), does not protect ASPS from NRZ directing ""downstream services"" after it owns and controls the $117 billion in UPB of MSR, causing the loss of a significant high-margin revenue stream for ASPS.We would expect that as the new owner in control of the MSRs, if the MSRs Transaction is completed, NRZ will direct how services are provided. First, and as described publicly by NRZ and OCN, we anticipate that NRZ would enter into a ""standard"" sub-servicing contract with OCN. We expect that under that contract, OCN would provide all services EXCEPT ""downstream"" services. This would be consistent with what NRZ's CEO said on their Q1 2017 earnings call: ""NRZ will also fully control all of the downstream services associated with this portfolio."" Furthermore, we expect that as part of this sub-servicing agreement, NRZ would require OCN to send all copies of loan files that require ""downstream"" services to either Nationstar Mortgage (NYSE:NSM) or NRZ, which could then refer/pass on the files to NSM.ASPS bulls likely rely on non-compete language in the Services Agreement and its two amendments to defend their position that ASPS is protected from loss of the significant high-margin service fee revenue stream referred by OCN. For purposes of this write-up, we will refer to the Second Amendment to the Services Agreement, which includes the latest language on the non-compete, filed in an 8-K March 29, 2013. Exhibit 10.1, page two of section 3. Standard of Performance; Marketing and Promotion; and Noncompete and in the sub-section (C) Noncompete, (emphasis added):A few points to consider: First, it is important to note that the Services Agreement is between OCN and ASPS, not NRZ and ASPS. Any breach of this non-compete would arise in a claim by ASPS against OCN, not NRZ. Second, as part of the MSRs Transaction, OCN would have a relationship with NRZ which simply owns the MSRs and doesn't engage in a line of fee-based businesses similar to those provided by ASPS. NRZ would be referring the REO auction and other services to NSM, which has no relationship with OCN. Third, even if somehow OCN could be seen as having violated the non-compete, the Services Agreement provides that in no event shall damages for a breach of contract exceed fees for the most recent six-month period (page 16 of Services Agreement). We estimate such fees would be less than half of what OCN would receive from NRZ in the MSRs Transaction, and since ASPS would have to rely on ambiguity rather than a violation, at best, ASPS could hope to settle for a lesser amount. In any event, we think the point is moot. We believe the Services Agreement and its two Amendments actually contemplate a scenario in which OCN can sell the MSRs to NRZ and provide sub-servicing while NRZ directs ""downstream"" services without violating the non-compete.From page two of the Second Amendment, same section 3., but from sub-section (B) Marketing and Promotion (emphasis added):We believe that following completion of the MSRs Transaction, NRZ would be the outright owner of the MSRs it acquires from OCN and, as such, will have control over the selection of the service provider of Services. We further believe that OCN will not be in a position to ""direct"" nor will it ""have control over the selection of the service provider of Services."" Moreover, we expect that NRZ will be considered a ""third party relationship"" for OCN.OCN can ""encourage"" NRZ all it wants to use Providing Party ASPS for ""downstream"" services. However, we think the smart business decision for NRZ and NRZ's likely choice will be to engage NSM for the ""downstream"" services. We also believe that regulators may prefer the selection of NSM given the issues that the 25 states, CFPB, and SEC have raised with respect to OCN's problems with its REALServicing technology platform and REO auction fees, among other issues, for which ASPS is partially responsible.Finally, we note a large overlap of shareholders exists between OCN and ASPS. OCN shareholders, and not to mention bond holders, who do not own shares of ASPS should be rightfully concerned about the conflicts of interest between the two companies. OCN has referred billions of dollars of fee revenue to ASPS over many years. Meanwhile, ASPS's technology platform appears to be at the root of OCN's problems with regulators, as evidenced by the claims in recent litigation and cease-and-desist orders filed by 25 states. Regulatory fines and monitor expenses have cost OCN hundreds of millions of dollars. And yet, OCN continues to refer revenues to ASPS. One must wonder why OCN has never turned to ASPS to share some of the burden, as it appears that ASPS bears much responsibility for the root problems. The inaction could be explained by certain large shareholders of OCN having a relative larger investment in ASPS and, therefore, a greater economic interest in protecting that larger investment. We suggest that OCN shareholders who do not own ASPS should be aware of the potential conflicts of interest which could also come into play in the pending NRZ-OCN MSRs Transaction. A potential activist investor in OCN, or plaintiff's attorney, might find it interesting to explore these conflicts of interest further.We once again suggest that long investors in ASPS should sell what we believe are overvalued shares which face significant downside risks."
4068956,103084,2017-05-04T08:00:00-04:00,"New Residential Investment (“NRZ”) announced a transaction with Ocwen Financial (“OCN”) in which it will acquire full ownership of $117 billion of UPB of mortgage servicing rights from OCN.NRZ would gain control of all the “downstream services”, including REO sales and other default-related services, we believe, the lifeblood of Altisource Portfolio Solutions’ (“ASPS”) cash flows.Likely by Q4 2017, ASPS will lose most of its high-margin revenue from OCN.Severe regulatory risks highlighted by NRZ on its call still exist, which could result in further bad news.Highly leveraged balance sheet, negative tangible net worth, and limited visibility of recurring cash flow after the NRZ–OCN deal could lead to a senior loan maturity default in 2020.","We have previously written about how the fundamentals have never been worse for Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ:ASPS). In that report, we highlighted that ASPS faced existential risk stemming from New Residential Investment's (NYSE:NRZ) negotiating leverage over Ocwen Financial (NYSE:OCN), especially in light of the recent harsh regulatory actions and litigation taken by 25 states and the CFPB. We noted that in order to solve its own problems, OCN could effectively ""throw ASPS under the bus"" by negotiating new terms with NRZ in which NRZ would take away the economic lifeblood of ASPS. This, in fact, transpired on Monday when on its Q1 2017 earnings call NRZ announced a major deal under negotiation with OCN.As described on the earnings call, NRZ expects to acquire outright ownership of $117 billion of UPB of MSRs that OCN owns and on which NRZ currently owns the ""excess servicing spread"". NRZ will pay $425 million for these MSRs and enter into a sub-servicing agreement with OCN which will continue to service the loans under a five-year contract. (Note, OCN provided in its Q4 earnings supplement (page 35, 36) an estimate of the off-balance sheet ""economic"" value of NRZ subservicing which amounts to $902 million. NRZ seemingly had OCN over a barrel given the substantial value that NRZ appears to have picked up in this negotiation by paying less than 50c on the dollar for this ""economic"" value.)Most importantly for ASPS, however, came the following comments from NRZ's CEO on its Q1 2017 earnings call:We believe that downstream services include activities such as REO auction sales and other default-related services. In the case of ASPS, we believe such services, including REO auction sales through its Hubzu.com website, represent its highest margin business line and the bulk of the company's cash flow.One analyst asked a follow-up question:As we pointed out in our prior report, we believed that NRZ is in a position to capture some of the outsized economics related to ASPS's high-margin REO auction and other default-related services it provides to OCN. It appears that NRZ will be capitalizing on that opportunity in addition to the outright purchase of the MSRs.Later on the call, another analyst asked for further clarity (emphasis added):NRZ's CEO emphasized, for the second time on this call, how long they have worked on the deal with OCN. We infer that means that the downstream services moving away from ASPS has been well thought through with OCN. His next comment about economics working for other parties, that they'll consider anything, doesn't clarify whether or not that means ASPS/Hubzu or NRZ's sister company Nationstar Mortgage (NYSE:NSM), owner of Hubzu competitor xome.com. (Recall that NSM is controlled by Fortress Investment Group (NYSE:FIG) which also manages NRZ. NRZ and NSM operate with a close relationship and can work together to maximize economics.) More significant, though, is the comment he makes about the number one priority - compliance with regulatory authorities. We believe this remark points to potential regulatory issues with ASPS as it relates to the services it provides to OCN. As we noted in our prior report and worth repeating here:On its Q1 2017 earnings call on May 3, 2017, OCN management wouldn't clarify its use of ASPS for ""downstream"" services as part of the NRZ deal. When asked specifically about ASPS, the CEO, after touting the benefits and likelihood of the NRZ deal, said that ""at this point, there is no agreement"" with NRZ and they would ""comply with contractual agreements."" He further went on to say there was ""no reason to believe the relationship will materially change."" Note, however, earlier in the call, he indicated that it would enter into a ""more traditional sub-servicing agreement."" We believe that in a ""traditional sub-servicing agreement"", the sub-servicer doesn't control the use of vendors in ""downstream"" services. Finally, we believe that NRZ has the bargaining leverage in this yet-to-be-concluded transaction and that NRZ's CEO's comments that NRZ will control the ""downstream services"" provide enough clarity that ASPS's service revenue will be diverted.We believe that the most likely outcome will be for NRZ to make a deal with NSM regarding the ""downstream services"" without giving ASPS the opportunity to bid on such services. If ASPS were permitted to bid, given it would be a competitive bid situation with NSM/xome.com, this would likely result in the setting of lower market prices for the default-related services. Rather than reset the economics for these services lower, it would be smarter for NRZ to simply engage NSM/xome at the same rates OCN pays ASPS/Hubzu. Obviously, securitization trustees/investors have accepted these existing rates. As a result, NRZ and NSM can maintain the strong profit margins of the REO auction and other default-related services.ASPS's high-margin revenue stream from OCN will also likely come to an end in the near term. From the Q1 2017 NRZ earnings call:OCN has an incentive to transfer the MSRs as quickly as possible as that dictates how quickly it receives the cash consideration for the MSRs from NRZ. With all parties interested in a quick transfer, we expect that securitization trustees will cooperate. One shouldn't confuse this type of ownership transfer with the multi-year transfer of MSRs when switching to a new servicer with a new technology platform. Furthermore, we expect that NRZ can direct REO auction sales and other default-related ""downstream"" services immediately after the ownership transfers occur. Default-related service providers can easily plug into whatever technology platform a servicer uses. ASPS's CEO on the Q1 2017 earnings call essentially admits that fact when discussing ASPS's own ability, as well as its competitors', to provide default-related services:OCN and ASPS bulls may point to one silver lining from the NRZ deal, the idea that OCN can return to growth by acquiring more MSRs due to the cash payment from NRZ. However, we do not believe that OCN will be able to grow its MSRs. OCN has given away all the upside economics in the NRZ deal, representing the bulk of its off-balance sheet ""economic value"" (as highlighted in OCN's Q4 earnings presentation.) OCN has admitted it won't be profitable in 2017, and now, one must question profitability beyond 2018 given the uncertain profitability as a sub-servicer earning half the revenues it used to (on Q1 2017 earnings call, OCN CEO indicated 13bps sub-servicing fee vs. 25bps currently).OCN still has unresolved regulatory issues with 25 states and the CFPB which have restricted OCN's ability to acquire MSRs. OCN and ASPS bulls decry the actions of the CFPB which they hope to see dismantled by the Trump administration, potentially offering relief to OCN. However, bulls have yet to address the fact that Pam Bondi, the Attorney General of Florida (home to OCN's headquarters!), and a Trump ally, has sued OCN. It is worth noting that approximately 70% of the 25 states taking action against OCN have Republican governors. This isn't a liberal conspiracy. Also, as noted in our prior report, bulls irresponsibly overestimate the MSR acquisition opportunity for OCN - the available UPB is half what bulls claimed; no certainty exists that owners of these MSRs will sell; it's a highly competitive market with other better-funded competitors (like NRZ/NSM); and sellers will likely question selling to OCN, a tainted servicer given all its regulatory issues. Finally, on the Q1 2017 earnings call, OCN's CEO admits ""… we've been out of the market for three years. We expect to be out of the market for additional period of time and it's really not feasible to project what might occur when that time comes.""We have attempted to estimate the impact of ASPS losing OCN-related revenue associated with the NRZ-serviced portfolio. While disclosure is poor, we have done our best to make reasonable assumptions based on the company's filings. Our results suggest ASPS free cash flow could decline from the $70 million guidance for 2017 to only $5 million in 2018, which, after required debt amortization, will result in negative cash flow.Source: ASPS Company Filings, SMLLC EstimatesWe walk through our step-by-step analysis below:OCN discloses in its 1Q17 earnings presentation (page 37) the 90+ days past due % (essentially the defaulted loans serviced) of the NRZ-financed and OCN-retained private label securitizations (""PLS""). We believe that the relative ratio of NRZ-defaulted loans to OCN-defaulted loans represents a good estimate for the relative revenue associated with the NRZ portfolio that flows through to ASPS. Recall that ASPS's primary revenue source derives from default-related services revenues from OCN.Source: OCN Investor Presentation, Slide 37We further believe that Hubzu revenues represent the highest margin business for ASPS and, in fact, provides all of the company's recurring pre-tax income.Source: ASPS Investor Presentation Slide 11, SMLLC EstimatesWe assume that NRZ-financed UPB gets diverted away from ASPS beginning in 2018, even though it is likely this happens sooner. We expect OCN-owned, UPB-related Hubzu sales to decline 15% in 2018, which we again believe to be conservative, as REO liquidations could slow amidst regulatory pressure on OCN. When combining the decline in NRZ-financed UPB and OCN-owned UPB, we expect Hubzu sales to decline 78% in 2018, which results in a ~$17 million decline in pre-tax income. While not factored into this analysis, as we focus only on the Mortgage Market here, with Altisource Residential (NYSE:RESI) essentially wrapping up its REO liquidations in 2017, we believe it's likely Hubzu revenues decline further than the 78% we show below:Source: ASPS Company Filings, SMLLC EstimatesBeyond Hubzu, ASPS's Mortgage Market segment contains $156 million of other revenue. This $156 million includes a variety of lower-margin services, including title, appraisal, property preservation etc., a portion of which we expect NRZ to divert from ASPS, as well as origination services. For purposes of our analysis, we assume 50% of the $156 million comes out of ASPS revenue in 2018 (compared to inferred 82% of Hubzu revenue from NRZ-financed UPB), which, at an 18% implied adjusted pre-tax margin, results in a reduction of $13.9 million quarterly pre-tax income.Source: ASPS Company Filings, SMLLC EstimatesWhen we pro forma ASPS 1Q17 adjusted pre-tax income of $18 million for lost Hubzu cash flow of $17.2 million, lost Non-Hubzu mortgage services cash flow of $13.9 million, partially offset by some non-Hubzu growth of $1.4 million, we calculate an $11.7 million 1Q17 pro forma adjusted pre-tax loss. After adjusting for depreciation, stock-based compensation, capex, and debt amortization, we calculate negative cash flow of $4.5 million.Source: ASPS Company Filings, SMLLC EstimatesUsing the midpoint of the company's adjusted net income guidance, as well as $70 million in FCF the company guided to on its 1Q17 earnings call, we calculate just $5 million of free cash flow in 2018. This is driven by a:The biggest two offsets are $15 million of tax savings as we assume ASPS pays no taxes in 2018 and a $25 million Y/Y benefit from lapping the litigation settlement net of tax.Note that our estimates do not consider any impact from the significant operating margin de-leveraging one would expect given the large proportion of lost Hubzu revenue and fixed cost nature of an auction website business model.Source: ASPS Company Filings, Senvest EstimatesWe note that ASPS has a relatively high level of fixed corporate, other, debt service, and other cash flow expenditures. To get a true corporate overhead, we take the disclosed 1Q17 ""Other"" segment SG&A and back out the asset recovery management and customer relationship management segments that are included therein. While those numbers aren't disclosed in 1Q17, they were disclosed throughout 2016. We arrive at annualized cash outlays of approximately $80 million, comprised of cash SG&A, cash interest, debt amortization, and capex.Source: ASPS 1Q17 10-QThe ""melting ice cube"" at ASPS associated with the declining high-margin revenue streams from OCN, not to mention RESI (see our prior report), has accelerated, and we believe will be vapor by Q4 2017. ASPS has attempted to offset the melting of the ice cube by growing revenues from new customers and acquisitions. We do not believe those efforts have shown any demonstrated profitability and, in fact, have been a drain on operating profits ($50 million in operating expense ""investments"" in 2017 alone; page 8 Q1 2017 earnings presentation). As we outlined in our prior report, given the poor track record of management, we do not expect these efforts to succeed enough to offset the dramatic decline in OCN-related revenues. Note that on its Q1 2017 earnings call, ASPS management already lowered its expectations for 2017 non-OCN results to the low midpoint of annual guidance, just two months after this guidance was given.ASPS has about $80 million of annual fixed cash corporate and other costs, debt service, and capital spending (calculated above). ASPS also has approximately $285 million of net debt and its $478 million senior term loan matures in just three and one-half years at the end of 2020. We haven't factored in any potential fines or costs to resolve regulatory issues or potential tax liabilities it could face in Luxembourg (see our prior report). These potential liabilities, if they materialize, would only increase ASPS net debt. After losing its high-margin NRZ-OCN-related Hubzu and other Mortgage Services revenue, and given the relatively high fixed cash costs, we believe that ASPS will be challenged to generate much free cash flow and could face a maturity default when its debt matures at the end of 2020.As a result of the significant change in ASPS's business and prospects, we believe the company will likely need to provide more disclosure on its non-OCN business lines. We also expect the company will likely sell assets and attempt to cut costs. The non-core asset recovery and customer relationship management business in the ""Other"" segment would be a logical candidate, but we question how much value ASPS could extract since this unit loses money. Moreover, meaningful cost cutting may be difficult. ASPS faces the dilemma of multiple costly growth initiatives to plug the OCN-related hole. Cutting costs in these initiatives could undermine ASPS's efforts to find new sources of income to offset the loss of OCN-related revenue. Moreover, if OCN switches servicing technology platforms as we expect, as noted by the ASPS CEO on the Q1 2017 earnings call, ASPS will ""…have some shutdown costs associated with the transition.""We encourage ASPS management to provide more transparency into its financials. We suggest it breaks out RESI-related revenue (as it used to) and associated adjusted pre-tax income. We also suggest it breaks out non-OCN, non-RESI related revenue, and adjusted pre-tax income, including revenues and related pre-tax income associated with acquisitions, in order to allow investors to evaluate the company's acquisition track record as well as provide insight into organic revenue and adjusted pre-tax income trends. We suspect that this disclosure will only further reveal the dire situation facing the company. We repeat our recommendation that long investors should sell ASPS shares at what we believe to be currently overvalued levels.Business Relationship Disclosure: Use of Senvest reports is limited by the Legal Disclaimer on its website.Additional Disclosure: You agree that the use of this report is at your own risk.

4058177,102322,2017-03-27T12:38:49-04:00,"A premier marketplace and transaction solutions provider for the real estate, mortgage and consumer debt industries.I believe in the stock for the long run.A massive short squeeze is also possible.","Altisource Portfolio Solutions (Nasdaq:ASPS) is a premier marketplace and transaction solutions provider for the real estate, mortgage and consumer debt industries.I believe in the stock for the long run, but in this article, I want to focus on a special situation for a short squeeze.Let's check the data of ASPS:Yahoo Finance:Shares Outstanding: 18.77MFloat: 8.68MShares Short: 5.39MAvg Vol (3 month): 387.67kAvg Vol (10 day): 538.27k* Yahoo Finance's numbers are not up-to-date.Bloomberg:Shares Outstanding: 18.4M (Proxy & Bloomberg)Float: 10M (Bloomberg)Shares Short: 6M (Bloomberg & Nasdaq)According to Bloomberg, 60% of the outstanding shares are being shorted. This in itself is a very unusual situation. But even this isn't the whole picture. I believe that at these prices, the real float (investors that will sell their shares) in ASPS is much lower than the reported float, because there are many long-term holders.According to ASPS proxy statements:To summarize what I think is the real float at these prices:So, if we remove the long-term holders from our calculations, the short as a percentage of real float is an astonishing 138%. The shorts will have a real problem covering their shorts, unless the stock price goes up to a level when some of the long-term holders may want to sell some shares.How long can it take?I really don't know. I do know this is an unsustainable situation, and I believe that there are viable reasons that can trigger a short squeeze.Potential reasons for a short squeeze:Company fundamentals:ASPS reported disappointing Q4 results and lowered their 2017 guidance. This pushed the shares lower by 27%. On their earnings release as well as on the call later, management indicated they're in the process of refinancing its term loan, which currently has unpaid balance of $475m and is due to mature in 2020.I hope that after they complete the refinancing they should feel more comfortable with allocating most of their excess cash to share buybacks.2016 EBITDA came in at $177m. In 2017, based on the mid-point of the company's guidance for pre-tax earnings, I'm getting to EBITDA of $136m (78m adj. pre-tax earnings + 21m of interest expense + 37m of D&A). To be conservative, I'll use the lower end of their scenarios so I'm getting to $130m of 2017 EBITDA.Management also indicated on the call that they expect the 2017 EBITDA figures to be the low point with growth resuming in 2019 (after a flattish 2018).Ocwen and ASPS are tied in a service agreement until 2025. I think the risk of Ocwen taking its business elsewhere is very slim at this point. ASPS's solutions are pretty much tailored to Ocwen's needs and I find it hard to believe there's another player out there able to provide similar services at a lower price.Most importantly - now that they've officially solved the California issue, I think Ocwen is probably not going to just let its current portfolio run-off. The MSR market isn't as hot as it was 3-4 years ago and there aren't too many great deals out there, but this is still Ocwen's main line of business, and they made it clear in several earnings calls that they want to at least get it to stabilize and stop declining as soon as possible.One last thing on ASPS's non-Ocwen business. I don't think its margins are actually a lot worse than the Ocwen-related business. If we look at the $130m expected EBITDA in 2017, I'd expect Ocwen to account to roughly 97.2m of that (18% * 540m) so non-Ocwen should be responsible for about $32.8m, which is ~12% of the $275m expected from non-Ocwen under the low-end of the scenarios.Given that Owners.com and probably Inevitability as well are in ""start-up mode"" and burn cash without making any real contribution to the revenue line yet, it looks like the non-Ocwen service revenues probably have EBITDA margins above 15%. I also believe that most of these revenues are pretty sticky - on-boarding a financial institution as a customer is a long and tedious process, but once they're boarded, their lifetime value as a customer is pretty high.I still think risk-reward here is very good, and the squeeze basically is just a short-term bump on the long-term road.SummaryI believe in ASPS for the long term, they will generate ~5$ FCF per share in 2017 and all of their estimates are based on the fact that Ocwen is a melting ice cube.Although I'm not an expert on short squeezes, I think this situation is a unique opportunity and may end up in a massive short squeeze. Please do not take it as a recommendation to act. Do your own analysis, and if you will find other arguments or your logic is different, please write a comment.If you believe in shorting this stock, it would be prudent to check your cost of borrowing."
4060757,84586,2017-04-06T10:06:21-04:00,Altisource Portfolio Solutions: Fundamentals never better; OCN done with NY DFS is a game changer.ASPS shorts miscalculated how risky it is to short 33% of common into concentrated holder base. I think 16.5mm shares not lending or pulling of 18.4mm.ASPS is my favorite investment: If five-yr forecast comes true it is $200/share in five years. Seems more likely as Ocwen with their low leverage balance sheet will grow.,"The fundamentals of Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ:ASPS) have never been better. I get into that down below but this first section tries to explain why the lending rate on ASPS has recently spiked and how this condition likely will wind up driving long-term shareholder value.I recently made an excel model that studies the ASPS outstanding short amount, an estimation of various ASPS investors who might not be lending their shares, estimates on various ASPS investors that might be interested in pulling lending on their shares in just the next 0-3 days, the remaining amount available to borrow against the 18.4mm common shares, and the predicted deficit amount that could force ""buy in's"" according to rule SHO designed (attached) to prevent short sellers from holding outstanding shorts without a locate of actual shares to support their stock loan.The results of the model include 44 ASPS investors that I believe are probably not lending or are in the process of pulling lending on shares. I estimate that out of the 18.4mm shares of common, that after a few days, 16.55mm are probably not lending. This amount includes 468k that my custodian is recalling today from the lending pool, considering the shares are fully paid for, and I put in a request for free delivery to another custodian, 275k shares from another guy that I believe is looking to pull lending, and another guy with 30k that I believe is also pulling lending for 773k ASPS shares that could come out of the lending pool in the next 0-3 more days. 16.55mm that probably are not lending less the 18.4mm shares outstanding would leave just 1.85mm shares total that might be available to borrow. Considering it was last reported that there are 5.4mm short shares outstanding this is going to leave a 3.5mm deficit that rule SHO will require to be bought in.The current outstanding short interest I am sourcing from a daily paid subscription service, shortside.com, says the outstanding short is 5.411mm as of March 31, 2017. The short interest on this service peaked at 5.75mm on March 23, 2017, and has come down just marginally.Also, I accommodated selling two investors recently 100k share blocks out of my position and bought these sharers back out of the market. These investors have a long-term horizon and are interested in letting the fundamentals play out that I discuss below.If you are a long-term investor - for reasons I discuss below- I recommend ASPS at this price. This short squeeze is just going to be gravy.Rule SHO requires ""fail to deliver"" on stock loan lenders who brokers the stock loans, to buy in the borrowers who fails to return shares when asked for them back, on the 13th settlement day that the borrower fails to return the shares.Based on the metrics attached, and the fact that the long-term shareholder base of concentrated holders who I do not believe are interested in selling for over a year, I predict that the share price will rise to over $50 a share as these forced buy ins occur in the face of having what might be a very limited supply of sellers.The borrow rate yesterday on shortside.com was an average of 98.03%. This was the combination of a very limited amount of new loans that were located and step ups to the interest rate on current loans. There is 200mm market value of short outstanding paying 50-92% interest and this is 100mm to 196mm per year of interest expense to stay short this thing. The 13-day SHO rule is going to reduce the shorts out of these loans until there are no more naked shorts, but in the meantime these are very high rates just into the next two weeks.I currently own over 900k shares of ASPS in my IRA that cannot lend the shares.Some guys I'm talking to say this might go to $100/share because of this short imbalance and very concentrated holders base.I just want the short guys to go away forever. These are the same group of guys that wrote phony research on Ocwen or alleged that 119 RMBS trusts were in an event of default (EOD). I have evidence that those guys shorted Ocwen (NYSE:OCN) before dropping the legal EOD notice to those trustees. That is very unethical. All of those accusations have since proven by Duff & Phelps to have no evidence. These are some of the same guys that are short ASPS now. This short group completely miscalculated how risky it could be shorting 30% of a company's common when there was a large group of concentrated holders.If you are an ASPS holder, I would recommend making sure that your shares are not contributed to the lending pool. The shorts have hurt long-term value for ASPS for over two years and it does not help your investment lending your shares. I would get it in writing. There are a number of large and small investors that thought they were not lending out their shares but after requesting confirmation discovered that brokers, prime brokers, and custodians were actually sweeping the shares out of accounts and lending.I spent 3 weeks in NYC living in a hotel room and got back a week ago. I spent an enormous amount of time talking to bankers, equity investors, term loan investors, company management, rating firms, and lots of my old RMBS trading clients. I am determined to add value to my portfolio of equities. I am an over 5% holder of ASPS/OCN/and RESI. This model and carefully tracking changing outstanding short interest is one of various ways I'm trying to add value. I hope my perspective is helpful.By far ASPS is my favorite investment and I think for various reasons that ASPS has 5 points of downside and 100 points of upside. It's a very asymmetric payoff which is what I have specialized in for my 17 years I have traded low priced structured finance subs that I buy at $5 or $15 price. I want 1 unit downside and big upside like 5x to 10x.Commentary:#1 Fair Value of ASPS should have been higher for last two year but for 4-6mm (or 33% of the outstanding shares that have been short)I have had discussions with some very experienced equity investors that have been involved in situations like this where a very large short interest built on a particular common stock. A couple observations that I have heard recently is that the ""fair market value"" or ""equilibrium price"" of ASPS likely has always been a higher value had it not been for almost 4-5mm of shorted shares that sold into the market 2 years ago and have remained there until this day. It always seemed odd to me that the company has been trading at a very low PE multiple against the $4.65/share adjusted EPS for 2016 on a company that has enjoyed between $5/share and $8/share of free cash flow.Eliminating a material amount of the short interest outstanding which is very likely to happen at this point, will rebalance the fair value that has always been there.#2 OCWEN news on the termination of the NY DFS monitor is a game changer for both companies.As an aside, I highly recommend buying OCN at the current share price. Ocwen is far cheaper today at $5.45 that it was at $4.75 just a week ago before this news that Ocwen is free of the NY DFS Monitor and might be eligible to purchase MSRs again in just a few weeks as disclosed in the consent order. Likely, OCN and NSM will be the dominant non-bank servicers going forward. PHH has been trying to sell itself for 18 months and has been self-liquidating assets and WAC is blowing up and is likely going to restructure its debt or possibly file for bankruptcy. Ocwen spent two years with NY, California, and the CFPB having installed monitors costing OCN over 100mm last year in monitor fees. The CFPB monitor ended on Feb. 29, 2017, and OCN settled with California eliminating that monitor.Ocwen has and will emerge a clean player after all of this scrutiny. Maybe the cleanest player considering they are the only bank or non-bank with multiple monitors on site for two years, this could set up Ocwen for years of growth. And if another non-bank gets into financial or regulatory trouble, which at least one company is in now, Ocwen may now be there to pick up market share.Ocwen has the balance sheet to buy 50bb of private label ( subprime) - nrz/nsm never went after this. This will add profitability to Ocwen.When Ocwen extended their 330mm term loan, there were 1.1bb or orders for 330mm of debt extension. Ocwen very well at that time could have drawn more funds out of the term loan but OCN management likely chose to not load OCN balance sheet with cash before California and NY Monitors were gone so they couldn't ask for more money. Now OCN, very likely, is in a position to upsize the term loan and pull out 200mm. Ocwen has 200mm in cash plus very heavy free cash flow now. Ocwen, if they upsize the term loan which I would recommend, and pull 200mm out of the term loan and use this as a down payment to buy 500mm proceeds of private label MSRs. I am aware of bankers that currently are offering mortgage servicers such as Ocwen, Walter, PHH, etc. term of a 60% advance rate and L+400 to finance the acquisition of new MSRs. Ocwen can buy over 50bb of private label MSRs with this 500mm.Not only is this growth in MSRs going to greatly change Ocwen's profitability, it will greatly increase ASPS profitability.ASPS has suffered margin compression in part because ASPS had to deal with Ocwen shrinking from over 400bb of mortgage servicing to 200bb. ASPS has previously announced staff cuts and other measures that dealt with the smaller Ocwen relationship. If Ocwen adds MSRs, the margin on this new business for ASPS would be very high. I would estimate that Ocwen adding 50bb of private label MSRs with 20% delinquent loans could add $1.5/ EPS a year to ASPS.The size of the private label RMBS market is 650bb or more. Ocwen has 140bb and NSM has 70bb. This leaves 440bb of private label MSRs available for Ocwen to purchase. I imagine the big banks like Bank America (NYSE:BAC), Citi (NYSE:C), JPM, and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) have had enough of the over 100bb regulatory fines, sanctions, RMBS and other penalties for their involvement with the subprime/ Alt-a RMBS origination and servicing issues that contributed to the financial crisis. Almost no private label transfers of MSRs have occurred in two years since Ocwen got in trouble. It's out there and I am expecting many large players will want to get this off their books letting Ocwen who by any analysis has done the best job of protecting RMBS bondholders from principal write-downs in their bonds. Any RMBS investors would want to appoint Ocwen based on these positive results and their effectiveness in dealing with at risk borrowers through loan mods.Ocwen has open access to the capital markets as proven by their 3+ year extension of both the bank term loan and the corporate bonds. It's very possible that over 1,2,3 years, Ocwen could grow from 200bb, to 250bb,to 350bb to 400bb in mortgage servicing. Ocwen has just 1 unit of debt and one unit of equity after backing out servicing advances and liabilities related to the securitization of the Reverse Mortgage HECM deals. If you compare this debt/equity ratio to NSM, WAC, or PHH these levels are between 3x and 8x not 1x.Ocwen has the balance sheet to grow.One more thing on Ocwen, Ocwen continues to have $4+ per share of real assets on their balance sheet marked at zero. If these assets were carried at NSM, WAC, or PHH they would, one way or the other, be included in the book value now. Refer to Ocwen's last earnings presentation for this list. I'm happy to walk you through what these assets are and why they would have been accrued or carried at the competing non-bank servicers in book value. Ocwen's adjusted tangible book value is more like $9.5 when you add these items to the GAAP book value. Additionally, Ocwen has a 250mm tax loss carry forward that is worth 75 cents to book value and Ocwen will add this back into GAAP book value when they believe they have a profit expectation.Also, with the monitors gone, Ocwen might cut costs, likely further, than they could have having both California and NY looking over their shoulder at everything they do. Ocwen didn't want to risk cutting costs to try and return to profitability at the expense of having the monitors extend. The last earnings call at Ocwen did say their expectation was for Ocwen to have a loss in 2017 but the thing that investors missed was that was assuming that the New York Monitor extended adding to monitors' costs.Don't forget Ocwen made 10mm in GAAP profit in Q3 when the street expected a 50mm loss. Ocwen lost 10mm in Q4. Ocwen made 45mm of operating profit in the servicing division their largest segment in Q4.I really like OCN and would add at current levels. I forecasted in my 27 page Ocwen paper that Ocwen would end the end in 2017 at $6.75 and be profitable. I stand by this forecast and think based on Ocwen's robust access to capital markets (term loan and corporate bond extensions) that I was not aware when I wrote my last paper, that my prior forecast at $6.75 is light and that a 7h is very probable.Ocwen management by far is the most experienced mortgage non-bank servicer in the business. They performed extremely well over the last 2 years managing risk and their relationship with regulators, given the circumstances and for this as an investor I am grateful and impressed.OCN/ASPSOcwen growing instead of shrinking is a game changer for ASPS. ASPS in their own 5-year forecast have Ocwen shrinking well under 100bb of servicing from 200bb. If Ocwen grows instead of shrinks this adds considerable revenues to ASPS 5-year forecast.ASPS five-year forecast - Can they hit if giving investors very asymmetric upside?ASPS five-year forecast says they are hoping to hit 1.5bb revenue and a 15-20% margin. They are focused on replacing what they thought was declining Ocwen revenues with a fast growing Non-Ocwen client base that currently has over 400+ unique clients.A 20% margin on 1.5bb is 300mm of EBITDA. For sure over 5 years the company would use the 210mm of cash and securities on the balance sheet and over 100+mm a year in free cash flow to take the share count down from 18.4mm to 15mm. 300mm EBITDA / 15mm shares = $20/EPS per share. If they continue diversifying their 400+ Non-Ocwen client revenue and client base further, ASPS should enjoy at least a 10x PE multiple and this would translate to $200/share under their five-year forecast.ASPS has very asymmetric upside to them executing on their growth plans.What gets ASPS to these 5-year numbers?a.) Non-Ocwen growthFor starters, I feel like the forecast on at least the non-Ocwen 2017 revenue growth is going to be realized. This forecast is bumping 2016 revenue from 230mm to 320mm. This is a 39% increase. Management I don't think wants to fall down on this forecast and I think that this forecast is driven by a spreadsheet that is referencing current client contacts, steps ups to current client contracts, and new client wins that are under contract. Please see the detailed presentation that breaks this out on the last company presentation. I do not believe there is much of a fudge number in there. Growing Non-Ocwen this year at 39% which I think is going to happen is going to be very significant.b.) Very large addressable market in property preservation division (Servicer Solutions) - Non OcwenASPS recently won a top 4 bank. I think this contract is the largest contract to the company besides the Ocwen business. As the company reported on the call, they said this is worth more than 1-2mm a month. I think this is more like 4mm/month. They also reported on the call that this bank put them under a 6-month probationary period where they got a fraction of the revenue. They got ranked #1 out of the other 9 vendors that the bank used. This is very good feedback. ASPS is competing on price and also their understanding of the servicing business is reflected by other disclosers the company has made that 8/10 of the top banks in the US are purchasing software from ASPS to assist with their servicing business. I'm not surprised that ASPS was ranked #1 by this large client.These other vendors are not in the software business to the extent that ASPS is. ASPS has an advantage.Also, this contract that is the biggest contract outside of OCN, I think is the smallest contract or second smallest of the contracts at this new big bank win. If you are ranked #1 you would think you would get more revenue and the contract would step up over time.Likely, the OCWEN taint cost ASPS winning more business from these banks in this very large addressable market. Ocwen was in a very tough spot any many folks were calling for Ocwen to file bankruptcy or to have to sell all of their assets. Likely, these big banks knowing that ASPS had big exposure to Ocwen did not want to ramp up flows and contracts with ASPS despite their good performance for fear that ASPS as a partner could have credit risk and operational risks if Ocwen fails. Likely, this TAINT was real. Now that Ocwen is stable, extended their debt, and is pretty much finished with regulators I anecdotally think that ASPS will get more business.c.) RESIASPS makes about 6% of revenue handling most of RESI affairs. RESI and their manager AAMC have very minimal employees. ASPS owns 4.15mm of RESI shares (I filed as a 5% RESI holder and think this is going to the 19.11 NAV in next 12 months)I predict that as RESI crosses over the $16/book value and approaches the 19.11 NAV, RESI management will issue more common stock. Resi is saying they are on track to pay 8-9% dividend on the book. All the other SFR players pay more than half that. RESI strategy handing lower cost rentals at 140k average is well under the 275k average of the SFR players. All the other players trade at 1.23x NAV or higher. Tickers are AMH, SBY, SFR, and INVH. So as RESI issues more shares which will be well received with this high future dividend, RESI could double or triple in size over the next couple of years greatly benefiting higher revenues to ASPS.RESI is deeply undervalued and I recommend buying big size at current pricing at $15.19/share. There are just limited reasons that RESI should trade at such a big discount to NAV besides the fact that 5 players sold 35% of the RESI common in last 18 months pulverizing the share price as those guys were frustrated that they owned OCN, ASPS, and RESI and took a bath on all of it for a period of time. George Ellison, a stand up and honest guy, a guy that was global head of fixed income of Bank of America for 20 years, says he is going to hit his 8-9% dividend on book and grow RESI. I believe and really like George I have had numerous phones calls and meetings with George and am very optimistic about RESI future and believe that RESI will contribute greatly to my P/L this year from current levels.RESI closed at $11/share on 12/31. Now is at $15.18. This is up 4.18 points on 4.15mm shares or 17.3mm profit for ASPS from 12/31. This is worth 94 cents a share of EPS to ASPS if they are ""marking this asset to market"" so watch out for how they treat this asset going forward. Hopefully, they mark this to market in Q1 and this translates into 98 cents of profit for ASPS.d.) OCWEN GROWING!I've already been over this. Ocwen growing into the future has enormous upside to ASPS. This is my base case for Ocwen and why I am so excited about ASPS. I have been waiting for OCN to get cleared by regulatory monitor programs and to be able to buy MSRs again. The time is basically here.This can TURBO CHARGE ASPS. And Ocwen is going to perform very well into the next 6 , 12 and 24 months.e.) owners.comThere are scenarios where this division that you are getting for free could be worth 1-1.5bb. Yes, several times more than ASPS market cap.It's a little too early to tell but the feedback is tremendous. Think of how Airbnb (AIRB) and UBER (NYSE:UBER) displaced their respective industries. Think about how Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) has a 6bb market cap on just 1bb of revenue creating advertising for brokers using the innovative map of the MLS listings so retail real estate buyers can do their homework on the internet.Owens is copying Zillow on the internet to source the retail buyers but they are employing their own brokers.Zillow makes advertising revenue changing brokers 3k, 5k, 8k, or 10k a month to get leads of buyers who decided they want a showing. Many brokers are getting most of their business from Zillow. Realitor.com collaboration with the Association of Realtors already copied Zillow's map and lists far more listings than Zillow does.Owners.com's idea is to capture leads on the internet with their map and iPhone app, and send them directly to brokers that work for ASPS/Owners. ASPS is charging just 1.5% commissions to buyers. They have developed iPhone apps to controls all communications between the brokers, the leads, and the back office. ASPS owns HUBZU, an eBay-like auction for foreclosed and real estate owned homes. Hubzu was ranked #7 realtor in the US by volume. ASPS knows how to close high volumes of homes and currently has tons of closing attorneys.ASPS also is a software developer and is used to handling billions of pieces of data, most of it automated, helping servicing 1.3mm mortgage loans for Ocwen as well as hundreds of thousands of loans for others. If anyone was going to have a good shot at creating a disrupted residential real estate marketplace, it very well can be ASPS. ASPS announced on the last earrings call that they got approval and set up a Title and Escrow Company and a Homeowners Insurance Business. ASPS also makes money on appraisals. So as Owners and ASPS grab this other revenue, the total revenue can be 2.0 to 2.5% on the home value - not the 1.5% commission they are marketing.They have been working on developing this for over a year and ran substantial development costs (cap-ex) through the p/l. The early stage results are growing exponentially. Let me remind you that you are getting this for free. Investors are putting no value on this division.They have gone in the last 3 quarters from like 20 brokers, to 90 brokers, to 200 brokers. I expect they will go to 300-400 brokers in Q1. They went from 5k leads to 10k leads to 28k leads. They are saying they have more leads than they know what to do with and they need more brokers. This is the good part- they went from closing 20 homes in the Q3 worth about 5mm of sales, to closing 80 homes in Q4 worth about 20mm in sales, and they just announced that based on a metric called ""late stage buyers"" {defined as under contract, made an offer, or did a showing} - they forecast to close 150-180 homes in Q1. 180 homes is 45mm of real estate sales, not bad for a startup.This is growing exponentially basically doubling every quarter.The addressable market is 86bb a year of residential real estate commissions. If they get 5% of this number this is 4bb of revenue. I think they have the automation capability with their software development background to handle 5k to 10k realtors. At some point someone is going to disrupt the traditional real estate industry. 3% is kind of a rip off for a realtor to do a few showings and fill out a contract for you if you already did all the work on the internet and are telling the realtor what things you want to see.ASPS brokers can be made to work all day (think of UBER) and keep doing showings and they hand over the contracts to ASPS extensive bank office (8,000 US-based employees) for follow up and completion. Then they make money on the appraisals, Home owners insurance, and Title and Escrow. They refer the mortgage loan to their Originations Solutions customers winning favor with that group.I am extremely excited about this and the green shoots turned into little baby plants. It these turn into bushes and small trees, this could be worth over 1bb.Zillow by the way, I heard is taking about 0.75% to 1% of these realtors 3% buyers commission for having the map and sourcing all the leads. Here with ASPS / Owners they can employee the same brokers, figure out how to get all the traffic off the internet, and if volume really ramps up, the brokers will make far more with Owners.com than they would advertising with Zillow.Brokers might only be doing 2 closing a month and splitting a 2% ( after paying Zillow) commission with the brokerage house. The owners.com model is getting set up to have brokers controlled by the iPhone apps doing 3x to 5x more showings than other realtors. Then these realtors might work harder but close 5x more deals and make a lot more money splitting the lower 1.5% commission.You are getting this for free. This has enormous upside. When I saw the green shoots on Owners turn into baby plants I bought another 300k shares of ASPS. I like this option.CEO Shepro buys two lots of about 130k proceeds as the window opens - Board member Kramer buys over 600k proceeds.What does Shepro know? Shepro bought like 100k proceeds in the 3rd quarter. Now when the window opens he buys two lots worth about 130k each. He knows which big banks are close to new contracts, he knows how owners.com is going, and he must be feeling better about the prospects for Ocwen growing and not shrinking. I really respect this.I think my model is saying that the large short interest in ASPS is in serious trouble. I don't think the shorts know the trouble they are in now except that the interest rate went higher. I don't think the shorts could possibly be guessing that there now seem to be 16.5 ASPS shares not lending for the foreseeable future against 18.4mm total. ASPS has 5 points of downside and 100 points of upside if a few of these things come together.I recommend ASPS, OCN, and RESI at current prices. These companies are all going to perform well into the future as far as their profits go and hopefully the share prices will follow.Best Regards,John Devaney"

In our opinion, this work used incorrect numbers; ignored significant regulatory and business risks as well as a poor management track record of capital allocation and failing to deliver on promises of growth; dismissed the competition; and relied on unreasonable assumptions. Most of his ""research"" appears to rely on management's word. This is a mistake since management, in our view, has little credibility as the overseers of a business suffering from declining revenue, earnings, and cash flow over the past few years and no quantifiable evidence of growing the company organically.The application of reasonable business judgment, along with a thorough analysis of the facts found in the public domain in SEC filings, earnings releases and conference calls, investor presentations, and other regulatory filings related to ASPS, OCN, RESI, NRZ, and Nationstar Mortgage (NYSE:NSM), along with sell side and other research and discussions with management of these companies, shows that the fundamentals have never been worse for ASPS. A leveraged balance sheet with a negative tangible net worth of -$181 million skews the risks even further. This explains why a large short position developed in the stock.ASPS shares traded down to a 52-week low of about $22/share on February 23, 2017, after a poor Q4 earnings report in which the company gave guidance below consensus estimates for 2017 and 2018 and disclosed new regulatory risks. Starting in mid-March, a ""short squeeze"" appeared to develop and sent the shares surging higher, closing at about $45/share on April 19, 2017. The following day, legal actions taken by 21 state regulators and the CFPB sent OCN and ASPS shares into a tailspin, and ASPS closed at $24/share on April 21, 2017. After the short-lived round trip in the stock, which may have benefited some long holders and short squeeze speculators, the present level of $24/share still offers a gift to long owners or speculators playing the short squeeze who should either book profits or avoid potential losses.A short squeeze inherently becomes unsustainable and a game of musical chairs. As the stock goes higher, the risk-reward for long holders worsens. Long speculators start to book gains and require either new long speculators or those with short positions to buy their shares. No real fundamental long investor can justify paying a projected 9x P/E multiple for this melting ice cube facing existential risks. Investing in a short squeeze situation becomes a game of musical chairs, and it appears that last week, the music stopped.The claim that ASPS fundamentals have never been better rests primarily on two arguments. First, that ASPS's largest customer, OCN, will return to growth in loans serviced, which will result in growth in revenues for ASPS. Second, that ASPS's efforts to grow non-OCN business will pay off. We will first address OCN's inability to grow its servicing UPB. Furthermore, we will point out the significant regulatory and business risks facing ASPS and its reliance on OCN, which could be in jeopardy. Then, we will discuss ASPS's poor non-OCN, non-RESI organic growth record and the challenges it faces in growing its non-OCN businesses.Source: ASPS 10-K FilingsOCN Can't Grow Mortgage Servicing and Will Continue to ShrinkOCN generates fee revenue by servicing residential mortgages. Through a series of acquisitions, it became the largest servicer of residential non-agency, private label mortgages held in residential mortgage-backed securities (""RMBS"") securitizations. These mortgages were originated before the financial crisis and consist of prime, subprime, Alt-A, and option ARM non-agency mortgages and generally suffer from high default rates. OCN's poor servicing practices and mistreatment of the borrowers behind these mortgages drew the scrutiny of regulators, who, starting in 2013, punished OCN with fines, the expenses of on-site monitors, and a ban on the purchase of additional MSRs. Mortgage servicers face a natural decay in loan balances due to loan payoffs from principal payments, refinancing, home sale, or loan modification. This creates a headwind on revenues and earnings. Mortgage servicers need to replace loan balance runoff with either further acquisition of MSRs or through originations of new loans. Since regulators shut down OCN's acquisition of MSRs, it has attempted to grow through originations of new mortgages and entering other lending markets. Despite its efforts to grow originations, the UPB of the loans it services, OCN's revenues and EPS have declined rapidly, as shown below:Source: ASPS 10-K Filings, OCN 10-K FilingsIn 2010, ASPS began trading as a public spin-off from OCN with a business consisting primarily of OCN's servicing technology platform from which ASPS earned fees by providing technology services and default-related services such as the auction of foreclosed upon real-estate owned (REO) and property preservation services. ASPS's highest margin business is believed to be the auction sale of REO homes through ASPS-owned hubzu.com, an online auction website. OCN is Hubzu's largest customer, representing 87% of homes sold on Hubzu in 2016 (ASPS 4Q16 Investor Presentation, Slide 14). OCN's need for ASPS declines along with the decline in OCN's UPB - thus OCN's headwinds are ASPS's headwinds.The ongoing recovery of the housing market and the general economy also supports the curing of defaulted loans. This represents a bad trend for ASPS, which generates revenue largely tied to defaulted loans, future foreclosures, and auction sales through Hubzu. Of note, the Wall Street Journal reported (April 17, 2017) that ""at the end of last year, the percentage of homes with negative equity hit the lowest level since the recession."" CoreLogic reported (April 11, 2017) that ""the current-to-30-day [default] transition rate is at a 15-year low."" CoreLogic also reported (March 14, 2017) that ""the December 2016 foreclosure rate is just slightly above the pre-housing crisis average foreclosure rate of 0.6% between 2000 and 2006."" ASPS, therefore, suffers from the headwinds of an overall shrinking defaulted borrower universe and the shrinking loan balances serviced by OCN, which can't grow for a host of reasons.The New York Department of Financial Services (""NYDFS"") recently reached a consent agreement with OCN, which led long speculators to believe that an MSR acquisition ban would be lifted within weeks and that OCN could grow its UPB. However, the March 27, 2017, consent order between OCN and the New York Department of Financial Services said nothing about lifting the MSR acquisition ban in the coming weeks. In any case, the point became moot on April 20th, 2017, when 21 states filed cease and desist orders (""C&D"") banning the acquisition of MSRs by OCN. Moreover, the C&Ds imply an effectively permanent ban from acquiring MSRs, as evidenced by the language of the State of North Carolina C&D. On the one hand, the North Carolina C&D will remain in place until OCN, among other things, can show it is a ""going concern."" On the other hand, the North Carolina C&D states that after taking into consideration certain liabilities OCN would incur in order to address regulators' concerns, OCN's ""continuing as a going concern would be in doubt."" This catch-22 means OCN won't be able to acquire MSRs.From the North Carolina C&D (page 5):Regulators' Actions Against OCN Really an Indictment of ASPSDespite OCN settlements with various regulators (CFPB in 2013 for $125 million, NYDFS in 2014 for $150 million, etc.) and agreements to improve servicing operations, it appears OCN can't comply. After ""several years of examinations and monitoring"" (North Carolina C&D press release), on April 20, 2017, regulators in 21 states and the CFPB launched a coordinated legal action against OCN, including C&Ds and civil complaints in federal court. Accusations included violations of multiple federal and state laws. Standard & Poor's (""S&P"") summarized the accusations well in an April 21, 2017, credit ratings downgrade of OCN:State regulators and the CFPB used some of the most scathing language we have seen in actions taken against a financial institution. We select some of the choice language below:In its press release, The State of North Carolina said,The State of Florida press release reads,In the Florida complaint, (Page 41):The Massachusetts Office of Consumers Affairs & Business Regulation's Division of Banks goes a step further than other states by requiring Ocwen to transfer all Massachusetts mortgage loans to a Division-approved licensed loan servicer (see here.) Massachusetts alone represents 3.5% of Ocwen's UPB.OCN responded with its intention to ""vigorously defend"" the accusations. In a classic maneuver to deflect attention, OCN accused the accuser, in this case, the CFPB. OCN stated in a press release dated April 20, 2017,This accusation rings hollow when considering that the State of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi filed a complaint virtually identical to the CFPB's. No mention of political grandstanding by OCN against Florida, which isn't surprising. Not only did Bondi endorse Trump (link here), she recently earned a Presidential appointment to serve on an opioid task force (link here). The harsh language from Florida stands out even further considering that OCN is headquartered in Florida!A review of the complaints and C&Ds reveals that issues with ASPS's REALservicing technology platform run throughout as a consistent theme. Since OCN dismisses the CFPB litigation as politically motivated, we will focus on the FL complaint to highlight these problems. We conclude that the real indictment goes to ASPS, the following sections from the FL complaint reinforce our view (page references refer to the Florida Attorney General suit against Ocwen, emphasis added):So, why hasn't OCN replaced ASPS's technology platform with a workable solution? We believe that conflicts of interest stemming from ASPS's historical connection with its former parent OCN and its common ownership have prevented OCN from switching platforms. In its complaint, the State of Florida makes reference to the NYDFS, which described the ""wide spread"" conflicts of interest between OCN and ASPS. The State of Florida also specifically points out (page 14) that ""...no other mortgage servicer uses REALservicing."" This is meant to question the commercial viability of REALservicing.One solution for OCN to reach a settlement with regulators would be to agree to use a new technology platform. Precedent for such a situation exists as seen in the case of Walter Investment (WAC), another publicly traded mortgage servicer that experienced rapid growth by acquisition. WAC's case resembles OCN's in that it had its own issues with failing to service loans properly and used an internally developed technology platform, just as OCN used its own internally developed technology platform (which was spun-off as ASPS). In the midst of an enforcement action from the FTC and CFPB, WAC agreed to switch from its internal technology platform to a more widely established, commercially successful platform offered by Black Knight Financial Services (NYSE:BKFS). OCN could likewise agree to use a third party, commercially accepted technology platform.Under the terms of the ""Technology Products Services Agreement"" filed as an Exhibit to ASPS 2010 10-K (link here), OCN can terminate the agreement if ASPS fails service level agreements or if government agencies require OCN to do so. The agreement provides for a 270-day transition period, which means that ASPS high margin revenues from its largest customer could disappear within a year of any settlement between OCN and regulators.Problems with More RegulatorsBut wait, there's more! OCN has issues with other regulators too, with ongoing investigations by the SEC, DOJ, and HUD. In its 2016 10-K, OCN beefed up dramatically its qualifying language in ""Forward Looking Statements"" (page 2, emphasis added on newly added disclaimer language):We've now heard from some State Attorneys General and the CFPB, which regulator will be next up to prosecute OCN?Significant Capital ConstraintsContrary to some long investors' assumptions, OCN has capital constraints and limited ability to access debt financing. Speculators boast of OCN's late 2016 refinancing of its senior term loan and senior unsecured notes, which supposedly had oversubscription demand. The oversubscription, in our view, likely stemmed from the overly generous terms OCN needed to entice bond investors. The new bonds offered a second lien interest in OCN assets (old bonds were unsecured) and came with much higher interest rates than the bonds they replaced.If stock speculators had only read the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility (SSTL) agreement, they would have learned that in no way can OCN ""pull down"" another $200 million in senior loans, as it has been suggested. Covenants limit the amount of additional senior term loans to $100 million plus an additional amount so long as the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) pro forma for the debt is less than 30%. OCN doesn't disclose its current LTV, but we estimate OCN can draw no more than $100 million in additional senior term loans (see Appendix C). Also, OCN's footnotes (page 62, 2016 10-K) disclose no additional debt capacity on its other MSR advance match funded debt. While OCN has about $189 million of cash (pro forma for the payment of regulatory fines, page 15, 4Q16 investor presentation), it needs to maintain a liquidity buffer. Cash hasn't dropped below $135 million since 2011, and that was with assets at about half of today's level. Moreover, OCN expects to lose money in 2017 (OCN 4Q16 earnings call). This will further pressure covenant compliance and suggests OCN needs prudent liquidity buffers.Given its high debt load, expected losses and numerous risks, we don't believe OCN has much dry powder to buy MSRs. OCN admits as much in its own 10-K (page 43, emphasis added):Limited Market to Acquire MSRsEven if OCN gets the go-ahead to buy MSRs, it won't be that easy. First, many speculators have overstated the market opportunity and use incorrect numbers on the PLS mortgage market. The non-agency market has $533 billion in UPB based on March 2017 remittance data, as reported by leading non-agency RMBS research firm Amherst Pierpont Securities (Non-Agency Mortgage Market Monitor March 2017), not $650 billion as others have claimed. Amherst reports that OCN services $139 billion of UPB and that NSM has $86 billion of non-agency PLS servicing, not $70 billion as others have claimed. So the supposed $440 billion market opportunity OCN can tap into really amounts to about $300 billion, almost one-third smaller.Why banks should want to start selling non-agency MSRs now after the pain of fines is behind them defies logic and speculators of the stock provide no good reason for why banks will start selling. Some have cited Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) as a potential seller to OCN. But they ignore the fact that Wells Fargo had a failed deal to sell MSRs to OCN in 2013. We think it's unlikely that Wells Fargo, given its own current regulatory issues, would ever consider selling to OCN again. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) already uses a sub-servicer for subprime mortgages, which makes it unlikely to sell these MSRs. According to Amherst, Wells Fargo services $38 billion in non-agency PLS UPB and Chase subprime servicing amounts to $25 billion, removing another $63 billion from the potential market. That leaves a market of about $240 billion that could theoretically trade. Also, OCN faces stiff competition from other financially healthy, well-funded buyers of MSRs such as NRZ and Nationstar Mortgage which have access to capital. Other private competitors for MSRs also exist.Finally, one can't ignore OCN's poor track record of growth. Its 2017 Proxy statement reveals management missed all growth financial targets in its ""2016 Corporate Scorecard Elements"" (page 29, OCN 2017 proxy statement). OCN management was ""below threshold"" in all growth categories:Even if OCN buys MSRs, it may not purchase MSRs with high levels of defaulted loans, ASPS's primary revenue source. The suggestion that OCN could grow to an impossible $400 billion in mortgage servicing is simply reckless.NRZ Relationship with OCNIn 2014, OCN faced liquidity problems which almost forced it into bankruptcy. To preserve OCN's liquidity, its affiliate Home Loan Servicing Solutions (HLSS), a publicly traded vehicle used to fund servicing advances, was sold to competitor NRZ. While OCN maintained servicing, NRZ gained significant control over most of OCN's MSRs. From the ASPS 2016 10-K, page 9:From the servicing agreement dated August 10, 2009, between OCN and ASPS:If ""Seller [OCN] fails to maintain residential primary servicer ratings for subprime loans of at least ""Average"" by Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of Standards & Poor's Financial Services LLC (or its successor in interest), ""SQ3"" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (or its successor in interest) and ""RPS4+"" and ""RSS4+"" by Fitch Ratings (or its successor in interest);We believe that due to the recent regulatory developments, OCN's servicer rating will be up for review. Given the gravity of the problems, as reported in the ""Finding of Facts"" section of the North Carolina C&D (page 3); OCN's financial instability, as alluded to in the North Carolina C&D (page 5); the Massachusetts requirement that OCN transfer servicing (link here); plus the litigation with not only the CFPB but the State of Florida; we believe OCN's servicer ratings will be downgraded to a level of ""below average"" by at least one if not all of the ratings agencies. As a result, NRZ will have the right to transfer servicing, which will result in the loss of ASPS's largest and most profitable customer.Even without a servicer downgrade, under the terms of its agreement with OCN, we believe that NRZ could view the recent regulatory actions as a ""material adverse event"" and could invoke a ""Termination Event"". This would allow it to end the contract and transfer servicing. OCN would likely challenge NRZ's claim in court, which would be costly and lead to uncertainty about the stability of OCN's business. This could in turn lead to a servicer downgrade and NRZ wins again.Regardless of OCN's servicing rating, ASPS likely has only a few years of remaining cash flow from OCN, but one wouldn't realize that by reading ASPS's SEC filings. ASPS neglects to mention in its 10-K that the term of OCN's agreement with NRZ effectively expires in April 2020. OCN filed an 8-K April 6, 2015, for an ""Amendment to Master Servicing Rights Purchase Agreement and Sale Supplements"", which describes that it would ""extend the term during which Ocwen is, subject to the provisions of the amended Original Agreements, entitled to be the named servicer on loans for which Rights to MSRs have been sold to HLSS (along with the associated economic benefits) for two additional years or until April 30, 2020,…"" OCN also stated that the amendment would ""provide that the parties will commence negotiating in good faith for an extension of the contract term and the servicing fees payable to Ocwen no later than six months prior to the end of the applicable term as extended pursuant to the Amendment."" We engaged a leading law firm with expertise in the mortgage servicing industry to confirm that this essentially means that NRZ can walk from the OCN servicing agreement in 2020.NRZ is managed by private equity firm Fortress Investment Group. Fortress also controls the board of non-bank mortgage originator and servicer NSM, a leading competitor to OCN and ASPS. NSM operates a home foreclosure auction website similar to Hubzu called xome.com. Given the outsized margins and profits that Hubzu earns on OCN foreclosure home auctions, it would seem plausible that NRZ could benefit by renegotiating terms with OCN in a way to capture some of that excess margin or require OCN to use a second foreclosure auction outlet such as Xome. NSM/Xome could then share some of the outsized profits on foreclosure auctions with NRZ at no cost to OCN but a real cost to ASPS.Subject to third-party consents (principally, the trustees of the private label securitization trusts that own the mortgages being serviced by OCN), NRZ can take legal ownership of MSRs serviced by OCN after April 7, 2017. NRZ can move servicing entirely in just three years, on April 30, 2020, (pages 12-13, OCN 10-K). These facts provide NRZ with significant leverage over OCN to renegotiate terms to the detriment of ASPS.The recent regulatory action heightens the risk of an OCN bankruptcy. On April 21, 2017, Standard & Poor's downgraded OCN's credit ratings to B- in response to the regulatory action. S&P stated in its press release,In the event of an OCN bankruptcy, with ownership of the MSRs still technically held by OCN, NRZ could be in a weaker position with respect to certain cash flows ahead of a Chapter 11 filing. It would be prudent for NRZ to own the MSRs directly in order to improve its standing in an OCN bankruptcy situation. We believe that NRZ has started the process of gaining ownership of MSRs by seeking third-party consents.If NRZ were to announce publicly its intention to end the servicing relationship with OCN in 2020, as per the terms of the agreement, rating agencies, debt holders (especially since its bonds mature in 2022) and equity holders would likely cave. OCN wouldn't want such a public announcement, and thus this potential threat provides NRZ further leverage over OCN in renegotiating terms of its deal.Last year, NRZ took the first step in the process of taking legal ownership of the MSRs and preparing to potentially move servicing. OCN noted as much with this disclosure in its 2016 10-K (Page 13 OCN 2016 10-K, emphasis added):We pay special attention to changes in language in the ""Risk Factors"" section of SEC filings and this change in ASPS's 2016 10-K should be particularly concerning (page 9, emphasis added):Could these ""other events"" be alluding to a potential renegotiation between OCN and NRZ at the expense of ASPS?Even if NRZ doesn't move servicing, we expect that NRZ will not extend its servicing agreement beyond April 2020. By that time, the UPB will have runoff meaningfully, which makes a transfer of servicing faster and less risky. But even if NRZ doesn't transfer servicing after 2020, significant risks to ASPS still exist in the form of a renegotiation of the deal between OCN and NRZ. For example, OCN could agree to an NRZ request to direct REO auctions to Nationstar without impact on the economics to OCN but with serious consequences for ASPS.Finally, speculators have overlooked the major negative impact that NRZ will have on future potential ASPS/Hubzu revenue resulting from NRZ's clean-up call rights. As the owner of MSRs, NRZ has the clean-up call rights to $160 billion of UPB or one-third of the non-agency mortgage market (page 18, NRZ investor presentation November 11, 2016). Neither OCN nor NRZ discloses how much of this UPB is serviced by OCN, but since it is the largest servicer of non-agency mortgages, one can assume that a large chunk of OCN-serviced loans can be called by NRZ. While a clean-up call has a mixed financial impact on OCN, it deprives ASPS of meaningful future revenues related to potential auction sales of REO. After exercising its call rights, NRZ would control the resolution of the NPLs in the securitizations that it calls. We believe that NRZ would direct auction sales of REO related to these NPLs to Nationstar's xome.com. According to NRZ's 2016 10-K (page 160), NPLs/REO comprised 16% of the UPB in which it exercised cleanup calls. Let's assume that OCN's 26% share of the non-agency PLS market applies to the $160 billion that NRZ can call, indicating $42 billion of UPB related to OCN. Applying the 16% of NPLs/REO in NRZ's prior cleanup calls to the $42 billion indicates $6.7 billion of UPB that won't make it to ASPS/Hubzu.Problems with Non-OCN Revenue GrowthIn addition to OCN as a primary customer, ASPS's second largest customer is RESI, another OCN affiliated spin-off. ASPS earns fees from RESI through the sale of REO on its Hubzu website, as well as property preservation, maintenance, and other default related service fees. ASPS stopped disclosing RESI revenue at the end of 2015, which raises a red flag. Companies often decrease transparency in order to make it more difficult for investors to analyze revenue trends when those trends tell a story the company doesn't want to talk about. However, we can infer revenues based on a review of RESI disclosure, ASPS segment revenue disclosure, and by using reasonable assumptions based on prior disclosure of RESI revenue reported by ASPS.We estimate RESI accounted for $60-65 million, ~7% of ASPS service revenue in 2016, up from $55 million in 2015. The increase was likely driven by RESI liquidating 2,668 REO properties in 2016, a ~100% increase from the 1,321 liquidated in 2015. We estimate the incremental 1,347 properties sold on Hubzu generated ~$9,000 in revenue per home for ASPS ($150,000 selling price per home x 6% fees) at a 55-60% gross margin.The bad news for ASPS is that RESI has stated it will effectively sell the remainder of its REO and NPLs in 2017 (RESI 4Q16 Investor Presentation, Slide 9), marking the end of a high margin revenue stream ASPS has been earning in recent years. We expect high margin, RESI-related Hubzu revenue to decline by $8-10 million in 2017 and $12-14 million in 2018. We expect this decline to be partially offset by 5% growth in non-Hubzu revenue.Source: ASPS 10-K Filing, RESI 4Q16 Investor Presentation Slide 8, Senvest EstimatesSource: ASPS 10-K Filings, RESI 4Q16 Investor Presentation Slide 8, Senvest EstimatesASPS also lost its exclusive vendor status with RESI last year. Despite this negative development, ASPS management boasted about negotiating a potential $60 million payment from RESI, but we see this as an empty victory. We believe RESI has no intention of selling the half of its REO that would trigger the payment and so it gave away nothing in agreeing to this deal point.Given the shrinking revenue from OCN and RESI, this explains why ASPS so desperately needs to grow non-OCN revenue. The company has principally developed this non-OCN business through the acquisition of a hodge-podge of insignificant or unproven players in the mortgage and residential real estate markets. ASPS believes it can codger together these various pieces and compete with well-established and market dominating players with much greater resources. ASPS also believes it can offer the services it provides to OCN and RESI to other banks and non-bank servicers and residential real estate investors. So far, the results aren't encouraging.Source: ASPS 10-K Filings, Senvest estimates*Revenue not disclosed. For Equator, the $65 million of estimated revenue was at the time of acquisitionHubzu, ASPS's largest and most profitable revenue source would be the most logical business to expand and offer to third parties. Management for years has talked about the opportunity for Hubzu with third parties (see earnings call commentary below). Hubzu trends, however, contrast starkly with management's bullish commentary. Third party home sales through Hubzu have plunged over the past few years. Moreover, while management and long holders tout the success of ""wins"" with new customers, they neglect to mention the losses. Hubzu lost one major customer in 2016, believed to be HSBC.Source: ASPS Earnings CallsSource: ASPS 4Q16 Investor Presentation Slide 14, RESI 4Q16 Investor Presentation Slide 8About a year ago, we engaged a third party web scraping firm to track the number of homes, and more specifically auction homes on the Hubzu website. It is important to follow auction homes, which provide higher revenue and margin per home for ASPS given the 4.5% buyer's premium on such properties. We see roughly flat Y/Y growth in the number of homes on Hubzu but a 10% decline in auction homes. It's reasonable to believe that fewer auction homes on the site lead to lower future sales for ASPS.Source: hubzu.comSource: hubzu.comAs mentioned earlier, ASPS has made numerous acquisitions to offset the OCN and RESI headwinds, amounting to $200 million for seven companies over the past seven years. ASPS doesn't disclose revenues from acquisitions which makes it impossible for investors to see trends in true organic third party revenues. One possible explanation for the lack of disclosure may to obscure the poor results of both acquisitions and organic growth.Source: ASPS 10-K FilingsASPS readily admits to its failure to grow non-OCN revenue in its 2017 proxy statement. Management missed a number of non-OCN related ""corporate scorecard elements"" threshold targets and ""strategic initiatives"" related to growth (page 38, 39):We also believe ASPS's disclosure on planned non-Ocwen service revenue growth in 2017 is opaque and disingenuous. Of the $72 million in ""2016 Clients Wins"", we estimate $15-20 million (assuming a 25% margin on the $13 million of buy/fix/sell houses classified as short term investments) relates to buying, renovating, and selling houses to RESI. While qualitatively disclosed, the term ""Client Wins"" does not accurately portray the nature of this revenue, which is not true independent, third party revenue and likely non-recurring.Source: ASPS 4Q16 Investor Presentation - Slide 3Moreover, ASPS has never disclosed operating income results for non-OCN, non-RESI business, and so, we question the margin profile of such revenue. Our best estimate, using company disclosure by business segment, is that gross margin on OCN is 35%, RESI is 41%, and non-OCN, non-RESI is 20%.For a full breakdown of our assumptions, see Appendix A.Source: ASPS 10-K Filings, Senvest EstimatesThe incremental margins for non-Ocwen business are also in question, which could potentially impact future operating profit growth and the value of $86 million in goodwill on the balance sheet. Compass Point Research observed in a March 6, 2017, report that ASPS revised the margin profile significantly lower for its 2017 non-OCN related revenue (emphasis added):See Appendix B for details of Compass Point's analysis.Unlike most companies that compete in the mortgage services and residential real estate markets, ASPS has chosen to spread itself thin and compete in multiple markets rather than focus on one vertical. Among others, it competes with Ellie Mae ((NYSE:ELLI), $3.5 billion market cap, $360 million revenues, and $38 million adjusted net income in 2016) and Black Knight Financial Services (BKFS, $5.9 billion market cap, $1 billion revenues, and $47 million adjusted net income in 2016) in mortgage originations and servicing.In the online residential real estate brokerage market, it competes with Zillow Group ((NASDAQ:Z), $6.3 billion market cap, $847 million in revenues, and -$41 million in adjusted net income in 2016). The scale of competitors dwarfs owners.com. According to SimilarWeb, a website traffic research firm, in March 2017, Owners.com had ~300,000 visitors compared to ~55 million for Trulia, 62 million for realtor.com, and 174 million for Zillow.Also, Owners.com is not the only young upstart in the residential real estate brokerage market. While each company has a different approach, they are all looking to expand aggressively:While these newer entrants appear to be gaining steam, Owners.com missed its own 2016 expectations by a wide margin. ASPS disclosed in its 4Q investor presentation that Consumer Real Estate Solutions, which we believe to be predominantly Owners.com, only generated $1 million in revenue vs. the midpoint of guidance $8 million. For speculators to suggest a business that was acquired for $20 million and currently doing $1 million of revenue could be worth $1-1.5 billion is simply ludicrous.Source: ASPS 4Q16 Investor Presentation - Slide 15ASPS Regulatory ProblemsASPS has its own problems with regulators. These problems should be taken even more seriously in light of the recent regulatory action against OCN and which highlighted issues with ASPS technology. The company disclosed a new issue with the CFPB in its 2016 10-K (page 8, 9, emphasis added):Language from the 2016 OCN 10K relating to an SEC investigation also raises potential questions for the economics of the ASPS deal with OCN to sell REO through auction site hubzu.com (page 17, OCN 10-K, emphasis added):ASPS also faces real risks with potential tax liabilities. The company appears to have domiciled in Luxembourg in order to benefit from a tax deal it made with the country. Since Luxembourg has a statutory tax rate of 29%, not much lower than the US rate, one can infer that it was the tax deal which motivated the company to move its corporate office there. From the ASPS 2016 10-K Risk Factors, page 17 (emphasis added):Applying the full statutory tax rates to historical pre-tax income, ASPS could face $134 million in back-tax liabilities, which would cripple the company.Source: ASPS 10-K FilingsNew language in the ASPS 2016 10-K (page 17) highlights the risk of US tax reform, which seems probable given the priority of tax reform for the Trump administration (emphasis added):Finally, given all the regulatory and business risk that could result in either significant cash liabilities or a change in business economics that could severely impair ASPS's balance sheet and future cash flows, we aren't surprised to see this new language in the ASPS 2016 10-K (page 14, emphasis added):Poor Capital Allocation DecisionsASPS has spent $200 million on acquisitions which have yet to demonstrate a good return on investment. None of the seven acquisitions appears to be contributing in a meaningful way to earnings. For example, ASPS acquired Equator for $70 million in cash up-front with an $80 million earn-out in November 2013. By 2Q14, it wrote off $37.5 million of the earn-out. As mentioned earlier in this report, Owners.com underperformed expectations by ~85% in 2016 ($1 million of revenue vs. $8 million at the midpoint of guidance).ASPS has destroyed massive shareholder value by overpaying in the buyback of its stock. Since 2013, ASPS has spent roughly $500 million on share repurchases, with $400 million of the repurchases at prices above $100/sh.With the magnitude of complaints by regulators surrounding REALServicing, it's hard to fathom why management spent $500 million of capital on buybacks instead of investing in technology to bring REALServicing up to industry standards.The share repurchases are shown below (""Share Repurchase Program"" section of each year's 10-K):ValuationIn our base case scenario, we assume that NRZ moves servicing away from OCN in 2020 and diverts REO liquidation business away from Hubzu. ASPS generates 3-4 years of cash flow from Ocwen before the cash flow declines sharply in 2021. However, ASPS might still be able to fund or refinance its 2020 term loan maturity. This scenario results in $8 of equity value for ASPS. Importantly, we do not factor into this scenario potential fines or other liabilities from ongoing ASPS related investigations and other risks which could result in a zero dollar share price due to the company's leverage.We assume EBITDA for each segment based on an analysis of gross margin by segment and an allocation of overhead based on sales. While our analysis suggests operating profits are broken down as follows: OCN 91%, RESI 13%, non-OCN non-RESI -4%, we use a 85%, 10%, 5% ratio for our valuation, as the 91%, 13%, -4% ratio would be too punitive given our expected growth rate and valuation of OCN cash flows.For OCN related cash flows, we distinguish between OCN controlled revenues and NRZ controlled revenues. We expect OCN controlled revenues to decline 15% annually (compared to 20% decline in overall EBITDA in 2016), while NRZ controlled revenues decline 15% in 2018, 50% in 2019, and 100% in 2020. For RESI related cash flows, our DCF assumes a 20% decline in 2018 (the first year with almost no Hubzu revenue), with 5% growth through 2021, and a terminal growth rate of 2%. For the non-OCN, non-RESI portion of the business, we use a 15x EV/EBITDA multiple, a more than fair multiple in the context of peers which have proven growth track records, established dominant leadership positions and scale. These include BKFS, ELLI, and Z which trade at 15x, 17x and 21x 2018 EBITDA, respectively.For valuation assumptions, see Appendix C.ConclusionWe believe fundamentals at ASPS have never been worse. We expect historically profitable cash flows generated from OCN and RESI to continue declining, more than offsetting lower margin revenue generated from any new customer growth. The declining fundamentals are coupled with multiple existential risks that could cause cash flows for ASPS to rapidly decline (regulatory risk at OCN, regulatory risk at ASPS, tax clawbacks in Luxembourg, changes in the NRZ/OCN relationship etc.).Long holders and short squeeze speculators should take advantage of the overvalued ASPS stock price and sell while they still can.Appendix A:Senvest Calculation of OCN, RESI and Non-OCN, Non-RESI Gross Margins & Operating MarginsAppendix BCalculation of Incremental Margin for non-OCN revenue for 2016 and 2017 scenarios.Appendix C:Base Case Valuation AssumptionsThis article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

4047832,76785,2017-02-21T11:01:06-05:00,"There were plenty of negatives in Altisource's Q4 earnings release. If you were a bear, you couldn't ask for more.Digging a little deeper, the reaction seems a bit overdone, and the news of Ocwen's California settlement should assuage some fear heading into next week.Altisource remains an example of why investors shouldn't be fooled by top and bottom line beats; the long-term story here remains muddy.Taking it all in, however, the reaction appears overdone. If you were long before, you had your reasons - none of which have changed.","Timing is sometimes everything in the market, and it will be interesting to see how investors in both Ocwen (NYSE:OCN) and Altisource (NASDAQ:ASPS) fare over the next two weeks. It appears shareholders were hit with the ""bad news first"" approach, with Altisource's quarterly earnings release bringing with it a host of bad news: weak and delayed non-Ocwen revenue growth, iffy 2017 guidance, a $28M legal settlement charge, and the disclosure of yet another regulatory inquiry. However, the news of the Ocwen settlement with the California Department of Business Oversight, while largely expected at this point, should be a positive catalyst for both companies heading into next week. In any case, sentiment appears terribly low, particularly at beleaguered Altisource, which really did not need a ""everything but the kitchen sink"" type of quarter to cap off its year.Execution Stumbles, Ho-Hum GuidanceWhile I've long not been a fan of owning Altisource (my original coverage on Altisource linked here, now behind the PRO paywall), and instead prefer owning Ocwen directly, I found the sell-off to be a bit overly aggressive. I think the sell-side had been far too slow to adjust expectations for 2017 downward given the weaker revenue growth that perpetuated 2016, but I'll give our Manhattan-based friends a pass this time around. A large portion of fault for that lies with management. After all, they did miss the bottom of their non-Ocwen 2016 revenue guidance by nearly 15%, which has driven a cycle of revisions from the sell-side throughout the year.That miss doesn't seem impactful, particularly given the still light size of the non-Ocwen business (and its low margins), but it did have the implication of cutting the actual growth rate (22%) nearly in half versus initial expectations that the company laid out heading into 2016. Investors might recall that management initially set expectations for 2016 to be another year of 40% top line growth in the non-Ocwen business lines. While it isn't important today, it is important for Altisource's long-term health given continued expectations for Ocwen to potentially just run-off its portfolio, and at the very least, continue to push for price concessions from its partner. The market is fairly adept here, and it is the reason why Altisource continues to get punished after earnings release numbers despite beating top and bottom line expectations.With that said, the revenue bridge, if taken at face value, looks like an easy path to that $320M mid-point number. Altisource is stating that it had significant contract wins (worth $72M in next year) that simply got deferred and pushed out to next year. The $53M gap (driven by current sales pipeline and hopeful unknown new wins) looks to be a short hurdle to clear. This sort of visibility is new for the company, so we can't compare to prior years, but it's manageable. Nonetheless, given the sell-off, there is clearly a little bit of ""show me"" action going on here by the market when CEO Bill Shepro basically says: ""Sorry guys, don't worry, we'll have 36% growth next year"". Show me Altisource can hit that guidance, and better yet, show me that underlying profit margins can actually move towards that 15-20% operating margin number that forms the long-term business framework. Thus far, that looks muted: current 2017 guidance is for $2.82/share in earnings at the mid-point. Keep in mind that this is non-GAAP, and adds back intangible asset amortization, which was a sticking point for me prior given the divergence of GAAP and non-GAAP. If there is one thing investors can take solace in, it is the contraction of the non-GAAP to GAAP earnings spread, along with falling business investment costs.However, the non-GAAP reported number for 2016 (also excluding the litigation charge) was $4.59/share. Given that revenue is expected to fall <10% in 2017, that shows how weak the margin profile continues to be from non-Ocwen business. That continues to be the bigger story. Management continues to push a story of revenue replacement, but as I've cautioned along the way, shareholders need to focus on the quality of the revenues being replaced. The $160M in projected Ocwen business losses in 2017 (both from portfolio run-off, revenue mix [less REOs, which are higher margin], and likely further price concessions to Ocwen) is highly profitable, cash-generating business. Current business wins, at least for now, are not. While some of the lower margin profile of this new business is certainly related to scale, the costs of growth, and expenses related to business investment and marketing, shareholders appear increasingly unwillingly to wait for the turn - if it ever comes. Recent reported results have compromised shareholder faith in management to a degree, and the breakdown of that relationship extends to whether or not shareholders buy into management's long-term margin guidance and vision for the business.Not Out Of The Regulatory WoodsCompared to Ocwen, Altisource has dodged a significant portion of the regulatory battles, which in the past made it a safe haven for investors that believed Ocwen would survive, but not necessarily thrive, under the new regulatory regime. A large portion of the negative reaction from Altisource late last week is likely due to the inquiry the company received from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (""CFPB"") during Q4. This was not mentioned on the conference call, via press release, or in the supplementary earnings release, but you will find the language in the 10-K that was filed with the SEC:This is not the first time, and it likely won't be the last time, intra-company deals come under fire. While some shareholders may not understand why it is such a big deal, it is important to remember that mortgage servicing is unique in that customers have no choice in what companies are used for fee-based services that impact their property, from property inspections to debt collection to the use of technology. As an example of what can occur, many servicers caught flak several years ago for setting up affiliated insurance arms to collect premiums on force-placed insurance (insurance costs charged to borrowers when they fail to maintain their own insurance). These premiums were often out of line with the true market price. High fees are often a negative event catalyst (forcing foreclosure) for what are already struggling homeowners. With all the related company dealing going on, regulators want to ensure that any such deals are priced consistently with the market and are conducted at arms-length.It is still far too early to tell what the potential impact here is, although there is some comfort in the fact that Altisource has given significant price concessions on technology over the past year (greater than $20M pre-tax was the number Bill gave). While that isn't a fact that might be comforting to Altisource longs (although I appreciate it as an Ocwen shareholder), it does give Altisource some ammunition in defending itself when it comes to whether it is pricing its products fairly.Takeaway2016 was a weak year for the company, and since I stated that Ocwen over Altisource was the call, Ocwen is up more than 60%, while Altisource is down 20%. While their fates are inextricably tied, Ocwen remains a position of high negotiating power: Altisource needs Ocwen more than Ocwen needs Altisource, particularly over the next few bridge years. That time frame remains a question mark for me, and it might be why you see discussion surrounding extending the senior secured term loan today, despite the fact it comes due in 2020. The current rate (4.5%) is pretty solid, and there is ample time left. The risk is, however, if execution falters and willing financiers run the other way if the non-Ocwen margin profile does not improve. Paying down more principal and moving the maturity out to 2023 gives the company more breathing room, even if it likely does little when it comes to saving on interest costs or reducing debt covenant restrictions.With that said, earnings expectations have come down to where they need to be heading into next year, and the non-Ocwen business looks to be an easier hurdle to clear. While I (still) think Ocwen is the place to be, the split should not be as high, and I actually think you can make a much better case for being long Altisource today than you could six months ago, despite all the bad news. The price has come down far enough, along with expectations, that there is a solid path to a bit of upside over the course of the next year. Selling here seems like it would just be capitulation at the bottom.For deep-dive research on asymmetric risk/reward plays in the Industrial and Basic Materials sectors (particularly small and mid-caps), consider investing alongside me and other subscribers within Industrial Insights.

4071587,84586,2017-05-10T08:08:02-04:00,"The ASPS Shorts do not understand the ASPS / Ocwen service agreements and are putting out false analysis in direct contrast to recent ASPS Management statements of ""Positive Development"".The Ocwen Financial and Altisource Portfolio Solutions partnership has proven benefits to NRZ's prior acquisition of HLSS assets better than any other servicer. Upsetting the apple cart hurts NRZ.Current price is going to wind up being a very valuable entry point for existing longs to add, new longs to take positions, and shorts to cover as clarity unfolds.","I.) History of the 425mm OCN MSR Sale to NRZ and NRZ true MotivationsIt is important to note that Ocwen Financial (NYSE: OCN) disclosed that the 425mm OCN/NRZ MSR transaction was in the works for over a month. This transaction was something that was in the best interest of New Residential Investment (NYSE: NRZ) and Ocwen Financial providing valuable benefits to both sides.NRZ was, and still is, motivated to get the MSR's into their name and OCN is interested in extended their agreement to continue to service the portfolio by 3 years and receive this substantial cash payment helping OCN have certainty of these cash flows and the extended OCN/NRZ relationship.It is very unlikely that either NRZ or OCN during these previous discussions contemplated any disruptive changes to Ocwen's proven ability to provide, what any analyst in the industry would state, is the best performance over any servicer to the valuable asset that NRZ bought previously from HLSS. I discuss this point below.The comments by Michael Nierenburg on the NRZ call seem to frankly be a surprise to those at OCN. OCN stated on their earnings call that they had been in discussions for over a month and that ""they did not anticipate any changes to downstream service vendors including Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ: ASPS)""It's possible Michael might have spoken out of turn. I do not believe that Michael or NRZ are interested in doing anything that would be disruptive to the previously positive performance that Ocwen has provided to NRZ's valuable HLSS asset.a.) Ocwen makes NRZ the most money on private label MSR over any servicer through high mod countOcwen's industry leading count of loan mods by far makes NRZ more money over any servicer by lowering the interest cost on the outstanding advances that NRZ is required to make on delinquent loans. Foreclosure is a longer process and results in higher interest expense to NRZ. Ocwen is #1 in this regard, proven to have made NRZ the highest profit on the ""senior IO"" asset they bought in the HLSS transaction. The interest expense NRZ pays under Ocwen's servicing practices are the lowest as compared to any servicer.b.) Ocwen refi's the lowest - another gain to NRZ assetsAlso, Ocwen has not, and frankly will not, be in a position to harvest the private label loans for refinance into FHA or Ginnie considering many of the seasoned private label RMBS loans can now qualify. This is a best case scenario for NRZ. NRZ owns an IO (interest only asset) in the HLSS transaction and now this new 12 bps in the new deal. If the Unpaid Principal Balance (UPB) goes down the slowest, the IO makes the most money. Ocwen just will not be in a position to actively refi loans in this portfolio in the next year. Ocwen disclosed on a prior call that they in fact had refi'ed a small amount private label loans into FHA.Ocwen doesn't refi and NRZ wins again on the IO asset making the most money.Also, not refinancing the ""good loans"" out of the private label deals helps the ""gross wac"" stay higher in these collateral pools making the ""execution"" for the NRZ call play strategy get a higher total selling price as NRZ sells these seasoned deals into the market.c.) RMBS Bondholders support Ocwen's servicing practicesThe vast majority of RMBS bondholders are very happy with Ocwen's servicing practices that protected the RMBS trusts from losses far better than any other servicer of subprime. NRZ is clearly building an empire of owning Excess MSR's and MSR's and NRZ knows the RMBS bondholders support Ocwen's servicing practices and do not want disruptions that might hurt the value of the Ocwen serviced RMBS bonds.Ocwen has provided the ""best total cure and cash flow metrics among servicers assessed by Moody's.""Mr. Nierenburg himself discussed that this transaction was something that was good for the industry overall and the system.Don't forget, NRZ is in the market selling deals that result from re-securitizing the seasoned loans as a part of their ""call play"" strategy. A continued positive relationship with the RMBS existing bondholders is important to the cross selling of the new deals.Many of the same RMBS investors that own Ocwen serviced senior and mezzanine bonds are the same investors coming back to purchase the seasoned ""call play"" new issue seasoned deals from NRZ.d.) Call rights?Ocwen's higher count of mods in the subprime category protected the riskiest bonds in the subprime RMBS deals better than any other servicer. This fact set up the ""call play"" strategy for NRZ to collapse deals where Ocwen successfully lowered the delinquencies through their positive servicing practices. NRZ in their call play is making money by purchasing these risky Ocwen serviced sub/mez bonds at discounts out of the market, and then as the deals get called, NRZ gets 100 cents on the dollar for the bonds they bought at a discount.The partnership with Ocwen has been more than positive in this regard and because Ocwen protected the risky RMBS tranches better than any servicer from losses, NRZ benefited greatly. NRZ would not want Ocwen to change their servicing practices and the smooth functioning of the entire servicing platform that might reduce the future economic value of the call play strategy.e.) Best interest of RMBS holdersThe lucrative property preservation business of ASPS at the heart of this debate has the payments paid by the RMBS bondholders. NRZ can't get their hands on these cash flows as the shorts might suggest. Ocwen Financial has a most favored nation's provision in the contracts saying Ocwen has to get the lowest price if ASPS sells these same services to other Non-Ocwen customers.Reviews of this pricing by third parties hired by RMBS trustees have confirmed that these services provided to Ocwen are at market rates. Moving around any of the important Ocwen vendors would hurt the returns of the RMBS bondholders and NRZ investors.Also, I might remind folks, that ASPS disclosed on a prior call that their largest contract away from Ocwen was with a top four bank that recently came online at ASPS after a probationary period. ASPS disclosed that this top four bank ranked them #1 out of nine other vendors on a list of various metrics including price, execution, and integration against the other vendors.NRZ knows that ASPS is a top provider of these same services.NRZ has stated many times that having multiple servicers, sub-servicers, and vendors are is strength to their portfolio.f.) Potential Conflicts of Interest of Fortress, NRZ, and NSM - Likely notBoth the NRZ Management Company and the bulk of the Nationstar Mortgage Holdings (NYSE: NSM) equity shares are owned by the parent Fortress Investment Group (NYSE: FIG).The shorts want you to believe that NRZ would simply make an effort to award these downstream services to the brother/sister relationship of NSM.I do not believe that NRZ with their powerful and respected brand would take such actions. NRZ has shown support of Ocwen Financial and was contemplating this deal far before the recent CFPB actions. The performance of Ocwen's servicing platform has provided substantial value to NRZ shareholders for reasons discussed above.g.) Republic Lawmakers reviewing what's going on at OCNI am currently talking to lawmakers in Congress who wish to hear from me how I believe that various groups that I have discussed previously, created phony research reports, might have shown this phony data to the CFPB or other state regulators such as the NY DFS or the California DBO. There are fairly powerful Republican politicians that are hell bent on discovering if the CFPB at any time might have improperly crossed the line in their interactions between those in the private sector, which I intend on helping to prove had their own profit agenda. Did regulators rely on phony data and accusations?As the battle rages between Ocwen, PHH, and the CFPB over the CFPB's constitutionality, NRZ is making efforts to work with their important partner Ocwen Financial to execute on this deal that previously had been in the works.Anyway, I said this before. I do not think that NRZ wants to try and hurt Ocwen and that having a stable Ocwen in the best interest of NRZ's large investment in excess MSR's and MSR, the entire mortgage servicing market, the RMBS investors, and the consumers.I previously wrote that I thought that Michael Nierenburg would be supportive of Ocwen after the recent CFPB news which he has been. I do not believe that he has some nefarious plans on the ASPS /OCN important vendor relationship like what the shorts keep saying. The disruption of this relationship would just hurt NRZ's returns.II.) Management Actions of ASPS seem to Point to Confidencea.) SSTL Tender: It's rumored that ASPS launched a tender for its SSTL bank debt. This debt was last quoted on Bloomberg today at $87.125 up $0.44 cents higher than yesterday. I think the company might be trying to buy back a chunk of the term loan out of the market.If nervous bank debt holders sell to the company at say an $85 level, ASPS would earn a onetime profit of 3mm if this amount was for 20mm and earn a onetime 6mm profit if this amount was for 40mm while paying down their debt improving their credit profile.The ASPS management is still sitting on a large cash hoard, 4.15mm share of RESI equity, and about 15mm of ""paid for"" homes that all can be part of the company's liquidity to buy back bank debt and equity.It seems that if, in fact, ASPS management is trying to buy back their term loan; this seems to reflect confidence in their interpretation of their agreements with OCN as they relate to the OCN/NRZ deal. If they thought the agreements were shaky, you would think ASPS management would try and get a lower price down the road instead of maybe buying back bank debt now.b.) Share repurchases recently?I figured out a specific dealer I believe bought back ASPS shares in February and March as the company was in the market. This data is free on Bloomberg. Data from March 8, 2017 seems to indicate that the company might have repurchased 25k ASPS shares out of the market. If this is the case, this would further reflect confidence in ASPS management that their own share price is a good deal based on their interpretation of the agreements, the proposed MSR transaction, and their future business prospects of the 400+ customers they have that are not Ocwen. ASPS is saying that at the end of 2017 that almost 40% of revenues are going to be coming from non-Ocwen clients.III.) ASPS/OCN Contract Discussion:ASPS bears have been articulating their read of the contract which is clearly incorrect, in my opinion. They refer to the Second Amendment to the Services Agreement entered into as of March 29, 2012. Specifically, they refer to the following excepts from the Second Amendment which extends the ASPS/OCN contract to 2025.Bear thesis 1:""First, it is important to note that the Services Agreement is between OCN and ASPS, not NRZ and ASPS. Any breach of this non-compete would arise in a claim by ASPS against OCN, not NRZ.""NRZ has rights to move the downstream services.NOOcwen would be protected by the standard indemnifications that are involved whenever there is a transfer of economic titles involving MSRs. It is highly unlikely that either NRZ or OCN would embark on a course of action that would risk breaching any contractual agreement. If the bear thesis was true and NRZ would be able to move business away without any consideration to contractual agreements, it opens up the NRZ/OCN transaction to a challenge by the most interested parties, the RMBS bondholders and ASPS.In the end, the RMBS trusts pay for all the fees received by ASPS or similar third party servicers. Any attempts to move ASPS business away, as alluded to by bears, to an NSM affiliate could be painted as self-dealing, as discussed above, given the relationship between NRZ's GP, Fortress, and NSM. NRZ would not do this.Bear thesis 2:""As part of the MSRs Transaction, OCN would have a relationship with NRZ which simply owns the MSRs and doesn't engage in a line of fee-based businesses similar to those provided by ASPS. NRZ would be referring the REO auction and other services to NSM, which has no relationship with OCN.""NOThis explanation reads poorly. The original Services Agreement defined a Customer Party as a ""party in its capacity of receiving a Service hereunder, including OCWEN."" The provisions for Non-Compete explicitly forbid the Customer Party from soliciting other vendors. It is important to remind investors that all the amendments to the Services Agreements were designed to accommodate the HLSS transactions. Any party that becomes an owner of the MSRs, as contemplated by the NRZ-OCN transaction, would need to explicitly define its interaction with the actual subservicer, which is contemplated to be Ocwen. If the subservicer receives any default mitigation services, it would need to retain ASPS.Bear thesis 3:""Third, even if somehow OCN could be seen as having violated the non-compete, the Services Agreement provides that in no event shall damages for a breach of contract exceed fees for the most recent six-month period (page 16 of Services Agreement).""?This statement actually supports ASPS based on the damages referred to by bears. It would cover all the net debt for ASPS on a pretax basis.Instead of focusing on willful breaches of the contract, the bears should focus on the Section that discusses ""Termination for Convenience"" of the ASPS contract which applies ONLY if the Customer Party and Members of its Group discontinue the line of businesses receiving such contracts. In the unlikely scenario that OCWEN or the successor to its role as the Customer Party stops default mitigation and resolution activities, ASPS would have to be compensated for employee severances, discontinuance costs for existing contracts and all costs related to hardware, software and equipment.It would be very unlikely, that Ocwen is going to take in the 425mm from NRZ over 6 months that is takes to transfer MSR ownership, and then turn around and pay a giant chunk of this to ASPS for a ""willful breach."" Ocwen simply won't do this and won't do the deal that clearly is in the best interest for NRZ. NRZ is trying to be helpful in this transaction and not create a mess.From a big picture perspective, all three companies involved have an incentive to reduce volatility. NRZ will benefit from cementing its role as the legal owner of MSRs that would protect its $1.5Bn+ investment in excess MSRs. Given the exposure to servicing advances at NRZ and the significant interest expense involved, this deal would provide stability to NRZ. However, RMBS holders remain concerned about any potential for elevated advance recoupments and cash flow disruptions from changes to servicing practices at Ocwen.Any disruptions from switching vendors, as alluded to by the bears, is simply ignorant of the lengthy time horizon needed to move files off the Real Servicing platform. There are 1.3mm files on Real Servicing and ASPS has mentioned that it is a break even business at best. If there was a consensual decision between all three companies to move loan files from Real Servicing to another accounting vendor, that could be accomplished as long as ASPS was confident its rights under the Services Agreement with Ocwen were protected. Attempts to breach the contact, as alluded to by the bears, would cause financial stress to ASPS and disrupt the Real Servicing platform, furthering weakening the financial profile of OCN and NRZ, and invite more regulatory scrutiny.Summary:Ocwen to date, with their servicing practices has delivered the best returns to the HLSS asset if you went head to head against any other servicer by lowering NRZ advance interest expense the most, protecting the discounted bonds the most integral to the NRZ call play strategy, by lower delinquencies significantly on the seasoned deals at the center of the NRZ call play trade, and Ocwen is not targeting these mainly subprime loans for refinance which are in the money on a cross section of this portfolio further helping the IO asset and the call play strategy. Ocwen wins driving the best return to NRZ on the HLSS investment. This is partly, why NRZ and Ocwen entered into these discussions a month ago to extend this servicing relationship another three years.ASPS management is confident that they have contracts to continue to provide services to Ocwen until 2025. The rumored recent SSTL tender and possible share repurchases seem to point to their own confidence.The vast majority of the RMBS investors would be against changing Ocwen's already proven successful servicing practices that as the ""LL Funds updated Ocwen Paper"" showed that Ocwen protected RMBS trusts from losses 6% better over a six year period against far higher rated SPS in the subprime category. It seems that if would be foolish for NRZ to upset the apple cart and upset the already happy RMBS bondholders.ASPS Management in their recent press release is stating their interpretation of the NRZ/OCN deal and service contracts agreements as a positive for ASPS. ASPS management surely is not putting out false statements opening them up to shareholder class action lawsuits.ASPS has a growing list of clients away from Ocwen and this year will see very strong 35% in the Non-Ocwen Growth. The current price is going to wind up being a very valuable entry point for existing longs to add or new longs to take positions. Shorts should take the gift of the recent price decline and exit their positions. S3 Black Knight reported yesterday they saw 4.6mm ASPS shares still outstanding as short. This is a pretty big number and as the OCN/ASPS/NRZ deal unfolds in a favorable way to all parties, the shorts are going to start covering in an effort to protect their positions from losses and stop paying a fairly high interest rate at between 61% and 90% depending on which data vendor you're asking.Maybe NRZ contemplates using the small equity bucket they have to purchase 4.9% of ASPS in the similar way it did supporting Ocwen. NRZ wants to make money and this similar ownership would surely help NRZ's shareholders make some extra money while protecting the valuable MSR assets and taking ownership in a vendor that was ranked #1 in a peer comparison by a top four bank.LUXEMBOURG, May 08, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (""Altisource"" or the ""Company"") today issued the following statement in response to a potential transaction between Ocwen Financial Corporation (""Ocwen"") and New Residential Corporation (""NRZ""):Altisource is aware that Ocwen and NRZ have each stated that there are on-going negotiations to reach an agreement that would convert certain of NRZ's existing rights to mortgage servicing rights (""MSRs"") to fully-owned MSRs. We view efforts by Ocwen and NRZ to reach an agreement that reduces uncertainty and strengthens the relationship between NRZ and Ocwen as a positive development.Altisource has long-term service agreements with Ocwen to provide various fee-based services on an exclusive basis. Altisource has invested substantial resources in acquiring and developing the infrastructure and services it provides to Ocwen and remains committed to providing these services and supporting Ocwen. Altisource expects that any potential agreement between Ocwen and NRZ will be consistent with and respect Altisource's service agreements with Ocwen. Altisource is in communication with both Ocwen and NRZ."

Recent Insider buying of $1.7m in range of $25 to $28.Company forecast revenues of $893 million and adjusted EPS of $6.00 for 2016.PE will expand from 5 to 12 = $72 price target.,"Altisource Portfolio SolutionsAltisource Portfolio Solutions (Nasdaq:ASPS) is a provider of software and analytical solutions serving mortgage servicing companies as well as financial companies within the real estate and financial sector. It is considered a specialty finance company and also has several website initiatives complementing their primary business.What initially drew our attention to this company was an investment made by Leon Cooperman as he was buying around the $40s in December of last year. During an earnings conference call, he made a comment questioning the logic behind not aggressively pursuing a buyback when the stock was below $30. He appeared frustrated because during 2014, the company repurchased 2 million shares at over $100+ per share but was now sitting on their hands in terms of implementing an aggressive repurchase program. As the price was hovering around $25, we began initiating a position ultimately buying as low as $14. The company finally increased their repurchase program after receiving approval at a shareholder meeting in May of this year. The company began repurchasing shares aggressively in June, bringing its six month buyback to 1.6 million shares paying on average, about $28 per share. Their latest 10Q filing shows they still have 1.8 million shares available and will continue to buy back shares albeit at a slower pace.We still do not understand why the company would slow down the buyback at current prices given the above. You would think that management would view this as a priority and be more aggressive, but the slowdown was confirmed during the earnings call comments. In addition, the company issued 750,000 shares for 3 acquisitions (Castleline, RentRange and Investability) making a portion of this year's buyback a wash. Despite this one issue that we disagree with, management continues to pursue and meet its goals on the four growth objectives below:On a positive note, insiders have purchased approximately $1.7 million in stock on the open market between $25-$28. Operationally, the company appears to be performing well exceeding analyst estimates on their last two earnings releases. In their presentation, the company also gave forward guidance of $893 million in revenues which will be up slightly from this year. Adjusted EPS will be approximately $6.00 for 2016. Trading at a PE of about 5, this would appear to be definitely undervalued by any measure given the forward outlook.Valuation - Is ASPS Undervalued?What makes ASPS undervalued in our opinion? The company currently has a market capitalization of approximately $560 million. For 2016, ASPS is expected to do approximately $893 million in revenues, generate adjusted pretax income of $134 million, and adjusted EPS of $6.00. ASPS has normalized net income margins between 15%-20% as well as a tax efficient structure because it is based in Luxembourg. Typically, companies with such high margins are either technology companies or pharmaceutical companies. On a price to sales basis, ASPS is undervalued trading at a 0.63x Price/Sales ratio based on 2016 revenues. In our experience, companies in the technology space typically trade anywhere from below 1.0x for low margin business (i.e. electronics, contract manufacturers) to as high as 10.0x (i.e. cloud, cyber security). There have been instances where multiples were higher, but let's use this range as an average based upon our 20 year experience monitoring the public equity tech space as well as recent M&A. When you look at the Yahoo table below comparing a similar company like Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV), as well as the business services sector, you can see the large disparity in multiples:*All above data based on trailing twelve months.On a more general comparison, we prepared the below table from data easily accessible from Yahoo Finance. With the exception FISV, all the companies listed in the table were taken from this year's proxy filing. The list was used to determine executive compensation based on comparable companies, and we believe it also should be used as a benchmark for comparable valuation analysis. The table speaks for itself highlighting the valuation disparity in PE, PS, and market capitalization.Ocwen FinancialOne of the looming overhangs for the company has been its relationship with Ocwen Financial (NYSE:OCN). OCN makes up approximately 60% of Altisource's revenues which have been on a decline. During OCN's recent earnings call, it was evident that the company has been in a turnaround mode, paying down debt to strengthen its balance sheet. The company has some regulatory issues that appear to be slowly dissipating, which should allow the company to resume growth in 2016. Ocwen will remain a large customer for Altisource until 2020 and if they start expanding with new mortgage servicing business, it will be extremely positive in stabilizing the outlook for ASPS.Top 6 shareholders account for 76% of 19.3m total shares outstandingWilliam Erby was the founder of Ocwen Financial which ultimately spun off Altisource Portfolio Solutions into a separate company. During this time, he has been holding most of his shares in both companies. In our opinion, he continues to hold approximately 6.8m shares in ASPS and must perceive the shares as undervalued. A table highlighting the top shareholders is listed below:Combined, this group holds 14.7 million shares or 76% of all available shares outstanding. This can all be seen in this year's proxy, as well as some subsequent 13D filings. We view this as extremely positive given the volatility in price and their respective decisions to hold at current levels.Short PositionsThe company is thinly traded, having a total share count of 19.3 million, according to the latest 10Q filing. There are approximately 3.6 million shares short as of October 15th, 2015 and reflected in our table below:Yahoo has the float at 8.8m, but based on the above we think it is actually a lot tighter and closer to 4.6m shares. Our calculated short position is close to 78% of the float. When you factor in all of the above, we see real trouble for anyone short should positive news flow from ASPS or OCN. The stock can be very volatile and has moved $14 points in intraday trading back on Jan 16th of this year.Given the recent progress of both companies, we still do not understand why anyone would be short this stock at current levels. Share count, short positions and float are moving targets and there is definitely some double counting, but we think the situation here is quite troubling for anyone holding a short position.Final ThoughtsIn closing, we expect ASPS and OCN will begin announcing positive news flow over the next few months, improving their respective outlooks. We believe the PE multiple for ASPS will gradually improve to 12, bringing the price near $72. Our assumption is based on the fact that the company is undervalued. We believe the company falls into the spectrum of being a software technology services company and warrants a higher multiple. Fiserv provides transaction processing solutions to financial institutions and has a trailing PE of 33. It trades at $98 on expected EPS of $4.32 for 2016, while ASPS trades at $29 with $6.00 in EPS. FISV is a true technology company but should give you an idea why we view ASPS as our most compelling idea for 2016.We expect the stock to breach the $40s over the next few months, on its way to $72 in 2016. Shorts will be squeezed higher as it becomes evident that Ocwen is not going to disappear. We view the recent weakness as an excellent entry point. Considering the stock traded as high as $100 in 2014, we do not believe this is an overly optimistic target, despite the large appreciation from current levels.This is our top pick for 2016 and our largest position."

For those unaware of the company's past, Altisource Partners is part of the Bill Erbey empire, forming an important cog in his mortgage servicing machine, along with Altisource Residential (NYSE:RESI), Altisource Asset Management (NYSEMKT:AAMC), Home Loan Servicing Solutions (sold to New Residential (NYSE:NRZ)), and Ocwen (NYSE:OCN). This web of companies and its tangled intercompany relations is worthy of its own novel, and their meteoric rise and subsequent fall is an amazing tale in and of itself. Long story short, Bill Erbey was a talented operator in the sub-prime space, but his scorn for regulators (including outright insults levied their way) finally caught up to him, and heavy-handed federal and state investigators in New York and California tore his companies apart in search of federal violations. While what they found wasn't what I would call intentional fraud by senior management (more akin to a company growing too big, too fast, and without sufficient internal oversight), the regulatory violations were more than enough to cause the collapse in stock prices and force his ouster as leader.With the soap opera (mostly) over, share prices across all these entities remain in the tank. I've long been a proponent of Ocwen as an asymmetric risk/reward play, covering it extensively here on Seeking Alpha. But is there some value elsewhere in this web? I don't see it here in Altisource personally, and I'll show why you're better off long Ocwen (despite its current unfortunate money-losing situation) despite Altisource currently generating positive returns.Business Overview, Ocwen RelianceAltisource is for all intents and purposes supports the logistics side of the mortgage business, although it does dabble elsewhere in some other credit segments. Traditionally, loan servicers and originators outsource some of their technology and property management work. It is usually cheaper for a third party to consolidate and offer to a variety of parties rather than keeping it all in-house, and Altisource fills that gap. Services include loan servicing platform technology (loan modification, automated default and delinquent loan monitoring), default management services (trustee, non-legal paperwork services), insurance (title search, escrow and settlement, forced placed insurance), and property management (preservation, inspection, lease management).Ocwen remains a key customer here, comprising 60% of 2015 revenue. Given this is a fee-based business and the fact that Ocwen has sold off a large quantity of MSRs and is currently barred from buying more, a key source of company revenue is naturally hamstrung. Worse yet, natural run-off from the Ocwen portfolio as loans are repaid or refinanced means further future declines.In 2015, $631.6M of revenue was derived from Ocwen, primarily on delinquent loans. The company pegs expected Ocwen-related revenue at $585M for 2016 (down 7% y/y), but this is up substantially from Q3 2015 estimates due to higher revenues earned per loan that management did not expect. It is likely to fall at a further run rate annually going forward (see ""Setting Expectations"" paragraph further down), assuming Ocwen never makes another MSR purchase. You can find that projection from Q3 2015 below:Altisource Portfolio Solutions, Q3 2015 Investor PresentationAs mentioned, (luckily for Altisource) the company earns substantially all of its revenue on non-GSE delinquent loans, managing $692/quarter in Q2 2016, compared to $100/quarter in the same quarter on GSE delinquents. This is up from $565/quarter for non-GSEs back when Altisource generated the above run-off projection, and that unexpected tailwind clearly aided in beating internal revenue projections.It is important to remember that when Ocwen sold MSRs to deleverage, it primarily sold GSE loans where it wasn't really earning much on the servicing. Total loan count on GSEs fell by more than 50%. Non-GSEs, however, were primarily kept, with loan count in that asset class falling just 20% since the middle of Q2 2014. This has been a big boost to Altisource and a key reason why top-line results have held up.So What Is The Ocwen Business Worth?While there is significant value in these assets even if they continue to fall, I believe Advantage Capital is being a little too aggressive on the margins assumed in this business. The 35% FCF margin assumptions in that linked research note on the Ocwen business is simply too high - remember Altisource generated $159M in free cash flow ($195M in operating cash flow, $36M in capex) company-wide in 2015.If Ocwen truly could manage to earn 35% FCF margins on Ocwen business in 2015, then Ocwen-only revenue of $631.6M would have generated $221M in free cash flow. The numbers simply don't tie out no matter how you slice it unless you assume the rest of the business is operating at a loss, which isn't true given management commentary.It is more likely that the Ocwen-related business is earning FCF margins equal to, or perhaps just marginally more, than that of the rest of the business, which was 15% in 2015 (GAAP, also assuming all capex is growth). This breaks a large part of Advantage Capital's $65/share valuation for Altisource, which assumed $25/share in run-off residual value for the Ocwen business. Given potential margin contraction from a shrinking number of loans serviced (this is a high fixed cost, low variable cost business) and contraction in fees earned per delinquent loan (bankruptcy/foreclosure, and REO loans are shrinking, as well as delinquency rates), it is important to set realistic expectations. The residual Ocwen business may only generate $32M in free cash flow by 2020 (maintaining 15% FCF margin) given guided run-off based off of Altisource's prior $231M 2020 projection. It depends on how you play with the numbers, but I honestly see the value of the Ocwen business (assuming no MSR purchases) worth no more than $12-14/share discounted back to today (10% discount rate) due to the excess cash flows in the short term.If you see those estimates as more proper, you dispel the whole ""Buy Altisource, get non-Ocwen business (and possible Ocwen greenlight on future MSR buys) for free"" story. That is more my view here, and I don't think the market would allow value seekers to have that much free cake.Non-Ocwen Business - An Outlet?Altisource has done a pretty poor job of meaningfully growing revenues in Technology and Financial Services segments once you factor in trying to offset revenue declines stemming from lost Ocwen business. Why? No real differentiation from competitors. Financial Services is basically glorified debt collection and relationship management, including outside of its core competency (housing), where the company has been venturing into auto lending and retail credit (among other sectors). While it is set to grow marginally in 2016, this is a 10% operating margin business (excluding corporate overhead). Put into perspective, this is one third the operating margin in the much larger Mortgage Servicing business. Likewise, the Technology business operated at a GAAP operating loss in 2015 and a pitiful $2M operating profit in 2014, even excluding the $110M in impairment losses both of these businesses were hit with. Thus far in 2016, there has been no change - profits are allusive. Technology Services continues to generate GAAP losses and Financial Services earned just $1.4M through the first half of the year (once again, ex-corporate overhead). As the revenue associated within both these segments from Ocwen shrink, it is only natural to expect to see even more pressure on the margins here.Simple answer here: no profits, no value, with no real reason to believe there will be any future value generated in the future. I place next to no value on these businesses, and you shouldn't either.Altisource Portfolio Solutions, May 10, 2016, Investor PresentationOffsetting Ocwen Mortgage Servicing DeclinesWhere Altisource has had success is selling its Mortgage Services offerings, growing non-Ocwen revenue from $32M in 2013 to $107M ttm from Q1 2016. This is where Altisource needs to have continued success, and it is set to see some growth in the coming quarters. Current internal expectations are for $202M in non-Ocwen Mortgage Servicing revenue given 2016 scenario averages, with a substantial piece of that coming from the growing Real Estate Investor solutions business ($70M growth y/y). This is a key metric to focus in on given a fairer value on the residual Ocwen business as Altisource management needs to craft a viable, standalone Mortgage Services business beyond Ocwen.Assuming $200M in 2016 revenue as a base (mid-point of guidance) and 20% annual revenue growth going forward, this is a $500M revenue business by 2020. This is an aggressive expectation, but it is the bare minimum of what is needed to offset Ocwen business run-off. 20% growth is well in excess of expected market growth in this market, and therefore would assume Altisource taking significant market share from other players. Given current operating margins, this new business could throw off $100M in operating profit - but on aggressive assumptions.Setting Reasonable Expectations For 2016Altisource has managed to do well in the first half of 2016 on the revenue side because of earning higher revenues per delinquent loan serviced by Ocwen, especially within Q2 which saw a 14.2% q/q increase.But remember, the company still missed earnings expectations. With delinquency rates falling and time a property spends in REO shrinking, I don't see these rates as sustainable, and certainly not growing from here. The last time we saw a measurable fall in rates per loan (Q2 2014 to Q4 2014 across both GSE and non-GSE), investors dealt with massive earnings misses in those quarters and a share price that collapsed more than 60%. While other issues in the time frame added to that sell-off, weak earnings results stemming in part from falling fee revenue were a large contributing factor, one that many underestimated.Piper Jaffray analyst Kevin Barker zeroed in on this on the most recent earnings call:Altisource management's answer pointed to declines. How much was not stated, but it is likely this number will come down to more reasonable levels ($575-600/loan for non-GSE in Q3/Q4), and current Street consensus revenue estimates back that, with projected revenues down 15% y/y from Q3 2015. This is more in line with loan count run-off, pointing towards somewhat moderating expectations on service revenues per loan. To me, this still might be a touch on the high side, and I caution investors to be careful of expectations into the back half of the year.GAAP Versus Non-GAAP - An Issue?Altisource Portfolio Solutions, May 10, 2016, Investor PresentationThere has been plenty of discussion on the proliferation of non-GAAP reporting recently, and skeptics will have plenty to take fire at here at Altisource, but only at first glance. While I'm not a fan of Altisource, the company does get a passing grade here. What has driven the wide disparity in 2015 and ttm 2016 compared to prior years has been both impairment charges and growing intangible asset amortization. Impairment charge back-outs are typical across most industries, and Altisource took impairment charges of $37.4M in 2014 (related to its 2013 acquisition of Equator) and $55.7M in 2015 (general charge against its Technology Services segment). Altisource has had a penchant for acquiring competitors to complement its suite of products, and unfortunately in the technology space, given the lack of hard assets, booking goodwill on the balance sheet is part of the game. It should be noted that only $82M in goodwill remains on the balance sheet, even after the 2015 acquisitions of CastleLine and RentRange, so perhaps investors can take solace that there isn't much left to write off on older deals. Newer deals have seen premiums come down (on an EV/EBITDA basis), so they are less likely to fail impairment testing.Intangible asset amortization is another oft-debated issue. Intangible amortization expense has grown from $4.6M in 2012 to $38.2M in 2015 despite little movement in adjusted net income. Why the expenses? For Altisource, this primarily comes down to expensing the value of customer relationships, especially within its Homeward and ResCap business acquisitions. When Altisource makes acquisitions, retaining and maintaining existing customer relationships is paramount, and these relationships can and do have a lot of value.These charges should begin to taper off over time as well. Per the company's most recent 10-K, the remaining net carrying value of these assets is $160M, with a weighted average useful life of 10 years. For fiscal years 2016-2020, estimated amortization expense is expected to fall from $32.3M to $19.5M, nearly a 50% haircut. The drop-off in these expenses should provide soft tailwinds to the company's results y/y as the company moves forward.ValuationI think you have to take the long look here to get a decent picture. Assuming margins stay stable and Altisource executes on non-Ocwen growth in 2020, free cash flow will have fallen from 2015 levels ($100M free cash flow from new, non-Ocwen business wins, $32M from residual Ocwen business). There is some residual value from the excess cash flows in prior years as the business contracts, but I don't see this company being worth more than 10% FCF yield on the valuation front in 2020, which points to fair value around $914M in enterprise value today (10% discount to fair value). You can build in some additional value from excess cash flows in prior, higher earning years, but it is tough to build a case for more than 30% upside from current levels in my opinion.It is clear that if you think Altisource significantly outperforms from today's price, you either assume that:1) Ocwen gets cleared for more MSR purchases2) Altisource manages to more than double its Mortgage Servicing business from today in 3.5 yearsOption 2 is already pretty aggressive and builds in some strong assumptions on management execution. In order to truly see meaningful upside potential in Altisource from current levels, I believe investors need to be assuming a return of Ocwen to the MSR market. To get there, Ocwen needs a servicer upgrade and clearance from California and New York monitors. That assumption isn't incredulous; I actually believe there is a solid argument to be made for that approval sometime in 2017. In fact, its likelihood is likely stronger than Altisource building its non-Owen revenue. If you buy into that possibility, Ocwen equity itself makes more sense from a risk/reward perspective, given the steeper discount to tangible book value and run-rate to profitability. In short, Altisource may have upside, but in this case, it makes more sense to go straight to the core company.For more research like this on small/mid cap companies perpetually under-followed by Wall Street and under-owned by retail investors, consider following me (by clicking the ""Follow"" button at the top of this article next to my name) to receive notification when I publish research.

3619256,77255,2015-10-29T10:49:51-04:00,Trading at 4.5x LTM Earnings.We believe stock is worth $65 in six to eight months.Market is underestimating non-Ocwen growth opportunities.,"Following the announcement on October 22nd of a healthy 25% beat to Q3 2015 adj. earnings ($2.27 per share vs. $1.82 est.) ASPS traded down from $31.77 to its current price of $27.76. We believe ASPS continues to present an extremely compelling investment. ASPS trades cheap on a historical basis and we believe the market is severely underestimating their ability to grow non-Ocwen revenue while overestimating ongoing Ocwen-related risks. We believe this stock will re-rate to an 8x P/E once management provides 2017 guidance and has provided a year of solid earnings away from Ocwen. This will have taken place by their Q1 2016 release in April 2016. Therefore, our Spring 2016 price target is $65 implying a 135% gross return and 470% IRR. ASPS is currently ~$535mm Market Cap, $945mm EV and trades about $11mm per day.Altisource Portfolio Solutions SA (NASDAQ:ASPS) is primarily a provider of software and analytics tools for mortgage servicers and financial services companies in the real estate and consumer finance space.The stock has traded down from a high of $170 in December of 2013 due to regulatory issues at ASPS's primary customer, Ocwen. These regulatory issues have since been settled and never directly affected ASPS.ASPS has LTM Adjusted Net Income of $118.4mm. This implies a P/E ratio of 4.5x and includes two horrendous Q's (Q4 14 and Q1 15) as they addressed their issues with Ocwen. Using sell side estimates of $29.95mm Adj. Net Income in Q4 15 and $22.25mm in Q1 16 implies that once ASPS clears these two poor quarters they'll have LTM Adj. Net Income of 152.7mm, implying a P/E of 3.5x.ASPS Management has guided to 2016 Adj. Net Income of $85mm-$160mm, implying a forward P/E of 6.3x to 3.3x. For what it's worth, in January of 2015 ASPS management guided to $95mm-$160mm of Adj. Net Income for 2015. Despite an extremely tumultuous year, it is unfathomably unlikely that ASPS underperforms the midpoint of their 2015 guidance.ASPS is trading extremely cheap on a historical basis. The market finds little credence in management's ability to generate comparable earnings going forward, let alone generate earnings growth in the future. There are three somewhat intertwined reasons for this 1) going-concern risk for Ocwen 2) concerns regarding Ocwen's ability to write new business and generate mortgage servicing revenue for ASPS and 3) questions regarding ASPS's ability to generate top line growth through their newer non-Ocwen businesses.Ocwen Going Concern Risk: OCN traded to a low of ~$5.65 in Jan/Feb of this year as numerous parties put a huge amount of pressure on the Company. The NYDFS forced Ocwen to stop acquiring new Mortgage Servicing Rights, a hedge fund group asserted that the actions initiated by the NYDFS represented a default under Ocwen's servicing agreements and pushed for mortgage trustees to move business away from Ocwen, and ratings agencies downgraded Ocwen's servicer ratings (as distinct from their credit ratings).Since this time, Benjamin Lawsky, the Superintendent of New York State Financial Services and effective head of the NYDFS has stepped down, noise relating to trustee-instructed transfers has died down completely and ratings agencies are likely to upgrade in the near future (the ratings agencies are discussed in more detail below).Given the above, we believe that the chances of Ocwen going anywhere are mitigated and are in the single figure percentage likelihood. OCN stock has traded poorly as there is concern in the market regarding their ability to maintain positive cash flow. However, ASPS does not need Ocwen to be earning significant amounts in order to be successful. They merely need Ocwen to maintain current operations.There is a related concern that New Residential Investment Corp (NYSE:NRZ) will be able to take control of Ocwen's non-agency MSRs in 2017 if S&P has not upgraded Ocwen's servicer rating by then. We believe this to be highly unlikely. Firstly, we believe that S&P will upgrade Ocwen well prior to 2017 as OCN management continues to work with the agency to obtain an upgrade which would move S&P's rating of Ocwen to roughly on par with Moody's. Secondly, even if is there is no upgrade, our diligence indicates that it is extremely difficult from both an operational and regulatory perspective to transfer MSRs in the manner NRZ would need. Given that the legacy MSR book would only have 3-4 years of useful life at that point we have a hard time understanding what possible incentive NRZ would have to undertake such a procedure.Ocwen-related MSR growth: The below slide is pulled from ASPS's Q3 2015 earnings call presentation. ASPS outlines their expectations for Ocwen related revenue through 2020 critically assuming that Ocwen is never able to begin acquiring MSR's again (the suspension of this right was the critical punishment in the NYDFS settlement). Simplistically, we believe ASPS generates FCF margins of ~35% on this revenue, meaning its worth $25 per share when discounted back at 10%. So, even if Ocwen never buys another MSR, the Ocwen book of business is worth a huge amount to ASPS.We believe however that there is a good chance that Ocwen will be able to purchase MSRs in the future. The main hurdle to buying MSRs is approval from the NYDFS and the California equivalent, the California DBO. The below quote is from Ron Faris, Ocwen's CEO, during their Q2 2015 earnings call:""In line with the settlement consent order, we are also working with the New York Operations Monitor on criteria for Ocwen to be able to purchase mortgage servicing rights again, but it is too early to say when that process will be completed.Also during the quarter, the California DBO announced that it had selected Fidelity Information Services as its auditor. While the engagement is just beginning, we understand the scope will be focused on reviewing servicing files and assessing Ocwen's compliance with applicable California and federal laws. We are committed to working closely with the California auditor and the California regulator. In order to receive approval from the California regulator to resume mortgage servicing right purchases in California, we must demonstrate our ability to provide them information in a timely manner and in a form requested.We are committed to meeting these requirements as soon as we can, but it is, again, too early to predict when that might be. We continue to work closely with other state regulators and have provided an update to recent exam activity in our investor presentation. We are not aware of any licensing issues that would have a material financial impact on us and we are not aware of nor anticipating any material fines or penalties from our state regulators.""We recognize that without a firm timeline for Ocwen to resume purchases it is difficult to get overly excited about this information. In our base case for ASPS we do not allow for any MSR purchases by Ocwen. However, we believe that the above quote highlights just how focused Ocwen is on working with their regulators to resume the purchase of MSRs. We would therefore be remiss not to mention this possibility as the announcement of MSR purchases by Ocwen would be an enormous positive catalyst for ASPS stock in our view. ASPS has a service agreement with Ocwen through 2025 so any new purchases by Ocwen would flow through to ASPS.Non-Ocwen Growth: Management is forecasting 60% growth in non-Ocwen revenue from 2015 to 2016. They break this down as 166% growth in Mortgage Servicing Revenue and a blended 20% decline in financial services and technology revenue. While we believe there is potential in the Company's tech and financial services platform, we will focus on their mortgage servicing opportunities. Given management's robust 2016 growth expectations, we believe it is reasonable to assume that ASPS will continue to grow their non-Ocwen mortgage servicing at a rate of 35% per year thru 2020. This implies that the line item will contribute ~$840mm to revenue by 2020.Digging a little deeper, ASPS has four revenue lines of non-Ocwen Mortgage servicing revenue. These are (letters reference the above slide) a) Servicer Related Services (projected to grow from $25mm in '15 to $63mm in '16 or 152%) b) Origination Services and Technologies (projected to grow from $35mm in '15 to $62mm in '16 or 77%), c) Online Real Estate Marketplace (projected to grow from $5mm in '15 to $62mm in '16 or 560%) and d) Rental and Renovation Services and Technologies (projected to grow from $28mm in '15 to $95mm in '16 or 239%).Altisource was selected by a top 10 US bank to provide pre-foreclosure services and manage its Real Estate Owned (REO). We believe this accounts for the majority of growth in 2016 Servicer Related Services (segement a). We cannot hope for 152% annualized growth in this segment but we do believe that this contract is an extremely bullish signal as it reflects the fact that servicers apart from Ocwen see value in the ASPS product. We believe it is reasonable to assume 20-30% annual growth in this segment at a minimum. Here is the ASPS CEO discussing the pipeline for origination services growth on the Q3 2015 call:""Our management and sales team also continue to develop a robust pipeline of opportunities. In addition to growing the services we provide to two top 10 banks, we are engaged in strong sales dialogues and responding to RFPs from several of the country's largest financial institutions. With the reception and success we are experiencing in the market, we believe the midpoint of our 2016 scenarios for this initiative of $93 million, as set forth on slide 21, is reasonable.""Origination Services and Technologies (segement b) is believed to be a $25 Billion addressable services market (ASPS Estimate). The Company describes this market as ""challenging"" due to market wide regulatory issues originating new mortgages. However, ASPS is pivoting to focus on smaller lenders (we believe more in the consumer finance space than mortgage lending). While ASPS notes they've signed service agreements with 10 new customers in this segment just in Q3 we do not assign any growth to this segment above the 2016 level due to lack of visiblity.Online Real Estate Marketplace (segement c) is the big option for ASPS. This segment relates to the Company's new initiatives, Owners.com and Hubzu.com. Owners.com is a platform for owner directed real estate transactions (you can go to the site now and buy a house directly from an owner). At first glance this doesn't seem particularly exciting. There are innumerable Silicon Valley startups aiming to build the exact same website. However, we believe ASPS has a HUGE competitive advantage here. Their entire business is to ensure that the back office and transactional aspects of buying and selling real estate as well as acquiring a mortgage is run smoothly and efficiently. Any tech startup can be essentially boiled down to ""we're going to simplify the process and cut out any middle men"". The current offerings distinctly fail to do this as buyers and sellers still need to work through brokers and have significant closing costs. We believe Owners.com and to a lesser extent Hubzu.com have an opportunity to completely change this dynamic due to ASPS's position as one of the central cogs in the real estate back office process. We estimate an extremely conservative 70% growth rate for this segment given management's expectations for liftoff in 2016. Don't get us wrong though, 3 years down the road there is a chance that this is the only segment of ASPS that anyone cares about. We will not post the entire quote here, but strongly advise that those interested read Mr. Shepro's comments regarding the hard work they have already done to make Owners.com a transformational business.Rental and Renovation Services and Technologies (segement d) is also extremely compelling. In this instance we will quote Mr. Shepro liberally as we believe he describes the business perfectly:""Our last initiative ... is growing our rental and renovation services and technology businesses. With approximately 15 million single-family rental homes in the United States and a small percentage of these homes owned by institutional investors, this is a very large fragmented market.With the suite of services and technologies and the scale to reduce costs for real estate investors, we believe we are well-positioned to grow. … We anticipate that our 2016 revenue growth will come from two sources. First, growing revenue from existing and new customers; and second, deploying a portion of our cash in a program to buy, renovate, and sell homes as a principal.""Essentially, as larger investors continue to aggressively enter the rental markets, ASPS will aim to be the go to provider of back office and software solutions both in the initial purchase of rental homes as well as ongoing day-to-day operations of a rental business. We believe this is another market ripe for a business with Altisource's expertise to revolutionize. We project 50% growth in this segment and again note that this estimate is conservative in our view.In summary, we'll leave you with this quote from the ASPS CFO Michelle Esterman during the Q3 2015 Earnings Call:""Finally, turning to 2017, we believe that we are positioning the company to generate higher service revenue and earnings in 2017 when compared to the midpoint of the 2016 scenarios. This, of course, is dependent on the successful execution of our plan.""Company is buying back stockThe Company bought back 1.4mm shares at an average price of $28.57 in Q2 and an additional 200k shares at an average price of $26.88 in Q3. While management has indicated that the will be less aggressive going forward, we believe this is mainly an attempt to show an abundance of caution with regard to the outside chance that Ocwen has going concern issues. As stated above, we feel the chances Ocwen has going concern issues is highly unlikely today. As this probability continues to recede we expect to see ASPS back in the market for their own shares. As shareholders we believe the best thing that ASPS can be doing today is buying back shares. We'd advocate that all shareholders express their support for ongoing buybacks to management.ASPS Management Buying in Open MarketASPS Management has been active in the open market for ASPS stock, headlined by ASPS CEO Bill Shepro buying 38,500 shares of ASPS at an average price of $26.19 in April and May. We strongly applaud Mr. Shepro for this purchase. We would take a moment to further applaud him given that at a cost of just over $1mm, this purchase amount is almost 50% of his total disclosed pre-tax compensation for 2014 at $2.2mm.ConclusionShorts would claim this is a perfect example of a 'value trap', a stock that trades very cheap on a historical multiple basis but is overvalued because it will be unable to match historical numbers. We believe the shorts are dead wrong. ASPS, to us, represents a Michael Burry-style 'ick' investment. Yes, there are hard to analyze issues relating to Ocwen, NRZ and potential growth of Non-Ocwen revenue but the stock today is completely overestimating the probability of these issues affecting Altisource's ability to be a successful company. At current levels, the stock is only overvalued if Ocwen disappears AND ASPS management completely fails to deliver on their new growth initiatives, a combination of outcomes we view to be an extreme tail risk. In any other scenario, the stock is drastically cheap."
3353555,24663,2015-07-24T00:10:22-04:00,ASPS is trading higher by more than 25% after beating second quarter earnings.It's still down 65% the last year.3 things in its earnings report make me think that it can go even higher.,"Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ:ASPS) has jumped higher by more than 25% after its second quarter report, and at first glance, I asked ""why?"". After taking a deeper look, it is clear that Altisource took two steps forward in addressing its many doubters, and that its stock should continue to go higher.Altisource is a company that provides residential mortgage services to companies that originate and service loans. The range of services are wide, such as real estate brokerage, insurance services, residential property valuation, collection and customer relationship management, and software services for managing loans and foreclosures.In other words, Altisource is a very diversified business in the world of residential mortgages, but one area where it is not diversified is in where its revenue and business is created. Last year, Altisource earned 60% of its revenue from Ocwen (NYSE:OCN), whose stock has collapsed 70% in the last year following a series of legal, leadership, and regulatory issues that came to light. The problem for Altisource is in fact its reliance on Ocwen for business, which fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Kurtosis figures to be over 85%, more than the 60% that Altisource claims. Regardless, Altisource earns a lot of its business from the troubled Ocwen.In retrospect, one could write a book discussing the countless events that have pushed both Ocwen's and Altisource's stocks lower over the last year. For a summary, you can read about Ocwen's regulatory and operating struggles here and here. Due to Altisource's connection to Ocwen, it has been dragged down too, but since Ocwen settled many of its suits, some have speculated that Altisource can get a fresh start. It appears that way.With all that said, why is Altisource's stock soaring more than 25% behind its second quarter? The most obvious answer is that the company's service revenue jumped 10% sequentially, signalling a comeback of sorts. Beyond that, its EPS of $2.62 was about $1.30 better than analysts had expected. Thus, these are obvious reasons that Altisource is trading higher. However, there are three additional reasons that I think are more meaningful for long-term investors. After all, we've seen Altisource show flashes of brilliance only to fizzle away soon after.First, the number of houses sold for customers other than Ocwen jumped 33% quarter-over-quarter to 1,168. Further, it was 39 times higher than in the same period last year! Meanwhile, the number of loans serviced by Ocwen declined 9% quarter over quarter. Clearly, this data shows that Altisource is diversifying its business and lessening its reliance on Ocwen. Given the events that transpired over the last year, this is great to see, and even more so that Altisource is able to find growth despite drifting away from Ocwen.Second, I think Altisource's acquisition of CastleLine is significant. By gaining CastleLine's technology, Altisource will strengthen its own products for mitigating risk in the origination, underwriting, and purchase of residential mortgages. This is an acquisition that might not have a material impact on Altisource's top-line, but for a business like Altisource, anything that mitigates risk is a good thing. In essence, it could help prevent what happened last year from occurring in the future.Third, Altisource is buying back stock, again. Altisource's stock buybacks had slowed significantly during the last couple quarters, as it was dealing with the mess created between it and Ocwen. But during the second quarter, Altisource repurchased 1.4 million shares of its common stock, about $40 million worth. That's fairly significant relative to a $630 million company. In my opinion, this reflects confidence and optimism on behalf of management.All things considered, Altisource's revenue is growing, its margins are expanding, reliance on Ocwen is declining, and it's making moves to ensure that investors don't have to relive the last year (CastleLine). These things combined with the confidence created by buybacks lead me to believe that Altisource can go a lot higher.While I have not yet applied Altisource to my numeric research platform, I'm willing to bet that at 9x earnings, and combined with these things noted, that it'll rank rather high as a stock to keep trading higher. One thing is for sure, I'm willing to take a gamble."
3281625,58671,2015-06-24T15:51:38-04:00,Scenarios laid out by the company vary wildly for 2015 Earnings: EPS of $4.40 to $7.65.Diversifying business away from Ocwen Related revenue will reduce risk significantly.Risk decreases significantly as Ben Lawsky moves on from NYDFS.,"Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ:ASPS) is a mortgage services company that has been severely beaten up due to it's close ties to Ocwen Financial. Ocwen had a robo-signing and illegal business practice scandal that was highly publicized because of the NY DFS Superintendent Ben Lawsky tried to make an example of them. I believe after accounting for the risks associated with this scandal, the risk reward of an investment in the company looks really strong right now for a few key reasons.History and BusinessAltisource is an August 2009 spin-off from Ocwen and is under significant influence from its founder and previous Chairman, Bill Erbey. The company has a diverse set of businesses. Altisource provides Mortgage Services, both Default and Origination Services, Technology Services, and Financial Services. For those not in the mortgage business these seem like pretty broad and general services categories. To get a sense of what each means, where is the descriptions provided by the company in the latest 10-K.If you want a more detailed description of their business here is the location of the last 10-K, look on pages 3,4, & 5.Recent Issues with Ocwen, Lawsky, and ErbeyAltisource gets roughly 60% of its revenues from Ocwen related business. So understanding what is going on at Ocwen is important to understanding the risks associated with an investment in Altisource. Here is a good explanation of what has happened in the Ocwen vs Lawsky saga. Here is a letter from Lawsky that alleges the wrongdoing, including funneling fee based business to Altisource from Ocwen through subsidiaries, which is illegal.Ocwen has since agreed with Lawsky to pay a fine and no longer pursue some of these illegal actions. William Erbey, who is the man behind Ocwen and Altisource was heavily involved with the outcome and it cost him a lot of money. Here is a good summary of what happened to Erbey and his fortune due to the issues at Ocwen and the subsequent agreement they reached with NYDFS.This is all pretty scary stuff, as it implies that Altisource had some pretty rosy deals set up with Ocwen in which they did little to collect fees. Because of the changes that will come from this agreement the margins at the company will contract significantly, at least for the 60% of their revenues that are tied to Ocwen. There is a big risk right now as no one is really sure how much the margins will contract or how much the revenue growth will slow. Based on the 2014 Q4 and 2015 Q1 results it is hard to tell exactly what the margins will be going forward as they had significant costs associated with this entire scandal that have burdened their expenses. In part Altisource is also working out exactly how the business will operate going foward. So those are the risks, uncertain margins and uncertain revenue growth, at least in the short term.Upside CatalystsI view an investment in the company via a risk-reward assessment of what I view as the most likely outcome. The positive outcome would be that Altisource gets back to growing their top line review in 2015, while further separating themselves from Ocwen and its lingering issues. Here are the main Catalysts that could drive the stock up and improve performance at the company in 2015.1) Ben Lawsky is has left the NY DFS to start his own legal and consulting firm. Ben Lawsky has been the major driving force behind the investigation against Ocwen and the subsequent fines and agreement. With him out of the job it looks like future scrutiny of the business will diminish.2) Altisource still believes it can produce $4.40 to $7.95 in EPS in 2015. In Q1 of 2015 Altisource reported and EPS of $0.18, but they guided via a Scenario Analysis of a pretty wide range of outcomes for the rest of the year. Their lowest Scenario still yields an EPS of $4.40, Stock trades at about $31 a share, so that is an forward P/E of 7.Source: Companies Q1 Earnings Presentation3) Hubzu and Owners.com continues to gain traction. Hubzu.com and Owners.com are two websites that Altisource owns and operates. Hubzu is a platform mainly for Real Estate Owned (REO) properties to be resold to investors, financial institutions, and banks. With Hubzu the company is trying to change the way that people go about buying real estate by simplifying and eliminating at lot of the costs through better technology. Hubzu continues to gain traction increases the amount of houses sold on the sight by 24% in Q1 y-o-y. Owner.com is a For Sale By Owner website that assist peopling in selling their own homes an avoiding paying a real estate agent. Both the websites are attempting to drive down the costs of buying and selling real estate and I believe they will be very valuable to Altisource as they grow.ConclusionWeighing the forward risks and the potential upside rewards for Altisource after the recent scandal, it seems to me that Altisource is a great investment. The company will likely continue to struggle through 2015, but 2016 and behind look very bright for the company. The opportunity set is really big as management has shown they are willing to push the company into new areas in the Real Estate market to drive revenue growth and profitability. The company is not fearful of driving change in the market either with their Hubzu and Owners.com websites. The stock is currently very cheap compared to the price at this time last year of over $100 a share, and I believe it is currently worth between $55-$60 a share, with the change to return to $100 a share one year out. Their is some execution risk, but in the worst case the company is likely at least worth $20-$25 a share."
3677326,28891,2015-11-11T16:24:54-05:00,"Hubzu - A spin off of the online businesses would create enormous value for shareholders likely worth close to current market cap of $560mm.
        Several comps in the sector confirm Hubzu is much more valuable as separate entity.
        Management needs to monetize these assets given the current environment.","Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ:ASPS) is a specialty finance company we recently wrote about as being severely undervalued with lots of upside based upon multiple expansion as well as being our #1 short squeeze candidate. Our previous analysis was focused upon the low Price/Earnings & Price/Sales multiples, strong shareholder base as well as the high short interest & extremely tight float. One additional value driver that we did not focus upon but will do so now is their online asset Hubzu.com. The company also made some tuck in acquisitions in the online space but we will focus on the above as we believe is their marquis asset.Online Real Estate Portal Assets - What are they worth?How valuable is Hubzu and their other online assets? Based upon recent mergers and acquisitions in the internet space, we believe these assets are worth a minimum of $500 million in their current form. How could this be possible given that the entire market cap of ASPS is approximately $550 million. We have prepared a table below highlighting recent transactions in the internet space and the multiples being paid by acquirers or merging companies.You can see the Price/Sales multiples being paid are very generous ranging from approximately 1.0x to about 20.0x not taking into account some extreme multiples that were higher. Many listed in the table are in the general internet space but I would point out four key transactions that we feel are relevant:Real Estate portal transactions in this space have been acquired at a range of 4.1x - 20.1x. CoStar bought Loopnet which was a commercial real estate listing website. Zillow bought Trulia to consolidate the residential listing directories and brokerage business. News Corp bought Move.com which owns Realtor.com to gain access to online listings. Expedia recently purchased HomeAway to compete with AirBnb. You can see from the above, there is exceptional value for anyone who has a meaningful peace of this market. In addition, scale will be an issue and you can see it has become a necessity for large players to adopt a ""land grab strategy"" basically acquiring anything of size.Hubzu.com - What is it worth?Hubzu is a real estate portal that conducts online real estate auctions bringing buyers and sellers into one transparent marketplace. For the latest 12 month period ending in Q3-2015, Hubzu generated $194.1m in service revenue. This is growth of 33% over $145.7m in last years comparable period. The average transaction per house sold during the year was approximately $5,913 based upon 32,827 homes that were sold. The bulk of these homes are Ocwen (NYSE:OCN) service portfolios but the group is expanding its non Ocwen business.Another good comparable company to Hubzu is Xome, a division of Nationstar Mortgage (NYSE:NSM). Xome had trailing 12 month revenues of $421m with 37% Y/Y growth as of Q3-2015. On a recent earnings call, NSM indicated that Xome was looking to raise capital at a $1.0B valuation implying a 2.37x PS ratio.Based on the below table, we believe Hubzu could easily be valued at $460m based upon a minimal 2.37x PS ratio. In addition, when you add in their others assets Owners.com as well as their recent tuck in acquisitions, you can easily come up with a valuation north of $500m if these assets were spun off as a separate entity or raised capital privately.Based upon a 19.3 million share count, $500m implies about $26 in value that is not reflected in the current share price of $28.ConclusionManagement continues to keep investors in the dark about the relative value of this company and appears to dismiss smaller shareholder concerns. We have spoken with several investors who voiced similar concerns and urge their three largest holders (Luxor Capital, Leon Cooperman's Omega, and Putnam) to pursue these discussions with management as it has become really clear, they have no intention supporting their stock or appeasing general shareholders.We reiterate, ASPS is worth $72 based upon 2016 EPS of $6.00 with an expanding PE multiple of 12. In addition, we believe the online assets (Hubzu, Owners.com & misc.) are worth $500m as a separate entity and ASPS should explore strategic alternatives to monetize this segment. Given they have done nothing to comfort investors when their stock price has declined from over $100+ to $28, we don't understand their intention to keep shareholders and new investors in the dark. Specifically, the recent $13 drop from $39.00 (pre-market) to $26.42 (close) on an earnings beat on October 22nd has troubled us. We can't even imagine where the stock would be if earnings were missed.In closing, we urge CEO William Shepro and CFO Michelle Esterman to address why strategic options are not being explored as well as their plans in delivering a clear message to shareholders. Most shareholders including ourselves have been troubled by the stocks performance over the last year and have lost patience with this muted message being delivered by the current team."

The company has been stuck in a myriad of legal cases regarding its affiliate, Ocwen, which operated a doubtful business.Share price plummeted and the whole business model of ASPS is now threatened as Ocwen is not able to fend off the allegations.We believe that there is an opportunity in ASPS as OCN seems to have most of the troubles behind and they are not likely to lose its whole business.","Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (NASDAQ:ASPS) is one of the leading providers for a variety of financial services in the US. ASPS mainly focuses on marketing solutions for household debt, mostly mortgages, but has a range of products available to customers.Investment thesisASPS has been rattled in the past few months because of the direction taken by Ocwen (NYSE:OCN), an affiliated company that was founded by the same person as ASPS; William Erbey. Erbey made his fortune by creating a complex mortgage servicing empire, consisting of the following five companies: Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. , Altisource Residential Corporation (NYSE:RESI), Altisource Asset Management Corporation (NYSEMKT:AAMC), Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd. (NASDAQ:HLSS) and, finally, Ocwen.The last of these companies has been shattered by a legal case that surfaced against the company in mid-2014, accusing Erbey and his companies of having severely conflicting interests due to the nature of the close links between them. Ocwen is now fighting a life-or-death struggle and, if prosecutors are successful, Ocwen will be forced to withdraw its license and completely shut down its operations. This would definitely affect other parts of Erbey's empire as OCN is a major customer of the other companies, especially ASPS whose revenues are highly dependent on OCN, meaning the fate of the stock hinges on the court result.This has made ASPS the subject of some very attractive valuations which could prove to be a perfect entry point; if the case is thrown out or its impact is lessened, OCN will no doubt survive. Providing a thorough account of the Ocwen case, we will go on to look at the possible implications for ASPS. At the end we will consider if this 'undervalued' company is worth investing in right now and, if this is the case, at what size in one's portfolio.At this point we would like to add a single quote from George Soros;'The worse situation becomes, the less it takes to turn it around, the bigger the upside.'The development of ASPS's share price itself has been a testimony to this quote, skyrocketing on the positive news of mid-January.What Ocwen Did Wrong and how it affects ASPSAs discussed in the introduction, the main issue faced by Ocwen and its affiliates is a conflict of interests, and not only for Mr. Erbey but also for people like the chief risk officer of OCN who is also the chief risk officer for ASPS. This conflict is allegedly present even at a business-level with Hubzu, one of ASPS's online auction platforms, selling mainly OCN property and able to charge a higher price with its additional costs being swallowed by customers. You can read a bit more here.These facts were brought to the attention of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) who started their investigation into OCN during February 2014 but, as they started to look deeper into the company they found issues with its actual operations and eventually accused OCN's core business of 'relying on inadequate systems'; this accusation was the result of a range of problems such as robosigning, wrongful foreclosure, missing documentation and even backdating of foreclosure letters. In addition to this, customer services had mainly been outsourced and staff were found to be lacking sufficient knowledge of the complex world of mortgage financing. Moreover, the financial officer of OCN recently admitted that his company's use of outsourcing could prove to be a real issue.The results of this investigation have had some serious consequences for OCN. First and foremost, the company can no longer acquire any more mortgage servicing rights unless they are approved by the NYDFS. In addition to this, it has had to pay $150 million to impacted house owners as repayment. William Erbey was not left untouched either, having to forfeit the positions he held in his intricate empire, a change that took the stock market by surprise and hammered the stock to its price level, a level that we can still see today. Finally, tough scrutiny will put OCN under a lot of pressure to improve its customer care and internal operations, resulting in a further delay of the improvement of its business and falling revenues as it is limited to servicing its existing loan portfolios.But, as we are considering ASPS as a potential investment, we need to see what the impact is for OCN's companions who haven't been direct affected by these legal developments. The obvious consequence is that, as the bulk of Altisource's revenue is created by its connection with OCN, a failure of OCN to restore its operations in time would definitely endanger the whole core business of ASPS. The company has around 60% of all revenue coming from OCN as it is stated on the latest 10-k here. Although as we can see the termination of OCN would not be terminal for ASPS, it is an important note to make and there are several other recent developments that we also need to take note of.Recent DevelopmentsFirstly, we need to look at the developments tied to its revenue stream and business model as these factors affect our proposed investment in ASPS the most.Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd. , one of the affiliates in Erbey's empire, had troubles with a number of their debenture notes issued as hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management has brought to the public attention. In the case of BlueMountain, as the facts in the Ocwen investigation came to be established, it became apparent that HLSS was heavily reliant on OCN, a relationship that it had not properly disclosed. Moreover, this fact created a material risk with regards to the notes that BlueMountain has been holding which were now, at risk of default in this new light, again comprising HLSS's disclosure practice.Although this seemed to be a huge issue for the company and its operations in New Residential Investment (NYSE:NRZ), a real estate investment trust, it also presented an opportunity to buy, announcing on Monday 23rd of February the acquisition of all outstanding shares for 18.25$ a share in cash, which amount to around $1.3 billion; this move was argued by NRZ as being beneficial for their overall business. While this is an issue on its own, the future plan for HLSS (in the hands of NRZ) could be another. OCN would face higher costs and increased regulatory scrutiny as it will no longer be as close to HLSS. Revenues, if there are any, will therefore be lower because NRZ retains the option of pulling its operations from the hands of OCN and cutting out HLSS entirely. This a definite red flag for OCN and ASPS too, as less revenue for OCN means less revenue for ASPS.When talking about revenue impact, we need to take a note of Ocwen's attempt to shrink its portfolio and create a sizeable cash position for further litigation. This has been done through the sale of 3% of its total mortgage rights to Nationstar Mortgage Financial, raising $9.8B. Even though this move can be seen as the right one in terms of Ocwen's management, demonstrating an understanding of the seriousness of the situation, Nationstar is Ocwen's biggest competitor and doing this will not improve its long-term prospects; OCN will see lower revenue as an effect of this transaction which, yet again, means lower revenues for ASPS.Similarly just few days ago, on the 18th of March, Ocwen announced that it struck the same deal with a subsidiary of Walter Investment Management Corp. Ocwen sold $9.6B worth of servicing right to them. Walter Investment was up 11% on these news, suggesting that they are getting a better position in the market, which could again hurt OCN and thus ASPS.Finally, with regards to revenue, Ocwen has been fired from overseeing the debt behind two major mortgage deals as OCN's servicing ratings were downgraded last year, forcing a technical default on the overseen debt. Although this change will also affect revenues, on the bright side, the majority of shareholders involved in the two deals and several others did not seek to terminate the relationship with OCN on the rest of their deals. Moreover a contributor on Seeking Alpha has written this open letter to Moody's stating that he does not agree with the move of firing Ocwen from this servicing.Let's turn our focus to the legal side of these developments. Here, we have to look at the recent developments surrounding OCN's license in California, a license that the California Department of Business Oversight were eager to suspend. There is some good news with regards to this as the Department has dropped the effort after reaching a settlement with OCN, thus saving this source of revenue. Moreover, this acts as a proxy for other similar cases, if they are to occur.The second development is a negative one, as a class-action lawsuit has been aimed at Ocwen and, on the 11th of March, got an approval from Judge Ramos from the district court in Manhattan. It accuses Ocwen of consumer fraud on the basis of its failure to help homeowners avoid foreclosures during the housing crisis, meaning that Ocwen will at least be liable for fines, if not something worse, again hurting the prospects of its business model.Here we are then with, what we believe, is a complete case of Ocwen and the impact these recent developments have had on ASPS.Altisource's FinancialsNow we need to look at this allegedly attractive valuation of ASPS. The company has a long history of good fundamentals, having seen positive and stable margins since its inception and coping really well with its big increase in revenue.However, as you can see, margins have suffered recently as a result of the Ocwen case.The company, through buybacks, has been increasing the leverage of its capital structure which, with the positive profit margins it has been having, has pushed the ROE in 2014 up more than 100% (at least in Q3). This is a bold move but raises a bit of a red flag as they could have definitely used this cash in a more productive way. The liquidity numbers are satisfactory as well, with a Current Ratio well above 2 and Cash ratio around 1.5, pushed up but with a mostly-positive free cash flow throughout its history.However, Q4 changes the picture a bit. First of all, the company has been operating at a loss of $1.5 million attributable to Altisource and a net income attributable to Altisource of $35.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Outside of the discontinuation of its lender-based insurance brokerage line of business, the fourth quarter 2014 net loss was due to higher costs resulting from the expense of supporting anticipated business growth. Mainly to change expectations of Ocwen's growth, the company has begun to execute a plan that includes eliminating non-revenue generating businesses, reducing vendor fees and eliminating staff to reduce costs. This has accounted for a bigger reimbursement expenses as well as bigger interest expenses due to the previous increase in debt that was issued when these events had yet to take place. Positive figures, however, have been the increase in Operating Cash Flow up to 71.8m$, much more than the 14.17m$ in Q3 2014.What now?Ocwen has been slammed by regulators during the last two years for conflicts of interest, backdating letters to distressed homeowners, and shady dealings with interrelated companies associated with Erbey. This has impacted his whole 'empire' and everyone has suffered a blow in terms of share prices. Is there then the possibility of a turnaround and, as Mr. Soros states, a 'big upside?'We believe that, even though the state of OCN is definitely troubling, it will not be wiped out completely as most of the problems are behind OCN and, although it needs to get approval for any new business, it will retain its business model albeit with increased competition. Altisource therefore could be a more risk-averse way of getting exposure to this situation as prospects quickly start to turn around in terms of share price, assuming new cases are not brought against OCN. Moreover ASPS is not that vulnerable to any legal cases as the main culprit here is OCN. With this in mind, this investment should definitely only occupy a fraction of the portfolio as a whole."

Its biggest client is Ocwen Financial Corporation (NYSE:OCN) and a lot of its revenue is tied to Ocwen's fortunes as a company. Altisource provides the following services, as seen on their website:Mortgage ServicesFinancial ServicesTechnology ServicesAltisource was spun off from Ocwen in 2009 at around $16 per share and grew very rapidly, at one point last year hitting a high of $156 per share. Since then, the stock has tumbled down a steep hill because of all of the regulatory problems facing its parent company, Ocwen Financial. These regulatory matters have made future profitability tougher for ASPS since OCN is their main client.Management at Altisource recently held a conference call and gave a presentation about the company to let investors know the status of the company, since there was so much uncertainty surrounding future earnings with all of OCN problems. The stock rebounded 50% after the conference call, on the news that the company will still be profitable. As I write this article though, the stock is down 13% today after it was up 50% in the last trading session. Management believes the company is significantly undervalued though. They plan to continue buying shares up as they are able to do so.Here are the projected non-GAAP earnings per share for 2015 from the presentation:ASPS seems like a great buy when you look at itls projected P/E ratio for 2015 of around 4/1 or so, depending on how the earnings come in at a share price of $25. However, in the presentation, management also gave us a look at the future. And the future will consist of steadily declining revenue from its existing non-GSE portfolio from runs off over the next few years. In fact, potential service and technology pre-tax income will drop from $205 million in 2015 to $113 million in 2019. This trend is not encouraging for a high P/E ratio.This means that profits will actually decrease in the coming years, unless ASPS can grow its earnings significantly over the next few years by starting new initiatives or adding to their existing non-GSE servicing portfolio. This also doesn't take into account the possibility of Ocwen selling (or being forced to sell) its non-agency portfolios.In the Q&A session on the most recent conference call, an analyst asked if the non-agency mortgages were sold by OCN, if Altisource would still be able to service them or not. Here is what was said:Question: So the contracts don't travel with the servicing?Answer from management: Not with a service transfer.So while ASPS' contracts are locked into 2025 with OCN, if OCN sells the non-agency portfolio, then ASPS could lose that business too.The presentation stated what management plans to do to grow the company over the next year, but it did not say how much this growth will add to the bottom line. As a potential investor, this would make me nervous because of a lack of clarity about future earnings. I would think if they were expecting these new initiatives to add greatly to the bottom line, they would have said so. Not having said anything makes me believe they might not add much to the profitability of the company, at least not anytime soon.Below is what they are planning on doing to grow the company:All of the uncertainties surrounding ASPS and its parent company OCN should make potential investors think twice before investing money into the company. While the current P/E ratio may be pretty low, EPS could actually decrease in the coming years, and I don't see the market paying a premium for that like they did during the years when ASPS was growing at a tremendous rate along with its parent company OCN.Before all of the problems in the past year, the P/E ratio was around 20:1 and this was with great growth prospects for the future. So, with lots of headwinds and the potential for declining EPS, a 20:1 P/E ratio doesn't make sense. A P/E ratio of 10:1 might even be high, especially with potential for declining earnings. And the biggest kicker is that the stated earnings are based on the ""diluted"" EPS, not GAAP earnings per share, which will be lower. In fact, they mentioned preliminary GAAP earnings for the 4th Quarter of 2014 coming in around $0.00 to $0.13 per share...ouch! The ""adjusted diluted"" EPS should be around $0.38-$0.51 per share.While there is potential for a nice rebound if Altisource is able to maintain and grow its earnings per share, I personally think they will be a long ways from growing EPS due to the above mentioned headwinds.For the speculative investor with a stomach of Iron and who sleeps well at night when stocks go up or down by 10%, 20% or even 50% in one day, then ASPS could be a good long term investment if they are able to execute on their growth strategy and buy back shares at this low price with the cash flow that their current non-agency portfolio is providing in the new few years.I am personally staying away from the stock for now, as OCNs problems still have not cleared, with CA being the latest state to give them problems by threatening to suspend OCN mortgage license. While ASPS' management doesn't believe this will happen, it still doesn't help the perception of ASPS or OCN and more states could follow suit."

This is likely to continue in the future.Altisource has reduced its cost base by $80 million on an annualized basis which will significantly improve profitability.Even assuming declines in revenue generated from Ocwen, Altisource trades at just 4.5x 2015 estimated earnings.","It has been a miserable year for shareholders of Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ:ASPS) which has seen its shares fall as much as 90% from their all-time high (struck during 4Q of 2013). Since then, the company has suffered along with its primary customer (60% of 2015 expected revenue) and affiliated company Ocwen Financial (NYSE:OCN). While Altisource's fate is no-doubt linked to Ocwen, assuming that Ocwen continues to exist in something closely resembling its current form (i.e. it doesn't lose state licenses and sell off mortgage servicing rights), there are several reasons to like Altisource Portfolio Solutions, including:What could Altisource be worth?In the slide deck from Friday's call, Altisource management provided the following range of EPS estimates:Using the above as a guide, I built a short form DCF:The DCF above uses inputs slightly more conservative than the midpoint of Altisource's 2015 guidance (my 2015 EBITA is ~10% lower). I assume that Ocwen revenue declines at 12% per year through 2018 and grows at 2% thereafter, while non-Ocwen revenue grows at 10% during the forecast horizon. I assume that total expenses remain flat through 2018 (non-Ocwen are likely increasing while Ocwen related are probably declining) and then grow 3.5% thereafter. As such, EBITA falls from 2015-2018. I apply a 14x P/E (or free cash flow) multiple to 2020 net income which reflects a 23% discount to the Russell 2015 estimated earnings multiple and discount back to the present (using a 12% discount rate) which produces a per share value of nearly $82, or nearly triple the current price. While this represents a significant increase relative to the current share price, it is worth noting that Altisource traded above $80 as recently as October.Of course there are some risks to Altisource achieving the valuation outlined above, including:"
3029676,84996,2015-03-26T05:41:39-04:00,"Altisource’s dependency on Ocwen is deeper than it looks.Sensing a need to preserve capital, Altisource has stopped repurchasing its own stock.The company’s 2013 acquisition of Equator has not generated the benefits expected.Related companies Ocwen and Home Loan Servicing Solutions have failed to file SEC Forms 10-K for the 2014 fiscal year and have received notifications of delisting.","Company value propositionLuxembourg-based Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ: ASPS) is a residential mortgage services company that provides services to companies - primarily Ocwen (NYSE: OCN) - that originate and service residential mortgage loans. With a market capitalization of approximately $290 million (based on its closing stock price of $14.31 on March 24, 2015), Altisource operates through three business segments: mortgage services, financial services and technology services. The mortgage services segment provides various services across the real estate life cycle, such as asset management (property preservation, real estate brokerage), insurance services, residential property valuation, default management services and origination management services. The financial services segment provides collection and customer relationship management services to debt originators and services. The technology services segment provides software and information technology for managing loan servicing and foreclosure-related activities. Of the three segments, mortgage services is by far the largest contributor to the company's P&L.Altisource operates within the highly competitive mortgage servicing market and competes with Nationstar Mortgage (NYSE: NSM) and Walter Investment Management Corporation (NYSE: WAC), among other entities. Its primary competitive advantages have been its relationship with Ocwen, with which Altisource has service agreements through 2025, as well as its utilization of offshore employees (more than 75% of its approximately 9,300 employees at 2014 year end were employed in India, Philippines and Luxembourg).The outlook for the mortgage servicing industry as a whole is not favorable in the near term. Cost per loan serviced has risen dramatically. Regulation has increased and margins have been squeezed.The effect of this is evident on Altisource's stock price. From a high closing stock price of $170.19 achieved on December 3, 2013, Altisource's stock has fallen over 90% through March 24, 2015, while the S&P has increased 16.5% over the same period.P&LAlthough Altisource has various types of revenue within its mortgage services, financial services and technology services segments, the revenue is derived primarily from a single customer, Ocwen. In its latest 10-K filing, Altisource disclosed that 60% of its consolidated revenue comes directly from Ocwen. Importantly, Altisource also disclosed that it earns additional revenue on portfolios serviced by Ocwen that is not considered related party revenue. The revenue that Altisource indirectly earns from Ocwen was $256 million for 2014. The combination of direct related-party revenue as well as indirect revenue from Ocwen-serviced portfolios means that in 2014 approximately 85% of Altisource's revenue was from Ocwen. To my knowledge, the quantity of indirect revenue earned from Ocwen is not something that Altisource previously disclosed prior to its appearance in Altisource's most recent 10-K filing. As a result of this profound dependency, the auditor's report attached to the company's 10-K filing emphasizes the potential implications to Altisource of Ocwen's uncertainties, including uncertainties associated with the possible cessation of the continuing relationship with Ocwen.As Ocwen shrinks, Altisource's revenue will also diminish. Throughout February and March, Ocwen has been selling off its mortgage service rights and strategically reducing the size of its agency servicing portfolio:Moreover, Home Loan Servicing Solutions (NASDAQ: HLSS), which owns mortgage servicing assets and engages Ocwen to service the mortgage loans underlying the mortgage servicing assets, has received requests from a shareholder that servicing be transferred away from Ocwen.Given that recently Ocwen has been selling off its mortgage servicing rights, it is evident that Altisource's business will shrink, unless Altisource can create new revenue sources. However, efforts to increase revenue not related to Ocwen are untested. Altisource recently appointed a chief revenue officer and chief marketing officer to grow its origination services business and attract new clients to its default related businesses, among other things, but these diversification initiatives are still embryonic. One of the company's recent attempts to generate additional revenue not related to Ocwen, i.e. its acquisition of Equator, has not gone well so far. Altisource purchased Equator in late 2013 for $113 million in total consideration, which mostly represented goodwill ($82 million of the net assets acquired). During 2014, Altisource wrote down $37 million of the goodwill it had recognized from the Equator acquisition, having assessed that the expected earnings of Equator would be lower than projected at the time of acquisition and that Equator's fair value was less than its carry value.While mentioning the dependency on Ocwen, it is also critical to observe that neither Ocwen nor HLSS has filed its 10-K for the 2014 year and both have received notifications of delisting from their respective stock exchanges due to this failure to file. HLSS has stated that is needs additional time to prepare information related to its ability to operate as a going concern. Ocwen, in turn, has stated that it needs additional time to file because it continues to analyze HLSS' ability to meet its obligations to fund new servicing advances and because it requires additional time to prepare information related to its ability to operate as a going concern. To the extent that there are doubts about either HLSS' or Ocwen's ability to operate as a going concern, this would have grim repercussions for Altisource.One bright spot in Altisource's P&L has been its low effective tax rate. The effective tax rate has ranged between 6.0% and 7.0% in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The low effective tax rate is due primarily to the effect of deductions in Luxembourg from a tax ruling. However, the tax ruling will expire in 2019 (unless extended or renewed). Given recent events (such as ""LuxLeaks"" and the special committee created in February 2015 by European Union lawmakers to curb tax evasion), it cannot be certain that the tax ruling would be extended or renewed beyond 2019.Balance SheetAltisource has been increasing its quantum of debt and reducing its equity (through share repurchases), resulting in greater leverage and risk. At 2013 year end, Altisource had total debt of approximately $572 million and total equity of approximately $158 million. In contrast, at 2014 year end, the company had total debt of $747 million and total equity of $41 million. From 2013 year end to 2014 year end, the company's debt to equity ratio increased from 3.6:1.0 to a highly leveraged 18.2:1.0. This perilous combination of increasing debt, decreasing equity and decreasing revenue is a clear red flag.Recent eventsVarious recent events have brought repeated bad news to Altisource:Bottom LineConsidering the above, the outlook for Altisource is not favorable. To recap some key points:Based on my analysis of the Company's current state and future prospects, and given the current high level of risk, Altisource shares are a strong sell, even at its current depressed stock price."
2117703,22148,2014-04-01T08:31:27-04:00,NY DFS case appears reaching but the stock and business could suffer short-term.The company has plenty of plans to diversify business away from Ocwen reliance.The stock appears cheap considering the regulation risks and growth potential.,"After astonishing returns following a spin-off from Ocwen Financial Corporation (NYSE:OCN) several years back, Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ:ASPS) shareholders face a surprising dilemma. The company that was benefiting in a way from government legislation that is pushing large financial institutions to sell mortgage-servicing rights now faces a government intent on limiting the growth going forward.Altisource Portfolio Solutions is a leading provider of transaction solutions for the real estate, mortgage and consumer debt industries. The company leverages proprietary business process, vendor and electronic payment management software and behavioral science based analytics to improve outcomes for marketplace participants. In addition, the company still obtains a majority of revenue from Ocwen despite recent efforts to attract new clients and frame the spin-off as needed to unlock that value creating opportunity.Along with Ocwen, the stocks have plunged in 2014 following a move by the top bank regulator in New York State to block the purchase of mortgage servicing rights from Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). The blocking of this deal questions some of the long-term growth prospects of Altisource Portfolio Solutions sending the stock crashing from $170 to $100, potentially setting up a buying opportunity if the government's case ends up flawed. According to the data provided by Hayman Capital, that is the case, but it won't prevent Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York's Department of Financial Services (NY DFS), from holding back the company and the stock.Strong ResultsAs of now, the quarterly earnings aren't really a debate, but we'll review the numbers anyway to get an idea of the potential if the government leaves Ocwen alone. Below are the highlights from the Q413 earnings report:The substantial 58% revenue growth is what drove the stock higher, but of course the recent moves by the state regulators have damaged investor appetites for the stock. Along with Ocwen, the companies have been aggressive repurchasing shares at levels consistent with the current stock prices. A good sign the companies see a strong future of growth, though the regulatory issues clearly caught them off guard.Need For Non-Bank ServicingThe major reasons for the dramatic growth at the non-bank mortgage services are the requirement by financial regulations including Basel III to increase capital requirements at major banks. Selling mortgage-servicing rights frees up capital not to mention the servicing of delinquent loans is seen as harmful to banks consumer franchises. Ironically this requirement is pushing forward the substantial growth that has caused the regulator in New York to question their ability to properly service consumers. So the major banks can't service the loans and the non-bank services are growing too fast. One just has to love the financial regulations in this country.In the case of Wells Fargo, the bank wanted to unload the mortgage servicing rights of a portfolio of 184,000 loans with a total unpaid principal balance, or UPB, of $39 billion. Back in the third-quarter earnings report, the company listed the potential new business opportunities at about $400 billion in UPBs with at least $100 billion in UPB awarded by the end of 2013. In essence, the company forecasted a deal the size of Wells Fargo as relatively small, but of course the movement of the NY DFS questions the ability to add any future deals.Tangled WebThe spin-offs from Ocwen and the corresponding ownership and executive role by the Chairman do present a tangled web. On first blush it would appear that some of the fees charged and inter-company interactions and agreements have questionable arms-length dealings that could and should concern investors. From a mortgage-servicing standpoint, it doesn't make a lot sense that a consumer would be more harmed from a separate organization than one large corporation. If the tangled-web of Ocwen companies causes servicing problem with loans, it doesn't make a lot of sense that the Wells Fargo brand would go unscathed. A bad experience with a new mortgage servicer would have to leave consumers with a bad taste for their loan originator that dumped them with the bad servicer.According to Lawsky, he has concerns that Altisource Portfolio Solutions provides technology service to Ocwen and Home Loan Servicing Solutions (NASDAQ:HLSS) acquires mortgage-servicing rights from Ocwen. His concerns extend to the ownership position of Mr. Erbey and the conflicts that he might favor one company over another based on ownership value.This article highlights many of the concerns with the related firms, but it doesn't highlight any of the benefits of separating out the different companies to allow for growth beyond Ocwen. Altisource Portfolio Solutions is a prime example of a company planning to grow with or without Ocwen. Another example is Altisource Residential Corp. (NYSE:RESI), owning rentals houses wouldn't mix well with the intended purpose of Ocwen to service mortgages in default. The separation of the businesses creates more attractive assets, but the company will have to work through the arms-length transactions and the control by Mr. Erbey.Hayman Capital ExampleRespected Kyle Bass of Hayman Capital is one of the largest supporters of the new generation of non-bank mortgage services with a preference for Nationstar Mortgage Holdings (NYSE:NSM) that competes against Ocwen for new business from the big banks offloading mortgage-servicing rights. Nationstar hasn't eluded the same scrutiny from New York State's top bank regulator in Benjamin Lawsky. Apparently he has the same concerns of staffing levels, modification procedures, and affiliated businesses as with Ocwen.Outside the affiliated business concern, the biggest point appears to center around a level of complaints about the firms by New York consumers. According to Hayman Capital, the complaints are substantially lower than those from the major banks and entirely in line with normal expectations from a group of consumers behind on loan payments.Kyle Bass went on CNBC and provided some great details on the sector and the reason he favors Nationstar and the sector over the long term. In fact, he provided the below slide suggesting that both Nationstar and Ocwen significantly outperform the industry in consumer complaints.Recently, Hayman Capital upped its stake in Nationstar to 5.3% from 1.2% so Kyle Bass was speaking his book, but his firm has backed up the statements with a significant position.Moving Beyond OcwenWith the tangled web listed above, Altisource isn't likely to move much in 2014 unless it makes progress beyond Ocwen. Currently, the vast majority of revenues come from the agreement with Ocwen that lasts through 2020. The company plans to grow revenue based on solid technology in several directions including a real estate auction site and U.S. loan originations. See revenue assumptions from a recent presentation below in two different scenarios based on whether or not Ocwen acquires $100 billion in mortgage servicing rights during the next three years or not.The next slide highlights the general assumptions underlying those targeted growth figures. Again the primary focus is on gains in auction sales from Hubzu.com that are non-Ocwen related. The target is to grow from five properties sold in 2013 to over 50,000 in 2018. The other main growth driver is the U.S. loan originations where the company not only gains from loan origination share, but also the origination related service revenue surges to 14 basis points from only 1.6 basis points in 2013. Note that the company predicts the market to decline and stall over the next five years, but the revenue share for Altisource will surge under these scenarios.Stock ChartInvestors new to the story probably won't want to review the stock chart over the last few years. The stock literally exploded after the spin-off from Ocwen to run from $10 to over $170 by November last year. The stock plunged to start the year, but it has now bounced off of $100 to reach back to $117.ConclusionThe recent conflict with the New York State regulator appears only a bump in the road for Ocwen and Nationstar. Maybe it is appropriate for these regulators to scrutinize the ability for Ocwen to process all of these defaulting loans, but it appears to be a situation that will work itself out. Ocwen and the services it requests from Altisource Portfolio Solutions offer better outcomes than the previous system and the Basel III requirements aren't going to adjust due to regulators' concerns over non-bank growth. In essence, these defaulting loans have to find a home somewhere besides the banks. The shakeout may last a while, but it doesn't appear that any reason exists to revert to the old servicing method unless the tangled web of companies proves to actually hurt consumers. So far, the NY DFS has only made the case that the potential exists for harm.Altisource Portfolio Solutions only trades at 12x reduced 2015 earnings of $9.50 with plenty of growth opportunities beyond Ocwen. It appears very cheap with substantial upside if the NY DFS drops its case.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

(NYSE:OCN) agreed to a major settlement with the New York Department of Financial Services (NY DFS) regulator, including the replacement of William Erbey as the chairman of Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ:ASPS). The Ocwen settlement includes numerous restrictive and costly requirements that will undoubtedly hamper the business operations of the mortgage servicer and the related parties. The news caused Altisource Portfolio Solutions to plunge 34%. The stock is now down to $31, after hitting $170 at the start of December.The direct impact to Altisource Portfolio Solutions is that the largest shareholder in William Erbey is stepping down as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is being replaced by Timo Vatto effective January 16, 2015. Mr. Vatto has been a board member since 2009, and worked for over 20 years at Citigroup (NYSE:C). While the $150 million settlement only impacts Ocwen directly, some of the provisions could impact the related companies, such as Altisource Portfolio Solutions. The NY DFS is setting up an Operations Monitor that will review and approve pricing and performance studies related to fees and expenses charged by a related party, such as Altisource. In addition, corporate governance requirements could hold up any related-party deals and transactions. The deal does allow Ocwen to acquire MSRs, though with several restrictions that will no doubt limit growth initiatives, not to mention reduce the willingness of banks to work with Ocwen owing to the restrictions and regulatory oversight in place.The original investment thesis in the article ""Altisource Portfolio Solutions: Facing An Attractive Conflict"" focused on the continued need for non-bank mortgage services and the diversification away from Ocwen. The thesis found Altisource Portfolio Solutions intriguing, considering the strong cash flows, lack of capital requirements and the ability to stabilize and even grow revenues without additional portfolio acquisitions from Ocwen. The original investment thesis questioned buying the stock, despite some apparent value, until the dust settled with the NY DFS suit against Ocwen. Luckily, the caution allowed for missing out on a substantial decline in the stock, while Altisource Portfolio Solutions reduced earnings expectations due to discontinuing lender placed insurance. While the company did repurchase a large amount of shares at slightly over $100, the stock still isn't buyable at $31 until the dust settles further on the Ocwen settlement and the impacts to Altisource. Investors need to continue avoiding the stock due to unknown and hidden impacts at this point that could further impact earnings potential."
181558,21136,2010-01-08T04:26:53-05:00,,"Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ:ASPS) was a strong gainer at the close of 2009 as significant volume at the end of the year pushed it to new highs.  The company is a provider of real estate, mortgage, and asset recovery services and their market cap is currently in the vicinity of $553 million.  As the financial sector continues its recovery in 2010, ASPS is a great place to be positioned amongst the smaller companies in the sector.This is because the stock will continue to show strong momentum early in 2010 and I expect that it will reach new highs.  In addition to the strengths of its technical indicators, the company has a very capable management staff to power its growth potential.  I also see the asset recovery arm of the business as being a strong driver for earnings this year.  It is also likely that the company will attract even more investor interest this year.  Already in the first two trading days of the New Year, it continued to trade at volumes significantly higher than its average for the past three months.  Piper Jaffrey is also bullish on the stock, citing strong earning potential among its reasons for giving it an “overweight” rating at the end of December.  Therefore, investors with confidence in the financial sector should consider ASPS.  It is a great choice since the stock has greater potential to move upward than larger companies as it has not yet been discovered by many investors.Disclosure: No positions"
1057231,39681,2012-12-11T10:49:45-05:00,,"For a stock that is priced for a number of years in the future, one has to realize why should you stay or go in to Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ:ASPS) at this price.The company is valued at $2.41bn based on Monday's close of $103. By fundamental metrics, that means a P/E of around 25, a P/S at over 4, and a P/B at over 10. Impressive numbers one must say, this was done possibly thanks to a number of reasons which I highlight below.First of all, ASPS has head offices based in Luxembourg, which happens to be a low tax jurisdiction with ASPS's effective tax rate being less than 10%. The Luxembourg office is an office of convenience, because if you look at the job postings on the company's website, out of 182 job openings, only four are Luxembourg posts. Let's also compare ASPS to its parent - which is a spin off of Ocwen Financial Corp (NYSE:OCN). Altisource was a spin-off of Ocwen and it is now valued at more than half of its parent, and is owned by the same insiders.If one takes a closer look at Ocwen's financials and Altisource's financials (read their 10-Q here), one will note that both make business together, meaning OCN's expense can be ASPS's income. They shift revenues to the lower taxed company to gain a tax advantage. They can go around not disclosing this, because the shareholders of ASPS are not OCN, but the OCN insiders are related parties. Most of the top executives of ASPS mostly hail from OCN.Similarly, from a technical point of view, ASPS and OCN tend to move together, meaning if OCN goes up, so will ASPS. This can be confirmed by the recent earnings announcements whereby ASPS missed, so OCN missed later. Both stocks sagged later.If one takes a closer look at the balance sheet of Altisource, one can find that the company has net value of $231m, of which over $73m is made up of intangibles/goodwill assets, meaning the company is really a small company, because it is overvalued in its books. One must question what these intangibles are. The company has a very low float, and trades very little, and thus if insiders start selling, it will falter very quickly -  as much as it rose in the past few months.The recent blow-off top of just below $130 makes the current price attractive to buy, but in fact is the best price for the insiders to unload. In fact recently the same CEO of both OCN and ASPS dumped over $10m from both stocks at around current levels.With the price being artificially supported at around the $100 mark, the insiders are trying to get a new deal done quickly close to the year's end to make the stocks more liquid. The idea is to work on an innovative 'stock split' whereby the shares of the common stock will be distributed as a dividend into another 2 companies. The reason is obvious, the insider will find it easier to sell a $25-30 stock and he can sell it in much larger quantities and remain unnoticed (since the new commons will initially trade in more voluminous amounts).There will be a short-term euphoria on the new stock, whereby funds will buy the new stock, thus generating sufficient short-term demand for the insiders to unload. It is very difficult to sell a $100 stock with an average volume of 200,000 and any regular pattern of insider sales based on the current setup would propel the share price in a vacuum. Everyone knows, and it can be clearly seen in the chart attached, that this company is both fundamentally and technically overvalued.There is no real technical support until the mid-$70s, and there is a technical gap to be filled which makes the trade now very dangerous. Yet the stock can be easily manipulated as volume is small, so it can be very easy for the insiders to re-load the stock up to at least keep the price hovering around $100 until they finalize their new ""IPOs"".The conclusion from this article is simply to make present investors aware of the real situation of Altisource's insider scheme. ASPS is a brilliant company but it does not deserve this rich valuation, the fact that its revenues can be ""managed"" by its parent. Coupled with the insider scheme to cash out at the top as explained above makes it an unwise investment in the long-term.Traders, hedge fund managers and investors - look out below.Disclosure: I am short ASPS.

3219336,72715,2015-05-29T14:31:29-04:00,"Regulatory pressures on Ocwen have weighed heavily on Altisource.The company is now diversifying away from Ocwen.Regulatory pressures are likely to subside, with one of the main regulators stepping down.","Altisource Portfolio Solutions (NASDAQ:ASPS) provides marketplace transaction solutions for the real estate, mortgage and consumer debt industries in the U.S. The company operates in three segments - Mortgage Services, Financial Services and Technology Services - providing proprietary servicing technology and default-related services.Looking at the price chart and the 80% decline from the previous peak of $160 in late 2013, it becomes clear that something is very wrong. The reason for the decline is the cyclical downturn in the mortgage market in combination with the negative outlook due to rising rates and regulatory push-backs, which have all resulted in sort of a perfect storm.Altisource generates a bulk of its revenue from Ocwen (NYSE:OCN), as can be seen from the Fig 1 below, and the recent developments have not been too positive, to say the least.Fig 1 - Altisource's revenue from OcwenSource: Latest 10-QTo understand why Altisource is not doing so hot, we must first understand how Ocwen generates its revenues. But, before I begin, I must give credit where credit is due. A lot of this information comes from Glenn Chan, who has done an excellent job covering the whole Ocwen/Altisource situation.How Ocwen and Altisource generate revenue?When mortgages are packed and sliced into mortgage-backed securities, various slices get sold to investors as per their risk appetite. One of those slices is called MSR, or Mortgage Servicing Rights, which is exactly what Ocwen invests in. The holder of MSRs is entitled to receive revenue on the unpaid principal, which should cover the servicing fees and turn a profit.In addition, the mortgage servicer also earns extra revenues such as the portion of the interest income generated by the float, prepayment fees, late payment fees and so forth.The main costs and obligations to the mortgage servicer are the paperwork associated with collecting payments, forwarding the principal and interest payments when the borrower falls behind on schedule, and various legal costs in the case of foreclosures.To make the whole servicing process smooth and cost effective, Altisource delivers the necessary infrastructure to Ocwen. For example, the life-of-loan platform REALServicing covers the whole loan life cycle from loan setup and administration to default and real estate-owned asset management.Ocwen's servicing qualityThe main concern with Ocwen's servicing quality has caught the eye of the regulators. One of the figureheads in the ranks of the regulatory establishment to pursue Ocwen has, until very recently, been Benjamin Lawsky. But with Lawsky stepping down, it's safe to assume the regulatory pressure will subside going forward.The truth is, the recent downgrades in the service rating by Moody's and other rating agencies have been largely due to the regulatory pressures, and the current SQ3- rating is the direct result of the negative feedback loop caused by the regulatory scrutiny. Below is an excerpt from the Moody's downgrade rationale (do note that it's from Jan 29th):While the regulatory landscape remains bumpy for Ocwen and the future is unclear, the company is making leaps of progress to exit its legacy agency portfolio and to focus solely on non-agency loans. The latest reports put the company's Non-GSE portfolio at 25% of the whole MBS market. Maintaining the non-agency (Non-GSE) portfolio should be beneficiary to Altisource due to the higher revenue generated per loan compared to agency loans (GSE loans) especially when the loans happen to be delinquent.Fig 2 - Service revenue per loan, Agency vs. Non-AgencySource: Q1 Earnings PresentationAs can be seen from the figure above, Altisource generates roughly 3x the revenue from non-agency delinquent loans compared to agency loans. What's more, the uncertainty around the Ocwen's loan portfolio was mitigated after the new deal with New Residential Investment Corp. (NYSE:NRZ), according to which Ocwen will remain the servicer of the loans, meaning secured revenue for Altisource. The deal will also mitigate the regulatory pressures.Financials and forward estimatesThe company is projecting revenues between $800-$935 million for 2015, and it looks like the results will come down to the total number of loans transferred from REALServicing platform and the total number of delinquent loans, as can be seen from the figure below. Given that Ocwen has most likely been through the worst of the regulatory pressures and the recent developments suggest improvements, I am expecting the transferred loans to be at the lower end of the estimate. Even in the worst case scenario, the estimated EPS will be at roughly $2.8 (net income of $56 million), translating to a Forward P/E of 10.3, which is very cheap considering the historical valuations, as can be seen from chart 1 below:Fig 3 - Assumptions for fiscal year 2015Source: Q1 Earnings PresentationChart 1 - Historical Forward P/EAccording to the optimistic scenario, which incorporates delinquency rate of 6.5% and 300,000 loans transferred from REALServicing, the net income for 2015 would be around $122 million, or $5.8 per share, resulting in a Forward P/E of only 5. Do note that even the most optimistic scenario accounts for the decline in the serviced loans count, which might not even be the case considering the company launched an aggressive marketing campaign to diversify its portfolio and attract new clients.Until very recently, Ocwen was the rising star of the mortgage business, and piggybacking on its rise provided all the growth Altisource needed. Now that things have changed, Altisource is looking elsewhere, and with its proven technology and tested solutions, it should have no problem diversifying away from Ocwen. Leaving aside the extreme estimates, the middle ground for net income is somewhere around $90 million, translating to EPS of about $4.3, putting the Forward P/E at 6.7. Given that we know this is the most likely result for 2015, we can see that when the regulatory pressures subside and Altisource starts to trade in just the lower end of its historical Forward P/E (which is around 12-14, as can be seen from the chart 1), the stock price will have more than 100% upside from the current levels.The takeawayAltisource's equity prices have been distressed due to regulatory pressures on its largest revenue source, but the worst seems to be over. Going forward, Altisource's current valuation offers a great opportunity to take a position and wait for the return to normalcy. It's opportunities like these that offer a great chance to acquire shares in a quality company at a significant discount to historical valuations."

Its current equity market cap is $1.7 billion and total enterprise value $1.8 billion.As background, Altisource was spun-off by Ocwen Financial Corp (NYSE: OCN) in August 2009 in a 1-for-3 shares distribution. By October 2012, Altisource shares had appreciated an astounding 1670% compared to a 50% rise in the S&P 500, during the same period.The remarkable stock performance until October 2012, in our view, can be explained by Altisource's historical earnings and free cash flow generation (see table below). It is important to note that this strong growth over the past six years was mainly organic and acquisitions played a minimal role.Source: SEC filings and Company press releases; All figures are in $millions except per share data.Since closing at an all-time high of $124 on October 12, 2012, the shares have retreated 43%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500, which gained 11% during the same period. This steep price drop, coupled with strong company fundamentals, has created an attractive investment opportunity. Here's why:Ocwen's Deal-Flow Will Continue to Drive Growth: Under an agreement that expires in 2020, Ocwen is contractually obligated to purchase certain mortgage and technology services from Altisource. In 2012, Ocwen accounted for 60% of Altisource's revenues and has been its primary growth driver. Ocwen has grown its service-loan portfolio dramatically from 470K in Q1-2011 to 809K in Q4-2012.On October 3, 2012, Ocwen completed the acquisition of Homeward Residential and on February 15, 2013, Ocwen acquired certain mortgage servicing and origination businesses from Residential Capital, LLC. As a result of these two transactions, Altisource is expected to board 2.1 million new loans. In order to accommodate this business, Altisource is in the process of hiring an additional 1,600 employees (it had 5,770 employees at the end of 2012). Furthermore, Ocwen sees a lot more opportunities to acquire loans - the point being that Altisource should continue to benefit from Ocwen's pipeline for the foreseeable future.New Growth Platforms: In order to diversify from Ocwen and expand, Altisource has developed several new revenue sources.Origination: In 2010, Altisource acquired the manager of the Lenders One mortgage cooperative. In 2012, the members of Lenders One originated approximately $183 billion of loans representing 10.5% of the US residential origination market. Altisource's service revenue from origination related services grew 72% in 2012 to $37.8 million due to membership growth, higher origination volume and an increased usage of Altisource's services by existing members.Residential Spin-Off: On December 21, 2012, Altisource completed the spinoff of Altisource Residential (NYSE: RESI) and equitized it with $100 million. Residential is a REIT that will own and manage single-family rental homes (acquired via distressed loans). This is a very large addressable market and Altisource estimates to generate initial revenue of $1,625 per home acquired by RESI and a recurring revenue stream of $1,275 per home per year. The Company expects to generate 40%-50% margins from this new business.Hubzu.com: Altisource re-launched its consumer real estate portal, Hubzu.com and has sold over 25K real estate owned (REO or distressed homes) assets during 2012. Hubzu-based 2012 revenue grew 67% to $53.2 million from $31.9 million in 2011. Management has indicated that over the medium-to-longer term (i.e. once this business gains critical mass), it will separate Hubzu as a stand-alone company and most likely, distribute it to shareholders.Significant Insider-Ownership: This is the least important factor in our long thesis, because, frankly speaking, it can cut both ways - - Pending Dell and recently completed American Greetings take-private transactions come to mind.That said, we prefer to be invested alongside management, all else being equal. William Erbey, Chairman of Altisource (as well as of Residential and Ocwen) owns 23% of ASPS shares. His record of growing businesses and creating shareholder value speaks for itself - just take a look at the long-term performance of OCN and ASPS.What is the Stock Worth? Altisource's management does not provide earnings guidance. Consensus 2013 earnings estimate, according to Bloomberg, currently stands at $6.80 per share. With 50%+ earnings growth track record and strong future potential, should Altisource not trade at a premium to S&P 500 multiple of 13x forward earnings? For example, a 20% premium would value ASPS shares at $107 or 45% higher.Risks to our long thesis:There is a saying about investment managers which we are always mindful of:""Often wrong, never in doubt""So when we find a compelling investment opportunity 'lying out in the open', we have to ask the question - what could we be missing? It's just common sense that one can't get 20%, 30% or 40% returns in the current 'return-free risk' environment without taking a lot of risk.Here are the key factors which we considered when making this investment:Disclosure: I am long ASPS, RESI.

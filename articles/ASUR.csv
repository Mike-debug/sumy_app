Last time around, this didn't play out well for investors.Why invest in this company when there are other HCM providers with better performance.","Asure Software, Inc. (ASUR) operates in the highly competitive Human Capital Management (HCM) industry. Asure recently moved to dispose of its Workplace Management business in order to reduce debts and focus on growing the HCM SaaS business model. With sales of approximately $73 million, Asure is not one of the bigger players in this very competitive industry. And it is certainly not one of the better performers. Unlike Paycom Software, Inc. (PAYC) which is growing at a 30+% rate or even Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY) which sports a 23% annual growth rate, Asure is expecting essentially zero growth for FY 2020.(Source: Asure Q3 2019 earnings call presentation)Now to be fair, Asure is in transition and is morphing into a very high recurring revenue business model.But revenue growth is a concern and it appears that future growth will be bolstered by M&A. The trouble is that Asure went on a shopping spree back in 2017 and it didn't work out well for investors due to significant share dilution. The revenue growth, or lack thereof, is a strong deterrent from considering Asure as an investment candidate. For this reason, I am giving Asure a neutral rating.One of my big points of contention is the company management's statement of 38% new bookings, which conflicts with the company's forward revenue guidance of zero percent revenue growth and long-term target organic growth of 8-12%.(Source: Asure Q3 2019 earnings call presentation)Asure's long-term target is for 16-24% revenue growth based on a combination of organic growth and acquisitions.(Source: Asure Q3 2019 earnings call presentation)Asure has eliminated debt by selling the Workspace Management business, but the plan is to grow by acquisition in the HCM space. Looking through the presentation material from the Q3 2019 earnings call, it appears that Asure plans on funding acquisitions by issuing stock, seller notes and cash.(Source: Asure Q3 2019 earnings call presentation)Given this company's previous history I am going to suggest that acquisitions will be funded via share dilution more so than cash. Companies tend to repeat what they have done in the past. So let us take a look at what happened in the 2017 time period.(Source: Portfolio123)The stock dropped from ~$19 down to ~$4.30 in a short period of time.(Source: Seeking Alpha)It doesn't take a genius to figure out what will happen to investors when the acquisition train starts up again, which it will likely do as I don't believe that shareholders will be satisfied with the organic growth target of 8% to 12%.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated Y-o-Y sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated Y-o-Y sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Asure is sitting modestly above the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is very slightly overvalued relative to its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate.The valuation is not of great concern for those wanting to invest at a reasonable price. My feeling is that Asure has a lot to prove in terms of growth potential, and until it starts to do so, I suggest staying on the sidelines.Asure has divested itself of the Workplace Management business and is now solely focused on HCM with a SaaS business model. The $120 million sale allows Asure to pay down its debts.Company management states that new HCM bookings have grown by 39%, providing promise that the company will have a strong future. That being said, this figure doesn't really jive with company revenue estimates and a long-term target of 16% to 24% revenue growth split between organic growth and acquisitions.There is a strong likelihood that this company will go on a shopping spree similar to 2017 funded by share dilution which could impact shareholders in a big way. There are stronger HCM plays out there, including Paycom and Paylocity among others.I previously had a buy rating for Asure and I am now shifting to a neutral rating."
4310128,104952,2019-12-02T14:52:50-05:00,"The recent divestiture of the Workspace Management business to FM:Systems will allow Asure to be a pure-play SaaS HCM player in SMB and mid-size markets.Asureâ€™s shift into such SaaS markets is not followed by relevant online strategies despite its ambition to achieve a ~10% target organic growth.Considering an expected revenue of $74 million and 1.76 P/S, we do not see the stock trading higher than ~$8.34 per share by FY 2020.","The recent divestiture of the Workspace Management business to FM:Systems will allow Asure (ASUR) to be a pure-play SaaS HCM (Human Capital Management). We found the background of the divestment strategic, given the asset and equity involved in the transaction worth $120 million. Following the divestiture, Asure will hold a minority interest in FM:Systems and receive some portion of the exposure to the Workspace Management sector.Upon the divestiture and shift towards the new direction, we remain neutral on the stock. In particular, our concern lies in the company's positioning in the SMB and midsize HCM market when we put it in relative terms to its current product and go-to-market strategies. Asure's focus on the SaaS HCM means that the company will also now be competing in a huge, yet saturated market with questionable upside potential.We believe that any bullish scenario in Asure would primarily hinge more upon the company's go-to-market strategies than the technical quality of the offering, as is the case with a lot of fast-growing SaaS companies. However, we found that there is a lack of cohesion between go-to-market strategies and technological sophistication in Asure's growth approach that we typically do not see in SaaS companies.(source: Asure's Q3 earnings call slide)We think that such cohesion is even more important for SaaS companies targeting SMB and mid-size businesses, where preference towards low-touch sales and onboarding processes is higher. Consequently, Asure's shift into such SaaS markets is not followed by relevant online strategies despite its ambition to achieve a ~10% target organic growth. By only leveraging resellers, referral channels, and direct sales teams, however, it remains to be seen whether Asure leaves a lot of money on the table.On the other hand, it is common for SaaS companies of any size to publish an app integration marketplace feature that not only allows its users to integrate with other SaaS apps through webhook or API (Application Programming Interface). Eventually, this online channel allows other existing SaaS users to discover other SaaS products and achieve viral adoption across the ecosystem. We even believe that the interconnected ecosystem has been the key reason as to why many SaaS companies are able to consistently maintain their double-digit growth rates even into their post-IPO stages. Ultimately, we would remain cautious about Asure's post-transition plan to achieve $100 million - $150 million through its cross-selling strategy.With the divestment of its Workplace Management Business still ongoing at least until FY 2020, there is a potential upside where the expected 8% - 12% annual growth following the end of the fiscal year may not be priced in yet. In recent times, Asure trades at ~20% off its 52-week high at ~$8.20 per share.(source: Asure's Q3 earnings call slide)Given effectively no organic growth during the transition year, the big question investors have here is whether there is enough upside to take the risk in the near term. In that sense, the type of acquisitions the management has in mind that can produce the midpoint ~5% growth and the required financing scheme would be two key things we look forward to hearing in the next few quarters before making any decision just yet. As it stands, the company currently plans to refine its capital structure by paying off the outstanding debt with the $120 million proceeds from the divestiture, leaving little room for the company to pursue attractive acquisitions.(source: Stockrow)In the greater cloud mid-size and SMB HCM software market, we view Paylocity (PCTY), Paychex (PAYX), and ADP (ADP) as potential competitors. With a very low 1.28 TTM P/S despite the recurring revenue stream going forward, we believe the market is currently pricing in Asure's transition along with its lack of viral growth potential given its mostly offline go-to-market strategies. The selected universe median of ~6.5 TTM P/S represents where Asure can potentially trade given the successful absorption of the incremental overhead, recurring SaaS revenue, and EBITDA margin expansion beyond the transition year. Considering an expected revenue of $74 million and 1.76 P/S, we do not see the stock trading higher than ~$8.34 per share by the end of FY 2020. As such, we remain neutral on the stock most probably until the first half of FY 2020, where we plan to review our position upon further developments on the upside scenario."
4259398,21815,2019-05-02T22:04:57-04:00,"The shares still haven't recovered from a disappointing Q3, and visibility a little hampered by the large number of acquisitions.However, we expect the positives of these acquisitions to gradually outweigh the cost during the year, generating significant cost and revenue synergies.The shares are also pretty cheap, but the company's recent history is full of dilution and debt issuance, mostly to pay for all these acquisitions.Management promises positive cash flow this year, which is pretty crucial in our view, given the debt and dilution.","Asure Software (ASUR) is a provider of Human Capital Management (HCM) and workspace management software. We actually wrote about this company all the way back in 2012 here, but the present company is quite a different beast and that article long lost its relevance.We start with the usual overview of the last five years which displays some kind of revenue explosion, mostly driven by acquisitions. It's not surprising (GAAP) net income has suffered as the cost of acquisitions predates the benefits.Data by YChartsHere are the company's two main planks of businesses (from the March 2019 Investor Presentation):These two main areas are HCM and workspace which are increasingly integrated, according to management. Here is what workspace management contains in terms of services (and existing clients):And if that's too abstract here are two useful case study summaries:The workspace business also contains an interesting HaaS business (Hardware as a Service) with IoT sensors monitoring environmental factors such as co2, lighting, heating, air conditioning, for instance. The company is completely revamping its hardware business, introducing many new and improved versions.As the HaaS model suggests, the hardware isn't stand-alone but exists to generate data which is consolidated in the cloud and machine learning will distill meaningful analytics from the data. Its hardware business grew 153% y/y in Q4 and 83% sequentially.What is also encouraging is the ongoing shift to the cloud and the increase in recurring revenues from the IR presentation:If you look at the stock performance, one might have missed what management argued was a very good quarter (Q4CC):From the earnings PR:The company also enjoyed significant client wins, in HCM for instance with NetPayroll, Hilltop National Bank, Centro and Prolong Pharmaceuticals. In workspace, companies like Assurance, New York Parks and Recreation, Mazda Motor (OTCPK:MZDAY) and SAP America (NYSE:SAP) signed up.The share price crash occurred in November last year in response to disappointing Q3 results.Here is how management described its priorities for the year (Q4CC):From the earnings PR:A big part of its growth strategy is acquisitions - the company acquired no less than 18 companies in the last two years, 7 in last year and one this year (so far):The idea of course is to create cost and especially sales synergies, but it also increases the company's footprint.The company is also driving a harmonization process centralizing back-office functions and moving to Amazon's AWS for client support and implementing a NetSuite ERP system, the bulk of which will be up and running by mid-year. It even appointed a new COO, Rhonda Parouty, for this.The company will also hire 20 new sales people, 12 of which will be specifically tasked with embarking on the cross-selling opportunities that all these acquisitions have generated.It's true that the company's sales force has remained fairly stagnant, given the revenue explosion, from the IR presentation:While revenue doubled in two years, the number of sales people grew much less, although a side benefit was that the productivity of sales people shot up (Q4CC):Data by YChartsGAAP margins moved pretty comprehensively south, which is no surprise really considering all the M&A activity. The decline in gross margin is partly a result of a reclassification of occupy cost from Q2 and Q3, without which the (non-GAAP) number would have been 65-66%, rather than the 63.2% in Q4.But most of the decline seems to be the result of a mix shift, the strong hardware sales growth (as well as HCM growth) had a considerable dampening effect on gross margins. Management believes these will remain at 64-66% in the near future.Non-GAAP EBITDA actually reached a very respectable 24% versus 21.5% a year ago despite one-time expenses from the acquisitions.Headcount declined by nine employees in Q4, bringing it to 544. There are a number of cost initiatives:Data by YChartsThe company does expect cash flow to move back to positive territory this year on the integration and organizational harmonization efforts, the falling away of the one-time acquisition cost and the emergence of acquisition synergies.The company has also started to invest its clients' funds, which are a not inconsiderable $85M-100M, so these investments also generate cash. At the 2.225-2.5% rate that's another $2M-2.5M, even though that's not modeled in the forecast.The company had $15.4M in cash and investment at the end of the year and $115.2M in debt.The company issued 2.375M shares mid last year to strengthen its balance sheet and pay for the acquisitions. As one can see below, share-based compensation is rising strongly and the number of outstanding shares has more than doubled over two years, with another $90M or so in debt to boot. The graph below is really a bit worrying:Data by YChartsThe company really needs cash flow to move back to positive to turn this trend around. Here is a detailed look of the 2018 cash flow:It shows that the company spent more than $112M on acquisitions in the last two years and issued $82.5M in debt and $112.3M from equity sales.Data by YCharts2.2x sales is hardly exorbitant for a cloud software company and this picture is reinforced if one considers the EPS estimates from analysts. For 2019, analysts expect an EPS of $0.61 rising to $0.77 next year, which amounts to 10x earnings.At first sight, the shares seem amazingly cheap but there are some concerns. One is the debt level. All the acquisitions also make it difficult to assess the health of the underlying business.Then there is the strong rise in the number of shares, but this was mostly related to acquisitions. One could argue that as long as the company squeezes sufficient cost and revenue synergies from these to be accretive, this isn't a problem.Is the company doing that? It's too early to tell. It is going to hire 20 new sales people, 12 of which will be occupied with generating the revenue synergies.Despite these hires, the company expects to move back into cash-flow-positive territory, so it looks like it can afford it (although share-based comp is likely to get another jump as a result).All in all, we tend towards the positive, for three reasons."
4286216,21815,2019-08-16T08:06:21-04:00,"The company produced good second-quarter figures, but shares sold off substantially, which is unwarranted in our view.There is a slight reduction in 2019 guidance, but this is immaterial.The shares carry very modest multiples really, and with the acquisitions and other investments behind us, 2020 looks like a promising year for the company.","We think the sell-off in reaction to the Q2 figures from Asure (ASUR) is quite overdone, as the company is progressing nicely. Asure reported Q2 results to which the market reacted with a surprising violence:Shares plunged the day after results, from $8+ to below $6, although they have started to creep up from these lows. As one can see, it had an even much more violent sell-off at the end of last year that took the shares below $5.We don't really see much reason for these kind of violent market reactions as the business performance is much more gradual:Data by YChartsYou see two remarkable trends, really substantial revenue growth and a deterioration in net income, that can be explained by the same phenomenon, acquisitions (and related GAAP expenses), 15 since January 2017 to be exact.2Q was the first quarter since without an acquisition, and management argues that it is going to slow down its pace and concentrating on absorbing these acquisitions first.The funny thing is, the combination of moving to Amazon's (AMZN) AWS cloud and the implementation of serious enterprise software systems (from Netscape, for instance) has made integration of future acquisitions much easier (Q2CC):From the 10-Q:Both revenue and non-GAAP EPS produced small beats, and the company had some impressive logo wins on both sides of its business. One big insurance company is going to install Workspace globally, and the management argues there are more to come. And there are more promising developments (Q2CC):But it will take time to get all of these onboard even if the opportunities are substantial (Q2CC):Working through resellers speeds things up and brings customer acquisition costs down. Backlog grew 8%.An organizational and policy change in the company's consultancy business led to a slight reduction in guidance this year (by $1M on low margin business, hardly a disaster) so:Data by YChartsThe gross margin decline is quite remarkable, and to some degree, the result of increasing product sales generating lower margins. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.9%, and management expects a range of 63-65% in the near future.Operating margins will be under pressure for some time as the company will hire 20 new sales people this year, most of them in H2.Data by YChartsCash flow recovered in the quarter, and the company gets a lot of cash from its clients, an increase of $32M in the first six months (from the 10-Q):The company receives interest income on these funds (a whopping $104.6M which it is consolidating into fewer accounts), which is pretty useful as it also pays substantial interest on its outstanding notes ($112.8M).This is a high-margin revenue stream for the company, although the declining interest rate environment is biting here even if management argues it's EPS and cash flow neutral because it also works on the debt side.The company has $14.65M of cash and equivalents, a decline of $1.9M from the end of Q1, due to investments in inventory to the tune of $2.5M, without which it would have generated positive cash flow. Management feels that will improve further (Q2CC):Data by YChartsThe effect of these acquisitions is a rising share count and share-based compensation.Data by YChartsValuations are close to five-year lows and are blighted by acquisition costs and accounting, so the real situation is actually better. Analysts expect EPS of $0.53 this year rising to $0.64 next year, which would make the shares very cheap.The company is still digesting a host of acquisitions and significant changes to its organization with the move to AWS and implementing software systems and a near just-in-time inventory system still ongoing, as well as some changes to its consulting model.Yet the company is winning important new customers and many resellers, and it is hiring 20 new sales representatives this year while still guiding to produce a positive operational cash flow.We think it could reap the benefits of these investments next year, and the shares seem too cheap to us."
4352552,104952,2020-06-08T11:54:06-04:00,"COVID-19 has hit the business hard given the company's focus on SMBs. We expect no growth for the rest of 2020.
        We expect any potential M&A, by which the management expects to deliver an additional 10% growth in 2020, to be put on hold.
        The long-term issue regarding weak positioning remains.","We will remain neutral on Asure Software (ASUR), considering the current pandemic-related headwinds that have severely impacted its business and its SMBs client base. The stock is down ~24% from last December when we published our first coverage on the stock. Back then, we discussed our view of the companyâ€™s limited upside potential despite the shift to pure HCM SaaS business. Today, we still hold the same view of the outlook, which is even worsened by the COVID-19.Given the companyâ€™s focus on SMBs in tier 2 and 3 cities, the COVID-19 will continue to hit the business really hard and present ongoing uncertainties. For starters, the company implemented salary cuts and benefit reductions to some of its employees in Q1, which amounted to ~$3 million in Q1. The company also reduced its headcounts to 411, down from ~423 at the beginning of the year.(source: companyâ€™s 10-Q earnings call slide)The rest of the business does not look good as well. The company reported Q1 revenue of $18.9 million, which was better than expected, though still down 1.6% YoY. Given the uncertainty around the timing of reopening, the company also does not have enough visibility. However, we believe the outlook for Q2 and beyond will remain quite similar. There will be very little to no growth going forward, considering ~20% of the companyâ€™s clients alone may go out of business. In Q1, bookings already declined by 2.7% YoY, while ~1,000 of its clients decided to temporarily shut down their operations in just over a month between March and April.(source: companyâ€™s Q4 2019 earnings call)The situation will be more difficult considering Asureâ€™s recent divestiture and transition to SaaS, which have taken a lot of the managementâ€™s focus and energy to complete. The management expected no organic growth at all last year, though it expected to drive up to 10% growth from a potential acquisition in 2020. We thought that the M&A move would be wishful thinking at the time, and could even potentially be a tailwind, considering the track record in the recent corporate actions. Due to the COVID-19 situation today, the acquisition that will hopefully improve its near-term outlook will certainly not happen.The main long-term issue in Asure, moreover, is its vague positioning in the SMB and mid-size market. While COVID-19 impacts all of the HCM (Human Capital Management) players to some extent, Asure will struggle in competing against the leading SaaS players in the SMB space with a more efficient self-serve go-to-market and stronger brand awareness.(source: gusto.com)Gusto, for instance, is one of the leading SaaS players in the SMB space. Considering its strong growth and estimated $100 million revenue in 2018, this private company is most likely already twice as much as Asure in terms of revenue. Having raised a $200 million Series D funding last year, it has recently aggressively priced its product at $25/month to anticipate for further COVID-19 impact.(source: zenefits.com)Another very strong SMB SaaS player, Zenefits, is even offering its payroll product for free this year. In terms of revenue size, it is also larger than Asure and more similar to Gusto. With all these aggressive pricing schemes, Zenefits and Gusto will be well-positioned to get their foot in the door with more untapped SMB clients, which belong to Asureâ€™s primary target market.The growth outlook will be lackluster for Asure for now, though the +10% insider ownership means that there is an alignment of interests with shareholders. The CEO himself, Goepel, still owns 5.3% of the business as of today. It also has adequate liquidity in its balance sheet with a low debt-equity ratio.(ADP vs PAYX vs PAYC vs PCTY vs ASUR. source: stockrow)Many of the larger HCM companies with enterprise clients, such as Paychex (PAYX) and ADP (ADP), maintain its modest P/S as their businesses are less affected by the COVID-19. The faster-growing and more diversified players like Paycom (PAYC) and Paylocity (PCTY), are also maintaining their premiums to-date. As expected, Asure has been the lowest-valued stock in its peer group with ~1.4x P/S. Back when we covered the stock last December, the business was still at the early stage of transition to the SaaS model upon the divestment of its workspace management business and had a ~1.7x P/S. given the situation today, we still think that the stock can even trade at a lower P/S beyond Q2. As of today, the share price has already been down ~30% from YTD-high in February and has not recovered since. While the price may be attractive for some investors, we will continue to remain on the sidelines and maintain our neutral rating for now."
4034276,101421,2017-01-04T12:14:06-05:00,"Human capital management company Asure Software announced three acquisitions at the start of 2017.
        The company acquired two resellers and one HR outsourcing service company for a total of $11.6 million consideration.
        The deals appear to have been reasonably priced.
        The strategic addition is the HR outsourcing service company, Personnel Management Systmes.
        Investors should look to the Professional Services line item ramp in future financial reports for clues on its integration progress.","Quick TakeAsure Software (NASDAQ:ASUR) has announced the acquisition of three companies, effective January 1, 2017.Austin, Texas-based Asure is a human capital management software and services company to all sizes of clients worldwide directly and through resellers.The acquisitions appear to have been made at reasonable valuations, although the proof will be in how well Asure can scale the outsourced HR services deal throughout its coverage universe.Target CompaniesThe three target companies consisted of:It appears that the three companies will continue to operate as wholly-owned subsidiaries of Asure.Payroll Specialties will help Asure grow its SMB presence in the Northwest US, while Corporate Payroll will essentially do the same for Ohio and the upper Midwest region.The acquisition of Personnel Management Systems will provide Asure's customers with 'an outsourced human resources department, which when combined with Asure's current solution, will provide clients' with tools and related services to more effectively manage their workforce.Acquisition Terms and RationaleAsure didn't divide out the acquisition consideration for each of the three companies.Rather, for the three deals combined, it stated total cash consideration of $8.4 million, stock consideration of $1 million and $2.2 million in seller promissory notes for a total of $11.6 million.The three acquired companies are expected to generate more than $5.5 million in topline revenues, so Asure paid an average of approximately 2x forward revenues for the deals.Asure acquired Payroll Specialties and Corporate Payroll in order to fold their reseller operations into Asure's operating statement, as it continues to push towards its goal of achieving $100 million per year in annual sales.It acquired Personnel Management Systems for its capabilities to expand its 'solution, service, and implementation capabilities, as we look to grow that business in 2017 and beyond.'CommentaryAsure has characterized the three acquisitions as 'strategic.'I understand that the acquisition of Personnel Management Systems appears to be strategic, with its 'outsourced human resource services' capabilities that expands Asure's suite of offerings to provide a more comprehensive set of solutions for the wide variety of businesses it services.The two other acquisitions are essentially that of bringing resellers in-house to tack on revenues and increase the company's geographic coverage, so they don't strike me as particularly strategic in the classic sense of the term.The price paid for the three deals appears reasonable, perhaps even good deals, depending on the undisclosed price for each individual acquisition.I expect Asure paid a higher multiple for Personnel Management Systems due to its potentially greater strategic value.In sum, I'm reasonably pleased with the acquisitions based on price, but need to see how Asure will scale the Personnel Management Systems service offering throughout its geographic coverage.It's one thing to scale a software offering, but another to scale a services offering since services tend to require adding significant people assets while providing clients with a reliable service in order to minimize churn.Investors should watch the ramp up of the Professional Services line item in future financial reporting as well as management discussion of the growth of this business line to determine whether the integration is accruing value to Asure.I write about IPOs, follow-ons, secondaries, and M&A.

4309953,21815,2019-12-02T00:31:37-05:00,"The company sold off its workspace business for $120M which will eliminate its net debt and $9M of interest cost.However, investors have to be patient for the benefits to emerge as 2020 is going to be a transition year with revenue stagnant.After 2020, things should be much better with revenue growth, margins and cash flow all improving and the shares are really cheap against such a scenario.","We argued back in August that the sell-off in Asure Software (ASUR) was overdone and that turned out to be the case:The company has certainly been growing nicely, even though its net income has moved down:Data by YChartsThe $9.5M or so in net loss over the past 12 months is a GAAP figure, non-GAAP the company is actually profitable (+$5.7M). The GAAP net loss is roughly equal to the interest cost savings the company will get from the big reduction in debt as a result of selling its workspace business, although there will be some transition costs as well.Since this is a main event affecting almost everything else, let us turn to that divestiture first.The shares' rally which we were predicting back in August happened mostly as a result of something we could not have foreseen, so it was at least in part a lucky strike. The company is selling the smaller one of its two divisions, its workspace business; from the earnings deck:The business is sold for $120M in cash on a debt-free, cash-free basis, which will allow the company to greatly improve its balance sheet, cutting its $124M debt to a much more manageable $20M-30M and cutting interest expenses by some $9M in the process.The Q3 results for the workspace business came in a little light with a decline of 4% but management argues that this was because of the distraction of the sales process.What's left is a HCM SaaS only business, which has now migrated to AWS and consists of the following elements (earnings deck):The HCM business is an attractive business, with the company getting most of its customers from the SMB sector (earnings deck):Management argues that longer term (after the transition year 2020), its HCM business can grow at 8-12% (earnings deck):As one can see, the bulk of that will have to come from cross-selling and there are ample opportunities here as the large majority of customers has just one product.One of the more curious things is that management argues that 2020 is going to be a transition year with revenue growth (now of course as a pure HCM play) of just 0-1%. We have a hard time understanding that.For starters, HCM was growing at 8% in Q3 and bookings came in at a whopping +38%, with the post transition year revenue growth guided at 8-12%. What is causing the slowdown in 2020?What we do understand is that the company needs some 12 months to absorb the incremental overhead from workspace, but this is affecting margins, not revenue growth.Management also argued that it is ready with its infrastructure, its transition to AWS is complete, so is its implementation of NetSuite, as well as a network of service hubs across the country (Q3CC):If it's ready to absorb acquisitions it should be ready to absorb more sales, we're inclined to say. One thing that does offer some sort of explanation is that the company is foregoing one-off consultancy work (Q3CC):But one-off consultancy revenue can only be 6% of revenue, as recurring revenue in HCM was 94% of revenue in Q3. An analyst at the Q3CC had the same problem as us and found the flat revenue guidance hard to square with the 38% growth in bookings. Here is what management answered (Q3CC):So we take it that all of the 6% non-recurring HCM revenue is consulting and all of that is going to fall off. The company is also building out its sales force, which has four components (earnings deck):The company is going to increase the direct sales force, especially in tier 2 and tier 3 cities where there is less competition and it has many referral channels like CPAs, banks, consulting services, benefit brokers, etc.Detracting the sales force for the workspace business, there is a jump penciled in for 2020 (earnings deck):While we realize that this takes training and up to 12 months to get these new sales people up to full speed, it is difficult to see this as contributing to the flat revenue growth.If anything, it should increase revenue growth at least a bit, even if they're not all hired at once and not immediately fully productive. The cross-selling opportunities seem especially significant with 95% of the clients just having payroll and none of the other products.Many of the referral partners become resellers, and in Q3 the company added 16 new resellers (earnings deck):Data by YChartsThe margins in the graph above are GAAP figures, the non-GAAP figures (excluding stuff like share-based compensation) are a bit higher. Non-GAAP gross margin came in at 65.6%, still down from last year's 67.9% and that despite the very high margin $457K in interest on client funds in Q3, which was up from just $20K last year.Non-GAAP operating margin was actually positive, and the company generated a non-GAAP EBITDA margin of 21.9% versus 22.9% last year.Data by YChartsCash flow has been improving and is likely to improve further with the elimination of roughly $9M in interest cost. At the end of Q3, the company had $12.9M in cash and $124M in debt, but this will of course change a lot with the closing of the workspace sale.Data by YChartsStock-based compensation is really rather modest although there has been significant dilution related to acquisitions.Data by YChartsThese metrics do not yet capture the sale of the workspace business, how does this change things? A few metrics:That is, we get an EV/S multiple of 1.65x, which is really downright cheap. Analysts expect a (non-GAAP) EPS of $0.36 this year rising to $0.44 but we don't know whether these are updated figures, given that in the first three quarters of the year the company already attained a non-GAAP EPS of $0.41.We are not aware that management guided for a non-GAAP loss in Q4 but that is not impossible as management argued it needs 12 months or so to eliminate the excess overhead that remains after the divestiture.The only guidance we have is full-year non-GAAP EBITDA of $11M-12M (implying a non-GAAP EBITDA margin of 15.3-16.4%). Looking at the first three quarters:Given the $17.2M of non-GAAP EBITDA in the first three quarters and the FY2019 guidance of $11M-12M, a non-GAAP net income loss seems indeed extremely likely. Here is how the company is supposed to look longer term (earnings deck):The picture for the immediate future isn't entirely clear as margins are marred by transition costs of the divestiture and this transition period is going to last for another year.While it might seem early, if you can look beyond that, a much more benign picture emerges with the shares being rather cheap, growth returning and margins recovering and a balance sheet that is much more sound."
2461495,48781,2014-09-02T12:30:00-04:00,The bullish long-term outlook driven by the growing use of SaaS workspace management solutions remains intact despite lower guidance for 2H14.The high recurring revenue and increasing contribution of higher margin SaaS revenue provides increased visibility and deserves a higher multiple more in line with peers.New products that leverage the unique integrated hardware/software approach and shift towards larger customers should accelerate growth.A refinancing earlier this year should help the company remain profitable and utilize the significant NOLs.The growth at a reasonable price thesis is supported by the investment in one of its closest peers at a 5x higher multiple.,"Company overviewAsure Software (NASDAQ:ASUR) provides time/labor and workspace management solutions.Recent pullback is opportunity, not cause for concernThe steady downtrend since the spring of this year should not cause investors to question the long-term bullish outlook, which is driven by multiple growth drivers that would make for an impressive word cloud. The SaaS solutions provided by ASUR can generate significant cost savings and improve productivity by reducing the three largest expenses (labor, technology and real estate) by leveraging big data and the cloud.As the ""easy"" cost cuts have largely been made across corporate America, any incremental savings will have to come from less obvious sources such as increasing workspace utilization, which can drop below 50% due to travel, off-site meetings, vacations and telecommuting. Companies can reduce real estate costs by up to 30% by increasing the use of shared space (hot desking) as the annual cost of an ""employee backpack"" (cubicle, desktop computer and land line) is $10,000-15,000. For example, nonprofit Voluntary Service Overseas is projected to save Â£400,000 annually by reducing its real estate needs through the use of AsureSpace Workspace Manager that will enable its 320 employees to share 180 desks. The cost of these empty backpacks will only grow given the ongoing shift towards a more mobile workforce with IDC projecting >1.3 billion mobile workers by 2015.The seamless integration of hardware and software represents a unique advantage that a competitor cannot easily match. Earlier this month ASUR introduced AsureForce AirClock, a tablet-based, biometric time collection device that uses cloud-based software and combines manual PIN entry with facial recognition technology. This virtually eliminates the possibility of ""buddy punching"" and time fraud.Another example is AsureSpace SmartView, which measures workspace utilization through the use of presence detection devices. This raw data is translated into actionable intelligence for human resources professionals to view on an interactive reporting dashboard. This system eliminates the previous method of measuring occupancy, which involved someone physically going to every workspace, meeting room and common area on a regular basis. To say this was an incredible waste of employee time and corporate resources is an understatement. Moreover, as one person can only be in so many places at once, this often resulted in incomplete and inaccurate data.From good to great: Recent quarterly results provide upgraded growth outlookInvestors should look past the modest 4% overall revenue increase in 2Q14 to the stronger and more profitable underlying growth drivers. SaaS revenue increased 10% and accounted for 53% of overall revenue (up ~300 bps from 2Q13) while recurring revenue (SaaS and maintenance/support) was 78% of overall revenue. This growth was driven by the ongoing shift towards the integrated cloud-based solutions and away from legacy on-premise products. The 83% increase in SaaS bookings should provide continued high visibility as revenue is recognized over the term of the contract (rather than upfront). The closing of several large, multi-year sales to two blue chip customers (KPMG and PriceWaterhouseCoopers) as well as the first seven figure deal reveals an expansion beyond the core small and medium sized business customer.The gross margin expanded 255 bps to 79% and reached the highest level since the PeopleCube acquisition in 3Q12 due to increased efficiencies and the shift towards higher margin SaaS solutions. Management said that there is scope for further margin expansion as growth continues to ramp up.A refinancing in March 2014 resulted in a 49% decrease in interest expense (the interest rate decreased from 11.5% to 5%) and should enable ASUR to remain profitable. The resulting lower cash principal payments ($0.8 million in 2014 and $1.1 million in 2015) could create a virtuous cycle as the savings and free cash flow are used to continue delevering (debt is already down $6 million since 2012).This higher gross profit, slight decrease in SG&A as a percentage of revenue (down ~140 bps to 53.4%) and lower interest expense enabled ASUR to return to profitability on a pro forma basis as EPS increased from $(0.06) to $0.02.Investors should not be discouraged after management said that revenue and EBITDA will come in at the low end of guidance for 2014 ($29-30 million and $5.5-6.5 million respectively) for two reasons. First, this would still represent double-digit growth. Second, a more positive (if overlooked) aspect of the guidance is the expectation of remaining profitable for the remainder of the year. Once ASUR posts several consecutive quarters of profitability the market should begin to price in the value of the $116.5 million of federal NOLs.M&A activity strengthens cloud presenceIn addition to organic growth, the following two recent acquisitions (funded with the new, low cost financing from Wells Fargo) further differentiate its integrated and holistic solution. In acquiring FotoPunch (which was previously only a partner) in July 2014, ASUR gained technology used in employee time/attendance that transforms a mobile device into a biometric, geo-located time clock. FotoPunch not only helped win the previously mentioned seven figure deal but should enable ASUR to capture a larger portion of the ~$610 million market for mobile time/labor management technology that is growing at a double-digit rate.Roomtag (a provider of SaaS workspace management solutions) was a highly complementary acquisition earlier this month that should deliver cross-selling opportunities and gradually enable ASUR to at least double the ~$100 of revenue currently generated per customer employee. The similar technology architecture also should result in a rapid and seamless integration.RisksManagement said on the 2Q14 conference call that the biggest risk for 2H14 is onboarding new clients in a timely manner.A portion of the progress made in terms of debt repayment has been ""reversed"" due to the FotoPunch and Roomtag acquisitions.Although management expects to be able to fund operations for the next year with the current cash, credit facility and operating cash flow, there may be another secondary offering in order to fund growth. The fact that insiders purchased about a third of the shares in the May 2013 secondary is encouraging.The industry is subject to intense competition (which is increasing due to new entrants such as ADP), rapid technological change and relatively low barriers to entry.Valuation and price targetAs shown in the chart below, ASUR trades at a significant discount to its peers (those that generate meaningful or even positive EBITDA) despite a similarly attractive growth profile.The more relevant comp (as shown in the chart below detailing the multiple similarities) is the $750 million investment made by Blackstone and GIC in February 2014 in Kronos that valued the company at 13.8x EBITDA.The price target of ~$7.30 (to be reached over the next 12-18 months) is derived by placing a 10x multiple (still 4x turns lower than slower growing ADP) on EBITDA of $6 million, which is a <10% increase from the low end of the 2014E of $5.5 million.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4076899,101421,2017-05-26T14:19:00-04:00,"Asure Software has completed the 'tuck-in' acquisitions of iSystems and Compass HRM for an aggregate $61 million.The two deals are part of an ongoing strategy to market Asure's HCM solution to service bureau networks.Asure increased its credit facilities and completed a stock offering to pay for the acquisitions, and the market's recent reaction has been generally positive.","Quick TakeWorkforce management software company Asure Software (ASUR) has completed the acquisitions of iSystems and Compass HRM for total consideration of $61 million.The two acquired firms will assist Asure in selling its Mangrove-acquired HCM (Human Capital Management) solution as it scales its foray into the HCM market space, which it views as large and growing.Assuming Asure isnâ€™t overpaying for the â€˜distributionâ€™ of these service bureau networks, these deals should be the right strategy to provide its solutions to the HCM market.Target CompaniesBurlington, Vermont-based iSystems was founded in 1996 to provide human capital management software for payroll processors, banks and CPAs via its â€˜EvolutionHCMâ€™ system.The Evolution HCM system includes modules for payroll, HR management, tax, time and labor and reporting and analytics.The company was founded by industry veterans Michael Trahan and Desiree Hanley-Trahan, who have developed its customer base to reach 100 service bureaus.Below is a brief demo video about Evolutionâ€™s payroll system:(Source: Evolution HCM)The second acquisition, that of Tampa, Florida-based Compass HRM which founded in 2011, is a reseller of Asureâ€™s HCM offering to its referral network in the U.S. Southeast with a focus on Florida.As a PEO alternative (Professional Employer Organization), Compass provides small businesses with the ability to create personalized employee benefit plans along with handling payroll processing and reporting.Acquisition Terms and RationaleAsure is paying $55 million for iSystems, of which $32 million is in cash, $18 million of Asure unregistered stock (1.5 million shares), and a $5 million note to the seller at 3.5% interest.Based on iSystems $14 million revenue, the purchase price represents a 3.93x Price/Sales multiple.The company is paying $6 million for Compass HRM, comprised of $4.5 million in cash and $1.5 note taken back by the seller.To close the deals, Asure has obtained a new $35 million term loan, increasing its credit facilities to a total of $75 million. The company has also completed a public offering of its common stock of 1.9 million shares of common stock plus an over-allotment option of 285,000 shares.Asure announced the pricing of the 1.9 million shares at $13.50 per share, and assuming the underwriter over-allotment option is fully exercised, the gross proceeds to Asure will be $29,497,500.So, with the additional credit of $40 million plus the share sale net proceeds of an estimated $27 million, the additional capital of $67 million will cover the two acquisitions of $61 million plus some integration cost funds.Asureâ€™s stock has generally traded up on the announcements, no doubt in part because the company recently reported good 1Q 2017 financial results and increased full year guidance.Asure has been actively acquiring companies as part of its strategic and transformational push into the HCM (Human Capital Management) space, which it views as a â€˜rapidly-growing multi-billion dollarâ€™ opportunity.With the addition of iSystems, management cited its,For the Compass HRM deal, Asure gets a significant referral network concentration in the Southeast U.S., particularly Florida.So, in the wake of its big Mangrove acquisition, Asure is pursuing a strategy of acquiring networks of service bureaus to achieve cost synergies and sell through to their customer bases.Managementâ€™s financial performance appears to be bearing that strategy out. As long as it doesnâ€™t overpay for these service bureau networks, the numbers will work out right for ASUR investors.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

4276540,35181,2019-07-22T17:39:15-04:00,"Asure is a $100 million revenues company operating in 2 industries with a combined TAM of $30 billion.Asure is the only company in both HCM and workspace management.The company has both geospatial and facial recognition for mobile time tracking. Big brother has arrived.Given the good fundamentals and very low valuation, I give Asure a Buy rating.As with all stock investments, this opportunity comes with significant risks.","Asure Software, Inc. (ASUR) operates in the highly competitive Human Capital Management (HCM) industry. With approximately $100 million in sales, Asure is not one of the bigger players in the industry but has managed to grow using an aggressive acquisition strategy, catering to a second industry called Workspace Management, and introducing a line of hardware sensors for the workplace.2019 will be a year that Asure consolidates a recent string of acquisitions and ramps up its sales staff for future growth. I expect that revenues and profits will not be overly impressive this year, but I would not sit on this opportunity. At under $9, Asure's stock price is grossly undervalued and given the company's aggressive growth strategy, it is best to get in now. Asure is a Growth At a Reasonable Price (GARP) opportunity and I am assigning it a Buy rating.Asure's situation is unique in that none of its HCM competitors offers workspace solutions. According to Asure's latest presentation materials, the combined HCM/workspace Total Addressable Market (TAM) is estimated to be as much as $30 billion.(Source: Asure)HCM - Competition includes ADP, Kronos, Paylocity, Ultimate Software, Ceridian among others.Workspace management - Competition includes Dean Evans & Associates, Inc., AgilQuest Corporation and Condeco Ltd.Not only is Asure a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company but with the new line of sensors, Asure now also operates as a Hardware-as-a-Service (HaaS) business. The suite of sensors includes environmental monitoring, detection of conference room occupation, and a time clock with facial recognition that will reduce time theft. According to the company, Asure is the ""only known company to have both geospatial and facial recognition technology working together for mobile time tracking."" Yes... Big brother has finally arrived!When it comes to SaaS companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I have developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.Asure had a strong year compared to its software peers with trailing-twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 53%, while the software industry as a whole grew by 16%.(Source: Portfolio123)Part of the reason for the strong revenue growth is due to the string of acquisitions, including 7 in 2018 and 1 this year.Unlike most SaaS companies, Asure has managed to keep SG&A under control while the company is growing. The SG&A expense is approximately 60% of total revenues. A hyper-growth company such as Okta (OKTA) typically has 100+% SG&A to sales. A mature software company would have a figure of less than 50%.(Source: Portfolio123)Asure's free cash flow margin TTM has been in a slow decline since mid-2012 and is currently sitting at -4.4%.(Source: Portfolio123)A rule of thumb often applied to software companies is the ""Rule of 40."" This metric helps SaaS companies balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin as I believe that it is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's revenue growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has balanced growth and cash flow resulting in financial health.Asure's revenue growth from the most recent 12 months was 53%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing twelve months was -4.4%. Therefore:Revenue growth + FCF margin = 53% - 4.4% = 48.6%Since the calculation comes out higher than 40%, I conclude that Asure is in good shape financially, although I suspect that revenue will be lower in future years. I will be keeping a close eye on the Rule of 40 for Asure.This is where things get interesting and somewhat controversial. It seems logical to me that high-growth companies should be valued more highly than slow-growth companies. To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of Enterprise Value (EV)/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth based on 77 stocks from my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"" also provided by Portfolio123.The reason for using analysts' estimates is because SaaS stocks tend to make a lot of acquisitions which can muddy the results of the scatter plot. The analyst estimates account for these acquisitions, and the estimates are updated frequently. This makes for a cleaner chart. The sales estimates, unlike EPS estimates, are usually quite accurate for most SaaS companies except that they tend to be a little on the conservative side. Apparently, all SaaS CEOs are clones of some very conservative financial guy as they all give conservative guidance!I use an exponential best-fit trend line as it appears to be more appropriate than a linear trend line for this application. As sales growth goes up, the valuation goes up exponentially. The trend line was calculated using MS Excel. I consider the stocks sitting above the trend line to be overvalued, while stocks lying under the trend line are undervalued.As can be seen from the chart, Asure is sitting well below the trend line, indicating that its EV/forward sales figure is better than almost all of its peers. In my estimation, Asure is undervalued. Keep in mind that this is a relative valuation based on a universe of SaaS stocks, not an absolute valuation that one would attempt to calculate with a discounted cash flow model.The recent pullback in stock price provides an ideal opportunity to buy shares as the price is now slightly higher than the support level of $8.40.An investment in Asure comes with several risks. For starters, the stock market bull market is long in the tooth, and we could enter a bear market in the not-too-distant future based on a slowing economy or a resurgence in trade tensions between USA and China.In addition, SaaS stocks are on a tear, and many of them are reaching all-time highs. Some analysts believe that we are in for a second ""dot-com"" crash due to lofty valuation levels and little in the way of profits. If a crash occurs, it is likely that Asure will crash along with the general market.Asure's profitability is to some extent dependent on the economy, and a recession could cause a downturn in company revenues and profits.There is also the possibility that the new initiatives undertaken by Asure may not be endorsed by customers.Asure operates in two very competitive industries: HCM and workspace management. Asure is the only company selling into both markets. Combined the two industries have a TAM of $30 billion. Asure has revenues of $100 million and has lots of potential for growth given the size of the TAM.Asure scores well on the Rule of 40 and has other positive factors going for it, such as reasonably low SG&A expense for a SaaS, and low price tag. According to my relative valuation scheme, Asure is very undervalued.While 2019 will be a year of consolidation of the many acquisitions made over the last 2 years and sales and marketing is being ramped, I believe that now is the time to buy. The stock may not remain so undervalued in the future.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"
2875376,42011,2015-02-02T14:41:51-05:00,"Asure is one of our top ideas - with a growth strategy linked to three major macroeconomic trends, and new product offerings to bolster growth.Asure has a global footprint and a solid foundation for growth with a recent refinancing, a high level of insider ownership and recent institutional buying.The companyâ€™s high ~80% GM, 90% customer retention rate and 79% recurring revenue offer visibility and should result in a stronger multiple moving forward. A $116.5M NOL can cut taxes.With a 1.67X enterprise value/revenue and a 9.68X EV/EBITDA, Asure is extremely undervalued in comparison to its SaaS peers.With an 80% GM, the company can deliver $0.70 to $0.74 in EPS for 2015, with a 20x P/E ratio this equates to 150%-200% upside potential.","An extensive interview with Asure's CEO, Pat Goepel, at the conclusion of this report.Opening:As wage increases have been weak at around three percent for the past four years, employees are becoming dissatisfied with their situations. As employers have to maintain their workforce with less profits in a more competitive marketplace, they need a more efficient way to run their organizations. Asure's cost cutting efficiencies and cost-savings offered through its workforce and workplace management solutions are a go-to for any organization that wants to be leaner and more advanced.Asure Software (NASDAQ:ASUR) is a cloud-based workforce management software solutions provider based in Austin, TX. Founded in 1985, Asure is a $30M microcap company with an impressive growth story. The company is profiting by saving businesses time and money. This is accomplished by streamlining workforces and workspaces into highly productive engines.With thousands of clients and a global footprint, Asure is an established company, not a typical overvalued technology company based upon promises. Further, Asure has aligned itself with three major market trends to bolster growth - globalization, mobilization and technology.With a conservative revenue growth rate, Asure has the potential to reach $35-$40M in revenue and an EPS of $0.70 to $0.74 in EPS for FY15. This equates to 150% to 200% upside potential with an industry average 20x P/E ratio.A Breakdown Of Assure's Two Product Suites:The company's AsureSpace and AsureForce each comprising various product offerings that can integrate with each other, while both product lines strive to make businesses more efficient.AsureSpace is a scheduling and workplace management software that allows employees to book meeting space or a desk from their own mobile device, or a kiosk - improving workspace utilization. This suite includes a resource scheduler, meeting room manager, workspace manager, workplace business intelligence, smart view and integrated hardware comprising of employee's devices or touch panels and kiosks. Further, NowSpace allows you to book rooms or desks, view co-worker availability directly from your smartphone.AsureForce comprises a suite of software, hardware and mobile workforce management solutions to improve efficiency through enhanced business intelligence to better allocate a business's workforce, decrease costs by flagging staffing issues and reduce labor expenses while creating strategy opportunities. On the software side, AsureForce Time and Labor Management Software that allows the managing of leave requests and PTO, time sheets online, employee attendance, workforce scheduling and more all from the cloud. This segment also comprises Asure's time clocks and data collection device and GeoPunch to track employees.New Product Offerings Can Benefit Organizations - While Increasing Asure's Sales:Recently, Asure has unveiled four new product offerings to complement its two key product and software suites. These new and unique products will bolster the efficiency Asure can offer to businesses while increasing sales for the company.GeoPunch: Asure stated that their time tracking management software delivers an 80% reduction in time and attendance administration. Further, the association of Certified Fraud Examiners found that the average organization loses 5% of its annual revenue to occupational fraud. Managing new hires, an expanding business and mobile workers leads to this lost revenue. Asure's GeoPunch tracks whose working to eliminate fraud and enhance productivity. This application requires virtually no training, and eliminates the clocking in of a co-worker through facial recognition.AirClock: The average organization pays $5720 in non-work dollars to every employee. Overall, workers spend 26% of their time at work, not working. Companies are turning from the old manual system to fully automated time clock hardware from Asure. Asure offers proximity cards, barcode cards and biometric options to eliminate time fraud and payroll costs. To the benefit of the business, Asure's options can be licensed on-demand or pay-as-you-go.Asure's AirClock offering is a fixed cloud-based device that offers biometric facial and PIN entry for employees to check in at work. This eliminates buddy punching, and increases business efficiency as employees can be better tracked. Moreover, AirClock requires virtually no training.NowSpace: NowSpace is Asure's easy to use solution that solves a massive problem ubiquitous to every organization - the frustration of an employee reserving a desk only to drive all the way to work to find their reserved desk is occupied due to miscommunication within the system. Asure's NowSpace is an easy to use application that allows an employee to book a room or desk to work at, when they want it. This cuts down on the real estate needed by a business and allows employees workspace only when they need it - especially as many employees are working from home, or are on the go. With NowSpace, Asure has stated that they can accommodate employee needs with up to half the physical real estate requirements. NowSpace can be used on employee devices or on employer given ones, and is an actual application - not a web based site.SmartTag: Last on the list of new products is Asure's SmartTag. This goes beyond employees and tracks physical assets from an employee phone to a desk chair or computer monitor. This allows for reduced asset losses and misplacements and the ability to recognize vacant or misallocated space. This division is reminiscent of our article on SuperCom's (NASDAQ:SPCB) acquisition of OTI's SmartID Division. OTI's SmartID division ranged from electronic monitoring and location tracking to SmartID creation such as Passports. Although Asure's SmartTag division can only be used to track business assets. It is worth noting that SuperCom has increased roughly 300% since the acquisition, although that was based upon a highly accretive acquisition. This example demonstrate the playing field and opportunity Asure's SmartTag can target.A Growing Company: Refinanced With Insider Ownership And Institutional Buying:Asure's recent financials demonstrate that growth is currently underway. For the 2Q 2014, Asure reported revenue increasing 4% Y/Y, while net income increased 103% Y/Y. Asure's gross margin of 79% represented an 7% increase Y/Y. Interestingly, the company grew repetitive cloud based revenue by 10% Y/Y and saw increased cloud bookings of 83% Y/Y. Asure's net income per share improved to $0.00 per share from $(0.10) Y/Y as the company's new refinancing was in place. It is worth noting that recurring revenue amounted to 78% of total revenue in the quarter. Asure has reached a critical inflection point as the company reported a positive 2Q net income after two quarters of losses.The company is becoming a leaner machine as they recently refinanced the company's senior deb under a new credit agreement with Wells Fargo. The new facility has a new term loan of $15M, a $3M revolver and an additional uncommitted incremental loan facility of $10M for future acquisitions. The new loan currently has a 5% interest rate, in comparison to the 11.5% loan agreement the company had with Deerpath Funding, LP. After incurring a one-time charge of $1.4M, Asure expects to reduce interest expenses by $0.6M in 2014, $0.7M in 2015 and reduce cash principal payments by $0.8M in 2014 and $1.1M in 2015. This will result in increased profitability for the company in 2014 and 2015.High insider ownership of 20% demonstrates that management's goals are aligned perfectly with shareholders - eliminating any potential principal agent problem. Pat Goepel, CEO of Asure, owns 6.7% of the company and Asure's Chairman Daniel Sandberg owns 13%.In addition to a healthy insider ownership, institutions have begun to add to their holdings in Asure as the company grows and develops. Institutions increased their holdings by ~20% Q/Q. Overall, 26% of the company is owned by institutions and mutual fund owners, equating to a solid ownership level while allowing liquidity with a 4.69M share float.A Real World Example: Scottish Water:Many companies offer promises as to the value proposition offered by their products and services - whereas Asure has documented success to prove it. On October 14, 2014, Asure reported that they implemented an agile working program that enabled Scottish Water to save over ~$6.3M (â‚¬5M) in construction and operating costs. This was achieved in Scottish Water's new office with a 25% reduction in the number of workspaces through Asure's Workspace Manager solution to support a hot design and resource sharing system.With almost 3,400 employees in six locations throughout Scotland, employees had faced various problems that reduced efficiency. Scottish Water's employees were spending too much time in vehicles between locations, had difficulties reserving rooms via email and lacked any form of hot desk reservation system. Together, these items caused employee frustration and reduced work efficiency.After the implementation of the agile working program, roughly 1,500 employees use Asure's Workspace Manager to book workspaces and meeting rooms online and in the office using kiosks and touch panels. Asure's solutions also cut down significantly on the time employees spent in vehicles between locations. Asure's solutions eliminated employee frustration and allowed management to be aware of room and desk utilization. Looking ahead, a pilot program us underway which will allow employees to book carpooling, and include video conferencing resources. Per the release, Scottish Water has plans to roll out Workspace Manager hardware and software to four additional offices and is evaluating Asure's Visitor Management and Catering services.Outside of Scottish Water, Asure closed several other deals as of last quarter. These deals include the sale of AsureForce workforce management solutions to PSSI in the U.S., and the sale of Asure Space workforce management solutions to KPMG and PriceWaterhouseCoopers in the UK. Documented success and cost savings for businesses using Asure's solutions will attract future clients for Asure moving forward.Forward Projections and Valuations:2014 In A Nutshell:Asure's solutions are being adopted by the marketplace as they are proven to make businesses not only more efficient, but in turn more profitable. Management has provided projections for the current fiscal year that we believe are achievable based upon Asure's recent documented growth, closed deals, and the cost savings and efficiency their competitive solutions provide to businesses. Management has stated that Asure can deliver $29M-$30M in revenue and $0.08 to $0.24 in EPS for FY14'.2015's Projections and How This Growth Will Be Achieved:With a quarter and a half to go for FY 14', we believe looking to 2015 can provide an even more fruitful opportunity. As with other technology companies, a company's products generally have a high curved adoption curve - slow at first before high growth sets in. We believe Asure is in an excellent position to target and capture growth hinged on three macroeconomic trends that will drive top-line growth. Looking ahead to FY 15' we believe Asure can achieve revenue of $35M-$40M, and EPS of $0.70 to $0.74.1) A High GM and Recurring Revenue Equals Visibility:Asure's high recurring revenue ~79%, coupled with their high ~80% GM offers excellent visibility and should result in a premium multiple moving forward. This is a key reason why we believe our 20X P/E ratio used in our model is conservative. Further, as Asure continues to demonstrate growth in the coming quarters, institutions will be more willing to reward Asure with a higher multiple due to its high GM and recurring revenue level which offer excellent visibility.With a large GM, Asure is a lean machine dropping more revenue dollars to the bottom line. Further, a high recurring revenue percentage offers a predictable growth model moving forward. Due to this visibility, the market should grant Asure a higher multiple than the industry average -the main reason why we believe our 20X P/E ratio is conservative.2) High Client Retention And An Untapped Market:Barrington research found that Asure has a 90% client retention rate and has only penetrated 4% of its $600M addressable market. This research estimated 150,000 potential clients paying $4,000 annually. A high client retention rate further solidifies the predictability of Asure's business model. Asure's 90% customer retention rate, coupled with its ~79% recurring revenue stream offer stable growth and high visibility moving forward. The company also has a massive untapped market that it will target in the coming quarters.Asure's high client retention rate, gross margin and recurring revenue stream all provide for visibility and stable growth moving forward not seen in other technology or microcap companies and should provide for a stronger multiple moving forward.3) Technology Trends:More business are eliminating the employee backpack and increasing support for BYOD strategies - thus allowing an employee to use their own devices to achieve work results. Frost and Sullivan found that 70% of organization in the US will embrace BYOD activity, and 78% will by 2018. As such, more businesses will embrace trends which favor Asure's solutions - driving growth as Asure is a very competitive player in the field. This is noted by their new and innovative product offerings.Further, the permeation of the cloud for businesses and employees means employees can collaborate more easily than ever before, while not having to be in the same physical location. Asure's employee tracking helps keep tabs of mobile employees, prevents clocking in a fellow employee, and allows for hot desk and meeting room bookings through their integrated apps, kiosks and smart panels. So when employees need to come into the office they can easily reserve a space - saving time, money and frustration for the employee and the business owner.4) Mobilization Trends:Telecommuting rose nearly 80% from 2005 -2012 and 1.3B workers will be mobile by 2015. Asure's offerings not only allow a business to better keep track of their employees through GeoPunch and other solutions, but allows the business to keep track of their physical assets that employees may utilize with SmartTag. Further, since all of Asure's offerings are integrated, Asure will be a friend to the growth in mobilization. For example, an employee can clock in on AirClock, verify their location if they run out with GeoPunch and then reserve a desk for the evening with NowSpace - all the while a business can track their physical assets with SmartTags.5) Globalization:With over 82,000 companies and 800,000 subsidiaries being multinational - business are more geographically stretched than ever. With multiple satellite offices ranging from a few to larger side operations with thousands of employees - businesses are craving efficiency to better track their organization and save money while doing so. Asure's offerings can virtually eliminate the 26% of time workers spend at work, not working. Further, they can virtually eliminate the 5% of total revenue lost through occupational fraud. These items are more prevalent than ever as business expand geographically, with managers not being a quick walk down the hall. With Asure's offerings, the employee-manager link is re-enabled with increased efficiency.6) Global FootPrint and Existing Clients:With 4,161 locations in 80 countries, Asure's global footprint will ensure that it can profit from providing increased efficiencies and cost-savings to business beyond domestic borders. The work norms and operations are different in foreign countries, but the concept of business efficiency is a globally shared business goal. Asure can offer its solutions to businesses around the world, a near limitless opportunity for the small company.With over 5,000 current clients, I believe Asure will be able to both cross-sell its new products and offer solutions these clients may not already have, to the company's benefit. If these clients purchased Asure's products in the past, the addition of Asure's newer offerings will result in increased efficiencies. Further, this proven partner channel demonstrates Asure's ability to work with and satisfy some of the world's largest companies, which can also be used as a selling point for potential new clients.Recently, Asure partnered with Douma, Japan's only firm dedicated solely to workplace management, whihc will offer Asure's solutions to its clients. This partnershipw will help Asure bolster its revenue in a new untapped international market with the only provider in that country.These thousands of clients include brand name companies such as Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). These are major companies, and signing deals with these giants should not be brushed off as an easy endeavor.7) Targeting New Opportunities:The market for mobile workforce programs and solutions that Asure is targeting is huge. Specifically, Steven Rodriguez, Asure's COO stated the following with regards to 2013' spending allocated to time and labor management technology.Outside of current macroeconomic spending trends, Asure is looking to expand its high-margin cloud options over the next 2-5 years. These initiatives include items such as community cloud offerings to cloud security and platform as a service or PaaS offerings. We believe that Asure aligning itself with growth initiatives in the cloud market is an excellent decision as cloud computing service revenue is projected to top $500B in 2019.8) Cost Savings and Efficiency Offered To Businesses Will Drive GrowthAs seen with Scottish Water, Asure's offerings saved the company over $6.3M in only one location. Asure also signed deals with PSSI for AssureForce workforce management solutions in the U.S., and the sale of Asure Space workforce management solutions to KPMG and PriceWaterhouseCoopers in the UK. We believe these deals, sporting documented cost savings with large organizations, demonstrate Asure's viability in the marketplace and that the company can offer these types of savings to many organizations in the future. Since Asure is proven to save businesses money, we believe the company will not have a problem attracting future clients.9) These Initiatives Will Lead To Impressive Growth in FY15':Looking ahead to 2015, Asure can offer shareholders a very impressive return on a very conservative growth level for an SaaS company. To achieve the low end of management's guidance for FY14', Asure will have to grow revenue 15% this year. We believe this conservative growth rate is obtainable as the company has already reported $13.08M in revenue for the first have of 2014. Further, since the company's new product offerings have rolled out, and recent deals, such as with Scottish Water, can entice new clients to reach out to Asure for their solutions. At the low end of the revenue target of $29M, on a GM slightly below this past quarter, we believe Asure can reach $0.12 in EPS - the midpoint of management's guidance for FY14. Our low end target is in line with Kristi Richburg's, CFO of Asure, guidance for FY14.Turning to 2015, Asure has an opportunity to reward shareholders handsomely. Due to the cost savings and efficiencies Asure's product offerings can achieve for customers, we believe a 30% Y/Y top line growth rate is achievable as the company ramps up its offerings and unveils further cloud solutions hinged on a $500B addressable market by 2019. With a slightly expanded 80% GM as Asure has become a leaner engine, the company can deliver $0.70 to $0.74 in EPS for 2015. With a P/E ratio of 20X, this equates to 150%-200% upside potential from current levels.We believe our model is conservative as a company's P/E ratio generally expands as the company grows, yet we have chosen the industry average P/E ratio. Further, we have accounted a notable increase to 10M S/O by 2015 to account for any increases in Asure's S/O for any future acquisitions.We have elected to expand Asure's S/O to be conservative in out model. Although since the company is now profitable and producing a TTM operating cash flow of $2M, the company will likely not need to raise its S/O and this can result in a stronger EPS number for FY15'. Management has also stated they believe they will generate sufficient cash for its short term needs and debt requirements over the next twelve months, so there may be no reason for a raise.We believe ~29M in revenue for 2014 is an accurate target as the company reported $7.03M in revenue alone for the quarter ending September 30, 2014. Growth is also accelerating as the company became much more profitable earning $161K for the quarter versus only $15K in the previous one.Achieving An 80% GM For FY15':A Leaner Machine:Our model includes a slightly enhanced GM as Asure better handles their costs moving forward. Asure's largest operating expense, SG&A has slowed as revenue has increased, allowing for a higher gross margin. In the 2Q, SG&A increased only 1.4% Y/Y as revenue increased 4%. This is notable as SG&A accounted for 72% of Asure's operating expenses in the second quarter.Our model includes a 10% Y/Y increase in all expenses. A closer look reveals how Asure will be a leaner and profitable machine moving forward, even with higher expenses - specifically its SG&A load. Due to the company's refinancing of its original $14.5M in senior debt through DeerPath with Wells Fargo. This resulted in Asure's interest expense decreases $0.6M in 2014 and $0.7M in 2015. Without this decrease, keeping interest expense even Y/Y, Asure would only deliver $0.03 in EPS in 2014, ceteris parbius. This refinancing will also reduce principal payments by $1.9M over the next two years as well.In addition, in March 2012, Asure amended the terms of the $1.5M convertible notes bearing 9% interest the company issues to finance its acquisition of ADI. Under the amendment, each 9% notes holder was permitted to convert the balance into common stock at $5 per share. $1.15M of the $1.5M was converted - eliminating a large portion of this 9% debt burden.Further, In July 2012, Asure issued a $3M note to the seller in its acquisition of PeopleCube. Asure had a dispute with the PeopleCube and Meeting Maker over a post-closing adjustment. The parties agreed in February 2014 to reduce the original $3M amount by $540K. The parties then settled and dismissed all litigation after settling the then $2.46M note for $1.7M. Asure's insurance carrier also agreed to pay Asure $500K in conjunction with the settlement. The end resulting in Asure recording a net gain of $1.034M recognized in the 1Q of 2014. This note had an outstanding balance last fiscal year of $2.22M at 10% interest - and this has now been eliminated as well.Overall, Asure has become a much leaner and cost efficient machine as the company's outstanding debt at the various interest rates of 9%, 10% and 11.50% have mostly been paid off or refinanced to 5%. This allows Asure to drop more money to the bottom line, also known as a higher GM.Growth In Higher Margin Cloud Offerings:Asure's cloud revenue inherently has higher margins than its hardware segment. As Asure continues to grow its cloud offerings, and offer more as demonstrated in their 2-3 year growth scenario, the company's GM should stabilize at 80%, from 74.75% in 2013. We believe this is obtainable as last quarter's 79% GM increased 7% Y/Y. In addition to higher margin cloud revenue, Asure has two other items bolstering its GM.Coupled with Asure's excellent moves to refinance their debt to entail much lower interest expenses, the slowing growth of the company's highest op-ex metric SG&A and an emphasis on higher margin cloud sales moving forward, Asure's GM can expand from 74.75% in FY13' to 77.50% in FY14' and 80% in FY15'.Cloud Strategies has found the median growth rate for a public SaaS company to be 28%, for the reasons noted we believe Asure will be able to grow just above this median rate, 30% Y/Y, for 2015. This industry metric also places our growth rate in the conservative range.Overall, Asure's refinancing and largest op-ex, SG&A, now lagging revenue growth coupled with increased higher-margin cloud offerings will result in an 80% GM. This is a conservative estimate as the company's GM in Q2 came in at 79%.Large NOL Can Aid In Profitability:As of the end of last year, Asure had a federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $116.5M. In addition to this large NOL, Asure had a Federal R&D credit carry forwards of approximately $4.9M and an alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards of $161,000. The former two items expire in varying amounts between 2018 through 2034. This massive NOL can help the company achieve increased profitability through reducing its tax burden in the coming quarters and fiscal years.An Undervalued Company:At a 1.67x enterprise value/revenue multiple, Asure is well below the software industry average of 3x EV/Revenue. Asure's billion dollar in-direct competitor Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) packs a valuation much akin to this average. ADP has an EV/Revenue ratio of 3.13x - nearly double Asure's ratio and in line with the software industry average. Further, with a price to sales ratio of 1.17x, Asure is wells below ADP's P/S ratio of 3.17x. (Permission For Use Granted By Software Equity Group, LLC)Statistics on public SaaS industry metrics can be difficult to obtain. Luckily, Software Equity Group publishes an SEG SaaS index to track public SaaS companies. Currently the index tracks 43 public pure play SaaS companies.Looking at SEG's SaaS index, Asure's EV/Revenue ratio of 1.67X is much below the industry average of 6.1x. Asure's EV/EBITDA ratio of 9.68X is also well below the industry average of 58.7X. These metrics conclude that Asure is extremely undervalued in comparison to the company's peers.Looking specifically at workforce management companies in SEG's index, the EV/Revenue of 8.2X and EV/EBITDA of 59X are even higher than the industry average. This subset is more in line with Asure's offerings and demonstrate how undervalued Asure currently is.With a market capitalization of $30M Asure is well below the average market cap of $877.5M for SaaS companies overall and below the $974M average market cap for workforce management companies. This demonstrates that the company has plenty of room to grow. Further, Asure's 2Q GM of 79% is also much higher than the SaaS industry average of 64.3% - demonstrating the company's increased efficiency over its peers.As Asure's gains exposure with institutions and retail investors, the company's valuation will move closer in line with its peers. A comparison of both EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA demonstrates the upside potential as Asure's valuation moves more in line with its peers as the company grows and management executes - resulting in increased upside potential.Betting On A Winning Leader: Pat GoepelBetting on the right leader is the most powerful force in microcap investing. Following a net loss of $12.7M in 2008, Pat Goepel was appointed CEO of Asure with an effective date of October 1, 2009, replacing Nancy Harris. Mr. Goepel is a powerful leader and led a strong turnaround at Asure.Mr. Goepel took over the a titanic losing $12.7M annually in the year before he took over the helm. In 2009 Mr. Goepel simplified Asure's business, improved the company's cost structure, improved and added products to turnaround the company. Since that date, Mr. Goepel has realigned Asure to near profitability in 2011.In 2012 the company's net loss did widen, but this was a strategic choice. SG&A increased $5.6M in 2012 with the $3.4M acquisition of People Cube and $1.6M in expenses linked to its ADI acquisition. As such, we see the loss as strategic choice in 2012 - since income would have been positive without these acquisitions. This loss narrowed in 2013, and Asure has recently beam net income positive in the 2Q of 2014. Due to the powerful turnaround Mr. Goepel was able to accomplish, we believe he is a leader worth betting on as Asure can now focus on growth.A Look At Asure's Direct Competition:In the space optimization space, Asure has a few direct competitors. NFS-Hospitality, offers meeting room and resource scheduling software, although from our research they do not offer integrated physical kiosks or airlocks. AgilQuest also does not offer these physical options either.SteelCase provides physical smart panels to reserve a meeting room, although its TagWizard panel is not integrated via the cloud to devices such as Asure's NowSpace. Further, SteelCase's upgraded RoomWizard II is a larger panel to reserve rooms, although it also is not integrated via the cloud to iPhones and employee devices. RoomWizard 2 can only be accessed physically or by a computer on a network PC - placing Asure's integrated cloud solutions a step above. SteelCase also does not have an integrated solution to compete with Asure's NowSpace.CyberMatrix offers an appointment scheduling software, although it has an outdated design in our opinion. Further, the company offers time-sheet software, where-as Asure offers GeoPunch to track employee movement with biometric validation. This solves a key problem of employee tracking and eliminating employee punching a friend in, not just another time-sheet solution. CyberMatrix offers an application known as Project Clock, although this does not compete with Asure's offerings and simply offers time tracking capabilities. CyberMatrix has no competing Kiosk or AirClock offerings.AMX does offer functional smart panels for room configuration and to schedule available rooms. These panels are fixed, and AMX does not have an integrated application for employees to utilize nor do they offer kiosks. AMX does offer a cloud-based application for their devices, but it is aimed for IT managers and not employees.Event Management Systems, also known as Dean Evans and Associates, is Asure's closest competitor offering many of the same products including interactive displays, and overlapping room scheduling software. Although, EMS does not offer any competitive product for GeoPunch or an application such as NowSpace. EMS does offer a web-application but not an integrated app from what we can discern. Further, EMS is a private company, so public investment dollars on this theme will flow to Asure. Emerging Soft also includes many overlapping capabilities, but does not offer a direct integrated application, only a web-based app.Crestron and Condeco both offer integrated smart displays and software much akin to Asure's scheduling capabilities, although they have no competitive product for GeoPunch or SmartTag.Playing The Theme:In order to directly invest in a small company with effective workplace management solutions and cost savings for its customers - Asure Software is the only choice. This is since Asure's direct competitors in the space optimization space, Crestron, CyberMatrix, EmergingSoft, NFS Hospitality, Event Management Systems, AgilQuest and Condeco, are all private.SteelCase (NYSE:SCS) is a public $2B company, but they are more focused on office furniture and do not have competing solutions for certain products offered by Asure - described earlier. AMX is owned by Harmon (NYSE:HAR) a public $6B company. To specifically play the theme of workplace and employee efficiency Asure is the only solution, as these two direct competitors are too large to play this specific theme.Risk Mitigation:The usual impediments facing microcap companies range from cash burn, illiquidity, share price swings and raising capital. We believe Asure is in a unique position since the company is producing a positive $2M TTM operating cash flow. Further, Asure is more liquid than most microcap companies as the $30M company is already NasdaqCM listed. Investors should be aware of all of the risks associated with microcap stocks before placing an investment as timelines are generally longer and price swings are common. Although these risks usually offer much more upside potential over blue-chip securities. Investors should be aware of liquidity risks and share price swings common in microcap companies.Conclusion:With the risks noted, Asure has the potential to offer shareholders considerable upside from current levels. In comparison to the SaaS industry overall and workforce management companies, Asure is extremely undervalued on a slew of metrics including EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA and P/S. Moreover, At the helm of Asure is a powerful leader - Pat Goepel.Asure's new product offerings, a growth strategy pinged to three major macroeconomic trends and the costs savings it offers to organizations will fuel growth into 2015. As a leaner, freshly refinanced entity producing $2M in operating cash flow with high insider ownership and institutional buying, Asure has a solid foundation for growth. Using a conservative growth rate and valuation in line with the industry average, Asure has the potential to offer shareholders 150%-200% upside potential from current levels.Recorded CEO Interview:To view SecretCaps' 30 minute recorded CEO interview with Asure Software's CEO Pat Goepel, Click Here Now.This article is meant to demonstrate the type of content SecretCaps members have access to. Visit SecretCaps to view our latest in-depth report on Network-1 Technologies now.Management Insight:An Interview With Pat Goepel, CEO of Asure SoftwareTom: Mr. Goepel, thank you for taking the time to offer investors insight into Asure Software.Mr: Goepel: Of course. Happy to be here talking with you today.Tom: AsureSpace and AsureForce are the two key solution offerings by Asure Software. Could you give investors the potential market opportunity for these solutions - such as a dollar amount these solutions are targeting?Mr: Goepel: Both AsureSpace workspace management solutions and AsureForce time and labor management solutions are cloud-based. Together, they allow our customers to better manage the time, space and assets associated with their employees and their real estate. This is especially key in today's world of the agile workforce. The traditional markets of workspace management and time and labor management within the mid-market only are predicted to be about $310 million and $100 million respectively. However, when you take these offerings up market to the enterprise level, and across the globe as multinational offerings, which we are doing, the opportunity is much larger.Tom: Management has guided towards $29-$30M in revenue for 2014. This seems to be a conservative target due to your competitive product offerings -- clients numbering over 5,000, over 4,000 locations in 80 countries and the three key trends Asure is targeting.Mr: Goepel: Asure Software is focused on predictable growth through the marketing, sales and delivery of SaaS-based solutions. Over the next few years, we will focus on bringing highly innovative SaaS-based mobile solutions to a global market and driving client satisfaction and retention.Tom: Asure offers a more aggressive growth target for cloud computing service revenue for 2015 and even 2019. How is Asure aligning itself with the growth of cloud computing service revenue? What are Asure's planned major cloud offerings?Mr: Goepel: All of our solutions are designed to work in SaaS environments and we have aligned our resources to develop and support SaaS solutions accordingly. Future development initiatives are looking at even more innovative ways to leverage the Cloud for mobile workforces. For example, we are looking into beacon technologies and few other exciting technologies right now.From a sales and client perspective, our goal is to market and sell all new sales as Cloud-based solutions. Within our customer base we are actively pursing migrations from on premise solution to Cloud solutions.Tom: When you joined the company you created an impressive turnaround bringing Asure to where it is today. How much was the company losing and how did you accomplish this turnaround?Mr: Goepel: I came to Asure in 2009, and at the time we were a $10 million a year company losing $10 million. The company lacked focus and the products were antiquated. Through talent upgrades, a renewed focus, a sound strategic plan, and a lot of hard work, Asure is now in a much better position. Today, we have highly differentiated mobile offerings, happy customers, and a truly mobile, global, SaaS-based offering we can be proud of. That, combined with better positioning and a solid go-to-market strategy, sets us up nicely for the future.Tom: Asure's solutions saved Scottish Water over $6.3M dollars per year in construction and operating costs. Which of Asure's solutions were utilized here? Was it costly for Scottish Water to implement your solutions?Mr: Goepel: Scottish Water is using our full AsureSpace solution with panels and kiosks, supported with consulting services and Professional Services. We do not publicize the value of our contracts, however, as you indicated, they received an annual savings of $6.3 million dollars in hard cost. While hard cost savings alone is certainly impressive, when you factor in increased productivity and less absenteeism, the savings is even more substantial.Tom, I'm glad you mentioned Scottish Water because our partnership is a great illustration of what we are seeing in the market place. This initiative started as a culture initiative led by their Vice President of Human Resources to better support the health and well-being of their employees by allowing them to work from home and reduce telecommuting times. But it quickly became apparent that in addition to improving the culture and increasing employee productivity, there was also a significant opportunity for cost savings. Their management team collaborated cross-functionally and with Asure Software to develop a solution that satisfied several key company initiatives and exceeded all expectations. A winning situation all-around.We are seeing several similar initiatives with other clients, both in Europe and the U.S. It's really exciting to be a part of these transformational changes.Tom: 2Q 2014 revenue was only up marginally, 4%, but your gross margin improved 7%. Do you see revenue as a picking up speed moving forward and do you think Asure's GM will stabilize at 80%? I ask as revenue has been somewhat stagnant the past few quarters.Mr: Goepel: We see revenue picking up moving forward and we will continue to look for operational efficiencies that will substantially improve gross margins.Tom: Also in the 2Q net income improved 103% and broke even. How did management achieve this much increased level of profitability?Mr: Goepel: We accomplished this by staying laser-focused on our key initiatives, improving operational efficiencies, automating manual process and top-grading our talent. And we will continue to make strides here well into 2015.Tom: How successful has Asure's new channel partner's portal been?Mr: Goepel: We are very pleased with the response to our channel partner portal. The portal is in it's early stages, and has just been released within the last 60 days. Our channel partners are critical to our success, and we are excited to be able to offer them tools and resources to position, sell and support Asure solutions.Tom: Asure is an SAAS provider, without the SAAS valuation. For example Asure's P/S is 1.17x while the industry average is 2.80X. With many of your direct competitors being private, it is hard to view Asure in comparison to them. Can you offer us details on Asure being an undervalued player?Mr: Goepel: We're focused on building a great company. We feel we're making the right actions in support of long-term client relationships. We happen to be in a technology sector that is enjoying nice valuations. As a small cap company sometimes valuations lag the market; we're confident as we execute our plan, valuations will rise to the level they are supposed to be.Tom: Asure acquired a few companies to support its product offerings. Is Asure done with product-enhancing acquisitions or do you see acquisitions possible in other areas of the business?Mr. Goepel: As a growth company, we are always looking for opportunities to supplement our offerings with products that are a strategic fit. We will remain focused on building, buying or partnering to round out a Cloud-based offering that brings best in class software solutions to our clients. This will likely include more acquisitions in the near future.Tom: Asure is targeting a plethora of opportunities looking ahead 2-5 years and 5-10 years from now. What is Asure targeting for the next two years' time and how will the company achieve its longer term goals?Mr. Goepel: Over the next few years, we are committed to three areas of focus: 1) Best-in-class SaaS solutions; 2) Solutions uniquely designed to support mobile workforces and work spaces, and 3) Offering global capabilities that scale for our clients. With a strong focus on these three areas, I am confident we will outperform our competitors and bring highly innovative products to the market that delight our clients and help them better run their business.Tom: Asure is leveraging three major trends in the marketplace to grow its market share. These are:At first glance these major trends seem to be above Asure's solutions. How specifically are Asure's solutions crafted to benefit and grow from these three major trends?Mr: Goepel: Great question. These trends inform our product strategy and we watch them carefully as we create our product vision and company initiatives. I'll respond to this by addressing each trend.Globalization is here for all companies, large or small. With very few exceptions (health care, municipalities), all business leaders will need to plan for global capabilities to successfully compete. With the proliferation of the Cloud, consumers and employees are no longer confined to geographical boundaries. Employee recruiting, retention and overall workforce management strategies must accommodate a global workforce. We have over 5,000 clients in 80 countries, so we already see the need for global solutions first-hand.Mobilization: As you mention in your statistic above, the mobile workforce and the support for personal devices is growing at a rapid rate. Our solutions are specifically designed to help organizations manage time, space and assets of their workforces, wherever they are. Whether your employees reside in one time zone or five, our solutions will help tell clients where, when and how people are working and help them optimize employee time and labor costs and real estate expenses.Technology: SaaS and the Cloud fuel our ability to offer global, mobile solitions. With anytime, anywhere access to data, the ability to service our mobile workforces and workspaces becomes a whole new ballgame.Tom: Within the TLM ecosystem, Asure is targeting the mid-sized business market and only has two key competitors. How is Asure differentiated from its various competitors? I see some not offering physical smart displays and others having no rival integrated hot-desk application. In other words, what is Asure's moat?Mr: Goepel: Our differentiation lies in product innovation and specifically with our mobile apps. With our GeoPunchâ„¢ time and labor management offering, we are the only software company that can offer mobile time and attendance with both facial recognition AND geo-location capabilities. We have also introduced Air Clocks, which brings a unique capability to track time for employees who are not at a desk, and may not have regular access to a mobile device. The value of our Air Clocks is particularly beneficial to field workers, a great example of this is in our work with PSSI.For workspace management, our NowSpaceâ„¢ mobile app offers the ability for employees to find, reserve and manage space. This is the first of its kind and we've received rave reviews. Our SmartTag offering is also highly unique in that our clients can track people, space and assets using a highly visual display. Being able to track these things in a variety of ways helps clients save millions of dollars simply by knowing when and where their physical assets are. As you mention, we do also have smart panels and kiosks, which supplement our SaaS-based software.Above all though, we are the only technology company in the world that can offer Cloud software solutions specifically designed to help manage people, time, space and assets together. We are very proud of this position.Tom: Asure has several new products out - NowSpace, AirClock, Smart Tag and GeoPunch. Can you walk us through the potential market opportunity for each of these products?Mr: Goepel: As mentioned your earlier statistic, 1.3 billion workers will be mobile by 2015. And business leaders are searching for ways to better manage their workforces and workspaces in a mobile world where alternative work arrangements are common place. Publicized numbers on workplace on ""mobile workforce and workplace market opportunity are not available, but based on our own predictions, we believe it to be in the range of $1 billion or greater across time and labor, mobile and space managementTom: Asure acquired Roomtag on August 11, 2014 and recently unveiled SmartTag. Did this acquisition allow you to offer SmartTag?Mr: Goepel: Yes, the Roomtag acquisition allowed us to introduce SmartTag to our prospects and clients. We've received great interest in this product and are excited about its potential within our product portfolio.Tom: What is the biggest risk to your business?Mr: Goepel: We are in a big market with big opportunity. Our biggest risk is time. We are laser focused on grabbing our share of the opportunity.Tom: Asure has a high debt level at just over $15M. Is this an overhang to obtain future financing if necessary?Mr: Goepel: Asure has roughly 6 million shares. We have not chosen to issue shares at this valuation.

The VTEL brand was well established and they had a rapport with resellers and a vested interest from Intel. This rosy outlook saw a volte-face from 1996 onwards as the business experienced low margins along with low growth. Initially price competition contributed to this woe but later Internet based technologies with enhanced flexibility proved overwhelming. The companyâ€™s financials prior to 2001 shows the unraveling of that business. The following summarizes the financials of the company after fiscal 2000:In 2001 the company divested its products and services business, their main revenue sources. They also announced the intention to drive revenue from its Intellectual Property (NYSE:IP) licensing business. As the table indicates, IP licensing helped the business stay afloat as they realized more than $160M in revenue during the period from 2001 thru 2006.In October 2003, they announced the acquisition of Network Simplicity Software. The Meeting Room Manager (MRM), Visual Asset Manager (NYSE:VAM), and certain derivative products of MRM together formed the NetSimplicity suite of products. With this new software business, they are looking to develop a profitable model outside of IP licensing. This is in effect an acknowledgement that the IP business is well past the prime. The iEmployee acquisition in 2007 is another significant step in this regard. Asure received a Notice Of Delisting from Nasdaq on 8/31/2007. This is the second time in the last two years that the company came under such scrutiny. The first of these was on 8/11/2006 and the company came into compliance when the stock stayed above $1 for an extended period of time between November 2006 and March 2007. Delisting is a risk that needs to be managed and can be achieved by: The company has achieved compliance as of Friday October 12 as the companyâ€™s shares closed above $1 for 10 continuous days between October 1 and 12. Even though the immediate threat of delisting is at bay, the risk remains as long as the share price hovers in the $1 vicinity.Asure has more than $6/share in tax-loss as a carry forward in its balance sheet. It has placed a valuation allowance against this and so this can potentially be viewed as a hidden asset from which value may be drawn under certain conditions. Acquiring companies with current earnings would work in its favor as that may allow Asure to tap into the tax-loss carryover. Further, this may allow the company to negotiate a better deal in an acquisition, as the companyâ€™s offer may be considered more lucrative when the tax benefit is taken into account. The balance sheet is strong with $35M in cash and with no debt Asure has the opportunity to grow the new business organically and through acquisitions. To become a leader in the SaaS workspace management space and realize sustainable growth, it will have to gain critical mass as quickly as possible. It is evident the company will be pursuing more acquisitions. The competitive landscape is busy with prominent players like Microsoft, SalesForce.com, etc along with specialized vendors such as ClickSoftware Technologies Limited (NASDAQ:CKSW).Globally, Software as a Service (SaaS) in the workspace management space is a segment experiencing tremendous growth. Asureâ€™s NetSimplicity and iEmployee product suites provide an automated, easy to use self-service unit, which showcases in-depth domain expertise in HR benefits, time tracking, scheduling, and asset management areas. The calculated focus on small to medium size businesses and divisions of large enterprises should allow the company to seed the market as it seeks to set the business up for growth. Here is a look at the Asureâ€™s NetSimplicity business:As of October 2006, Asure is lean with a head count of only 37 employees. The business started operating in the black and generated about 100K in cash during the last quarter. The expectation is to grow the revenue close to the $6M range in fiscal year 2008 per the 4th quarter earnings call. The iEmployee acquisition roughly doubled the business. The purchase price of $10.7 million at slightly more than twice the revenue is reasonable considering the business has 15% bottom line net income. The 8-K filing indicates the cash consideration was roughly $6.6M and the remaining portion was funded through roughly 5M shares of Asure stock. This brings the total outstanding shares to roughly 31M and cash tapers to about $30M. The combined business is expected to rake in recurring revenue in the 70% range. This welcome rain brings predictability to the companyâ€™s business moving forward. The initial expectation is that the combined business will generate cash in the 2nd half of next year but there the guidelines provided stops short. During the 4th quarter earnings call, it was indicated that such guidance would be forthcoming in the November timeframe. Asure is valued very low since it is unclear how the business will perform as time progresses. Once the business track for the upcoming year is in place much of the uncertainties surrounding revenue, profitability, and growth expectation should get cleared up. If the company can turn profitable it will get valued per the projected growth expectations. Until then, investors will stay in limbo taking solace that the valuation is cheapâ€¦Disclosure: We have a long position in Asure Software"
719431,21815,2012-07-13T11:08:53-04:00,,"Assure Software (NASDAQ:ASUR) is an interesting little company and has been on a tear lately. Its shares basically went from $4 to over $6 in five trading days, so time to see what's going on. First things first, what do they do?In the past it was known as Forgent, a company that was mainly licensing and was involved in what some argued were questionable patent practices (claiming to be the owner of the JPEG image compression standard, for instance), but these days seems well and truly behind us as the company changed focus, name, practices, and much of the board.Its main products are:Some basic metrics:Revenue is jumping this year, largely due to acquisitions:You might think it's only a small outfit, but it has some big clients:Growth opportunitiesThe nice thing about being small is that growth is easier. It's looking at the following areas:The company itself expects quite a lot. This year it expects EPS (without one-time items) to be between 24 and 32 cents, which gives it a P/E above 20, which isn't cheap. However, 2013 guidance (July 5 2012) is very bullish:If it comes anywhere near that, the shares could be in for a really decent run up. The shares have appreciated already quite nicely:Acquisitions The company's acquisition strategy is looking for companies with synergies and opportunities for cross-selling. While we're generally quite skeptical about acquisitions, we think in this case these cross-selling opportunities, considering the similarity of services that are provided, seem quite real. Some of the latest acquisitions:Conclusion It's a nice little growing company. If management's confidence in this year, and especially the next, materializes, the shares are undervalued. However, as you can see from the graph above, the shares have run up some 50% in less than a week. We would let this situation cool off a bit before we would consider buying.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

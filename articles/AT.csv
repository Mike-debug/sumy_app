I believe AT's net income number doesn't mean anything at all and is pretty confusing for most investors. Here is the way that I look at the numbers and some readers may very well disagree with my method but it's something that I think gives me a good indication of AT's real earnings situation.Although the EBITDA number gives us a pretty good indication of the financial earning power of AT, I think it is still lacking for a few reasons. Analyzing EBITDA, we see that there is a huge disparity between EBITDA and Net income for a couple of reasons. Firstly, depreciation is booked at about four times what it really is. The company disclosed that for 2014, it is expected to ""reinvest approximately $36 million to $40 million in 2014 in our portfolio in the form of project capital expenditures and major maintenance expenses."" The level of spending has been pretty consistent with this amount for the past periods and I consider it to be a more realistic approximation of the true depreciation. We have also had a massive amount of Goodwill impairment so far year to date. I don't believe such impairment should be taken too seriously in the earnings showing for a few reasons. Goodwill represents when management believes that the discounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the Goodwill. These results are based on extremely arbitrary assumptions such as the future price of gas and energy, discount rates, etc. If the future should reveal much lower earnings due to weak energy prices, then it will do so and we will see them as they come. By writing off future earnings with a one-off impairment, you are essentially double counting the decline in earnings in the future presently. Hence, it should not be taken at face value in the earnings statement.After deducting the interest expense, we then have earnings that accrue to equity holders and from that we will deduct the true depreciation to arrive at a number that I would call free cash to equity holders, which I've indicated as Earnings after CAPEX and maintenance expense. This amount can be used at the disposal of equity holders subject, of course, to the covenants in the bond and note indentures. They can be used to pay dividends, pay down debt or be reinvested in projects. From my showing, it appears that Q1 2014 and Q2 2014 have had a poor showing for free cash to equity holders and indeed, AT has fared pretty poorly in terms of financials but the Q3 2014 numbers have been quite positive. Q1 2013 and Q2 2013, the comparable numbers were much better but there was poor performance in that respect for Q3 2013.Finally, if we adjust for the amount of premium paid to redeem two series of notes in Q1 2014, we come up with a number that should best represent the operational performance of AT. We must adjust this because the one-time premium paid to redeem the notes is also booked to interest expenses and does not represent the actual interest incurred for the period. Although I will probably be faced with extreme criticisms for saying so, it appears that AT hasn't done too poorly operationally and we have even seen a small improvement year over year.Source: Author's own work based off of all of AT's 10-Qs and 10-K for fiscal 2013 and 2014Note: The 9 months figures represents the period Q1 2014 to Q3 2014 and the 12 months figures represents the period Q4 2013 to Q3 2014The current lull in energy prices may affect the Q4 2014 results in a negative manner but I think it probably isn't a cause for alarm. A lot of the contract prices are hedged through derivatives and Q4 tends to be a better year in general due to the colder weather. Other than that, the result so far for the year doesn't look all that terrible to me.On my financial basis, this company has earned roughly $78 million year over year, down from fiscal 2013 largely due to the redemption of notes at a premium. On an operational basis, however, the performance has increased to $118.6 million from $109.5 million in fiscal 2013. At the current market value of roughly $250 million for the common stock, this company looks downright appealing to me. Of course, if you look at the comments and articles previously written about this company, you will find all of the reasons for why you should not buy this stock. I highly recommend the reader to study and consider them as well."

The company continues its path to improve its balance sheet and expects to have its leverage down to 4.0x by the end of 2019. The company does not have a long average weighted PPA duration as most of its PPAs will expire in the next 5 years. In addition, its development and acquisition pipeline appears to be limited. Although its shares are trading at a significant discount to its peers, we think investors should wait on the sidelines.Data by YChartsAtlantic Power reported its Q1 2019 earnings with adjusted EBITDA of $53.7 million. This was slightly higher than last year’s $53.4 million. The increase was primarily driven by improved power generation as its aggregate power generation of 1,172 GWh in Q1 2019 was higher than Q1 2018’s 1,120.5 GWh.Source: Q1 2019 Investor PresentationSeveral PPAs will expire before 2021Atlantic Power has a portfolio of power plants with a net capacity of 1152MW (see table below). The average remaining power purchase agreement life is only about 6 years. This is low compared to its peers. For example, Northland Power’s (OTCPK:NPIFF) average PPA life is 11 years. As can be seen from the table below, 9 power plants will have their PPA expiring in the next 5 years. These 9 plants represent about 62% of its total capacity. Given the volatility in electricity prices and the competition from renewable energy sources, it is very possible that Atlantic Power may not be able to renew its PPA with favorable terms.Source: Q1 2019 Investor PresentationManagement is actively engaged in renewing its PPAs. They are currently in discussion to renew its PPA in Williams Lake. Although there are no updates at this moment, we do know from the Q&A in the latest conference call that its Williams Lake plant is well-maintained and there are no major overhauls expected. The short PPA life of 6 years and the lack of details on PPA renewals at the moment adds uncertainties to Atlantic Power’s outlook.Atlantic Power will acquire several projects in 2019Atlantic Power has a plan to increase its net capacity. It has reached an agreement to acquire two 20MW biomass facilities in South Carolina. While we are encouraged by its plan to improve its portfolio, the capacities to be acquired only represents a small portion of its total capacity (about 1,152MW). Management noted in its latest conference call that there is a potential acquisition of a hydro asset. However, details are not provided.Management is improving its balance sheetWith no dividend payment since 2016, Atlantic Power has been able to gradually improve its balance sheet by repaying its debts. The company also sold some non-core assets. As a result, its leverage ratio has gradually improved to 4.5x in Q1 2019 from 5.7x in 2015 (see chart below). In this time period, the company has reduced its debt from about $1 billion to $717 million. The company hopes to reduce this further to $647 million by the end of 2019. Its leverage ratio will hopefully fall to 4.0x.Source: Q1 2019 Investor PresentationLooking forward, Atlantic Power has a plan to further reduce its debt to $374 million by 2023. If executed successfully, the company will be able to significantly improve its balance sheet. We think dividend payment will also become possible.Source: Q1 2019 Investor PresentationAtlantic Power’s EV to EBITDA ratio of 6.2x is significantly below its peers. As can be seen from the chart below, Innergex (OTCPK:INGXF) trades at a ratio of nearly 17.0x and Brookfield Renewable (BEP) trades at a ratio of 14.9x. We believe Atlantic Power’s lower valuation is primarily due to limited growth opportunities and its inferior portfolio of power generation assets. Both Innergex and Brookfield Renewable have richer development pipelines in the next few years.Data by YChartsThere are several risks we believe investors need to be aware of:(1) Rising interest rate may increase interest expense for its future projects.(2) Rates of its PPA renewals may not be as favorable as before.(3) Since Atlantic Power has several power plants that are gas-fired, its EBITDA generated from these plants also depends on natural gas prices. A significant increase in natural gas prices (e.g. a harsh cold winter) may result in a lower EBITDA.(4) Hydrology does change every year, and this may impact its hydropower generation.Atlantic Power appears to be heading on the right path. The elimination of the dividend back in 2016 has helped it to improve its balance sheet and reduce its debt. While its stock is trading at an attractive valuation, we think this is warranted because of its inferior assets and its low average PPA duration of 6 years. Therefore, we think investors should remain on the sidelines."
2671475,38231,2014-11-11T16:55:17-05:00,Atlantic Power posts yet another poor quarter.Free cash flow remains well below the dividend.I would avoid Atlantic Power.,"It is getting extremely hard to imagine a world in which Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT) can turn things around. The company has been chronically mismanaged for quite some time. As a result, Atlantic Power has been forced to lower its dividend twice since early 2013, from an annual payout of $1.15 per share to the current $0.12 per share, a 90% decline. Indeed, the share price has reflected this change, down 80% since that time period.AT data by YChartsQ3 2014 OverviewUnfortunately for Atlantic Power longs, the company posted yet another weak quarter for Q3 2014. Project revenues were down 2% to $138.3 million, compared to $140 million last year. Project Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, was $72.2 million, down from $75 million last year. Atlantic Power's projected loss for the quarter was $68.6 million, compared to a small profit of $4.4 million last year. When adding back administrative, income tax, and other expenses, Atlantic Power posted a net loss of $91.1 million from continuing operations, compared to $40.6 million last year. On an earnings per share basis, Atlantic Power's net loss was $0.74, compared to a net loss of $0.34 last year.Atlantic Power's FCF remains impairedWhile large, the GAAP net loss was not Atlantic Power's most pressing concern. For large utilities, cash is king. However, even on this front Atlantic Power failed to deliver. As shown, the company only posted $12.6 million in positive FCF for the quarter, down 67% from $38.6 million last year. YTD, Atlantic Power has seen negative $48.4 million in FCF, compared to $113 million last year. This large drop in FCF is mostly a result of 1% mandatory amortization payments on Atlantic Power's term loans and a 50% cash sweep.The company also revised its ""adjusted"" FCF guidance downwards, to a range of $0 to $10, compared to the previous range of $0 to $25 million, reflecting severance charges associated with management changes. It is worth mentioning that Atlantic Power's revised FCF range excludes $49 million related to debt refinancing and a $8.1 million debt repayment.ConclusionOverall, Atlantic Power remains a mess of a stock. The company is seeing declines in nearly all of its crucial metrics, most importantly FCF. Also note that Atlantic Power is still technically not in compliance with certain loan covenants (9.0% senior unsecured notes and Piedmont project debt), restricting some use of intercompany cash.Do note that even at the top end of its revised FCF range, Atlantic Power's FCF still does not cover its annual dividend payments of around $13 million per year. The dividend, even at the current level, remains above Atlantic Power's FCF generation and thus is unsustainable. While the company is projecting FCF to increase in 2015, it failed to provide specific guidance, only mentioning that the dividend is supported by ""anticipated Free Cash Flow generation."" Needless to say, I remain wary of Atlantic Power's guidance given its past history.Disclaimer: The opinions in this article are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned.

4010780,102303,2016-10-07T08:46:03-04:00,Utility Atlantic Power Corporation looks bad on the surface but a turnaround is in progress.The new CEO is one of the most shareholders friendly CEO I have ever seen.Insiders are buying and holding.Stock should trade at over 7$/share.,"Source : Flickr.Looking at the surface, Atlantic Power Corporation (NYSE:AT), an independent power producer with gross electric generation capacity of 1478 MW, looks like an investment coming directly from the dumpster: negative ROIC, very high financial leverage, not much prospect for external growth and share value that has dropped from over 12$ in 2012 to around 2.50$ right now. Add the fact that the company has had negative income for years, and I can already hear you saying: ""I wouldn't touch this thing with a ten fool pole.""And you'd be wrong.There is much to like in this company if we dig a bit.ManagementFirst things first: management. Been a small private investor means I have to be humble: I can't know everything. I have to buy stocks like I'd be buying a piece of a business run by a neighbor. I have to trust the management team. After nearly destroying the company with over leverage, much of the board have been replaced after an activist from Mangrove Partners filed in. The old management wasn't to be trusted and my thesis is that this is not the case with the new one.The new CEO, James J. Moore, is a gift from Heaven. After been highly successful as Chairman of energy and power practice for Diamond Castle Holdings from 2008 to 2015, he joined AT last year. You have to read his Report to Shareholders from AT's last Annual Report. This is one of the best letters I have read. His approach is based on Thorndike's wonderful book: The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success. He doesn't fear to sell assets. He doesn't need to keep a dividend. He said he would consider selling the company if a good offer is on the table. His goal is to increase the per share value of the company, period.In the last two years, AT sold the Wind Business for 13 times the cash flow and used the money to pay off debt. It reduced leverage ratio from 8.9 to 5.6. It redeemed all the 2017 convertible debentures and repurchased much of 2019 convertibles, hence making a financial crisis highly unlikely. It reduced overhead costs by 30%. It worked on PPA extensions. It cut the dividend. It bought back shares when management considered they were under the company's intrinsic value. It obtained Credit rating upgrades.Moore knows where he is going.And the insiders believe in the Turnaround.Insider buyingInsiders sell for many reasons, but they buy for only one: they believe the shares are undervalued.Source: Finviz.When I am looking at a turnaround story for a small to micro cap stock, I want to see insiders buying and holding the stock. Since they know more than I know, I like it when I see they accumulate rather than sell their stocks. It shows they have confidence in what is going on and they don't fear to put their money in play.They recognize their stock is cheap and that's why there are buying it.ValuationSource: personal spreadsheet.I built this very simple three years EBITDA model and decided to use the GAAP earnings and not the ""Project Adjusted EBITDA"" in the company documentation. This non-GAAP data includes derivatives and since I am not that comfortable with those, I decided to use the GAAP numbers. Better to stay inside one own circle of competence, as Buffett says. Since ""Project Adjusted EBITDA"" is much higher than the numbers in my model, results could be even better than the numbers shown here.I decided to use an average EBITDA margin for the last ten years and to give credit to the new CEO for the margins improvement. In my opinion, margins shouldn't go below where there are right now and should lean toward the mean. As a peer group, I used all the utilities trading in the US.As you can see, for 2019, if the company can trade roughly at the same EV/EBITDA as its peer group, share price should get to 7.31$, which is a 44% CAGR. (I use the same three years minimum 20% CAGR target that Samir Patel, from Askeladden Capital Management, uses.) With a more competent board dedicated to reduce its leverage to 4 and under, with internal optimization and low-capital intensive investments, I believe this is a possible scenario. As soon as leverage gets down, market should pay a higher EV/EBITDA ratio.Deleveraging is a long process, but such a turnaround has a high chance of working when it's done by a competent board.Insiders see the progress and know what is going on. Buy with them, and hold for the long run. Patient investors should be rewarded."

The current share price of $2.40 gives AT little credit for slashing their debt in half, streamlining the asset base, and dramatically cutting back corporate overhead. Management and insiders are aggressively buying back stock at current levels, they are bigger believers in the company's future than consensus in the public market.Consistent with insider sentiment, I recommend purchasing AT stock today. AT stock offers 100% upside, with a target price of $5 based on 8x 2017 EBITDA.Company DescriptionAT owns and operates 23 power plants in the US and 2 in Canada. AT sells electricity to utilities and commercial customers primarily under long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).ATs power plants can generate a combined capacity of 2,138 megawatts, of which AT owns 1,500 MW. 19 of ATs generation assets are currently operational as of 4Q16, generating 1,975 MW, of which AT owns 1,337 MW. AT mothballed 4 generation assets in Ontario, of which 1 will come online between November 2017 and June 2019.Thesis and Catalyst For Atlantic Power CorporationAT is an attractively valued IPP that has been fighting tooth and nail to survive since 2013 and has finally turned the corner. AT shares collapsed in early 2013 when Ontario started going green. With a fleet of natural gas plants financed by over $2 billion of debt, PPAs not getting renewed was a scary reality. Shares went into death spiral from over $13 in 1Q13 to $1.57 in 4Q15. During this period, AT hired a shareholder friendly CEO with a private equity background, James Moore, who spent the past 2 years nursing the company on life support.After 2 long years of aggressive debt paydown and streamlining, AT cut their debts in half to $1 billion and expects to earn $225-240 million in project EBITDA. Since 2013, AT has cut corporate overhead in half from $54 million to $23 million in 2016, via layoffs and relocation of their HQ from downtown Boston to the suburbs of Dedham, MA. During the same period, AT has also created $12 million in annual savings at the fleet level. With $533 million in debt paydown over the past 2 years, cash interest payments were reduced from $100 million in 2015 to $71 million in 2016. 2017 free cash flow will also benefit from $26 million in savings from 2 above market gas contracts expiring.AT is not a one trick pony. Deleveraging has also come from asset sales, with management divesting non-core assets. AT sold wind assets in 2015 for $350 million, and is currently evaluating additional asset sales, with one prospect in Piedmont. Management recently highlighted the growing disparity in IPP public valuations versus private valuations for underlying IPP assets. IPP assets with long dated PPAs are trading at high valuations because of the persistent low interest rate environment.While fundamentals have turned positive, shares are still trading at distressed levels. AT expects to generate $104-119 million* of free cash flow in 2017 while trading at a market cap of $275 million. (*Free cash flow based on guidance, cash flows from operating (CFO) between $130-145 million, capex of $5 million, preferred dividends of $9 million and debt amortization of $12 million.) With $50 million of discretionary cash on hand and $104-119 million in 2017 free cash flow, management plans to reduce debt in 2017 by another $150 million. By 2020, management expects to pay down $400 million of debt from operating cash flow, which is 45% more than the current market cap and 40% of current debt. At 6%, $400 million of debt reduction would reduce annual interest expense by an estimated $24 million.After 2 years on life support, AT still isn't exactly healthy but the company can breathe again. AT still faces another 9 PPA expirations in the next 5 years, representing a quarter of megawatts and worst case scenario up to $60 million of project EBITDA. In spite of these issues, management and insiders are very bullish on the firm's prospects. Over the past 2 years, the current CEO bought 350,000 shares at $2.47 and insiders bought another 1.4 million shares at $2.3. In 2016, the company repurchased 7% of shares at $2.42 and plans to repurchase another 10% of shares in 2017.ValuationBased on FY17 Adjusted of EBITDA $215*Base Case: 7x = $3.25 / share**Bull Case: 8x = $5.13 / share***2017 Adj EBITDA = Project EBITDA Guidance of 225-240M less overhead**As of 4Q16 Debt $997M, Preferred $221M, Cash $86M, 114.65M SharesVariant ViewFinancial RiskAT only recently ran out of the leverage hamster wheel. Management is still racing against upcoming PPA expirations, with the gas pedal for deleveraging mashed into the floorboard. Management needs to continue slashing leverage ahead of likely declines in EBITDA to keep leverage ratios and interest coverage manageable.As of December 2016, the company was 5.6x levered on a trailing basis. Management expects to be <4x levered by 2020. Management is very transparent noting that 30% of project EBITDA faces renewal risk, which is offset by ATs commitment to reducing debt 40% by 2020.Industry RiskPower generation is a tough business, it is capital-intensive, cyclical, commodity-priced and heavily government-regulated. The combination of low interest rates with retirements of nuclear and coal power plants led to an overbuild of new power sources. PPA renewals for AT and other fossil fuel IPPs have been difficult with ongoing shift in public preference towards renewable energy.Most North American households have not benefited from declines in wholesale power prices plaguing companies like AT. Household power prices have been flat while wholesale power prices declined up to 40% over the past few years. In response, management has been shifting focus in their growth efforts, targeting industrial markets who need reliable cheap energy.ConclusionAT management has done an impressive job keeping the company alive in a tough operating environment. By cutting both debt and overhead in half over a few short years, AT is now generating strong free cash flow which is being deployed into additional deleveraging. ATs operational improvements and deleveraging more than offset risks arising from upcoming PPA expirations.Management's commitment to running a lean company shows no signs of slack, yet shares are still depressed. Insiders are buyers of AT stock, and so am I. I expect shares to double to $5 over the year, as management executes on another 15% of debt reduction.Sources: FY16 commentary and FY16 presentation."
2582265,38231,2014-10-22T05:42:40-04:00,"Atlantic Power declined nearly 10% after responding to the Clinton Group letter.
        Shares of the company had spiked 25% higher after the initial Reuters report.
        In the letter, the Clinton Group expressed confidence that bids for the company from its strategic review came in for as much as $4 per share.
        However, this appears to not be the case, with Atlantic Power stating that no offers came in above $3.04 per share.
        I believe Atlantic Power’s stock has 13% downside to $2.00 per share.","Late last week, Atlantic Power's (NYSE:AT) stock staged a remarkable 25% recovery. The main factor to this was a letter from the Clinton Group which called for the company to restart the sale process it abandoned last month after completing its strategic review.As I noted at the time, Atlantic Power released a series of very bad news, including slashing its dividend 70% to 12 cents per year, the stepping down of its long-time CEO and President Barry Welch, and announcing that it would NOT be selling itself or merging with another company as these actions were not deemed in the ""best interest"" of the company or its shareholders.The Clinton Group appeared to be much more bullish than even the company itself. The firm, in its letter, suggested that the company reinstate its strategic review. Furthermore, the firm was confident that bids for Atlantic Power came in at least at $4 per share.However, Atlantic Power has pretty much crushed these hopes. In a recent SEC 8-k filing, the company commented on the Clinton Group letter. Atlantic Power noted that the speculation regarding a $4 per share bid was not consistent with the actual results of the strategic review.Indeed, the company clarified that it did not receive any offers that could be consummated at or above the closing share price of $3.04 on May 1, 2014, the day prior to press rumors concerning a possible sale or merger. Atlantic Power noted that it believes that the interests of the it and its stakeholders are best served by continuing to operate as an independent company, while executing its business planTo put this into English, no one wanted to buyout Atlantic Power even at $3 per share. This is not at all surprising given the overburdened balance sheet and future large debt obligations. Furthermore, Atlantic Power's current power purchase agreements are likely to rest lower, especially if natural gas prices remain low.ConclusionNeedless to say, this news is a negative event for the stock. However, despite the nearly 10% decline on Monday, I believe Atlantic Power could fall even lower.Before the initial news broke, the stock was trading for as low as $2.00 per share. If it were to retreat back to this level, this implies another $0.30 drop, or 13% downside from current prices.AT data by YChartsDisclaimer: The opinions in this article are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned.

2563995,69295,2014-10-15T12:17:01-04:00,"AT has a very hard to value portfolio of assets due to the advanced tax structures and evolving legal environment.
        Management tried to provide a measuring stick for value by implementing a large dividend. Investors became too dependent on this fabricated measuring stick.
        AT's recent dividend cut has caused investors to panic and the difficulty in gauging the fair value of their assets is an opportunity for the enterprising investor.
        Investors should gain a more reasonable view of the company's prospects and safety by following certain interest coverage ratios and the total debt amount rather than the dividend.","Atlantic Power Corporation (NYSE:AT) is a business that owns and acquires power generation assets in the U.S. and Canada when looked at from face value. However, their assets are mostly in the renewable or cleaner energy sector which makes their business more complicated than it would first appear. AT owns and operates a portfolio of hydro, biomass, natural gas and wind power generating facilities. They then sell the power they generate to other large commercial players such as quasi government entities and large industrial companies in the form of long-term power purchase agreements or PPAs for short. AT has a net generation capacity of about 2,026 MW and its projects are located mainly in California, the U.S. Mid-Atlantic, New York and the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia. You will note that AT tends to gather around states and provinces that are more progressive in terms of renewable or cleaner energy legislation. This is because without specific tax and other incentives, it would be financially onerous to operate some of these renewable assets such as wind power. Furthermore, it would be difficult to get the financing available to build some of these projects due to their unprofitable nature.While the company certainly appears to be a simple energy generating industrial company, I believe there are far more dynamics at play with this company's strategy than most others in the similar field for several reasons. Firstly, the renewable sector, if left to stand on its own, would probably not be standing very well at all. An understanding of the legislative landscape is key to the company's growth. Traditional supply and demand is the most vital consideration of course, but the tax incentives are almost equally important in determining how and if an investment is made. Take the example of tax equity investments in the U.S. It provides a 30% investment tax credit available for solar through 2016 and for wind through 2012. For wind projects, if you decide to opt out of the ITC, you can receive a 2.2 cent production tax credit. Another great thing is that there is an accelerated depreciation feature that can be used to offset taxable income from other sources. Due to the fact that a lot of these renewable projects cannot fully use these tax benefits for their own operations, they must find tax equity partners who can use it to their full benefit. This has been a method for encouraging investments in the renewable sector. Therefore, it is likely that AT will at times acquire certain projects although they are not the best investments on a stand-alone basis. If they are able to take advantage of certain tax benefits that comes with the project by combining it with more profitable ones, it can create extra value for shareholders.The churning of assetsYou will note that the company has heavy turnover within their portfolio of power generation assets. This is important to their strategy. Government policy on renewable energy will evolve and change over time. Thus, the company of course sees the need to enter into markets where policies are friendly and profits can be made. As this is a fairly new industry, policies and rules governing it will continue to change for better or for worse from the perspective of investors. Another reason for the heavy turnover is the fact that certain tax incentives only last for a set period of time. Accelerated depreciation is an ever decelerating tax benefit. Thus the net benefits of making an investment can be realized in a rather short period of time for certain assets they acquire.After the recent downturn in the price of stocks, many have blamed the fact that the board consists of mainly lawyers. However, due to the added importance of understanding the legal and tax implications of certain projects as well as having the ability to adapt to an evolving government policy landscape throughout North America, I think it is important to have a strong team of lawyers and tax experts close by.Difficult to value portfolio creates opportunity when dividend goes awayIt would take a truly dedicated effort for anyone or any team for that matter to give a meaningful valuation of the company. The assets are constantly shifting due to the portfolio turnover and the specific tax knowledge required to get a real sense of intrinsic value truly makes it prohibitive for the average investor to gauge an accurate value for the bundle of assets. Yet, the average investor is just what this industry needs to finance their projects. What better way to provide that measuring stick for value than to pay out a dividend? Few analysts have managed to say anything very insightful or meaningful beyond what they can see being paid out for dividends. Without the dividend, the market would be a bit lost as to what they think the worth of the company should be, and I think therein lies the opportunity for a truly enterprising investor. Recent dividend cuts have led to the annihilation of AT's share price and wild speculation over its status as a going concern. I could be wrong, but I daresay that the situation might not be so bad. Here are the reasons for why I think so.1. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2013 was a mere $26.2 million on a consolidated basis. The expected expenditures for fiscal 2014 is supposed to be roughly $36 to $40 million. I think this is more in line with what's actually required to keep the business going. The capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 and 2011 were $468.1 million and $115.1 million respectively. These numbers are far out of line with what's representative of the cost required to keep the business going, but rather contains the massive costs involved in asset acquisition. Therefore, the massive depreciation amount for 2013 of $167.1 million and all prior years are grossly over the amount actually required to keep the businesses going under normal circumstances. The depreciation numbers are likely to be influenced by the accelerated depreciation used for tax purposes. Thus, a more useful number to look at is EBITDA rather than the ugly net income shown each year. It is interesting how nobody seems to care much for it when dividends are flowing freely, but when it stops, people suddenly become terrified of net income losses.2. In order to measure AT's ability to make its interest payments and hence the safety of the common equity, I think a fair assessment can be made with the Project Adjusted EBITDA. It is defined as project income (loss) plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (including non-cash impairment charges) and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. The Project Adjusted EBITDA for years 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 were $270.5 m, $227.6 m, $86.8 m, $118.4 m, and $105.2 m respectively. If we average out the stock's Project Adjusted EBITDA to interest expense multiple for the fat dividend years of 2012 to 2010, we have an average multiple of 2.71. This is much higher than the 2013 1.95 multiple. If we look at normal EBITDA compared to interest expense, we see that the three year average multiple between 2012 and 2010 were 1.83 while the same multiple for the current 2013 year is 2.00, a surprising improvement. I would watch these two multiples carefully as well as their actions on reducing debt. If the company is determined to improve these two multiples, they must give up on the previously very high dividend for the time being.ConclusionGauge the condition of the company with different measures of interest coverage such as the ones I have used above and not with the payment of the dividend. Closely monitor the trend in such ratios as well as the total reduction of debt in the coming quarters. If such ratios do improve in a meaningful way whilst stock prices remain very low or fall further, entering a position could give the chance for a rewarding payoff."
3161976,41741,2015-05-08T18:00:32-04:00,"AT now has two activists pushing for a potential sale of the company.
        Or in the least, more asset sales.
        Which comes as it’ll be tough to be profitable as a standalone company.","Power Generation company Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT) was already facing calls to sell itself from the Clinton Group when private equity firm Mangrove Partners announced an active stake earlier this month. Mangrove is pushing the company to commit to a large buyback program, and may also push for seats on the board, as well as a sale.Its power business: Atlantic Power generated roughly 2,000 MW of power last year from power plants and wind farms throughout the U.S. and Canada. 53% of its production capability came from natural gas and 26% from wind, with biomass, coal, and hydro making up the rest.Rising fuel input costs have hamstrung AT, as its operating cash flows have decreased from $167 million to $65 million between 2012 and 2014. This in turn led to a significant dividend cut in early 2013 that sent the stock spiraling down from around $15/share down to its current level between $3 and $4/share.As part of an attempt to deleverage somewhat-AT has $1.4 billion in long-term debt vs. a market cap of $400 million-the company sold its portfolio of wind assets for $350 million in April. This means its portfolio is now heavily tilted towards natural gas.The hedge fund pressure: AT conducted a strategic review last fall and the board decided that a sale was not in the best interest of the company. Shortly after the announcement, the Clinton Group, owning up around 2% o the company, penned a public letter to the board pushing for a sale.Even though the Board denied receiving any offers above its market price, Clinton Group stated their belief that the company could complete a deal at above $4/share, which would be a roughly 25% premium to the current valuation. Clinton Group also expressed doubt that the company could be profitable as an independent entity:""The ""leaders"" of this company cannot seem to understand that the concept of public independent, non-regulated power companies does not work. Time and time again, debt-laden companies that attempt to sell power on the wholesale market or to regulated utilities have imploded.""More recently, Tampa-based private equity firm Mangrove Partners announced an active stake with 7.5% ownership. Mangrove wants most of the proceeds from the sale of AT's wind projects to be returned to shareholders in the form of a $300 million special dividend. Mangrove has been discussing board representation, with the ultimate goal being to convince the company to either break up or sell itself.Where we stand: Contrarian investors jumped aboard AT when it dropped from $15 to $5/share in 2013, only to watch the company continue to slide. With analysts projecting declining revenues and continued losses over the coming years, it's hard to see a great deal of upside for the stock going forward.With a negative tangible book value and over $1.4 billion in long-term debt, the company is not exactly an enticing prospect for acquirers either. The Board's denial that it received any offers above the market price last fall stands in stark contrast to the optimism expressed by Mangrove Partners and Clinton Group.Even if offers do materialize at the levels anticipated by these investors, the upside is not that high, only ~25%. Meanwhile, there's a big potential downside if cash flows continue to decline at the same level. Right now, AT looks like a high risk, low reward proposition for investors."
2498385,44981,2014-09-16T09:46:50-04:00,The company today announced another dividend cut which brings down its annual dividend substantially.Atlantic Power continues to face issues regarding its cash flows.Another dividend cut has altered our opinion and investors might need to look elsewhere for growth and income.,"Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT) today announced the results of its strategic review, and the company has come up with some interesting decisions, which will have a deep impact on the current shareholders and the prospective shareholders. According to the announcement, the management has decided to not pursue the sale or merger of its business as it believes the current situation will not result in a strategic decision such as a merger or sale of the business in the best interest of its shareholders. The stock of the company has lost substantial value over the last year and the company has been making efforts to get its house in order and enhance its cash flows; however, it looks like the things are not getting better for Atlantic Power.One of the main reasons behind the loss in the stock price during the last year was the dividend cut. Atlantic Power expected to have better operations and cash flows for future growth projects and the company wanted to preserve its free cash flows. However, the situation has not improved and the company has slashed its dividends further - Atlantic Power has cut its annual dividend from Cdn$0.40 [$0.36] per share to Cdn$0.12 [$0.11] per share. Furthermore, the company has also changed the dividend payment from a monthly structure to quarterly structure. Another dividend cut shows that the cash flows have not improved and the company is still facing troubles in raising cash for growth projects as well as liquidity needs.We were quite optimistic about the prospects of the company, as we believed that the business model of the company meant stable revenues. Furthermore, we believed that Atlantic Power will be able to tackle the decline in its cash flows and the stock price presented a good entry point. However, as the company has slashed its dividends by a big margin, we believe the stock price will fall further and Atlantic power may face problems ahead. First dividend cut usually shows a change in the strategy and management's willingness to improve cash position internally in order to achieve growth. However, second dividend cut usually signals that the management has been unable to stop the decline. We believe long-term investors might want to look elsewhere for income and growth purposes and leave Atlantic Power to speculators and traders as it will become even more volatile."
2499315,38231,2014-09-16T14:04:15-04:00,Atlantic Power decides against the selling or merging of the company.Atlantic Power has also lowered its dividend 70% to 12 cents per year.The company also announces that long-time CEO and President Berry Welch has stepped down.These are all a result of the completion of Atlantic Power’s strategic review.Shares are down 33% as of this writing.,"Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT) has just announced the long-awaited results of its strategic review. To put it mildly, the company disappointed on various fronts. The stock is getting wrecked by the market, down over 33% as of this writing on very high volume.First, Atlantic Power has announced that it will NOT be selling itself or merging with another company as these actions are not in the ""best interest"" of the company or stakeholders.I have another interpretation of this matter. Reading between the lines, considering that the company had hired Goldman Sachs and other financial advisors at likely great cost, it seems as if Atlantic Power simply could not find a buyer.This seems like a rather obvious result given that Atlantic Power has a huge mountain of high yield debt, totaling over $1.4 billion as of June 30, compared to its market cap of $450 million (now around $300 million).Second, Atlantic Power has announced that its long-time CEO and President Barry Welch will be stepping down effective immediately. This came following a ""mutual agreement"". The interim replacement for both positions will be Director Ken Hartwick, former CEO for Just Energy (NYSE:JE). Atlantic Power has now commenced its search for a permanent replacement.That Mr. Welch is leaving Atlantic Power is hardly surprising. Under his watch, the stock price has been reduced by 80%, with much of this decline coming over the past 18 months.Lastly, Atlantic Power has decided to lower its dividend. The new dividend rate will be at CDN$0.12 per share, down 70% from its the previous level of CDN$0.40 per share.In addition, Atlantic Power will no longer be paying monthly dividends. Instead, Atlantic Power will be moving over to a quarterly dividend schedule at a rate of CDN$0.03. The last monthly payout will be the previously declared August dividend for CDN$0.03333 which will be paid on September 30, 2014.That Atlantic Power is lowering its dividend cannot come as a surprise for those following the stock. As I noted in an earlier article (locked to the SA Pro platform), a dividend cut was very likely given Atlantic Power own guidance.In order to pay down older debt due this year, 2015, and 2017, Atlantic Power basically agreed to extremely harsh terms under a new $600 million senior secured term loan facility. Among the terms included are 50% excess cash flow ""sweeps"" and other concessions.As a result of the lower dividend, Atlantic Power will save roughly $30 million per year. The company plans to use these funds ""optimization investments in its existing projects that are expected to produce attractive returns."" The company is looking to cut costs, especially in development and other corporate expenses.Furthermore, Atlantic Power is looking to extend the expiration dates for several power purchase agreements expiring in 2018 as well as ""pursue external growth opportunities with accretive returns, to the extent available."" This may include asset sales and or joint ventures.ConclusionAtlantic Power pretty much sealed its fate with this recent dividend cut and related events. Furthermore, due to the ""poison pill"" provision adopted last year, I see little chance of an activist investor stepping in. I would avoid the stock even at the current depressed prices.Disclaimer: The opinions in this article are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned.

2461125,62373,2014-08-30T03:06:49-04:00,The company’s Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) have a specific expiration date and fixed payment stream which ensures the security and stability of the cash flows without facing any commodity risk.Management clearly stated in the annual report that the future dividends are not guaranteed.Major debt refinancing in 2013 has reduced the company’s interest costs and has increased its financial flexibility.Natural gas is the major power generation fuel used by the company. Its prices are continuously rising causing the company’s costs to increase.The company’s legal proceedings are shattering investors’ confidence.,"Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, Atlantic Power Corporation (NYSE:AT) is engaged in power generation and infrastructure activities. With a number of power generation assets, the company operates about twenty-eight power projects across eleven states in the United States and two provinces in Canada. These projects produce and sell electricity to utilities and many large commercial consumers under Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). By the end of December 2013 (Subscription Required), Atlantic Power Corporation's projects had the electric power generation capacity of about 2,948 megawatts and the company had a collective ownership of nearly 2,020 megawatts.Investors with short-term investment perspectives who are seeking smooth payoffs should invest in utilities. Investing in utilities like power generation companies can assure stable dividends and help to meet investors' objectives, as people will use energy and electricity no matter the economic conditions. However, Atlantic Power Corporation does not seem to be benefiting from this as its performance has been constantly falling over the past few years. The year 2013 was one of the worst financial years the company witnessed. Atlantic Power Corporation reported a weak financial performance and heavy debt liabilities. The stock witnessed a huge drop of about 70% in its value. It fell from $11.8 at the start of the year to $3.52 by the end of 2013.The graph below shows the company's accumulative total shareholder return from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2013, along with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 and S&P/TSX. Financial year 2013 disappointed investors as the company reduced the dividend payout ratio from 100% in 2012 to only 53%. A major decline in dividends can be seen in the year 2013.Source: SEC Filings Form 10KHowever, the corporation is working on its weaknesses and the announcement of the first quarter of 2014's results played an important role in regaining investors' lost confidence.The stock price is gradually increasing and has jumped by 5% to 6% since the start of 2014. Take a look at the stock's performance since the year started below.Source: FinvizThe Safer Side Of The Investment:Let's have a look at the factors that make Atlantic Power Corporation a safe investment:Stable Cash Flows: Atlantic Power Corporation generates stable revenues based on the contracts it holds with its customers. The Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) have a specific expiration date and fixed payment stream that ensure the security and stability of the cash flows without commodity risk.As shown below, except for the projects Selkirk and Tunis expiring in the year 2014, no Power Purchase Agreement is expiring before 2017. So even if the market conditions are restless, it won't affect Atlantic Power's business activities before 2017; this will ensure a reliable and steady revenue stream. This also ensures the stability of dividends for investors in the long term.Source: AT Investor's PresentationClean Power Generation Assets: The nuclear and coal fired power plants that were historically used to generate electricity are not environmentally friendly and are perpetuating global warming. These power generation methods face legal pressures. Moreover, the regulations concerning emission and air pollution are increasing. These regulations can significantly affect the business' activities, but this is surely not a problem for Atlantic Power as the company does not solely rely on these methods. About 95% of Atlantic Power's power generation is clean power. The company maintains a diversified portfolio of clean power generating assets that focus on wind, natural gas, hydroelectricity, biomass, and other methods. The company has attained these methods through both organic and inorganic growth, including acquisitions made in North America.Significant Improvement In Debt Position: A major refinancing activity took place in 2013 which helped the company to reduce its major debt liabilities that occurred in the recent term. The company paid back debt totaling $415 million that was maturing throughout 2014-2017. The company has redeemed its $140 million 9% senior notes that was originally due in 2018. Atlantic Power Corporation extended its revolving facility from $150 million maturing in March 2015 to $210 million that will now be maturing in 2018. This refinancing activity has helped to reduce Atlantic Power's interest expenses and also rebuilt its financial position.If we look at the figure below, we see that the debts are not maturing earlier than 2017. This assures the financial stability of the company and its dividends in the long term.Source: AT Investor's PresentationImproving Performance: Atlantic Power Corporation's financial performance is gradually improving. If we look at the projects revenues for 2013, it becomes evident that they have increased from $440.4 million in the year 2012 to $551.7 million. This reflects an increase of about 25%. Moreover, the net income from the projects has moved from a net loss of $29.4 million in the year 2012 to $64.3 million in the financial year 2013. This shows a huge increase of about 319%.The cash flow position is also improving. The cash flows from operating activities increased from $55.9 million in 2011 to about $152.4 million in 2013, reflecting an increase of approximately 170%. These improvements show that the company is committed to overcoming its weaknesses.Furthermore, the company's management expects improved earnings by the end of this year. The EBITDA guidance for 2014 is shown below.Source: AT Investor's PresentationStabilized Dividends: Though the company had a large dividend cut in 2013 which disappointed the shareholders, in the last few quarters the company has finally started working on pleasing its investors. The company maintains a sustainable dividend yield of about 9.32% compared to the sector's dividend yield of only 3.24%. Moreover, the company recently announced a monthly dividend of about $0.0305 per share to be paid on September 30th. The company has an annual dividend of about $0.366 per share and a dividend yield of 9.54%. The announcement reflects Atlantic Power Corporation's commitment to its shareholders.The Risky Side Of The Investment:Besides the strengths of Atlantic Power Corporation discussed above there are many other things that an investor should know before investing. The points discussed below surely make Atlantic Power Corporation a risky investment.Rising Prices Of Natural Gas: Natural gas is the major power generation fuel used by the company. It represents about 53% of the total fuel used by Atlantic Power in its energy generation activities.Source: AT SEC Filings Form - 10KNatural gas prices have been rising since the start of the year and are expected to increase further. Though the company has executed natural gas swap contracts to avoid the risks related to the volatility in its prices, natural gas can affect the company's profits if the prices move in an unpredictable manner.Legal Issues: In 2013, Atlantic Power faced many legal proceedings. Five purported securities fraud class action complaints were made against the company by its investors. The complaints state that Atlantic Power made materially false and misleading statements about common stock dividends that have artificially inflated the stock prices.Moreover, in 2011, the IRS began an investigation of the company's federal income tax returns for 2007 and 2009. These legal actions have broken investors' confidence in the company and will cause the share price to fall.Dividends May Be At Risk: Though the company is currently paying smooth dividends, it is not guaranteed in the future. The management states in the Form 10K:This statement makes short-term investors rethink investing in the company, as their goal of earning dividends may not be achieved in the future.Cash Flows May Not Remain Stable: Although the company has entered Power Purchasing Contracts, this does not guarantee stable revenues over a longer period of time. As soon as the contracts expire, the guarantee also disappears unless new contracts are negotiated with favorable prices."
2504325,38231,2014-09-18T09:06:27-04:00,Atlantic Power may face a credit rating downgrade.The stock is down over 10% as of this writing.I remain extremely bearish Atlantic Power due to its worsening fundamentals.,"Things really have gone from bad to worse for Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT). The stock fell over 30% on Tuesday as a result of the completion of its long-awaited strategic review. As I noted in my earlier article, this was really a trifecta of negative news. The dividend was cut 70% to 12 cents per year, the possibility of a sale or merger was all but nixed, and the long-time CEO ""stepped down"".However, Atlantic Power's stock continued its freefall today, down another 10% as of this writing. The reason? The Standard & Poor's Ratings Services has now placed Atlantic Power and affiliate Atlantic Power Ltd. Partnership (""APLP"") on CreditWatch negative. To put this into English, S&P may lower the rating on Atlantic Power's debt as it reviews the company's strategic and financial plans. The S&P cited the departure of the CEO and unanticipated distribution cut as the trigger for its review.Needless to say, a credit rating downgrade would be a serious setback for Atlantic Power. The company already has a ""B"" credit rating, which puts it firmly into the junk grade tier and implies a highly speculative investment. Furthermore, Atlantic Power's ability to access the bond markets was already questionable and any increase in the cost of capital for the company may lead to future liquidity problems.Disclaimer: The opinions in this article are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned. Please do your own due diligence before making any investment decision."
2395455,44981,2014-08-07T12:13:40-04:00,The fears about the debt of the company and the cash flow situation has caused the stock to lose substantial value over the last year.Fee based revenue should ensure stability in cash flows and the future dividends are likely to remain unhurt.The current price of the stock makes it an attractive investment for an income investor with a yield of over 10% and solid growth prospects.,"Atlantic Power Corporation (NYSE:AT) owns and operates a diverse fleet of power generation and infrastructure assets in the U.S. and Canada. The company's power generation projects sell electricity to utilities and large commercial as well as industrial customers under long-term power purchase agreements. These long-term contracts also hedge the company from the commodity risk exposure in the long-run. Moreover, as of December 31,2013, the company's power generation projects in operation have an aggregate gross electric generation capacity of approximately 2,948 Megawatts, of which, its aggregate ownership interest is 2,026 Megawatts. Its current portfolio consists of interests in twenty-eight operational power generation projects across eleven states in the U.S. and two provinces in Canada.A Poor YearAtlantic Power lost substantial value in the last year due to harsh decline in dividends, poor financial performance, and high debt on the company books. The stock plummeted from $12 at the start of the year to below $4 by the end of the year. However, the company is getting back up while decreasing its short-term debt obligations and a strong portfolio of clean energy power generation assets. Moreover, the market is impressed with the company's first quarter earnings and the stock has gained around 5% year-to-date.Business ModelThe conventional nuclear and coal fired power plants have faced severe difficulties due to rising geological concerns of global warming. Atlantic Power maintains a diversified portfolio focusing on wind, natural gas, hydroelectricity and biomass methods. These newer and cleaner energy generation methods are attained by both organic growth and potential acquisitions by the company in North America. Atlantic Power focuses on generating stable operating revenues through contract cash flows from its existing assets. As mentioned earlier, the company's power generation projects in operation have an aggregate gross electric generation capacity of about 2,948 Megawatts in which its aggregate ownership interest is 2,026 Megawatts. Further, the company derives its revenues from utilities and large commercial as well as industrial customers under long-term power purchase agreements. The use of long term power purchase agreements secures the future cash flows of the company as well as hedges the company from commodity risk in the market.Strong Future GrowthAfter the worst financial conditions during the last year, Atlantic Power focused on initiatives aimed at improving its financial flexibility and addressing its near-term debt maturities. Moreover, the company believed that the execution of near-term loan facility and the use of those funds are important steps towards achieving the strategic goals of the company. As a result, the fundamentals are getting stronger now with rising revenues and margins. Atlantic Power increased its revenues by 25% to $551.7 million from $440.4 million last year. Moreover, the company also managed to increase its net profit margins by over 300%, and turned the loss of $29 million in the previous year to a profit of $64.3 million.Source: SEC FilingsAtlantic Power benefited a lot from the renewal of its revolving credit facilities over the last year. The company substantially reduced its short-term debt holdings - thus increasing its financial flexibility and interest expense during the period. The company managed to refinance a debt arrangement which was used to redeem $415 million of debt maturing shortly in 2014, 2015 and 2017. Further, the company also increased and extended its revolving credit facility at Atlantic Power Limited Partnership (NASDAQ:APLP) to $210 million maturing in 2018 replacing the $150 million credit facility maturing in March 2015. Moreover, this reduced interest expenses will further create room for sustainable dividends in the long-run.Source: Investor Presentation, 4Q and YE 2013 Earnings Release.With more free cash flows in hand, the company is now able to revive and retain its profitability in the long-run. As mentioned earlier in this article, the company maintains a diversified portfolio of energy generation methods which have far more social and political acceptance compared to conventional sources such as nuclear and coal fired plants. Atlantic Power has vastly segmented its revenue sources over all these energy generation methods.Source: Investor Presentation, Q4 and YE 2013 Earnings ReleaseFurther, the company has a strong order backlog for several years in the form of long-term power purchase agreements. Beyond Selkirk and Tunis in 2014, the company's next power purchase agreement expirations do not occur until year-end 2017. This will enable stable and consistent revenue streams to the company ensuring its dividend stability in the long run.Source: Investor Presentation, Q4 and YE 2013 Earnings ReleaseAtlantic Power pays monthly dividends to its shareholders and has lost substantial dividend distribution per share during the last year. This is due to the poor performance of the company which resulted in severe dividend cut during the period. However, the company has stabilized its cash flows over the last few quarters which have stabilized the monthly dividend distributions to $3 per share - yielding around 10.2% compared to the industry average of 2%.ConclusionAtlantic Power has been through a lot over the last year and the stock price performance shows the condition of the company. However, the things have started to get better for the company and the contract based revenue will ensure stability in revenues as well as cash flows. We believe the current price of the stock makes it an attractive investment for income as well as growth investors as the stock pays a juicy dividend yield and the financial conditions are getting better. The extension of debt maturity should allow the company to have smoother operations and better liquidity.Additional Disclosure: This article is for educational purposes only and it should not be taken as an investment recommendation.

While Atlantic Power's website says ""95% of our power is 'clean power,'"" By ""clean"" they mean ""not coal."" They are also indulging in a bit of fudging by counting the size of projects by megawatts (MW) of capacity, which has the effect of decreasing the apparent weight of baseload power generation like coal.Page 30 of the company's annual earnings presentation gives a much clearer picture of the their assets since it breaks out the projects by cash flow (adjusted EBITDA.) Only 21% of Atlantic Power's 2013 Adjusted EBITDA came from wind.The following is Alantic Power's graph of Adjusted EBITDA by project from the earnings presentation. I've added notations to each wedge to identify the project fuel by cross referencing it with their project list:As you can see, coal accounts for 8% of Adjusted EBITDA (not 5%). It's not clear how much of the ""Other"" wedge is natural gas, but if we break out those ""other"" projects by MW capacity, they are about three quarters natural gas. Of the 76% of cash flow which is broken out by project, 29% is natural gas, 18% is wind, 12% is hydropower, 9% is biomass and 8% is coal.The natural gas industry certainly likes to call itself as ""clean."" I'm willing to concede that it's not as bad as coal. I even consider it clean when it's used in a Combined Heat and Power (Cogeneration) project, as is the case with Capstone Infrastructure's (MCQPF) natural gas fleet.Here are some comparable charts from Capstone's investor fact sheet: Note that Capstone takes the trouble to break out its Adjusted EBITDA by fuel source. A big chunk of cash flow comes from its water utility, but of the rest, only the 4% slice from district heating, does not meet my definition of ""clean."" The rest is cogeneration (17%), wind (13%), solar (13%), hydropower (8%) and biomass (6%.). It's also worth noting that a larger chuck of cash flow has come from renewable power since Capstone acquired Renewable Energy Developers in 2013. I'm sure Capstone's management will highlight that in its 2013 earnings presentation today.UPDATE: Here is the 2013 chart:If a power producer claims to be ""clean"" and does not prominently break out its electricity production, revenue, cash flow or earnings by fuel source, they're probably talking about natural gas or nuclear power. Some people consider these clean, but I suspect even Atlantic Power's management has doubts.If management really thinks natural gas is clean, why did I have to dig to find out how Atlantic Power fuels most of its generation?Disclosure: Long MCQPF.This article was first published on the author's Forbes.com blog, Green Stocks on March 7th.

1984571,38231,2014-02-01T10:49:22-05:00,,"Sometimes bad situations just get worse. This is currently the case surrounding Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT). According to a recent press release, Atlantic Power may be forced to drastically lower its dividend as soon as February, 2014. The reason for this is rather complicated, but can be summarized as the following: Atlantic Power is about to exceed certain loan covenants regarding its indebtedness.As noted in the press release, Atlantic Power is about to repay and or redeem in whole the following notes:Atlantic Power would need to pay par plus and an applicable make-whole premium. The company is funding this transaction using several new senior secured debts, comprising of a $600 million senior secured term loan facility and a $200 million senior secured revolver. This new debt will be issued by Atlantic Power Limited Partnership (""APLP""), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Atlantic Power.While this does solve one major issue for the company, it does raise another. Such a transaction will result in a rather nasty charge to earnings due to the make-whole payment and related expenses. This charge is expected to occur sometime in Q1 2014. Below is the key paragraph from the press release which explains this situation in more detail:If the above were not clear, let be more explicit: Due to the announced transaction, Atlantic Power will breach its loan covenants regarding its fixed-charge coverage ratio on its 2018 9.0% notes as early as February, 2014. As a result, Atlantic Power will therefore be limited to an aggregate dividend payment of at most $50M per year.Considering Atlantic Power had about 120M shares outstanding as of Q3 2013, this would result in a MAXIMUM dividend payment of $0.415 per share per year ($0.034 per month), or less than 4% above the current dividend level of $0.40 per share per year ($0.033 per month).However, this is only the start of the bad news. I believe Atlantic Power left out a crucial passage from its SEC filing in its press release. The following is from the above mentioned Atlantic Power's Q3 2013 10-Q page 78:Obviously, these new senior secured credit facilities constitute an ""improved"" financial flexibility. However, they also come with their own terms and conditions. While the full details are not yet out, one must imagine they may be rather strict given Atlantic Power's sky-high debt levels. Below is what Atlantic Power anticipates the terms for the new credit facilities to be:Regarding the dividend, section 8 is probably the most worrisome. What exactly are the new limitations and restrictions regarding dividend payments or other distributions? While the press release does not say it explicitly, I believe that this section likely means that Atlantic Power will be further limited as to how much it can pay out via dividends. In other words, another dividend cut seems very likely short to medium term.ConclusionWhile Atlantic Power does need to lower its debt load, doing so will result in some serious pain for shareholders. Besides the negative impact for Q1 2014 earnings, the dividend now seems to be in jeopardy.Needless to say, I think another dividend cut would send Atlantic Power's stock tanking as I do not believe that this information is currently priced into the stock.Disclaimer: The opinions in this article are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned.

1923241,24122,2013-12-31T13:21:27-05:00,,"Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT) is a power-generation and infrastructure company with assets in the US and Canada. They are traded on the NYSE and in Toronto. The company is small with revenues in the US$550m range and has a number of challenges that have decimated its stock price in the last 12 months. The stock pays a monthly dividend and was an income play until a surprise cut of the dividend in Q4 2012. After other issues and uncertainty of the current payout, we believe it has become an asset play. There are two small preferred stock issues, thinly traded, which are a more conservative way to play this situation.Company BackgroundAT is primarily a power generator operating in Canada and the US with a generating capacity of about 3,018 MW. This capacity is spread over 29 projects in 11 states and 2 Canadian provinces. Of these projects, 23 are wholly owned and the rest joint ventures. Most of the production is sold via long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs.)The company has been selling several assets over the last 2 years, after making a $190m equity investment in a wind project in Oklahoma.IssuesThe steep decline in the company's securities this year (both common and preferred) can be explained by a number of issues:Dividend Risk: Management cut the common dividend significantly, even after assuring shareholders they would be safe. Not good for trust, especially when most shareholders were holding AT for yield. Given skimpy coverage of capex and upcoming debt maturities, even the current payout maybe in jeopardy.Indebtedness: AT carries a high debt to equity ratio. This has pushed up financial risk and cost of capital. While the company can probably handle 2014 maturities, management admits that there is no solution for 2015 yet.Expiring PPAs: The company is not a regulated retail utility, earning a predictable margin. Instead, it has PPAs on most, but not all projects. Non-covered assets, and expiring PPAs, some with terms above current market, are a source of uncertainty. Conversely, new or extended PPAs would be positive catalysts.Lawsuits: Following the surprise dividend cuts, several class action lawsuits were filed against the company and management. This is at best a distraction for management and shareholders, at worst a significant liability.Lack of Scale: The company's assets could be managed much more efficiently within a larger company, reducing administrative expenses, cost of capital and raising management quality.Management Quality: Management has shown incompetence in handling the dividend cuts, especially by issuing assurances to the contrary beforehand. Their reluctance in seeking ""strategic alternatives"" for the company also shows how they resolve significant conflicts of interest with shareholders: in their own favor.ScenariosThe company is clearly in a crisis situation. We can see six ways of resolving this:1. Muddle throughManagement may succeed in refinancing, renewing PPAs and more or less keeping the status quo, maybe with slow improvements. This would, over time, help both common and preferred.2. Issue new equityDilution for common, better cushion for preferred.3. Cut dividendA further cut of the common dividend will likely hurt the common price, while improving the economic situation of the senior preferred.4. Sell assetsThis, in conjunction with deleveraging, will help both common and preferred.5. Sell companyProperly marketed in a non-distressed market, this will likely be the best outcome for all shareholders. Unfortunately, management's options are mostly under water, they own little equity, and they have shown great motivation in holding onto their jobs by installing a poison pill after shocking shareholders with a dividend cut shortly after giving assurances that they would not do so. The board may decide to do this, maybe forced by activist investors or in conduction with a redesigned incentive structure for management.6. ReorganizationA forced reorganization will be the worst case scenario. We can see this coming about only if financial markets tighten up significantly making a refinancing impossible.Preferred Stock SeriesThere are two series of preferred stock, both issued in C$ by a subsidiary (acquisition) but guaranteed by AT.Series 1 (Symbol: AZP.PRA.CA): 2007, 5m shares, 4.85% cumulative redeemable pref, C$25 nominal, payable quarterly, C$1.2125 annually, currently redeemable at $25.75, declining to $25 by 2016Series 2 (Symbol: AZP.PRB.CA): 2009, 4m shares, 7% cumulative, rate reset pref, C$ 25 nominal; pays $1.75 annually through 12/31/2014. After that, will reset at 5-year Canadian government bond yield plus 4.18% Holders can convert into Series 3 cumulative floating rate preferred shares at each reset date. Series 3 will pay quarterly floating rate dividends at 90-day Canadian government T-bills plus 4.18%While the series 2 has a much higher indicated dividend yield, this will go away as it resets at the end of 2014. After that, the dividends should be fairly close to each other, although the series 2 has a built-in interest rate protection.Both issues are traded in Toronto and, due to the small issue size, are fairly illiquid.ValuationValuing the preferreds, and AT common is not easy. As fixed-income securities, both Series yield well over 10%, and trade at a 50-60% discount to their nominal value, at which they would be redeemed. And a redemption is likely in several plausible scenarios (company sale, significant deleveraging.) While this is attractive, the main question is how safe are dividend and principal.To evaluate that, we need to value the common which provides the margin of safety for the preferreds.A simple asset valuation is difficult, as AT has a large number of heterogeneous assets. These have PPAs on them ranging from zero to 20+ years in duration, and may be on terms that are above or below market. Additionally, the company has investment projects that are not yet generating EBITDA, but will be coming on line shortly.Referring to a very thoughtful article on AT common by Howard Winston which was a semi- finalist at this summer's Ira Sohn conference (and is available on seekingalpha.com), we can apply a multiple on EBITDA (he chose 9, close to the 10 paid by Warren Buffet's MidAmerican Energy for NV Energy this year). Project EBITDA will be around $270m for 2013. With a 9x, this leads to an EV of $2.43 billion. Subtracting $1.6 billion in net debt and $220 million in preferred equity leaves $610 million for the common, or about $5.08 per share.A simple book value calculation leads to $7.50 per share. Stripping out all goodwill and intangibles leaves only $1.11 per share. This is certainly a very conservative approach.On the NYSE, the common has traded in December between $3.08 (all-time low) and $3.70, down from a high of 13 in February.All in all, it appears that there is a comfortable cushion behind the preferred issues.Disclosure: I am long AT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: We are long common and both series of preferred."
2058543,24122,2014-02-28T11:00:44-05:00,,"Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT) was able to refinance all of its near-term debt, and was able to do so at significantly lower rates. In this capital markets environment, the deal is about as good as could be expected. All shareholders should be unhappy that management chose this path, rather than selling the company to a larger, more efficient operator. But with that not in the cards, this deal brings the following advantages:Interest expenses will go down substantially - about 100 bp for $415m of refinanced debt.No new financing necessary until early 2017.The current dividend level should be sustainable, especially for the preferred issues.What remains to be seen is the one-time charge for the whole deal, which will be substantial. We will also find out what the terms of the tender for a portion of the 9% high-yield notes will be.As for the dividend, in 2014 they are limited by covenants in the high-yield notes. The current payment level should be just underneath the cap. What limitations are in the covenants of the new financing is not clear.We believe that the preferreds are significantly undervalued and should probably yield no more than 6-7%. The common should jump significantly from their current depressed level. If there will be a dividend cut, both may slide, although economically, the company is better off than a few weeks ago.For management, the challenge will now move from financing to operations, and hopefully some long-term PPA.Disclosure: I am long AT.

1909521,38951,2013-12-20T10:23:04-05:00,,"Summary: Within this article I am going to cover one of the most pressing issues facing Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT) (TSE:ATP) in the near-term; debt. I will be covering the company's debt profile and establishing whether or not the company will be able to meet its debt obligations and repayment commitments. Furthermore, I shall be considering Atlantic's dividend payout and if it is sustainable with debt at current levels. To support my argument I will be using data from the company itself as well as broker estimates and industry average figures.Additionally, I will be covering Atlantic's high cost of capital in comparison to the industry average.Note: The many debt maturities Atlantic Power is facing became some-what muddled when I was writing this so to solve the problem I have given each debt tranche a reference which is displayed in the table below and throughout the text.One of the key issues facing threatening Atlantic Power and its dividend is debt. However, it is assumed that the company will be able to pay back its near-term maturities.Management expects to have $145 million of unrestricted cash at the end of 2013, plus $75 million of cash reserved under the senior credit facility. Based on the debt maturity table below, Atlantic should be able to repay the convertible debt due Oct 2014 [Ref: 1] with cash ($46 million outstanding). Atlantic should also be able to refinance the Curtis Palmer notes [Ref: 2] ($190 million outstanding) as they are tied to the Curtis Palmer project.Curtis Palmer's PPA does not expire until 2027, which gives creditors a predictable cash flow to work off and debt could be amortized over the life of the project.Unfortunately, this leaves $150 million outstanding on the unsecured notes maturing August 2015 [Ref: 3]. If Atlantic cannot refinance, it is likely that the company will be able to repay with cash on hand. After the repayment of the convertible debt due 2014 [Ref: 1], Atlantic will have approximately $100 million in unrestricted cash. Depending upon disposals, broker estimates put Atlantic expected cash from operations at around $100 for 2014, excluding dividends. Management have stated previously that the company's 2014 payout ratio will be in the region of 75% to 85% cash from operations, which if realized indicates that Atlantic will enter 2015 with $125 million in cash. On this basis another dividend cut is on the cards if Atlantic plans on paying off its 2015 maturity -- this assumes no project CAPEX.Two other factors are also expected to affect Atlantic Power during 2014: the expiration and re-negotiation of 2 PPA's or power purchase agreements for both the company's Tunis and Selkirk operations. The re-negotiation of these two agreements is expected to impact the company by around $15 million annually for 2015. However, the future of these two facilities remains uncertain until the PPA agreements are in place.However, 2017 brings a further $223 million of debt [Ref: 4+6], 2018 brings $460 million [Ref: 7] and during 2019 an additional $230 million matures [Ref: 8+9]. With $913 million in debt maturing within the period 2017 to 2019 Atlantic is going to have to find a lot of cash quickly.Debt profileBefore we get to the debt maturing during 2017 however, we need to consider the closer 2015 maturity [Ref: 3]. My model above assumes no CAPEX and a 85% dividend payout ratio (management has committed to this but no comment was issued during the third quarter statement).Unfortunately, my model above is wrong. In particular, management has already approved a number of project upgrades through 2014, including the Curtis Palmer re-power, Nipigon generator upgrade and the North Island electricity system upgrade. These projects are expected to cost $20 million but will produce an annualized EBITDA contribution of at least $6 million from 2015; an ROI of 30% within a year, a great return.Nevertheless, Atlantic is still having issues at its Piedmont biomass asset where the company may be required to inject additional equity into the project. Assuming that these projects come in on time and on budget, Atlantic's cash from operations minus CAPEX will be around $80 million during 2014. Without adjusting for the impact of the dividend, we can see that it is unlikely that Atlantic will be able to keep its payout at the current level, if it wants to remain solvent and meet its debt obligations.Note: During the last few weeks Atlantic has swapped its 60% interest in Rollcast for full ownership of the Piedmont and Cadillac biomass plants - as of yet there is no data on how this will affect the company's cash flow.Still there is hope for Atlantic to raise the cash it needs. The company has assets to sell and some analysts have speculated that private equity my be willing to pay around $500 million for the company's portfolio of hydropower assets. Although, uncertainty over the future of some PPA agreements, lawsuits and project level debt could complicate the sale of some assets.Note: There are currently a number of class-action lawsuits filed against Atlantic claiming that management violated state or federal laws when communicating the sustainability of dividends to shareholders. While it is highly likely that nothing will materialize from these actions, the company's access to capital markets could be negatively impacted in the short-term.Cost of capitalAside from upcoming debt maturities facing Atlantic several analysts have brought up the issue of the company's high cost of capital. Indeed, as shown below Atlantic's cost of capital is approximately double the industry average according to some metrics. It is likely that this will impact Atlantic into the future as even if the company can refinance its debt, a persistent high cost of capital will continue to hold back the company.Atlantic's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is almost double the industry average according to data from Value Line, computed at the beginning of this year (Jan 2013).So, Atlantic's cost of equity is nearly double the industry average and the company's cost of debt is more than double the industry average. On an individual basis, American Electric Power's WACC comes in at 4.75%, 165 bps lower than that achieved by Atlantic.Atlantic really needs to focus on this cost of capital before it can progress significantly.Buy-out?Of course, with Atlantic trading at around half its book-value-per-share, there is an increasing amount of speculation that the company could be brought out by a larger peer. Nevertheless, with the uncertainty over PPA agreements for the next few years, competitors are unlikely to launch a bid until there is more clarity over the company's future income. What's more, the high level of project and near-term debt hanging over Atlantic is likely to deter acquirers further. The only attractive part of Atlantic that acquirers are likely to target are the company's lucrative power plant assets with PPA agreements in place as well as renewable energy assets. It would be easier for any predator to acquire these individually, along with any directly related project level debt, which would reduce debt liabilities.SummarySo then, in summary, Atlantic's debt is a problem and it quickly becomes apparent that the company is going to struggle going forward. With the bulk of maturities coming due after 2017, Atlantic is going to struggle to raise enough cash to pay off its debt. This indicates that a dividend payout cut is on the cards. Indeed, with a number of maturities coming up in the next few years, unless the company significantly increases the pace of its asset disposals, of slashes the dividend payout, it is unlikely that it will be able to afford to pay back the senior unsecured notes due 2015, much less maturities falling due during 2017. All in all, Atlantic's investors are heading for trouble, debt is not falling fast enough and the dividend is going to face further pressure.Key near-term date for Atlantic's investors to noteDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2288613,25258,2014-06-26T16:03:16-04:00,Atlantic Power Corporation has begun to improve its balance sheet by redeeming near-term debt maturities.The company has a strong portfolio of clean energy power generation assets.The company's business model incorporates stable long-term contracts.,"Income investors looking to round out a high-yielding dividend portfolio might want to consider a small power generation company named Atlantic Power Corporation (AT). Atlantic Power Corporation is the owner of a diversified portfolio of power generation assets within the United States and Canada. The company operates out of 28 power generation projects across 11 states in the United States and two provinces in Canada. Combined, these projects have a total annual capacity of approximately 2,945 megawatts. Of this amount, the company has an ownership interest in approximately 2,024 megawatts.What makes Atlantic Power Corporation an interesting play in the present is the fact that the company is now in recovery mode. Previously, shares of Atlantic Power fell from over $12 at the beginning of 2013 to less than $3 at the start of 2014. This was a result of poorer than expected performance, a dramatic dividend cut in early 2013, and the looming debt maturities. However, since this time period the company has begun to significantly improve its financial position. Atlantic Power Corporation now distributes a stable monthly dividend with a rather high annual yield of 10.3% based on the closing price of $3.60 as of June 25.The following are three things to like about the company now:A Look At The Company NowAtlantic Power Corporation now trades with a market capitalization of $434 million based on the closing price of $3.60 on June 25. The company supports a low price-to-sales ratio of 0.79 and price-to-book ratio of 0.79. Atlantic Power carries total assets of $3.30 billion, of which total liabilities account for $2.52 billion. As of March 2014, current liabilities were a mere $173.6 million in contrast to the company's $315.2 million in current assets. Altogether, the company now reports shareholder equity of $781.6 million.Annual revenue has sequentially increased year-over-year. The company reported revenue of $93.9 million, $440.4 million, and $551.7 million for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013 respectively. However, the company has also maintained a net loss of $38.4 million, $112.8 million, and $33 million for the same corresponding time periods. However, Atlantic Power has largely relied upon its cash flows. For the years 2011, 2012, and 2013, the company reported cash flow from operating activities of $55.9 million, $167.1 million, and $152.4 million respectively.Final ThoughtsAtlantic Power Corporation remains an undervalued company with an enviable portfolio of clean energy assets. Yet it is not without its flaws. The company's perception was largely tarnished when Wall Street swiftly punished the energy producer for being too aggressive in 2013. Nevertheless, the company's financial situation has since shown signs of improvement.The company has successfully refinanced its most immediate threat found in its debt maturities and has proven itself capable of sustaining its current dividend yield. In addition to this, the company's stock now trades below its book value and currently has the majority of its projects under long term contracts. For investors looking to diversify their dividend portfolios, Atlantic Power appears to offer a rather high dividend yield for a rather low near-term risk.Disclosure: The author is long AT.

1427381,38181,2013-05-12T02:20:34-04:00,,"Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT) is a power generation and infrastructure company with assets in the United States and Canada. While not so long ago AT had a market capitalization of well over a billion dollars and appeared to be a fairly solid investment, it soon fell apart, as it had transpired that AT management had misled investors and failed to disclose important information. AT's strong dividend was cut, and numerous class action lawsuits began against AT from disgruntled investors. After AT has lost so much of its value (currently it trades at roughly a third of its price from its highs), the question is whether AT can recover somewhat and provide investors with solid returns.AT recently announced its Q1 2013 results, with cash flows from operating activities of $74.2 million (an 11% increase year-over-year), and a projected income (loss) of $31.1 million (a substantial increase of $68.1 million year-over-year). Upon announcing these results AT stock had a decent run upwards. In my view, the most important considerations for AT investors now are the following:Future OutlookAT could hardly be considered a safe investment opportunity with guaranteed growth in future. There is a lot of uncertainty involved, and investors seeking a steady return would do well to avoid the stock. However, I am inclined to believe that AT is a decent speculative investment with high risk and high reward. The fact that the stock has dropped so severely means that AT has the potential to bounce significantly, and we can see that management is clearly taking the company in a new direction with the introduction of new projects that have brought in significant revenue in just the first quarter of operation. I will not be trading AT, but will be watching with interest.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1527892,23393,2013-06-30T04:19:44-04:00,,"""Sell your losers and let your winners run."" This endlessly quoted Wall Street adage makes sense for traders, but doesn't necessarily apply to income-seeking investors who care primarily about collecting a steadily growing stream of dividends over time.The latter approach, which has served me well over the past 20 years, requires patience and the conviction that comes from understanding a company's underlying fundamentals and growth drivers.Let's scrutinize the wisdom of letting your winners run. Increasing profits, strengthening demand and a rising dividend can push a stock to a sustainably higher price. But in this era of institution-dominated trading, stocks are often bid up to valuations that no longer reflect underlying growth prospects.In these instances, the gains you've earned by letting your winners run can quickly become a loss when the momentum reverses. The more one of your holdings appreciates in value, the greater the proportion of your wealth that's tied up in a single stock - a situation that can end unhappily when institutional investors take their profits.There's no shame in turning paper profits into real ones. When stocks reach frothy levels that exceed their fair value, it's time to take at least a partial profit and allocate the proceeds to names that trade at better valuations. This approach even gives you the option of repurchasing the stock that you sold once its valuation returns to reasonable levels.As for cutting your losers short, every investor endures his or her fair share of heartburn when one of their positions suffers a pullback. Selling the offending stock can provide a bit of an emotional release, even if this move locks in a loss.However, in many instances, the further a position declines in value, the less damage the position can do to your portfolio - at that point, the market has priced in the worst news. In this situation, it's critical to take a dispassionate view of the stock's prospects for a potential recovery.Recovery: Fact and FantasyWhen a stock tumbles precipitously, investors must ask themselves three questions.On the plus side, stocks that have suffered significant setbacks benefit from lowered expectations; if the company can right the ship, quarterly results should have no problem exceeding the consensus estimate.Of course, some companies face insurmountable challenges - and their stocks are cheap for a reason. In the early 2000s, a number of technology stocks went to zero after the underlying businesses consistently failed to turn a profit.In recent years, the Federal Reserve's accommodative policies have increased investors' appetite for dividend-paying names, especially marginal fare that offers high yields.Coveted by investors looking to turn savings into an income stream, these stocks can take a beating if the company is forced to slash its dividend. Such a move spurs a cascade of selling that reinforces fears that the worst is yet to come. Rebuilding investor confidence after a dividend cut is a monumental task; a reduced payout represents a tacit admission that performance failed to match management's projections.In these discouraging instances, investors must ask whether the dividend cut will generate enough spare cash to stabilize the business, or if this move amounts to applying a napkin to a gaping head wound.When I first partnered with my longtime friend Elliott Gue on Capitalist Times and Energy & Income Advisor, I took a hard look at the names in my coverage universe that had either cut their dividend over the past year or were at risk of reducing their payout.Although many of these names eventually will recover despite recent disappointments, the extended time frame for any turnaround prompted me to attach a ""Sell"" rating to a number of these stocks.However, two of the downtrodden - Atlantic Power Corp. (NYSE: AT) and Just Energy Group (NYSE: JE) - earned Hold ratings after intensive scrutiny. Both stocks have struggled monumentally this year, with Atlantic Power plummeting by 61 percent and Just Energy giving up 28 percent of its value. Shares of both companies aren't far removed from the all-time lows that they hit in November 2008, the height of the financial crisis.The analyst community isn't particularly bullish on either stock: Atlantic Power has eight Hold ratings and one Sell rating, while Just Energy has one Buy rating, three Holds and three sells. Although the short interest in each stock has declined, current levels are higher relative to many dividend-paying equities.Insiders have loaded up on the companies' shares in recent months, with Atlantic Power's executives adding to their holdings by 25 percent over the past six months and Just Energy's leadership starting to buy stock in January 2013. Meanwhile, the prices of the companies' bonds have remained relatively stable.Atlantic Power and Just Energy are two stocks that investors want to chuck out of their portfolios - if for no other reason than to stop looking at them in their account statement.Here's why I'm sticking with these stocks for now and didn't include them in a spring cleaning that saw me downgrade seven names in my coverage universe to Sells.Atlantic Power Corp (TSX: ATP, NYSE: AT)Thus far, Atlantic Power has met many of the near-term benchmarks I've set for holding the stock:Atlantic Power completed the sale of its interests in three Florida power plants to Quantum Utility Generation LLC and its stake in California's Path 15 transmission line to Duke-American Transmission Co. Both deals closed at previously agreed-upon terms.The embattled utility on May 2 announced that the firm had completed the syndication of tax-equity interests in its Canadian Hills wind-power installation.A few days later, Atlantic Power disclosed in its 10-Q filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that the firm had also entered an agreement to sell its 17.1 percent interest in the 560-megawatt Gregory cogeneration plant to NRG Energy (NYSE: NRG). This deal will enable the firm to extract US$33.7 million from an asset with little potential for leverage.I also like the hiring of Edward Hall, a former executive with AES Corp (NYSE: AES), as executive vice president and chief operating officer. Hall worked for AES in various positions during its well-documented turnaround and has the experience needed to maximize value from Atlantic Power's far-flung assets and strengthen its balance sheet.Hall will spearhead a major push to improve operational efficiency and take advantage of the company's scale. He and the rest of the management team will also tackle the challenge of adding new projects to the portfolio to stabilize cash flow and set the stage for future growth.Atlantic Power's recent asset sales and loan restructurings have gone a long way toward reducing the company's debt load. Although these divestments will eat into the firm's cash flow, these transactions have dramatically reduced the utility's exposure to the weak wholesale power market. And after the dividend cut, cash flow generated by long-term contracts and renewable-power plants alone will be sufficient to cover the company's obligations.However, any growth in the dividend will hinge on Atlantic Power's ability to increase its cash flow through new projects and acquisitions - a prospect that depends on whether the company can negotiate a waiver for anticipated breaches of covenants associated with its senior credit agreements.Atlantic Power used the proceeds of its recent asset sales to pay off the outstanding balance on this line of credit. But tapping this source of liquidity to finance future acquisitions will require management to successfully renegotiate the terms of its credit agreement.The company has indicated that it should have news on this front in the second half of the year. Atlantic Power's second-quarter results, which should be released around Aug. 8, 2013, will tell us whether the firm's cash flow will meet expectations after a string of recent divestments.A wave of class-action lawsuits alleging that management made false and misleading statements to investors about Atlantic Power's financial performance is another headwind. Although the burden of proof in such cases is high, the risk of an unfavorable judgment or settlement will hang over the stock.The biggest point in Atlantic Power's favor is the company's high-quality portfolio of power plants, all but two of which have contracts to sell power to regulated utilities. No utility has ever defaulted on a power-purchase contract with an independent producer. Not only is the company's asset base diversified by region and fuel source, but also only a fraction of its capacity isn't covered by contracts with at least five years remaining. Source: Company FilingsAt this juncture, Atlantic Power's survival isn't in doubt; rather, the looming questions are whether management will be able to engineer a turnaround, when this recovery will take place and whether it will prove worthwhile for investors.The jury is still out on all three of these questions. But shares of Atlantic Power trade at 72 percent of their book value - an extremely low bar of expectations. Although investors shouldn't allocate new capital to this stock, the stock is a hold for those who can stomach the volatility and elevated risk.Just Energy Group (TSX: JE, NYSE: JE)After cutting its monthly dividend by 32 percent in April, Just Energy has targeted a payout ratio of less than 80 percent for its fiscal 2014 and a debt-to-cash flow ratio of between 3.5 and 4 times cash flow by fiscal 2016.In its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31, 2013, Just Energy posted record customer additions, reduced its costs and boosted margins. A dividend payout ratio of about 95 percent doesn't reflect the subsequent reduction to the firm's monthly disbursement to shareholders.Over the past several months, the stock has vacillated between $6.00 and $7.00 per share, reflecting the back and forth in the press between the company and short sellers that have questioned the utility's prospects. Like Atlantic Power, Just Energy has been tripped up by low electricity prices in the wholesale market - a headwind that's unlikely to abate over the next 12 months to 18 months. That being said, the firm's existing contracts should ensure the sustainability of the recently reduced dividend.Just Energy will announce results for its fiscal first quarter on or around Aug. 9, 2013, at which point we'll have more insight into the company's health and the potential for a turnaround. Investors shouldn't build a new position in this stock, nor should they double down on an existing position; however, those who can stomach the volatility and have a longer time horizon should consider holding the stock.Disclosure: I am long AT, JE.

1357651,46271,2013-04-22T06:38:26-04:00,,"Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT) has been punished by investors over the last year. The company was offering a hefty 13% dividend in 2012, and usually when something seems too good to be true, it is not. Dividend-seeking investors and mutual funds lost substantial amounts of capital due to the company's failure to disclose information and provided misleading statements about the company's operations. As a result, the company's PPS saw a steep decline, and several law firms have started to file class action lawsuits against the company (See here: 1,2,3,4). AT's PPS have declined 58% YTD and 70% over six months, (figure 1). Meanwhile, most investors are still busy digesting the recent dividend haircuts, massive share value depreciation. I would like to present an even more pressing issue that could drive the company's PPS to new 52-week lows and jeopardize its dividend payment integrity.Figure 1. AT price-per-share performance from July 2012 to-date.What is the issue at hand with Atlantic Power?Two must-read articles should bring a quick up-to-date to most investors. These articles may be found here and here. Although the company may seem attractive for a long position after a 50% drop, I believe the company will see its PPS decline further for reasons herein described.Recalling from my previous article, vide supra, the company produces 58% of its electricity by natural gas power plants, (see figures 2 and 3 below). Natural gas prices have more than doubled over the past year. Does this present a problem for the company? Short answer… Yes.The company is expanding its clean-energy operations through the 300 MW Canadian Hills eolic project and by the acquisition of 120 MW Ridgeline Energy project, another clear energy facility. Further, the company is constructing a 53 MW biomass electricity production facility in the state of Georgia. However, the cold fact is that the company is still largely leveraged to the prices of natural gas. Increases in the commodity prices will directly impact its operation costs.Figure 2. Atlantic Power electric power production.Figure 3. Atlantic Power facilities in the United States and Canada.Natural gas prices have increased by 230% from $1.90 per Mcf in May 2012 to current levels of $4.39 per Mcf. Further, in the United States, the average share of electricity generated from coal dropped from 58% in 1997 to 45% in 2009. What's more is that the use of coal to generate electricity declined by 21% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. As coal demand decreases, natural gas prices increase since utilities are migrating towards cleaner electricity generation.Since natural gas prices steadily decreased for 2011 and 2012, large companies such as Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and EXCO resources (NYSE:XCO) reduced their rig count by 80%. Although the natural gas prices have more-than-doubled since the second half of 2012, companies such as Devon (NYSE:DVN) do not plan on drilling for natural gas at all this year. This gesture hints that supply will not rise in the interim, and it will drive the commodity's prices upwards. Moreover, The Marcellus Shale Coalition said that current natural gas prices will have to be sustained for a period of months or years for companies to resume previous natural gas drilling operations.Well-known investors such as Jeremy Grantham, co-founder and chief financial strategist of GMO, claimed that the current natural gas surplus levels will soon revert to a shortage, bringing appreciation to the commodity prices. He even claimed that the prices of natural gas will triple over a five-year span.ConclusionSetting aside Atlantic Power dividend payment cuts and lawsuits being filled against the company, a more pressing matter should be in investors' minds. Although the company is moving to cleaner electricity production, the company still generates 58% of its electricity via natural gas. Natural gas prices have increased dramatically over the last year, and some analysts claim that the recent rally is not yet over. Further, natural gas production companies such as Chesapeake Energy are not boosting their natural gas production and natural gas prices should rise due to a controlled supply. Recent price increases in the commodity will increase the company's operating expenses significantly, and it will reduce its net income. In brief, I believe the dividend payment may be reduced again in the near future. In my opinion, the outlook for Atlantic Power grows dimmer as natural gas prices increase.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1541342,43331,2013-07-09T18:16:53-04:00,,"Note: We submitted an analysis of Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT) for the Sohn Conference Investment Idea Contest. Our submission was named a semifinalist. The contest sought the best investment idea for the next 12 months and the judges included Bill Ackman, Seth Klarman and David Einhorn.OverviewAtlantic Power shares have lost over 70% of their value in the past six months primarily driven by a poorly communicated reduction in monthly dividends. The fall in share price has highlighted the need for the company to sell itself to a larger more efficient operator. Atlantic Power owns a desirable collection of non-coal power plants with Power Purchase Agreements that are best owned by a firm that has a low cost of capital and a low percentage of administrative expenses. Unfortunately, for shareholders, the current structure is just the opposite: AT has a high cost of capital and a high percentage of administrative expenses. The good news is that there should be many energy firms interested in acquiring Atlantic Power's portfolio. For example, Berkshire Hathaway's MidAmerican Energy Unit recently agreed to spend approximately $10 billion to purchase NV Energy. Our back of the envelope calculation is that a buyer with a high credit rating can pay in excess of $8.00 per share and still achieve excellent investment returns.BackgroundIn his 2012 annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett states that, ""above all, a dividend policy should always be clear, consistent and rational. A capricious policy will confuse owners and drive away would be investors."" Buffett goes on to quote from Phil Fisher's legendary investment book, Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits. In Chapter 7 titled The Hullabaloo About Dividends, Fisher explained one can operate a restaurant that features hamburgers or a restaurant that features Chinese food. But one can't randomly switch the menu between the two and retain customers of either one.It takes a certain amount of ego to be a value investment manager. One has to assume at certain times that one is smarter than the market in general or a particular seller of a security. One way to gain at least psychological comfort is to find a recognizable pattern that has proven itself in the past. One of our favorite patterns is that of the confusion created when a company reduces or eliminates a dividend. Existing shareholders that purchased the security for the income are likely to exit. Income mutual funds that by charter can only hold securities that pay dividends sell regardless of intrinsic value. We have often observed that the confusion and selling pressure often results in an immediate plunge in share price. As Buffett stated, a capricious policy drives away potential investors. But it also drives away existing ones as well. It is in this confusion and panic that we have repeatedly found phenomenal investment opportunities.We have invested in a number companies following dividend reductions or suspensions. Our favorite example is the Macquarie Infrastructure Company (NYSE:MIC). Created by the Australian investment bank of the same name, MIC holds a collection of five infrastructure assets that have extremely stable cash flows, including the regulated natural gas utility for the state of Hawaii and the supplier of chilled water for cooling downtown Chicago. However, MIC units lost over 95% of their value as the company reduced and then completely suspended its dividend. Cash flow was simply being redirected to paying down holding company level debt. Basic math demonstrates that over time outstanding debt would be reduced and therefore the value of the equity would correspondingly increase. MIC units have since risen by over 20x.Another example is Cedar Fair (NYSE:FUN). Cedar Fair operates 11 amusement parks including Kings Island in Cincinnati. The theme park business is generally stable. FUN's EBITDA ranged from $315 million and $360 million in the 2007-2010 period. However, FUN's publicly traded units lost 80% of their value following a series of dividend reductions and ultimately a total dividend suspension. FUN was simply redirecting cash flow to pay down its debt. As the dividend was reinstated, the units recovered all of their lost value.Current IdeaAtlantic Power.Our favorite dividend confusion investment today is Atlantic Power. AT meets many of our dividend confusion investment criteria:AT's shares have recently lost most of their value following the company's decision to reduce its dividend by 65%. We believe that the shares are currently trading below their intrinsic value. Simple investment analysis demonstrates that AT is best owned by a larger firm. A larger company will provide obvious merger related synergies including a lower cost of capital, lower administrative expenses and elimination of duplicate public company expenses. Atlantic Power is the classic case of a company existing solely for the benefit of management. As measured over any time period, shareholders have experienced capital losses even as the overall market reaches record highs. Management has grown the company simply to justify their own increase in compensation. And finally, management has lost all creditability as their statements regarding the crucial dividend level have been misleading at best.Atlantic Power HistoryAtlantic Power went public in the fall of 2004 on the Toronto exchange at C$10 (roughly $8.50 USD) per unit by issuing 32 million income participating securities. As the name implies, the security was created by design to provide stable and steady income. A clear indication of the importance of AT's dividends was that they were to be paid monthly, just as a Social Security check is. Although incorporated in Canada, the company's headquarters has always been located in Boston and until 2011, all of its power plants were located in the US.Atlantic Power grew in size by frequently issuing additional securities. The largest issuance of AT shares was in 2011 in connection with the acquisition of another power producer, Capital Power Income LP. Shareholders in Capital Power Income LP that accepted AT shares in the buyout were promised a continuation of a stable and regular dividend policy. The Capital Power acquisition marked the first time that AT actually had operations in Canada, as a few of Capital Power's plants were located there (although the majority of Capital Power's plants were located in the US).There are essentially two types of power companies: merchant and regulated. All power companies must comply with safety and environmental laws, and therefore the term regulated only applies to regulation of the plant's profitability. A merchant power company's earnings are generally volatile, as neither the price of their product (electricity in dollars per Kilowatt hour) or the largest expense (whether the fuel is natural gas or coal) has to be fixed. On the other end of the spectrum, a regulated power company generally operates under strict government oversight that generally allows them to operate with a specific operating profit margin. Regulated companies' earnings streams are generally stable as increases in costs can be passed through to its retail and business customers.Atlantic Power most resembles a regulated power company. Although not directly regulated, Atlantic Power has sold the majority of its future production using power purchase agreements (PPAs) with a weighted average life of 11.4 years. In its slide deck titled 4Q and YE 2012 Investor Presentation, Atlantic Power projects its 2013 project level EBITDA at $250 -$275 million. Given that most of its revenues and expenses are hedged, it is highly likely to achieve this result. Atlantic Power also projects $171 million in interest expense and $38 million in corporate and other expenses. AT forecasts that it will be able to distribute roughly $50 million to shareholders in 2013.The Dividend CutGiven the stable nature of the Atlantic Power business, the 70% decrease in share price that occurred from October 2012 to June 2013 is shocking. Most of the decline occurred around the time frame of the surprise announcement of a 65% reduction in annual dividends on February 28th.The company had assured shareholders that its dividend was stable. For example, on October 11, 2012, AT's management presented at the Deutsche Bank's 20th Annual Leveraged Finance Conference. The slide deck (which is currently still posted on the company's website) touted the stable nature of the company's business.Also, the Chief Executive and President Barry Welch assured shareholders multiple times on the third quarter conference call on November 6th that the dividend was safe:It is still not clear what changed between November 2012 and February 2013 that resulted in the company to eliminate the majority of its explicitly promised and investor coveted dividend. Most likely, it was a combination of factors. Management knew and had told shareholders that several above market Purchase Power Agreements were going to expire. As a result, it was known to all that several sources of the company's historical EBITDA were going to end. However, management also firmly indicated (both on the Deutsche Bank Presentation and the Third Quarter Conference Call) that its new projects would make up for that shortfall. Lastly, the company may have been paying out too high a percentage of its cash flow. The new dividend is safer, as it is a lower percentage of EBITDA and operating cash flow. We believe that the current market valuation now reflects a dumb or deceitful (feel free to pick either or both) management discount.Part of the collapse of the share price may be due to the confusion of the dividend policy. The company used to pay out 100% of its free cash flow, but for 2014, it is only targeting 80%. Administrative expenses related to potential new projects have also grown with the Ridgeline Energy Holdings acquisition. So the change from a pure income security to one that has possibility for growth has left investors confused. Management discussed its new emphasis on growth in the fourth quarter earnings release:The Prescription: A Sale To Unlock The Value.Given AT's mismanagement, we believe that the best outcome is for the company to sell itself to a larger, more credit worthy energy producer such as Berkshire's Mid American Energy Holdings. Management has indicated its plan to issue more equity to fund upcoming debt maturities. At these depressed share price levels, that plan is quite dilutive to current shareholders. Given that AT is incorporated in Canada, it should be easier than for shareholders in US companies (particularly for companies incorporated in Delaware) to prevail given the conflict of interests (shareholders' desire for a good rate of return and management's desire for a highly paid job). Finally, as management and directors own few shares, an activist investor will be able to initiate a sales process easier than if management held a significant stake.An acquirer will have the following advantages over the current structure:We do not believe that management will put the company up for sale without shareholder pressure. In the case of FUN, Q Investments' involvement allowed shareholders to maximize value.ValuationAT is forecast to have $275 million in Project Level EBITDA for 2013. When MidAmerican Energy purchased NV Energy on May 29th, it paid a 10x EBITDA multiple. Using a more conservative 9x multiple yields an enterprise value of $2.5 billion. Adjusted for $1.5 billion in net debt and $220 million in preferred stock, the equity should be worth in excess of $700 million vs. under $500 million currently.Atlantic Power's assets are the most desirable in the power market: clean and operating under a PPA. The value of these assets has risen because of the low interest rate environment and President Obama's desire to cease coal produced energy. Also, because of the Great Recession, the demand for power has dropped. That has affected the merchant power part of the market, as excess supply is not needed.Risks: The main risk is that AT's shareholders simply accept the status quo. AT will continue to operate with an inefficient structure and eventually shareholders will get diluted. All of the current large shareholders are the non-activist type. They include Blackrock, Vanguard and iShares Russell. These firms do not take the required steps to unlock value.The company has taken significant steps to reduce leverage, selling over $400 million in assets in the past 5 months. In addition, its PPA contracts now have an average life of over 11 years vs. 7.4 years, which should provide it with a stable earnings stream. Therefore, there is some margin of safety.Disclosure: I am long AT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1314061,38231,2013-04-02T08:33:11-04:00,,"It is my opinion that Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT) is an uninvestable stock. During the past year, Atlantic Power fed its investors with multiple shareholder presentations (I, II, III), that omitted crucial and relevant information regarding the safety of its dividend. Atlantic Power also failed to mention the concentrated nature of its distributable cash flows (""DCF""). Since it reported its Q4 2012 earnings, Atlantic Power's stock has been eviscerated, declining over 50%. YTD, Atlantic Power has declined a ghastly 60%.The above chart needs some explanation, as it can tell the story of the decline of Atlantic Power. While I am by no means an expert in charts, I can tell you the approximate causes for each of the major declines experienced by Atlantic Power. Below is the same chart, with each major event color coded:Let us first look at the blue oval:This event saw Atlantic Power's stock price decline from roughly $15 per share to about $11.50. This corresponded to an abysmal Q3 2012 earnings report on November 5, 2012. The company performed poorly during the quarter and the stock price declined on the earnings miss. This quarter saw Atlantic Power with a massive 120% dividend payout ratio. However, notice that after this report, Atlantic Power's stock price had regained most its losses, and by late January 2013, was trading at about $13 per share.This leads us to the brown oval:This event saw Atlantic Power's stock price decline from about $13 per share to about $11.50. Notice that the $11.50 'floor' was hit twice during these price declines. This price decline was caused by Atlantic Power's announcement of the sale of its Florida assets on January 31, 2013. By mid-February, Atlantic Power had recovered most of its losses and was trading for about $12.20 per share.Next comes the yellow oval:This decline saw Atlantic Power's stock price decrease from about $12 per share to $10 per share. This decline mystifies me, and in my opinion, is the most suspect. There was no news released by Atlantic Power, and the dividend was declared as normal during this timeframe. Atlantic Power's stock price was about $10 when the next major event occurred.Now, let us take a look at the pink rectangle:I would hope that any holders of Atlantic Power's stock would know exactly what occurred here, but let me recap. On February 28, 2013, Atlantic Power released its Q4 2012 earnings. While the earnings were mediocre, what really sent the stock tanking was that Atlantic Power announced a 65% reduction in its dividend level. In addition, Atlantic Power adopted a shareholder rights plan (also known as a 'poison pill'). If this weren't enough bad news, Atlantic Power's guidance for 2013 was horrendous, with DCF dropping over 50% and the projected 2013 dividend payout ratio at nearly 100%. This last point warrants repeating: the payout ratio for 2013 is nearly 100% AFTER the 65% dividend cut. You can find a much longer explanation of these events in my prior two articles on Atlantic Power, here and here. After this event, Atlantic Power saw its share price collapse, from $10, to about $7.Finally, we arrive at the orange rectangle:During this time frame, Atlantic Power has seen its share price fall 33%, from $7 to the current price of $4.66 per share. No major events have occurred during this period. If I were to speculate on why Atlantic Power has continued to decline so sharply, I would guess that this is the 'slow' money (pension funds and mutual funds) leaving the stock. Atlantic Power is/was widely held by institutional holders in both the US and Canada. In addition, since Atlantic Power has fallen below $5 per share, many institutional holders may have been required to sell (sources: MSN Money, The WSJ).ConclusionAtlantic Power's management had previously touted the dividend's safety during Q3 2012, and yet cut it 65% the next quarter. I no longer trust any statements made by Atlantic Power. In terms of risk/reward, Atlantic Power carries massive risk, with relatively little return. Atlantic Power may rebound, but it could also continue its decline. The information needed to determine the DCF provided by the sold Florida assets was located on pages 55 and 56 of the 2010 10-K. I ask, why was this information not provided in any of the recent shareholder presentations? Also, what other surprises could Atlantic Power have in store for its shareholders? There are other much less risky stocks out there, and in my opinion, they provide much better risk-adjusted returns than Atlantic Power.Disclaimer: The opinions in this article are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned.

1540562,38231,2013-07-09T13:43:47-04:00,,"Few positive things can be said about Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT). During much of 2012, Atlantic Power repeatedly reassured its shareholders about the safety and sustainability of its dividend before then slashing the dividend 65% on February 28, 2013. Atlantic Power also vastly understated the concentrated nature of its distributable cash flow. In addition, soon after reducing the dividend, Atlantic Power adopted a shareholder rights plan, also known as a 'poison pill', which is widely seen as a defensive tactic to deter a potential takeover. The market has not reacted kindly to these events, with Atlantic Power's stock down a massive 66% YTD. However, Atlantic Power still has several major downside risks, mostly associated with its large amount of debt.OverviewBefore I dive into Atlantic Power's risk factors and operating metrics, let us take a look at its current assets. Atlantic Power owns and operates several power generation facilities throughout the US and Canada. The company also owns other power generation related assets, including transmission infrastructure and minority stakes in other plants. The majority of Atlantic Power's adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow comes from its Northeast segment. Atlantic Power uses power purchase agreements, or PPAs, as part of its business model. These PPAs allow the company to lock in cash flow for years. However, these contracts also expose the company once they expire.Adjusted EBITDA and DividendAtlantic Power saw a sharp fall in profitability after it sold its Florida assets. These assets represented about 33% of its FY 2013 adjusted EBITDA. However, Atlantic Power did have projects coming online in 2013 which mostly cover this EBITDA decline. Using the midpoint for Atlantic Power's FY 2013 guidance, the company projects a 22% decline in FY adjusted EBITDA, from $333M in 2012 to about $263M in 2013.However, adjusted EBITDA is not a good measure for determining the safety Atlantic Power's dividend. Atlantic Power uses a metric called 'cash available for distribution', which I will refer to as DCF, to determine its dividend. This metric is in no way correlated to Atlantic Power's adjusted EBITDA. For FY 2012, Atlantic Power generated about $132M in DCF. However, the Florida assets represented an outsized chunk of this total. When removing these assets, Atlantic Power's DCF drops to about $55M, a decline of nearly 60%. To summarized: the Florida assets only represented 33% of adjusted EBITDA, but about 60% of DCF. Atlantic Power only received about $110M for the Florida assets, or less than 1x FY adjusted EBITDA. In essence, Atlantic Power traded away most of profitability when it sold these assets.When discussing its FY 2013 DCF guidance and payout ratios, it should be noted that Atlantic Power adds cash flow from discontinued operations to this metric. This is, in my opinion, a very unsavory tactic. By definition, these cash flows are not recurring. They will not be replicated in future years and are by nature one-time benefits. Therefore, I will be providing both an adjusted and non-adjusted version of these figures.Using Atlantic Power's numbers, it projects a dividend payout ratio of about 65% to 75% for FY 2013. However, as noted above, this figure includes cash flow from discontinued operations. Using the pro-forma basis, which excludes $44M in cash flow generated by the sold assets and adjusts the dividend for the new monthly rate of $0.033, Atlantic Power's payout ratio deteriorates to about 100%. This would put Atlantic Power current dividend firmly into the ""high-risk bracket"".However, neither of these metrics capture the true nature of Atlantic Power's dividend. Below is a chart that combines two things: it excludes the $44M in cash flow from discontinued operations and includes the 2 months of the previous dividend rate of $0.9583 per month. Note that this chart uses the midpoint for Atlantic Power's DCF from continuing operations, which can be seen in the above chart. This number is about $48.5M, or about $4.05M per month.Major Risk Factor: Massive Debt LoadEven with its stock price in the gutter, Atlantic Power still carries outsized risk. Atlantic Power has a massive amount of debt coming due in the next few years.As shown above, Atlantic Power has about $235M in debt coming due in 2014. This includes about $190M for its Curtis Palmer subsidiary debt and $45.8M (Canadian dollars) of convertible debentures, for a total of about $235m.How will Atlantic Power repay these debts? Well, the answer is a combination of about 50% debt and 50% equity, as shown below:To fund the equity portion, Atlantic Power would need to dilute its shareholders massively. 50% of $235 is about $118M. Using its current share price of about $4, Atlantic Power would need to issue at least 29.5M shares, or about 26% of its float, not including the likely discount needed to sell these shares or any related fees.Considering that Atlantic Power's current payout ratio is hovering around 100%, it seems unlikely that the company would be able to issue this many extra shares without further dividend cuts. Also note that Atlantic Power has several other large amounts of debt coming due in future years, including its massive $460M high yield unsecured notes due in 2018. It is questionable as to if anybody will even buy a high-yield bond from Atlantic Power considering its current indebtedness.The question regarding debt refinancing was brought up during Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Energy and Power Leveraged Finance Conference. (here is a link to the transcript). Below is Atlantic Power's CFO Terrence Roman's answer to the question:Again, it remains questionable if Atlantic Power will even have access to the high-yield debt market. If the company has trouble refinancing $190M in debt, imagine the trouble it will face when it has to deal with the other large debts due in 2015, 2017, and 2018.ConclusionDue to its history of misleading investors about the safety of its dividend, its weak operating performance, and massive debt, Atlantic Power is an uninvestable stock. Atlantic Power's total liabilities are nearly 6 times greater than its current market cap. Even after cutting the dividend 65% earlier this year, Atlantic Power's payout ratio is still hovering around 100%. Even with its large yield, Atlantic Power has massive risk and should be avoided.Disclaimer: The opinions in this article are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned.

1257191,45191,2013-03-07T16:06:54-05:00,,"Thus far, there are now three law firms, about which I am aware, that have launched investigations into the very questionable practices of the officers and directors of the utility company, Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT). Those firms, and their contact information, can be found by following the links listed below:AT is a small utility company based in Boston, MA that holds a portfolio of assets in the United States and Canada. Until recently, it was also one of the best dividend paying utility companies in the public marketplace. The company's stock trades on U.S. exchanges under the ticker symbol AT, and it trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ATP.On February 28th of this year, the company announced disappointing fourth quarter and year-end results, and it announced the reduction of its once lofty dividend payments. To make matters worse, the company also announced that it was seeking to adopt a shareholder rights plan, also known as a ""poison pill,"" which, in most cases, is designed to protect the company's officers and directors.After the announcements were made, the stock's price plummeted as investors ran for the doors. The stock's price had been hovering around the $10.00 per share range but, following the announcements, it quickly plunged to around $5.00 per share where it seems to have settled. The most egregious part of this story, however, and the real reason for the plunge in price, is the fact that the company's CEO had been touting the sustainability of the dividend prior to the announcements. (For a very good recap of the company's shenanigans, I am going to direct you to an article that was published by a fellow Seeking Alpha contributor which can be found here.)Though I fully expected legal proceedings to commence, I am very happy to see such swift action being taken. Personally, I have put myself in-touch with the three law firms listed above and, for anyone out there who is still a shareholder, I would encourage those reading this article to do the same. At this point in time, it would be my best guess that the poison pill will not be adopted and that lawsuits will commence in the very near future.Approximately one to one-and-one-half years ago I had a conversation with a representative in AT's Investors Relation Department. At that time, many of the company's highlights were touted and I was told that the company was a favorite investment amongst retirees, given its very generous monthly dividend payments. Now, I can only imagine the pain those retired investors must be feeling.With its market cap cut in half (more than half if one ventures back to November of last year), I would strongly suspect that AT will now be a viable take-over target, especially given its very ""green"" portfolio of assets.Those clean assets would be quite appealing to companies such a Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK), NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) or Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC). So, for those still invested in AT, holding on to your shares to allow further developments to take shape may be a prudent thing to do. That said, however, AT's problems are far from over. As can be seen in the chart below, AT's stock price decline began as far back as November of last year, which raises some questions surrounding the idea that certain investors may have known about recent developments in advance.Disclosure: I am long AT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. At the time of this post, I owned shares of AT and I was enrolled in a dividend reinvestment program with my online broker."

Further, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLU) is trading at 52-week highs. However, some utility companies have not shared the same fate, including Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT). Although this company enjoyed the favor of dividend-oriented investors due to hefty monthly dividend returns, its situation changed at the beginning of March. Its price-per-share fell from $10.00 to $7.00 in one day. The company announced in its annual report the reduction of its payout ratio, which resulted in investors losing their confidence in the company. Although investors do not show mercy to companies who reduce their dividend, several articles still suggest that a long position in Atlantic Power should be considered. Therefore, I have decided to share my research on its most recent 10-K filling, and to discuss why I believe Atlantic Power should not be considered for a long position.Note: When reading the statements, (p. X) means the 10-K page where the information is discussed.Atlantic Power, a Canadian-based utility company, is a corporation dedicated to the production and sales of electricity, mainly through ""Power Purchase Agreements"". It operates power generation facilities in Canada and the United States. On the fundamental point of view, it is trading with a P/E of 1.85, and a dividend of 7.91%. Also, it is trading below its book value of $6.11. Further, its balance sheet shows a considerable debt, with a debt ratio of 0.23. On valuation, this company may appear to be a door-buster deal to investors; however, several issues that point to a risky future will be discussed.By delving into its 10-K filling, several issues have led me to adopt a bearish position in this company. There are several risks associated with energy production and sales that will be discussed. Moreover, the company is being investigated by the IRS, and it has also been sued by a law firm. Further, other issues may push its PPS to new 52-week lows.Risks associated with energy production and salesProduction RisksAccording to its most recent earnings report, 58% of the company's electrical power output is generated by natural gas power plants (p. 3). Although the company has hedged against natural gas prices volatility, an increase in the natural gas prices will reduce its net income (p. 21). Natural gas prices have increased 33% year to date. Moreover, the company has completed the acquisition of ""Ridgeline Energy"". These facilities compose of wind and solar farms. The company generates 24% of its electrical power output through eolic power stations. In other words, if the winds are not favorable in the wind farms, the company's net income will decline (p. 23).Sales RisksAtlantic Power sells the majority of its power output through ""Power Purchase Agreements"". However, these contracts may be terminated before maturity, which would hurt the company's net income (p. 19). Besides, three PPAs are expiring in the next few years. However, even if the contracts are renewed, it does not guarantee that the company will sell its electricity at current or higher prices. If the agreement is not renegotiated, the company will see substantial losses in its net income. Further, the excess production may be sold to the grid at on-spot electricity prices, but electricity prices depend on supply and demand. Weather has an impact on electricity prices (p. 22). If the summer average temperatures are above average, customers expend more electricity for cooling purposes. Conversely, winter average temperatures should be below average, so customers consume more electricity on heating systems. Net revenue will increase only if electricity prices increase.Legal risksIn 2011, the Internal Revenue Service began an examination on the company's federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2007 and 2009 (p. 41). On April 2, 2012, the IRS issued various Notices of Proposed Agreements. Although the company intends to contest the proposed adjustments, the dispute conclusion may not favor the company. Further, several law firms have initiated class lawsuits against the company on behalf of investors. The complaint alleges that the company made false/misleading statements, or failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operation, and prospects. These prosecutions will drive the stock's price-per-share lower.The Board of Directors may be a riskSecondary public offers dilute the stock's price-per-share. The company stated that ""From time to time, we may decide to issue additional common shares"" (p. 37). On July 5, 2012, the company closed a public offering of 5.5 million shares. In my opinion, I do not like companies that have secondary offerings schemed in their futures.In addition, the company stated that the dividends are not guaranteed (p. 35). From my point of view, future dividend cuts may be on the company's future plans. Investors had Atlantic Power in their radar because it is a monthly-dividend company, but now that dividends have been cut, and future cuts are possible, dividend-seeking investors will look elsewhere.These situations will put pressure on the stock's price-per-share.Performance year-over-yearThe company's performance according to the most recent earnings report may be visualized in the following table (p. 45).The company's net loss increased from $5.40 million in 2011 to $31.90 million in 2012. Until the company reports a positive net income, long positions should not be considered in this stock.ConclusionAtlantic Power was a company favored by dividend-seeking investors before its most recent earnings report. In this manuscript, I have underlined key aspects from its 10-K filling. The company carries substantial risks involving electricity production and sales. Furthermore, it is being investigated by the IRS on its tax income returns for 2007 and 2009. In addition, several law firms started class lawsuits against Atlantic Power for failing to disclose information about the company's business. Furthermore, future dividend cuts may be in the company's future plans. In addition, the board of directors hint about the possibility of secondary public offerings. For these reasons, a sideways to bearish approach on this company ought to be considered.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1224671,34771,2013-02-26T11:33:43-05:00,,"Just recently I wrote a very brief summary article covering Atlantic Power Inc. (NYSE:AT), meant to overview the company's delightful set of assets which focus on wind, natural gas, hydro and coal. To my disappointment, I left many readers undernourished for not mentioning the company's financial health, and rightfully so. It seems there is much uncertainty regarding the sustainability of the dangerously high dividend, which yields 10.6%, and is paid monthly. In addition, the dividend has been increasing over recent years, while the company offers a 3% incentive for enrolling in the DRIP, enhancing the dividend to roughly 10.9% when enrolled.By the last metrics released by management, the company was paying out 90% to 97% of cash flows in 2012 to support the yield. Not only are these ratios high, but the large range between the high and low implies some unpredictability, perhaps due to asset sales and the company's small size:sourceMoreover, at the recent Deutsche Bank Leveraged Finance Conference, AT presented a report, in which slide 4 seemed to imply the current yield was sustainable:Asset SalesThe question is, will the dividend be cut drastically going forward, kept the same, or slightly adjusted in the near term? A concrete answer is difficult to ascertain, as the company has been fairly quiet in the last couple of months despite monster asset sales of the Auburndale and Lake facilities for just over $100 M, because of failure to secure meaningful pricing of new PPAs (contracts) for the facilities. In the press announcement, President and CEO Barry Welch, said:It was nice of Barry to highlight the positives, but what about the negatives? Delta-Person and Gregory are only small natural gas facilities, so the effect of those sales will have little bearing on the dividend. However, it is indeed disturbing that the Auburndale and Lake projects were two of the three largest individual sources of EBITDA in 2011, representing a combined total of 21% for the year, while accounting for a total of 341 net MW of power output.Facility Replacement on a MW Basis:To replace the 341 MW reduction calculated above, AT has some projects in the pipeline as well as a recent acquisition of Ridgeline, a renewable development company in Seattle, WA, with approximately 1,000 MW of wind and solar projects under development. According to past estimates, the Canadian Hill project was expected to produce just shy of 300 MW of wind power, and Piedmont was expected to generate roughly 54 MW of bio power. However, on January 2, AT announced a pleasant update:It seems the 341 MW loss should be fully replaced by the 450 net MW gained from the Canadian Hills and the Ridgeline acquisition, so depending on the pricing per MW for these new projects and when the others are officially divested, it appears there may not be a substantial shock to the company's well being. This again assumes the pricing per MW of the projects are similar.SummaryOn a MW replacement basis, the Canadian Hill project and the Ridgeline acquisition should sufficiently substitute for the loss of the three sold Florida plants. By rough calculation, I determined the 450 net MW gain from new projects should offset the 341 MW loss, but the exact conclusion is unknown until the company determines an accurate timeline, effects on debt loads, etc. Also, this replacement is reliant on similar MW pricing, which at this point is too difficult to calculate accurately. Although these uncertainties are a definite negative for the stock, one positive is the immediate replacement of natural gas assets by wind and biomass facilities. This will further position AT's portfolio into one more focused on renewable energy while reducing natural gas exposure. In addition, the Ridgeline acquisition, which was bought for a net $88 million, opens the door to even further allocate AT's portfolio to solar and wind energy sources in the future.I was enthused by management's plan to maintain the dividend as recently as October of 2012, but was thrown by its inability to accurately forecast the dividend coverage ratio, which ranged from 90%-97% just recently. I was unable to accurately determine if the dividend is subject to a reduction because of these unclear figures provided by management, especially considering the multiple sales and new projects coming online. In addition, I am concerned by its untimely silence on the subject over the past four months, despite the worst-case scenario sale of large assets coming to fruition. There will truly be much to be said on the impending conference call, scheduled for February 28 ( I hope ).AT does have solid assets with fixed costs and fairly long-term contracts. However, the razor thin, uncertain coverage ratio is an unknown investors should be wary of. On a positive note, management definitely seems to value returning cash to shareholders. Still, I feel the uncertainty has outweighed the juicy yield, and the shares have traded violently. It is also noteworthy that the dividend has been fairly consistent for the past several years.My OpinionFor those with limited a risk tolerance, waiting until management announces results and comments on the dividend on the conference call could be prudent. However, since I have a tolerance for risk, I recently initiated a small, partial position in AT after the large pullback from the mid teens. It is my opinion that the new projects coming online will more than compensate for the Florida sales, therefore sustaining the dividend. In addition, I also believe the Ridgeline acquisition provides clarity into the future of AT, considering the 1,000 MW of projects claimed to be in development.As always, this article, which again is my opinion, should not be your complete guide to investing in AT, and your investment decision should be just that - yours. Good luck.Disclosure: I am long AT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1243561,38231,2013-03-05T09:38:49-05:00,,"When I first read that Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT) had announced that it would be reducing its dividend 65%, I was quite surprised. Actually, I was in a state of semi-shock. I had previously owned this stock and had written about the Florida asset sales; however, this news forced me to quickly sell my shares. I had calculated that Atlantic Power would be able to replace most of its lost adjusted EBITDA with the new projects it had coming online in 2013. This turned out to be partially correct, as the new projects are projected to add between $45M to $65M in adjusted EBITDA while the Florida assets generated $82M in adjusted EBITDA. Using the midpoint adjusted EBITDA for the new projects of $55M, Atlantic Power was able to replace 67% of the adjusted EBITDA that it will lose once the sale of the Florida assets closes.Why then did Atlantic Power decided to lower the dividend so drastically? I explained this somewhat in the article I wrote right after the dividend news broke. Below is a summary of this previous article:Notice that I did not mention adjusted EBITDA in regards to the dividend. This is because, quite frankly, adjusted EBITDA was a useless metric. Atlantic Power's dividend safety could not be accurately determined by using adjusted EBITDA.This now begs the question: What metric could have been used to determine Atlantic Power's dividend safety? The answer to this is quite obvious: cash available for distribution (also known as distributable cash flow, ""DCF"").How much DCF were the recently sold Florida assets (Auburndale Power Partners Limited Partners ""Auburndale,"" Lake Cogen, Ltd. ""Lake,"" and Pasco Cogen, Ltd. ""Pasco"") projected to generate? To answer this, one would have had to gone all the way back to Atlantic Power's 2010 10-K. There, on page 55 and 56, you would have found the answer:Below is the key data from above:Project Cash Available for Distribution ""DCF""Auburndale $25M to $27MLake $30M to 34MUsing the midpoint for both, we arrive at $26M DCF for the ""Auburndale"" project and $32 DCF for the ""Lake"" project. This totals $58M, or about 44% of Atlantic Power's 2012 DCF. The ""Pasco"" project DCF was not mentioned, though Atlantic Power has stated in the past that this project has generated negligible DCF.Below is another excerpt from the 2010 10-K, page 55:However, this fact did not deter Atlantic Power from boosting the dividend in late 2011:source page 69Basically, the Florida assets comprised of a significant portion of Atlantic Power's DCF. Also, it was quite clear that this cash flow was expected to decline sharply in 2013. However, why was cash available for distribution ""DCF"" not mentioned anywhere on this slide from the October 2012 investor presentation?Notice that Atlantic Power chose to use the useless and irrelevant ""adjusted EBITDA"" its claim that ""Cash Flows Supported by Contracted Generation."" Below is a graph, which breaks down and displays the much more important cash available for distribution ""DCF"" for FY 2012:The blue section of the above graph is what Atlantic Power refers to as ""continuing operations,"" which are assets that the company does not plan to sell. Notice that DCF from continuing operations are less than half of the total for FY 2012.However, this does not mean that 2013 will be much different. Here is a similar graph, though using the projections and guidance for FY 2013:Atlantic Power expects that it will generate $41 - $56M in DCF in 2013 from continuing operations. Now, even though the dividend was cut 65%, Atlantic Power projects that it will have a payout ratio of about 100% on a pro forma basis in 2013.However, remember that Atlantic Power paid out its regular $0.09583 monthly dividend for the first two months of 2013, which was about $11.4M each month. Below is a chart which takes this into consideration. The dividend payments for the rest of 2013 are at the new monthly rate of $0.0334, or about $4.0M per month. The DCF from continuing operations number is basically the midpoint of the 2013 guidance, which is $49M, divided by 12, which leads to DCF from continuing operations of about $4.1M per month: ConclusionIn my opinion, the fact that the ""Lake"" and the ""Auburndale"" projects provided $58M of the $132M in FY 2012 cash flow was material information, and should have been clearly listed in the October 2012 investor presentation material.Atlantic Power has to be the least transparent company I have ever researched. The fact that one had to go back all the way to the 2010 10-K to find any hint of the cash flow provided by the Florida projects is astonishing. This information would have shown just how unsustainable the dividend actually was. Due to management's history of not sharing crucial info, investors should avoid Atlantic Power.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1151851,38231,2013-02-02T10:41:18-05:00,,"Back on November 27, I wrote my thoughts on Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT). Atlantic Power operates various power generation assets, selling electrical energy to utilities and other large commercial customers under long-term purchase agreements. Atlantic Power's goal is to generate stable cash flows to sustain and/or increase their dividend. Atlantic Power had been recovering nicely from its sharp decline after its Q3 earnings report. However, it has recently suffered a reversal, with the share price declining over 11% over the past several trading days. Atlantic Power offers a monthly dividend Cdn$0.09583 ($0.01 U.S.) per share. At current prices, the stock yields 10%.The share price reversal seemed to be triggered by the announcement of the an agreement to sell three Florida facilities.Atlantic Power intends to use the $111 million in net cash to pay off debt and for general corporate purposes. Atlantic Power had previously stated in its Q3 conference call that it expected substantial decreases in cash flow from its Lake and Auburndale projects in Florida after their PPAs expire on July 31 and December 31 of 2013, respectively. The Company anticipated that any potential new PPAs at its Lake and Auburndale projects would have been impacted by the recessionary energy market in Florida.The sale of these assets should not have come as a surprise. In the conference call, Atlantic Power CEO Barry E. Welch strongly hinted that this was a possibility:The CEO also clarified some of the reasoning for the sale in sale announcement:The Auburndale and Lake projects were two of the three largest individual sources of 2011 EBITDA for Atlantic Power, representing 11% and 10% respectfully. The Company's Pasco project, a similar sized gas facility also in Florida, signed a tolling agreement in 2008, prior to the recession, which provides approximately $4 million per year in cash distributions to Atlantic. Atlantic Power was anticipating that potential new PPAs at its Lake and Auburndale projects would not individually achieve a better result in the near-term than that of its tolling agreement with Pasco due to recessionary impacts in the Florida market. The Pasco project was part of the ""other"" category and represented 3% or less of project EBITDA.Atlantic Power has been planning for this loss in EBITDA for awhile now and they do have several projects kicking in 2013 and later that will replace it.ConclusionI think the market is overreacting to this asset sale. Atlantic Power will have new sources of cash flow kicking in 2013 that will cover the loss of the Florida assets. There was very little chance of maintaining anywhere near the levels cash flows generated by these projects in a new PPA.I took advantage of this two-day 11% price drop, and on Friday, purchased some shares in Atlantic Power. I had been regretting not purchasing shares after my article in November. I do have some concerns about the dividend payout ratio, though I think Atlantic Power will manage to keep it under 100% in 2013. You rarely see many 10% monthly dividend stocks on sale, and that makes, in my opinion, Atlantic Power a buy at under $12 a share.Disclosure: I am long AT.

1031571,38231,2012-11-27T16:46:18-05:00,,"Atlantic Power Corporation (NYSE:AT) operates various power generation assets, selling electrical energy to utilities and other large commercial customers under long-term purchase contracting agreements. The corporate strategy is to generate stable, contracted cash flows from existing assets to sustain their dividend payout to shareholders while increasing the value of the company through accretive acquisitions in North American markets. The company currently pays a monthly dividend of Cdn$0.0958 (Usd$0.0963) at an annual rate of Cdn$1.15 (Usd$1.16) per share. At the current price as of Nov. 23 of $11.89, the dividend yield for AT is a tempting 9.75%. Please bear in mind that this dividend is paid in Canadian dollars, and is subject to a 15% withholding tax for US investors.click to enlarge)When a company has such a high yield it is always wise to check if it can afford it. Atlantic Power's cash available for distribution is a key metric in measuring the sustainability of the dividend. For 3Q 2012, cash available for distribution was $28.3 million. However, total cash dividends declared to shareholders was $34.0 million in 3Q 2012. This leads to a dividend payout ratio of 120%. This is clearly not sustainable. However, the company did state that the payout ratio for the quarter was negatively impacted by the timing of a $26 million payment. This payment did not occur until the first week of October, resulting in a reduction of working capital for the third quarter.click to enlarge)As can be see from the chart above, Atlantic Power's payout ratio has fluctuated widely the last 8 quarters. From a low of 55% during Q1 2012 to a high of 249% during Q2 2012 the payout ratio for this company is unpredictable quarter to quarter. Luckily, management reaffirmed FY 2012 guidance for the payout ratio during its Q3 conference call. 2012 payout ratio guidance is a range of 90% to 97%, subject to the financial performance of the projects. Using these payout numbers and assuming a similar cash dividend of $34.0 million we can guess Q4 cash available for distribution to be in a range of $35.6 to $46.2 million.I must admit that I do not feel comfortable with a dividend payout ratio of 90-97% of free cash flow. This is especially true if you were to take a look at interest expense for Atlantic Power. Interest expense for the last 8 quarters has been climbing, reaching a high of $40 million for Q2 2012. As a percentage of revenue, interest expense is also high, averaging 17% for the first 3 quarters of 2012.click to enlarge)Earnings per share have also been trending downwards. EPS for Q3 2012 was -$0.06. EPS however is not an important metric when determining the dividend's safety due to the large amounts of non cash charges reported. A much better gauge of the health of the company is revenue. Revenue for Q3 2012 reached $154.5 million, compared with $44.7 million for Q3 2011. However, please note that this increase in revenue is primarily due to an acquisition which closed in Q4 2011, thus not reflected in Q3 2011 numbers. You can see this in the increase of shares outstanding.AT Shares Outstanding data by YChartsTax InformationConclusionThe recent drop in the share price seems overdone and may be a rare opportunity to buy this stock relatively cheap.. However, the high dividend payout ratio makes me wary of this stock. I would wait for the company to give guidance on its FY 2013 dividend payout policy before I would buy in.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1211661,34771,2013-02-21T13:37:38-05:00,,"Some may think the dividends of utility stocks aren't as attractive as in the past relative to the S&P 500. As of today, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) yields a whopping 2%, while the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLU) yields roughly 4%. I admit yield of utilities may not seem as glorious as they once were; however, there are still select utility stocks that pay out bountiful dividends by comparison to these averages. One of them is Atlantic Power Corp (NYSE:AT), which currently pays out 10% in dividends annually, but does so monthly instead of quarterly, which over time will enhance returns and reduce the ex-dividend date shock effect.Profile Summary:Atlantic Power Corp is a $1.3B market cap utility company specializing in power generation and infrastructure based mostly in the US with some Canadian assets. The net generating capacity of the company's portfolio is approximately 2,560 MW, which consists of ownership or partnerships in 33 power generating projects across 12 states and 2 provinces. In addition, AT also owns an 84-mile, 500 kilovolt electric transmission line located in California. To better summarize what fuel sources AT primarily uses, I created this chart:To add to the diverse product mix is AT's relatively equally sized asset portfolio. Out of AT's 33 power plants, not one contributed to more than 11% of 2011's Project Adjusted EBITDA:In addition, these assets have relatively stable contracts extending years into the future. As of September 2012, AT's portfolio had an average remaining PPA life of 10.1 years, with 19% of energy contracts extending 15 years or more into the future. This average contract life of assets is reasonable, providing some clarity into future earnings streams:Wind:The majority of AT's wind energy comes from its flagship assets Meadow Creek - a 120 MW wind project in Idaho - and Canadian Hills - a 298 MW wind power facility in El Reno, Oklahoma. Meadow Creek recently attained commercial operations in December, 2012, so this 57 monster turbine facility is practically brand new, and the energy they produce is contracted for 20 years to PacifiCorp. Canadian Hills has power agreements with three counterparties under which all electricity produced by the wind farm is sold at fixed prices, including: 20-year agreement with Southwestern Electric Power Company, and Grand River Dam Authority, and a 25-year agreement with Oklahoma Municipal Power. These two new, renewable plants in addition three others should provide a reliable and consistent stream of income into the future given their extended contracts and renewable energy sources.Natural Gas:It's clear the majority of AT's power is derived from Natural Gas (65%), which lately is a definite positive considering the North American glut of the fuel and low natural gas prices. AT's flagship natural gas plant, the Manchief plant located in Colorado, generates 300 MW or about 11.8% of AT's total portfolio power. This state of the art plant commenced operations in the year 2000, and has its entire output sold under a long-term contract with Public Service Colorado until 2022. If natural gas prices remain low into the future, surely AT will be a beneficiary. However, many of AT's contracts are designed to pass through increases in fuel cost fluctuations, so this is not of huge concern for investors.New Projects:To compliment diversified yet traditional power generation sources which include wind, hydro and natural gas, the company also as a 53 MW biomass project under construction in Georgia, which is near completion. AT also has several other projects in progress. AT also owns Ridgeline, a renewable development company in Seattle, WA, which has approximately 1,000 MW of wind and solar projects in development.Final Thoughts:If you are looking for exposure to the utility sector, or just need a big yield to charge your portfolio, Atlantic Power Corporation is a reasonable option for most investors. With a North American-based, diverse portfolio focusing on mostly natural gas, wind power, with minimal exposure to coal and none to nuclear, AT should be safe from the wrath of the EPA and other regulatory outfits, as well as the unpredictable nature of foreign markets and other risks present in other utility companies. This diverse, reliable portfolio combined with predictable revenue streams derived from long term contracts allow for management to reward shareholders with 10% yearly, however in monthly payments which in my opinion only makes AT that much more appealing. After the recent drop in shares, AT is worth at least a small position in my opinion.Disclosure: I am long AT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1241031,38231,2013-03-01T15:29:56-05:00,,"On February 28, Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT) reported its Q4 and full year 2012 results. Included in the report was the announcement of a dramatic shift in Atlantic Power's dividend strategy and 2013 financial outlook. Atlantic Power will now be paying a $0.033 dividend starting with the March payment, a 65% cut from previous levels. Its 2013 guidance was also negative, with distributable cash flow ""DCF"" much lower than 2012 levels. In addition, Atlantic Power also announced that it had adopted a shareholder rights plan -- also known as a poison pill. This plan will greatly lower the chance of a possible takeover or buy out of Atlantic Power. Shares of Atlantic Power have declined sharply to this series of news, falling 30% as of this writing.(Click to enlarge)For Q4 2012, Atlantic Power reported a net loss of $58M, or $0.50 per share, compared with a loss of $0.27 per share for Q4 2011. For FY 2012, Atlantic Power reported a loss of $112M, or $0.97 per share, compared with a loss of $0.50 per share for FY 2011. For FY 2012, the dividend payout ratio was 100% compared to 109% for FY 2011. The payout ratio for FY 2012 was within Atlantic Power's guidance of 96% to 102%.Even though Atlantic Power reported a loss for the year, this was not the cause for Friday's sell-off. Atlantic Power was an income stock, with a high dividend yield paid monthly. By reducing the dividend 65%, Atlantic Power has basically thrown that away. Even at a $7.00 share price, Atlantic Power would only yield 5.7%.As recently as November 6, 2012, Atlantic Power had been giving reassurances about the sustainability of the dividend. Below are a few quotes from CEO Barry E. Welch regarding the dividend:From the November 6, 2012 Q3 Conference Call (link)(Click to enlarge)From the August 10, 2012 Q2 Conference Call (link)Another cause for Friday's sell-off was the abysmal 2013 guidance that Atlantic Power provided:(Click to enlarge)Note that the projected 2013 adjusted EBITDA is actually expected to increase to $250 - $275M, from the $226M reported in 2012. Note that the EBITDA metric excludes the earnings generated by the recently sold Florida assets.However, what I found to be the most worrisome was the dramatic decline in projected distributable cash flow (NYSE:DCF). However, even with the increase in EBITDA, DCF is expected to decline to $85 - $100M, from the previous 2012 level of $132M.With the 65% dividend reduction, Atlantic Power now projects a 65%-75% dividend payout ratio for 2013. However, this payout ratio is very misleading since it includes approximately $44M in cash flow from discontinued operations. Indeed, the discontinued operations represented $77M, or 58% of the 2012 DCF. Excluding the cash flow from the discontinued operations, the 2013 dividend payout ratio would be 100% and the 2012 payout ratio would have been 240%.Let us do some quick math:According to the Q3 2012 10-Q, the discontinued operations (which were located in the Southeast segment) generated $69.9M in EBITDA for the first 9 months of 2012. Now, when we annualized this, we arrive at $93.1M in EBITDA. Now, subtracting the Orlando operations (which were not sold) of $9M EBITDA, we arrive at $84.1M million in FY 2012 EBITDA. Atlantic Power claims that these $84.1M in EBITDA generated $77M, or 58%, of its 2012 DCF. That means that the other $226M in EBITDA generated only $55M, or 42%, of its 2012 DCF. In terms of gross margin, the discontinued operations generated 91.6%, while the other operations generated only 24.3%. Let me just say that I find this hard to believe. Atlantic Power needs to provide a more detailed breakdown of how it determines its cash available for distribution and how each project affects this metric.(Click to enlarge)Finally, Atlantic Power adopted a shareholder rights plan, also known as a ""poison pill"" provision. It will effectively be giving Atlantic Power the power to deter takeovers, which in my opinion, can only be seen as an attempt by management to keep their jobs.ConclusionAtlantic Power has failed its shareholders. The CEO has repeatedly misled its shareholders about the safety and sustainability of the dividend. Why did they raise the dividend early in 2012 only to cut it now? Nowhere in any of its investor presentations did Atlantic Power bother to mention that about 28% of its assets generated 52% of its cash available for distribution.

I do not wish to own a company that blatantly misleads its shareholders.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

But that didn't stop management from trying to mine more electric gold in the US, launching a roughly USD1 billion bid for New York State-based electric and gas distribution utility CH Energy Group Inc (NYSE: CHG).That offer still has a ways to go before consummation, needing approval from often-contentious Empire State regulators as well as the increasingly unpredictable Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And it also faces potential opposition from some shareholders, who want Fortis to pay more.The prospect of having to pay more--as well as conceding to regulatory demands--is a good reason for caution on Fortis stock, despite the company's fairly robust fourth-quarter earnings. Fortunately, it's far from the only Canadian company making a power move into the US.Atlantic Power Corp's (NYSE: AT) merger with Capital Power LP, for example, more than doubled its market capitalization and generating capacity. That's dramatically diminished its former dependence on individual power sales contracts, such as two set to expire in Florida by 2014.And it's left the company in prime shape to continue its robust expansion on both sides of the border.In January, Atlantic bought a 51 percent interest in Canadian Hills Wind LLC, whose primary asset is a 300 megawatt wind power facility in Oklahoma. Construction is set to begin on the project by April at a total project cost of roughly CAD460 million. It will go into service in November, in plenty of time to earn wind power tax credits, which will expire for new projects at the end of 2012 if they're not extended.That's a timely move to lock in long-term, stable cash flows--output is fully contracted for 20 years--that is only possible thanks to Atlantic's greater post-merger scale.Ditto the company's investment in late 2011 for a 30 percent interest in an 80 megawatt wind facility in Idaho.As was the case pre-merger, Atlantic's post-merger power mix is still heavily weighted toward natural gas.This should prove to be a huge added advantage to the company going forward, as it's able to lock in much lower fuel prices for its facilities, undercutting wholesale power market rivals on price while preserving or even padding margins.That's a smart strategy for a Canadian company doing a booming US business.The addition of Canadian assets does provide a natural currency hedge to the US assets that contribute the bulk of Atlantic's cash flow. But management has consistently shown itself adept at limiting currency exposure in some very wild times, by virtue of knowing at all times where its cash is coming from.Atlantic promised a 3 percent to 5 percent dividend increase when it completed the Capital merger. The company rewarded dividend investors, delivering 5 percent-plus. That's the kind of achievement I expect to see from this company for a long time to come, as it takes what the market gives it to boost shareholder value.For more on investing in high-yield Canadian companies, check out my free Canadian REITS report.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
36331,20219,2007-05-23T15:16:18-04:00,,"At first I was going to list all the M&A deals announced to date this year and then realized that this would be the longest article I had ever written in my life. The markets are definitely different this year. I can still recall the numerous times throughout 2006 that upon reading about an acquisition I would mutter to myself the words 'nice move'. I have yet to mutter these words this year.
While contemplating how to construct a useful commentary that would catch the essence of what is going on in the markets, I recognized that this is not just a US market phenomenon. It is global. Hence, one scenario below covers none US companies.
Such being the case I put forward three hypotheses that attempt to explain the current situation.


The Insane
I doubt very much that there is an analyst alive that would categorize the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) $6 billion acquisition of AQuantive (AQNT) anything other than insane. There have been numerous articles written about this including various attempts to explain Microsoft's rationale behind the acquisition price. None resonate the truth nor quell the uneasiness that swirl in our hearts and minds.
A macro global analysis that explains this particular M&A move and sheds light on the broader picture encompassing dozens of deals globally may help put things into perspective.
What Microsoft is signaling is that cash is overvalued. What appears to be a dollar today is really 25 cents in a few years from now. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) apparently is more bullish about the future and estimates that a dollar today is worth about 50 cents just around the corner.
In order not to confuse the issue, both Microsoft and Google are signaling that ALL currencies are overvalued, not just the US dollar. It is the flight from paper currencies and demand for hard assets that is fueling the M&A activity. Some currencies may devalue faster than others but all will devalue never-the-less. The fundamentals behind this are; accumulated deficits and monetary policy. Everyone is running a deficit, not just the United States. After years of accumulating debt, coupled with no other means to continue the show without the printing presses, something has to give and that something is paper currencies.
The question is, how much?
According to bullish Google, the true rationale for buying DoubleClick for $3.1 billion is that in reality it paid only $1.55 billion when taking into account the value of currency in a few years time. When putting this into perspective, this is still a bold play as DoubleClick had only $150 million in revenue (yes - revenue, not profits) last year. Due to the constant slide in currencies, time is of the essence. The longer a company sits on cash, the higher the risk that more notice the intrinsic value. Google did not flinch at the fact that it had depleted its entire cash reserves. On the contrary, this is exactly what they intended on doing; getting rid of the cash.
The more bearish Microsoft sees things differently. One of the theories floated was that Microsoft wanted to stun the world and prove that it would not be bullied by Google. Therefore, as the theory goes, they intentionally overpaid for AQuantive. Nonsense!
There are cheaper ways to pull off a PR stunt and one should give Microsoft a little credit. The rationale behind the $6B price tag is that they are paying only $1.5B in relative terms. In a few years time, $6B today will be $24B in nominal terms. Getting rid of the overvalued cash in a way that can generate future positive cash flows in larger nominal numbers is of the essence.
According to this hypothesis, only companies that have the potential to generate substantial cash flows are up for acquisition. Companies that need extensive cash outlays are not going to be acquired, at least not at this stage of the game. The objective is to get hold of as much cash as quickly as possible and promptly spend it. Acquiring assets that generate hefty cash flows further enable additional acquisitions of new cash producing hard assets.
Likewise, companies that continuously issue new stock to finance their operation are not good acquisition candidates. In addition, companies that report top line revenue growth that are dependant on high payrolls, resulting in little bottom line improvement are not good acquisition candidates. Excess cash generation is the key.
This also explains Berkshire's foray into the railroads. True to his nature, Buffett is acquiring hard assets realizing that these cash generating assets are not going to be replaced with new technology anytime soon. No matter what the price is today, in a few years from now, the cash value will be higher as it will take more suitcases of cash to acquire the same asset.
This would explain why so many companies are buying back their shares. Getting rid of the cash through a share buyback is actually better for investors than declaring a dividend. In the long term, unless investors are going to reinvest the dividends, the nominal share price will increase in tandem with the devaluation of currency, keeping pace with the underlying value behind the stock certificate.
This does not explain Google's purchase of YouTube unless there is a way to turn YouTube into a cash cow.


The Bad
A slightly different hypothesis is along the lines that inflation is higher than reported yet we are not in the throws of a major currency crunch. According to this school of thought, all stocks are undervalued as they have not kept up with true inflation.
The recently announced Alltel (NYSE:AT)  acquisition for $71.50 cash per share ($27.5B) demonstrates this theory. Goldman Sachs Group is a banker, not tech geeks. The rationale behind the purchase is to flip the company once industry consolidation sets in. A quick check reveals that no less than three competitors use the same technological infrastructure as Alltel. China's Unicom (NYSE:CHU) may not be in a position to enter the US marketplace today but there is no telling what the situation will be in a few years from now. With the newly found 'bigger is better' atmosphere, AT&T (NYSE:T) wouldn't face much opposition should it desire to devour Alltel. Sprint (NYSE:S) is also in the running.
On the surface, Alltel has only 12.1 million customers yet boasts the largest geographical footprint in central and south-west US. Until consolidation is on the table, Goldman Sachs can use Alltel to make further acquisitions. Alltel has a very strong balance sheet with little debt. More enticing is the strong cash flow. Loading up the balance sheet with debt and then flipping the company including the debt is probably the long term plan.
Taking DoubleClick as a precedent for return on investment percentages, Goldman Sachs expects to flip this company within three years at a 90% nominal premium including the assumption of (moderate) debt. With little intentions of actually investing in this business and with every intention of milking the business for what it's financially worth, it is relatively transparent that Goldman values the demise of paper currencies (in this case the US dollar) to be in the vicinity of  60 to 70 cents to the dollar today.
This reflects a 4% to 6% compounded discrepancy between the reported inflation and actual inflation from 2002 to 2007 (EOY). If incorrect and inflation is as reported, the current value would be $20.2B, not $27.5B.


The Ugly
With all the merger mania being reported in the media, it was not surprising to see the headlines regarding the purchase of Israeli pharmaceutical company, Taro (TAROF.PK). As expected, the media concentrated on the 27% premium ($7.75 cash) being paid by Indian Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (BSE: 524715) for the company.
What was omitted was the fact that Taro was trading at $10.60 just last January. More to the point is the omission that Taro was thrown off the NASDAQ due to insider trading allegations. The same people behind the insider trading scandal are behind the sale to Sun. Franklin Advisers, Inc. and Templeton Asset Management Ltd. (9% shareholders with no voting power) attempted to thwart the deal as they felt that minority shareholders were getting shafted. After their first taste of the Israeli judicial system, the two may think twice before making any new substantial investments in hard assets in Israel.
What is more intriguing is that once Taro is sold to Sun, the company can tell the SEC to kiss them where the sun doesn't shine. Sun is listed in India.
More to the point is that even companies that are up to their necks in foul play seem to be able to get acquired based on globalization. In this case, technological know-how is needed by Sun. In the US, Taro would have a much lower acquisition value as US companies would value Taro for its pharmaceutical portfolio and place no value on its manufacturing know-how and knowledge of the inner workings of the FDA.
According to this hypothesis, US equities need to be valued based on foreign valuations. If standard average P/E ratios are double the US average, eventually US equities will either match overseas valuations or be acquired by overseas companies. Globalization dictates that eventually it all evens out. Of course there is the possibility that Indian, Japanese and Chinese valuations can come down to current US standards, but I wouldn't bet on it just yet.
Take Your Pick
Whether you are 'insane' and anticipate 200% over the next two years or 'bad' and settle for 90% and a money back upfront loan or just plain 'ugly' for a 100% gain, the bottom line is - the market is heading up. Call it technical, call it insane, call it inflation, call it what you like, just pick any dozen stocks and ride the wave.

1031841,35111,2012-11-28T19:15:42-05:00,,"With the announcement of 3rd quarter results and weaker management guidance, Atlantic Power (NYSE:AT) share prices were hammered this month, falling from $15 to $12. This haircut makes AT an intriguing value play for those who can stomach additional volatility and who have patience for a turnaround. While the third quarter operating numbers were within expectations, future guidance offered by management was far from rosy.Atlantic Power is a small-cap merchant power electrical producer with assets in Canada and the U.S. Ninety-six percent of power generated is from ""clean"" resources, including biomass, wind, hydro, and natural gas. AT generates 2,140-MW of electricity from 31 sites. Including projects under development, natural gas comprises 67% of generating capacity, wind 16%, biomass 8%, hydro 5% and coal 4%. A detailed list by facility is found here, and below is a map of generating locations by fuel source:For the third quarter, AT reported revenues of $154.5 million, which was 6% below expectations. EBITDA clocked in at $77.2 million for the quarter, also below estimates of $82 million. Funds from Operations (FFO) were in line at $0.34 per share, while earnings per share were $-0.06 versus an anticipated $-0.02. While not a stellar quarter, management's guidance is what has spooked investors.The main concern lies in the expiration of purchase power agreements (PPA) at the gas-fired Auburndale and Lake facilities in Florida. The PPAs expire next year and the renegotiation will result in lower prices and much reduced cash flow. Previous estimates by management implied they were expecting a 60% drop in FFO from these two facilities, but are now expecting a steeper decline of about 80%. Management's current cash flow guidance for 2014 is $4 million each facility or $8 million combined, versus estimated combined 2012 cash flow of $63 million. This sharp drop rattled the Street with numerous downgrades along with price target and FFO estimate reductions.When utilities offer substantially lower forward guidance, the discussion of a dividend cut is usually put on the table. AT is no different. Currently, AT pays a monthly dividend of $0.095 per share for an annual rate of $1.15. The reduction in FFO from the re-negotiation of PPAs outlined above could equate to a substantial $0.44/share. With the current payout ratio of almost 100% of FFO, it becomes obvious that the current dividend is at risk - all else being equal.However, all else is not equal. There are two important projects coming onstream this quarter that will increase companywide generating capacity by about 15%. According to management, the Piedmont biomass project and the Canadian Hills wind project should add $24 to $29 million in FFO next year. Contractual arrangements concerning natural gas hedging at the 50%-owned Orlando facility could add an additional $14 to $18 million in FFO in 2014. Combined, these will offset $38 to $47 million of the anticipated $55 million reduction in FFO from the two expiring PPAs.In addition, the company plans to divest non-core assets, with one sold during Q3/12 and three more currently up for sale. In September, Atlantic sold its 50% interest in the 46-MW Badger Creek facility for $3.7 million. Non-core assets that are currently for sale include Atlantic's 17% interest in the 400-MW Gregory facility and its 40% interest in the 132-MW Delta Person asset; these are being sold together with the interests of the other partners in the projects. Atlantic is also conducting a sale process for its Path 15 transmission line. The company is accepting bids for the asset, and anticipates a sale during Q1/13. Proceeds for these assets could total around $120 million.Redeployment of invested capital could help make up the anticipated FFO shortfall. AT recently announced the purchase of an additional wind farm, Ridgeline Energy Holdings, from Veolia for $88 million. Management expects Ridgeline to generate $9 to $12 million in additional FFO.Comparing Atlantic Power's share price decline with two other dividend-at-risk utilities, Exelon (NASDAQ:EXC) and Capstone Energy (MCQPF.PK, CSE.TO) is outlined below:It is interesting that each has declined about 30% as the market began to focus on the operating risks in relation to the dividend. AT and EXC have not announced dividend cuts, while MCQPF has officially cut its dividend. It would seem the worst of the decline for Atlantic Power's share price is behind us. EXC's current yield is 7.4%, AT's current yield is 9.6% and MCQPF's current yield is 7.3%AT's home exchange is on the Toronto Exchange, although it is headquartered in Boston, MA, and is also traded on the NYSE. Results are stated in Canadian Dollars and dividends are subject to a 15% Canadian withholding tax for positions held in non-tax advantaged accounts. The withholding tax is offset by a credit when filing personal returns. The withholding tax does not apply when held in tax advantaged accounts, such as IRAs.The latest investor presentation can be found here (pdf) and the 3rd quarter earnings announcement is found here (pdf).As a contrarian high-risk utility selection, AT could offer an interesting future with a 9.6% current yield and the potential for a minimum 30% capital gain if the dividend proves to be sustainable. At worst, the dividend could be cut by 25% and a reduced dividend is already priced into the stock.Disclosure: I am long AT, EXC, MCQPF.PK.

27563,20364,2007-02-20T15:23:13-05:00,,"Independent U.S. wireless operator Alltel (NYSE:AT) today reported 4th quarter (December) results above analysts’ expectations, and better-than-expected numbers on customer turnover, at least according to one analyst with a note out this morning.    Alltel’s 63 cents of profit per share, excluding some items, was nicely ahead of Thomson Financial’s consensus estimate of 59 cents, while sales of $2.1 billion came in ahead of the average estimate of $2.04 billion. What helped the company was a higher-than-expected 228,000 new subscribers, says Prudential Equity Group’s Richard Klugman, and a churn rate — how much customers abandon the company’s service — came in at 1.5%, below Klugman’s expectation of 1.7%. Operating profit was 37% of sales, better than Klugman had expected, and even leaving out the company’s recent acquisition of Midwestern Wireless, sales growth of 8% year-on-year was strong. So, with a rather high P/E multiple of between 8x and 9x this year’s estimated operating profit, does all this sweeten the deal for a buyout of Alltel buy leveraged buyout shops, being as the company is one of Citigroup’s favorite LBO targets? Well, in a post back in early January, I said that Goldman Sachs’s options trading group was recommending “strangles” that would place a buyout at around $65. Klugman’s price target today on the shares is $66, and the shares currently are up 2.58% at $61.99.

4375146,24361,2020-09-18T11:59:12-04:00,"Although non-resi construction activity has held up better than expected, COVID-19 is still hitting AYI, pushing fiscal Q3 revenue down 20% and likely pushing Q4 down by a mid-teens percentage.The non-residential new-build pipeline is looking weak, and I am concerned that Acuity will see lower levels of market demand in 2021 and 2022.Far-UVC is a significant wildcard. The technology has been shown to safely kill viruses (like SARS-CoV-2), and Acuity has partnered with Ushio to offer Far-UVC systems later this year.Widespread adoption of Far-UVC lighting could create a large retrofit revenue opportunity for Acuity, but the technology is not yet widely known and may amount to little or nothing for Acuity's shareholders.Acuity still looks undervalued on its core business (excluding any potential upside from Far-UVC), but lighting is an unpopular business and without Far-UVC catching on, this could be a value trap.","The going remains tough for Acuity Brands (AYI). While I don’t really love the business, I thought back in January that the valuation seemed low relative to even modest (low single-digit) long-term growth assumptions, but the shares have since underperformed the industrial group, perhaps due to the company’s high exposure to non-residential new-build construction and relatively little exposure to green building retrofits, as the LED upgrade cycle is largely mature.Now there’s a new potential driver to consider – Far-UVC lighting as a retrofit product for building hygiene. Unlike conventional UVC systems, Far-UVC lighting systems can kill viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, but are still safe to use while the building is occupied. Given the sheer installed base for potential retrofits, this could provide an important spark to Acuity’s story in calendar 2021 – and the stock really could use a spark, as although it continues to look undervalued on undemanding expectations, the Street has shown it really isn’t interested in commercial lighting businesses.UVC lighting has been used for some time to disinfect spaces, but its use has largely been confined to areas like healthcare or mass transit where the lighting can be used at “off times” to disinfect unoccupied areas – while UVC is an effective pathogen-killer, it is also dangerous to humans, animals, and plants, with potential damage to skin, eyes, and other systems.Recent tests of Far-UVC lighting, which operates at 207-222nm versus most UVC lights which operate at 254nm, have shown some promising results. While testing conducted by Signify (OTCPK:PHPPY) and Boston University that showed UVC could kill SARS-CoV-2 wasn’t so surprising (it was already known that UVC can kill coronaviruses), Columbia University has come out with research showing that not only can Far-UVC effectively kill cornonaviruses, it can do so without harming humans, animals, or plants – opening up the possibility of installing lighting systems in all manner of commercial and institutional buildings, including offices, schools, and retail locations, not to mention healthcare facilities and public transit.To the best of my knowledge, Acuity does not have its own internal Far-UVC technologies, but it did sign a strategic alliance with Ushio back in June to combine its lighting fixtures with Ushio’s Care222 Far-UVC module for the U.S. market. Given Acuity’s strong presence in the market, it seems like a natural partnership, and Acuity could well see significant demand for these products when they make them available later this year.It’s hard for me to say how big this could be for Acuity. It would make sense to me for healthcare, public transit, long-term care, and possibly educational facilities to use this technology, particularly in areas like entryways, elevators, and places where people congregate (waiting areas, etc.), but I’m not quite as sure what commercial operators may do. I’m sure there will be early adopters in verticals like offices and retail, and if those installations are seen to drive competitive advantages in terms of rent/occupancy, it’s a pretty safe bet that others will jump on board. By the same token, I do see a risk that at least some potential customers will put their eggs in the “we’ll just wait for the vaccine, save our money, and hope it all goes away” basket.Construction activity has remained surprisingly robust through 2020, but Acuity did see an impact from COVID-19 in the fiscal third quarter (revenue down 20%), and with management commenting on some business being pulled forward in that quarter, a revenue decline in the mid-teens for the next quarter seems plausible to me, along with some additional gross margin deleverage, offset in part by operating cost reductions.My concerns are more about what calendar 2021 and 2022 hold for the company. A variety of data sources, including the Dodge Momentum index and bank loan data, are pointing to a shrinking pipeline of new projects for 2021 and 2022, and I believe the uncertainties created by COVID-19 and the election cycle are leading many to hold off on new non-residential project commitments. With over half of Acuity’s business driven by new-builds (not to mention a heavy exposure to office buildings and other commercial properties), I believe Acuity could be looking at a tough environment for its core lighting products for a couple of years.Longer term, the company does have some modest leverage to IoT (Atrius) and building lighting controls (Sensor Switch), but this isn’t a building controls/automation play like Johnson Controls (JCI) or Honeywell (HON), and I don’t see Acuity getting a particularly significant lift from a green retrofit cycle in commercial buildings – a lot of those benefits came with the LED replacement/retrofit cycle.COVID-19 and the weakness I now expect in non-residential new-builds does impact my model, reducing my long-term annualized revenue growth rate from around 2.5% to closer to 2%. I do still expect some margin uplift from SKU rationalization, cost restructurings, and efforts to shift the revenue mix towards more controls and software over time, but I expect FCF growth will be in the low single-digits.And again, the Far-UVC story is an important wildcard. I’m not explicitly modeling it as a separate line-item, and I don’t know what the transfer pricing agreement between Ushio and Acuity looks like, but meaningful market adoption could perhaps drive 10% revenue upside for at least a couple of years if this resembles the LED retrofit cycle to at least some extent.Again, I want to emphasize “wildcard” – I see a bull-case scenario where Far-UVC retrofits drive a meaningful upsurge in revenue, profits, and cash flow, but I can also see a bear-case scenario where the technology is never adopted to any meaningful extent and it really has no financial impact. Time will tell, and a lot may depend on what happens with virus transmission rates into next spring/summer and whether this technology gets enough attention that there’s a wider public call (or even mandates) for it.On an as-is basis, Acuity Brands looks priced for a double-digit annualized return, and that’s enough potential to get my attention in a market where most industrial names are expensive. Lighting is a special case, though, and the market has shown that it is not excited about the weak core growth prospects, nor willing to pay much of a multiple for the stocks. That remains a definite overhang for Acuity Brands and a risk investors must consider – while Far-UVC could drive meaningful upside to numbers relatively quickly, absent that sort of spark, this could well become a value trap."
4316243,24361,2020-01-10T15:42:44-05:00,"Acuity shares were hammered as revenue came up short on a double-digit volume decline and management warned of weaker demand in the non-residential vertical.
        Management realizes that selling lighting fixtures isn't going to get Acuity very far, but the shift toward selling more controls, software, and IoT-enabled systems hasn't yet taken off.
        Acuity shares look surprisingly cheap on FCF, suggesting the market may be overly pessimistic about the value of the business as a going concern.","The markets typically care more about margins than revenue … until they don’t. While Acuity Brands (AYI) once again did well on the margin lines, the market seemed more than just spooked by the severe year-over-year erosion in volume. I’d also assume that the weaker call on non-residential construction, one of the markets expected to be stronger for multi-industrials this year, didn’t exactly help matters.I don’t love lighting as a business and I think Acuity has a long way to go before its more sophisticated control and IoT businesses kick in meaningful contributions. Even so, I’m surprised the shares trade where they do. I mean, I get that the market doesn’t like lighting stories, but that seems overdone here. It’s tough to buy into a sector that I don’t really like, and I know the undervaluation here could persist (particularly if volume stays so weak), but the valuation is enough to make this a name to keep watching.Acuity shares tend to have outsized reactions to earnings and this was no exception, with the stock getting hammered (down 14%) in response to weak revenue, weak reported EPS, and less than encouraging commentary on the construction market.Revenue fell more than 10%, missing expectations by more than 4%. On an organic basis, revenue contracted an ugly 13%, with volume down 16% and only mitigated to a minor extent by the 3% improvement in price/mix. While this is only the third volume contraction in the last eight years, it’s the second in a row and the magnitude is pretty startling.Management noted that retail was down sharply (down over 37%), with volumes hammered by ongoing SKU rationalization (eliminating lower-margin products) and tough year-ago comps from the Lowe’s (LOW) load-in. In the independent/direct channel (which makes up the bulk of the business), sales were down 6% as the 10-Q shows a 5% decline independent sales and a 15% decline in the direct sales network. Revenue in the traditional lighting business was down 15%, while LED lighting revenue was down 8%.Despite the very weak sales backdrop, SKU rationalization drove almost three and a half points of improvement in gross margin, with Acuity beating expectations by over two points. Operating income declined 11% on an adjusted basis, but still came in more than 2% ahead of expectations and 100bp better on margin, leading to a $0.06/share beat at this line. I will note, though, that I can’t be entirely certain that the third-party reports of average sell-side estimates are using the adjusted number, which would magnify the apparent beat. Clearly the reaction in the stock price would tell you that investors weren’t cheering the operating results.With double-digit declines in volume, it seems reasonable to assume that Acuity is losing share. Acuity is the first to report in this cycle, so we’ll see what Eaton (ETN), Signify (OTCPK:PHPPY), and Hubbell (HUBB) have to say, but I don’t think they’re going to be reporting double-digit declines, even as Hubbell goes through its own SKU rationalization program.Frankly, I don’t care much if Acuity is losing share in low-margin lighting products. That business isn’t worth a lot anyway and competition from foreign suppliers isn’t going to get any easier.What I do care about is the commentary about weaker-than-expected core market conditions. Acuity management said that market conditions in construction were weaker than expected this quarter, with particular weakness in larger projects in commercial construction, renovation, and infrastructure. All told, management indicated a low-to-mid single-digit underlying decline. That’s worrisome because non-residential construction was supposed to be one of the few relatively solid markets in the U.S. this year; growth was expected to slow, yes, but still stay positive in the low-to-mid single-digits.If non-residential construction activity is falling off more than expected, that’s bad news for a host of companies – including the likes of Honeywell (HON), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), Ingersoll-Rand (IR), Johnson Controls (JCI), and Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY). Of course, lighting and lighting controls is just a piece of the overall market and the various segments can move in different directions – in other words, lighting can be weak and HVAC and/or building controls can still be relatively healthy. Still, it’s definitely a new concern to monitor as we go into the reporting cycle.As I said in the open, I’m no great fan of the lighting business. When you look at the market opportunity for luminaires and off-board controls, it’s an increasingly commodified market, particularly with LED penetration now over two-thirds. Said differently, it’s tough to make a value-added growth business out of selling lighting fixtures.Acuity knows this, has known this for a while, and is trying to work around it. The company has been building up its offerings in embedded controls, “intelligent lighting”, networked controls, software, and IoT. Some think that lighting systems could be a preferred method of installing and managing sensor and data collection networks through commercial and industrial buildings, and Acuity has definitely been investing in capabilities like indoor positioning, asset tracking, visualization, and analytics (using occupancy and movement data to optimize facility ops). With electrical costs a significant portion of building operating costs, and HVAC in particular being a significant cost, optimizing building operations could be a real opportunity.I’m just not convinced Acuity is going to be the one to lead that initiative. A lot of companies have their hat in this ring, including Honeywell, Emerson (EMR), Ingersoll-Rand, Johnson Controls, and Schneider, and by Acuity’s own admission, sales of “Tier 3 and Tier 4” products (connected solutions, software, IoT and the like) are still a small part of the overall mix.My modeling assumptions suggest less than 3% long-term revenue growth for Acuity, with ongoing pressure in the legacy lighting business. I’m also assuming that while this portfolio rationalization effort will help gross margins, as will increased sales of controls, software, and other more advanced products, there’s still going to be overall margin pressure on the business limiting long-term operating margins to the mid-teens and long-term FCF margins to the low double-digits. With that, my long-term FCF growth rate is in the very low single-digits.Even with those assumptions, the shares look priced for a roughly 10% annualized return, and a margin/return-driven EV/EBITDA approach suggests even more potential upside. I will note, though, that Eaton did not get a particularly robust multiple for its Lighting business (high single-digit EBITDA multiple) and Signify does not trade at a robust forward multiple either. In other words, lighting is a sub-sector of the market where valuations are structurally lower (likely due to lower intrinsic growth and margin potential).What should investors do with Acuity? With the free cash flow I expect, Acuity could buy back about 8% of its shares in this fiscal year if management wanted to, and similar levels in the years to follow. Maybe I’m underestimating further volume erosion and/or overestimating margins, but it seems like the business is undervalued on a FCF basis. At a minimum, Acuity should be able to acquire some growth in the controls and IoT space if it wishes to do so. It’s tough to buy into a business I’m not crazy about (and that Wall Street clearly has some issues with), but I’m puzzled as to what I might be missing with valuation or whether this really is an intriguing value/GARP opportunity after this post-earnings sell-off."
4378763,105526,2020-10-13T02:30:48-04:00,"Acuity Brands posts a relatively resilient FQ4 earnings report, but pricing pressures remain a concern.The business is well-capitalized, but the priority remains on investing for growth rather than capital return to shareholders.Shares are not quite cheap enough at current levels.","Acuity Brands (AYI) had a surprisingly resilient quarter overall, but while margins remained stable, price/mix continue to trend negatively, with management guidance calling for more of the same into the coming fiscal year. The guided Y/Y weakness is mainly down to COVID-19 headwinds against a period in which AYI has typically raised prices in previous years. Additionally, a slow recovery in construction and major projects looks set to weigh on AYI’s recovery prospects, and therefore, I expect more pricing and margin pressure going forward. Current valuations are not yet cheap enough to justify the challenged AYI outlook.AYI posted a strong beat on the top-line, with Y/Y declines of -5% beating undemanding consensus expectations. While revenue remains on the downtrend, FQ4 is still a solid improvement over the -18% Y/Y result in FQ3. On a Q/Q basis, revenue grew 15%, which may offer bulls hope of a recovery on the horizon. But I think it’s worth noting that on an organic basis, sales suffered a steeper -8% Y/Y decline. Similarly, volume declined 4% Y/Y on the back of COVID-19-driven market weakness.By channel, sales through independent networks were flat but were boosted by a c. 3% benefit from acquisitions (implying negative organic growth Y/Y). Most of the top-line strength came from retail channels (+7% Y/Y), which offset underperformance in direct channels (-12% Y/Y) and corporate accounts (-29% Y/Y). Notably, management pointed out that channel trends largely reflect the relative strength in residential end-markets and light industrial, in comparison to weakness in the heavy industrial end-market.Source: FQ4 Acuity Brands Earnings ReleaseDespite volume coming in better than expected, price/mix was still down 4% in FQ4, signaling industry dynamics remain unhealthy. Management commentary confirmed as much, suggesting this trend is set to continue into the upcoming quarter, with an especially tough comp in FQ1 (when AYI typically takes its price increases).Furthermore, AYI also noted that the price/mix weakness effectively represents a reversal of earlier price increases. This is significant because the prior price hikes were the first in years, highlighting the extent of the relative demand weakness in the aftermath of COVID-19.Nonetheless, AYI management deserves credit for its strong execution on margin for the quarter, with gross margin flat Y/Y at 42.1% despite the pricing pressure. Key margin drivers were lower input costs and acquisitions, offset by price/mix and volume declines.Source: FQ4 Acuity Brands Earnings ReleaseAYI is in decline, but still generates plenty of free cash flow – for the latest full year, AYI’s FCF reached $449 million, a significant increase Y/Y despite the pandemic. Share repurchases were also resumed in FQ4, with 687k shares repurchased for $70 million. This equates to c. 2% of shares outstanding, with an additional c. 3.9 million shares remaining in its repurchase authorization.Source: FQ4 Acuity Brands Earnings ReleaseTurning to its balance sheet, the company added c. $100 million Y/Y to its cash balance, which now stands at $561 million. With only $401 million in total debt, the company remains in a net cash position. AYI also has plenty of liquidity at its disposal, with $396 million of additional borrowing capacity on its revolver.Source: FQ4 Acuity Brands Earnings ReleaseShareholders hoping for a more substantial capital return plan will be disappointed, however, as management’s capital allocation policy continues to prioritize organic and inorganic growth over capital return to shareholders.While no specific guidance was provided, AYI did highlight its expectations for continued weakness in non-residential building activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Management did, however, note the opportunity to expand market share in fiscal 2021 by leveraging its product portfolio and investment in digital transformation.But the broader point remains that C&I project portfolio is challenged – while larger projects are resuming, smaller projects still face delays. The company also noted geographic inconsistencies across different regions of the US, with limited visibility into a recovery. Nonetheless, capex is still set to run at 1.5% of sales in the upcoming fiscal year.While AYI has historically relied on replacement demand for stability through the cycles, things have changed in recent years. At present, only half of AYI’s revenues come from new construction, which reflects the fact that the renovation cycle has structurally changed following the LED transition. As such, renovation demand looks unlikely to support AYI this time around (a key difference to previous down cycles).The scale of the non-resi downturn is also more severe this time around – renovation activity has suffered as high vacancy rates and an uncertain outlook drive dim prospects for an LED upgrade cycle. As US office vacancies were already at a multi-year-highs prior to COVID-19 and with the work from home trend appearing structural, vacancies look all set to increase further. In sum, the case for LED upgrades (relative to absorbing higher electricity cost) appears challenged in the current operating environment.While the FQ4 resilience was encouraging, it is hard to see much upside in the fiscal 2021 outlook. The macro backdrop is challenging, as evidenced by non-resi starts (which typically lead lighting sales) continuing to trend negatively in recent months. Additionally, pricing pressure could intensify as smaller competitors look to unload inventories ahead of fiscal 2021 weakness. At current valuations, AYI shares are not yet cheap enough to justify its challenged outlook.Data by YCharts"

While the market is definitely negative about the future of the business, AYI’s operating results don’t paint a grim picture.The market’s forward-looking outlook is possibly pricing-in increased competition in an otherwise commoditized market, plus the still ongoing trade dispute and COVID-19 uncertainty on non-residential and residential construction do not help matters either. However, we believe the company is taking the necessary steps to create long-term shareholder value through its product portfolio and building management solutions.AYI is a solid FCF generator. It also sports a healthy balance sheet with $520 million in cash and total long-term debt of $432 million (including operating leases). In the last quarter alone, AYI generated $163 million in cash from operations, while spending $13 million in CAPEX and with sales for the quarter dropping 18% from the prior-year period. AYI’s 10-year median FCF margin is 8.3%.With a forward EV/Sales multiple of 1.1x and a P/FCF multiple of 9.7x, AYI is selling at cheap valuations. At an FCF yield of 10%, we believe this is a good opportunity to start a small speculative position. The company’s cyclical top occurred at the end of 2017 when the market for lighting products started to slow down and continuing throughout 2019. The outlook for 2020 wasn’t positive either, with management disclosing a cautious position as they still saw sluggish demand for lightning products.With no solution to COVID-19 in sight, things went from bad to worse for AYI. A second wave could result in construction projects being delayed or outright canceled. Because we can’t time the market, our buy recommendation is solely based on valuation. The strong balance sheet plus the historical profitability of the company, even during the great recession of 08’-09’, gives us the confidence the company has staying power.Source: company filingsIf investors would only base their investment decisions by looking at the reported numbers, we believe the stock would not have underperformed as badly as it has. That is not to say the company has been without its hiccups though.However, the overall picture looks solid. AYI has grown its top-line from $1.6 billion in 2010 to $3.6 billion by 2019, for a solid compounded annual growth rate of 9%. Growth in their revenues came from tailwinds within the lighting industry, as customers began adopting new lighting technologies for power efficiency, a strong construction market, and retrofit opportunities. The company generates 98% of its sales from its North American region. Their revenue mix is evenly split between new constructions and renovations, while 85% comes from non-residential projects and only 15% from residential markets:Source: investor presentationFueling growth has been the M&A strategy at the company. During a nine-year period, AYI has spent $1.1 billion on acquisitions. As part of its acquisition strategy, the company has been diversifying its product portfolio by acquiring business in the IoT, software, and automation markets:Source: annual reportsContinuing the topic of AYI’s M&A strategy, management has made the following comments:The focus on expanding their technology footprint bear fruit with the introduction of their Atrius Integrated Solutions in 2017. Atrius is a combination of IoT business solutions, intelligent luminaires, lightning, and building management controls. If that sounds complicated, the slide below explains in layman terms what this new product does:Source: Acuity Brands YouTube channelWe believe the IoT space could become a long-term growth driver and a boost to revenues as consumers begin another upgrade cycle. Lightning is found in every public, private, and residential space, so the potential market for AYI’s solutions is big. Currently, the company has deployed the Atrius solution to over 5,000 retail stores in North America:The good thing is that AYI has a market-leading position. Management believes (as stated in their annual report) that their TAM is over $20 billion. With revenues in 2019 of $3.6 billion, that gives AYI a market share of approximately 18%. Having a significant share of the market makes it less of a challenge for AYI to introduce new services, as they already have a solid customer base. As such, we see the adoption of Atrius as accelerating in the future.Besides having growth opportunities ahead, we like how management has been able to keep operating costs under control. The rise in their COGS, which has affected gross margins, is mostly attributed to inflationary costs and the impact on tariffs which are events outside the control of management. However, the company has been able to sustain operating income margins in the mid-teens due to controlling G&A expenses, which as a percentage of sales, has decreased from 24.3% in 2010 to 20.6% in 2019, indicating operating leverage working in favor of AYI. To us, it also indicates acquisitions have been well integrated into core operations and accretive to shareholders. From 2010 to 2019, EPS has grown from $1.8 to $8.29 per share.Source: tikr.comFrom a sales multiple perspective (EV/Sales), AYI is trading for cheap. Since we can’t time the markets, we believe this is a good place to start a small speculative position. We say speculative because the broad market is acting in strange ways. While we believe AYI has long-term staying power, coupled with a high market share, we don’t feel too confident in allocating a sizeable position for a long-term hold. There are still too many unknowns and we believe the economy is not in a healthy place. A second wave from COVID-19 could result in states shutting down again, putting a halt in construction projects.That said, a good quality company at cheap prices has the potential to yield good results. We believe that is the case with AYI."
4309818,31101,2019-11-30T04:24:29-05:00,"Acuity Brands announced Monday that it is acquiring LocusLabs, maker of solutions for indoor location based applications.LocusLabs is the third indoor location related acquisition that Acuity Brands has made in recent years.Acuity's indoor location offerings use signals encoded in their LED light units to enable smartphones and other devices to calculate their locations.Acuity's move in this direction positions it strongly in this new technology area, with technology that delivers a great user experience that the market is looking for.","Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) announced on Monday that it is acquiring LocusLabs, a five-year old start-up company whose platform powers applications based on indoor location. This is Acuity Brands' third acquisition in the indoor location area, following on its April 2015 acquisition of ByteLight and its December 2015 acquisition of GeoMetri.These acquisitions are a big element of Acuity Brands' efforts in the indoor location market, where it is leveraging its share of the market, providing lighting to big box retailers such as Target (NYSE:TGT). Deploying location technology based on lighting gives high-quality results without requiring any infrastructure other than the lights that are already being installed.Acuity Brands' acquisition of ByteLight strengthened its technology for visible light communications (VLC), a method of encoding signals in LED lights which can be received by camera-equipped mobile devices and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. VLC technology enables those devices to calculate their location indoors more accurately than most other indoor (non-GPS) localization methods. (See this video for a demo from several years ago of the accuracy and responsiveness of Acuity's VLC technology). Its second acquisition of GeoMetri strengthened the company's software capabilities for mapping and location processing. This third location-related acquisition strengthens its software capabilities in navigation and other end-user location services.This acquisition makes it clear that Acuity's goal is to compete with technology leaders in the indoor localization area. Steve Lydecker, Senior Vice President of Technology at Acuity Technology Group, told me that ""this significant acquisition demonstrates Acuity's long term vision to be a global leader in the indoor positioning systems arena.""While it may seem strange for a lighting company to move into a technology market, there is a specific appeal in the case of indoor location technologies. One of the challenges in deploying indoor location services in large sites is the installation of infrastructure. While some indoor location solutions are ""infrastructure-free,"" most strong technologies that deliver accurate and fast location positioning require that some form of devices be deployed throughout the site, usually called ""beacons"" or ""locators."" If a lighting company such as Acuity Brands includes localization infrastructure in lights that are already needed in a site, there is no additional installation required for localization applications to be deployed.Acuity Brands is not the only lighting company moving into the high-tech area of indoor location. Signify (OTCPK:PHPPY) (formerly Philips Lighting) also has strong VLC-based indoor location technology (as shown in this video) and several other companies do as well. But Acuity Brands is pushing its localization offerings forward very strongly with this series of acquisitions. It has also made several other acquisitions in the lighting and manufacturing areas as well, not related to its indoor location efforts.It must be noted that VLC technology has both benefits and tradeoffs when compared to other localization technologies. Its accuracy and responsiveness is great, but the signals sent by LED lights are received by a smartphone's camera. This means that VLC uses more battery than some other technologies, and only works when a smartphone is out of a pocket/purse and able to see the light. But other indoor location technologies, with lower battery usage and in-pocket operation, are not reaching market as quickly as expected, and the improved user experience of VLC may well be worth the tradeoffs.The acquisition of LocusLabs follows a pattern in the industry, as shown in the report on indoor location related M&A by Grizzly Analytics (an analyst firm I founded). While early acquisitions in the area were focused on strengthening technology, many of the more recent acquisitions in the area relate to the application layer and integration with industry-specific verticals. Similar acquisitions include Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquisition of Indoor.io in December 2016, and Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) acquisition of July Systems in June 2018.The LocusLabs acquisition not only strengthens Acuity's applications, but also specifically supports its expansion from retail sites into transportation sites. ""The transportation industry is the second vertical market we are approaching, building on our success in retail. LocusLabs' broad reach in the transportation vertical aligns with Acuity's IPS technology that is now in place at 4 of the top 10 airports in North America,"" Lydecker said.Will Acuity Brands succeed in leveraging its lighting clients as location service clients? Will VLC succeed in the market, with its tradeoffs, where other technologies have not yet taken off? Will other lighting companies use M&A to solidify their position in the indoor location area as well? What will be the next location companies to be acquired? Time will tell, but it looks like exciting times ahead in the lighting and localization areas, and Acuity Brands seems determined to lead the charge."
4357239,50662,2020-07-07T10:00:00-04:00,"Acuity Brands remained profitable in its third quarter (which ran from March to May).The free cash flow is consistently higher than the net income as the capex is consistently lower than the depreciation charges.Acuity Brands hasn't been buying back stock so far this year, but I think the company should consider restarting buying back stock at these levels.I currently have no position in Acuity Brands but could write some out of the money put options.","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the valuations of certain companies back to healthy levels, but in some cases where share prices haven’t bounced back from their March lows, there are some interesting opportunities. Acuity Brands (AYI) - one of North America’s leading producers of lighting systems, for instance - still has a net cash position, was profitable in its third quarter (March-May) but on a YTD basis, its share price is still down by approximately 35%. An opportunity?YChartsIn the third quarter, Acuity Brands reported a revenue of $776M, which is quite a bit lower than the $948M it generated in the same quarter last year as COVID-19 obviously had an impact on Acuity’s sales. That being said, the company’s profitability remained relatively strong: although Q3 revenue decreased by just over 18%, the COGS fell by in excess of 20% and the $170M drop in revenue resulted in a drop in the operating profit by just over $37M, or roughly a third.Source: SEC filingsThat still is substantial decrease but due to the lower net finance expenses and the lower tax bill (due to the lower pre-tax income), the net income of $60.4M still represented an EPS of $1.53/share (as the average share count slightly decreased as well.So although the company’s Q3 was undeniably weaker than in 2019, the damage remained relatively limited and I’m looking forward to seeing the company’s Q4 results to see if Acuity was able to stabilize its revenue and profit. Due to the specific focus on North America (98% of the company’s sales are generated in North America) and the continuous COVID-19 problems in the USA, it’s perhaps too soon to expect an improvement of the financial results in the fourth quarter. But with the publication of the Q3 results, Acuity shows it was able to remain profitable during difficult times.The $60M net income in Q3 brought the net income in the first three quarters of the year to almost $175M or $4.42/share. A decent performance and I wanted to check if Acuity was able to convert the majority of its net income into free cash flow.The company reported an operating cash flow of $378M, but this includes changes in the working capital position to the tune of $67.7M resulting in an adjusted operating cash flow of $305M after also taking the $5M in taxes paid on equity awards into consideration.Source: SEC filingsAs Acuity Brands runs a low-capex business model and the capex was just $38M, the adjusted free cash flow in the first nine months of the year was approximately $267M. That’s substantially higher than the net income, predominantly caused by A) the difference between depreciation charges and capital expenditures and B) the $32.5M in share-based payment expenses which are an expense but don’t represent a cash outflow.Looking at the balance sheet, Acuity had almost $521M in cash, $18M in current debt and $386M in long-term debt for a net cash position of approximately $117M. That’s an excellent achievement as the net cash actually increased by $13M compared to the end of FY 2019 when Acuity had just $104M in net cash and since the beginning of the current financial year, Acuity has spent $303M in cash to acquire The Luminaires Group. The purchase price wasn’t disclosed when Acuity announced the acquisition, but the cash flow statements indicate $303M was spent on acquisitions. As there were no other material acquisitions in that time frame, the majority of that $303M was very likely spent on the TLG acquisition.Granted, a portion of the strong net cash was created by the working capital inflow but that actually is a positive feature. During a tough financial quarter where the entire world and North American economies were suffering from COVID-19, Acuity was able to convert about 20% of its receivables in cash and did not see its inventory level increase, indicating a robust underlying result (as one would have expected the opposite: higher receivables as customers are postponing payment and higher inventory levels as the demand decreases).Acuity never made it a secret its number one priority was to demonstrate the durability of its business model and the company continues to look at bolt-on acquisitions and perhaps it can indeed hunt for deals as COVID-19 may have made smaller competitors rethink their strategies.While I’m fully on board with the pursuit of smaller bolt-on acquisitions to further boost Acuity’s products offering, I think the company should explore its options to restart a share repurchase program. And that program doesn’t have to be large but with an enterprise value of $3.6B and a pre-COVID full-year EBITDA exceeding $600M, Acuity Brands is quite cheap and if no suitable M&A targets can be found, Acuity should consider buying its own stock.With an anticipated full-year free cash flow of $320-350M (my own estimates, and this will obviously entirely depend on the Q4 performance in this COVID-19 era), Acuity Brands is very reasonably priced and deserves more love from the market. I currently have no position but noticed the option premiums are quite attractive, so I may write one or two out of the money put options, hoping to initiate a long position at a lower price level."

However, this provides a patient investor with an entry point.AYI has a large amount of cash and debt available to it, that puts the company in a healthy position.AYI is also an industry that is well placed for macro-growth, which will lead to an increased share price and EPS.","Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) is facing short term headwinds, but this has provided an attractive entry point for a long-term investor. The firm knows its shares are undervalued, which has led to repurchases. The firm has a large amount of cash and debt facility, which allows it to offer shareholder friendly returns. The firm is also in an industry well-poised for macro-growth, which will lead to increase EPS and share price. The short-term headwinds of tariffs are actually positive for the company in the long term.RepurchasesThe company understands that its shares are undervalued, which is why it has an extensive repurchase program at the moment. The firm repurchased 400,000 shares for $49 million during the first 9 months of fiscal 2019. There are currently 4.8 million shares remaining under the current share repurchase program. At current prices that would be buying back $620 million more worth of shares. This is around 12% of its total shares, at the company’s current market cap of $5.1 billion.Cash FlowThe company has a high cash pool of $334 million to execute towards growth strategies that are in-line with increasing returns to shareholders. An example of this is the ambitious repurchase program that the company is going after. This is due to net cash from operating activities being a strong $312 million in the first 9 months of the year.In addition to this the firm has access to $795 million worth of borrowing as of May 31st 2019. This again highlights the ability for the company to execute towards growth strategies that are in-line with increasing returns for shareholders. There was also $350 million worth of senior unsecured notes that were due to mature in December 2019, which can now be refinanced using this money. This highlights, how the company is in a strong financial position.This cash flow may be used in the form of acquisitions. An example of this was WhiteOptics LLC in the third quarter, an advanced optical components firm, although this is not expected to materially affect 2019 statements. Although it does highlight the potential for the firm to make material investments that can lead to increased price growth moving forward.Long-Term Macro GrowthIn the long-term AYI is in an industry where there is potential for macro growth. This is due to increased opportunities for construction in the long term as well as the ‘conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size to more efficient and effective solutions.’ These two levers form a big part of the macro growth that will lead to increased revenue and EPS moving forward. The company is well placed to take advantage of these levers through it being a market leader in lighting solutions. It is also a technology leader in building automation with the Atrius platform. The CEO highlighted this fact about how the firm is ‘well-positioned to fully participate and lead these exciting and growing industries.’ The firm has made significant strides in the strategic and technology front. That has been a big positive for the company moving forward in the long term and will lead to increased revenue and profitability. Another positive for the firm is that its new product introductions have been well received by the market, with awards being won for innovation.RestructuringThe firm is facing short-term pressure in the form of cost-inflation. A positive for the company was that the input cost of steel levelled off, however expenses such as imported electrical components, finished goods, freight and wages continue to rise. To address these short-term issues the firm has increased cost prices (however as discussed this has led to a reduction in customer demand), introduced product and freight cost reductions and taken further action to improve productivity. Although this will have the effect of lowering sales and revenue in the short term, this is actually positive for the company in the long term. The cost reductions and improvement in productivity will lead to reduced expenses and increase revenue in the long term.The firm has reduced shipments in its retail channel and eliminated products that weren’t meeting its profitability hurdles. By removed these products that don’t meet the margin the company is going for, there are lower sales in the short term. However, in the long term this is margin accretive, operating profit dollars will be the same, but profits will be greater. This will lead to increased profitability for the firm. The firm has seen gross profit margins increase for the 3rd quarter in a row, and they are now above 40%.Graph Source: Acuity Brands Inc MorningstarThe short-term risks that the company are facing have led to an attractive valuation for a patient long term investor. The P/B is currently 2.73 which is lower than the company’s 5-year average of 4.95. The Price/Cash Flow ratio is currently 14.12, which is lower than the 5-year average of 24.26.The P/E ratio is currently well below the average market multiple of 22.32. It is also well below its 5-year low of 28.83. The company is therefore an attractive investment to a long-term investor, who is able to see past the risks in the short term.The firm has seen impressive growth figures that make the P/E look even more attractive. The EPS growth projected by analysts in 2019 is 9.22%, while in 2020 it is 6.03%. The firm has a Forward P/E of 12.56 based on an earnings projection of 10.28 in August 2020. In comparison to its 5 year average, this is incredibly low.Al-Gore agrees with us, his fund owns 8% of the company, with a $460 million stake, although this is a position less than 5% of his overall fund.TariffsThe firm recently has been under pressure from increased tariffs that went up from 10% - 25% in May. There was talk of another potential tariff increase in the USA and Mexico, although the American administration backed away from these demands. The result however was greater volatility in the markets, which led to lower demand. The company has faced higher component costs and finished good prices, which have to be offset by the consumer. This resulted in many lighting companies including Acuity to implement a price increase in May. The result of this though has been decreased supply from consumers, which has put pressure on profitability in the short term.AYI is facing short term pressure. These includes tariff pressure, cost-inflation and an uncertain political environment, which has led to the firm being more efficient and will turn a short-term problem into a long-term gain. The macro environment is very positive for the company due to increased construction and a trend towards more efficient and effective solutions though. The Forward P/E of 12.56 for the company is therefore a bargain, when you look at the company’s 5 year average of 28.83 and the overall market multiple of 22.32."

(AYI) is a holding company, which owns companies operating in the lighting industry. Its brands are considered to be some of the best in the industry. The company is based in Atlanta and employs over 13,000 people.Acuity designs and produces everything from lighting controls and building system controllers to power supplies and integrated systems for industrial purposes. Acuity was trading at over twice its current price towards the end of 2016. As such, value hunters have been eagerly watching Acuity so as to determine whether it is a worthwhile investment at its current price.While Acuity looks like a decent company from a non-technical standpoint, our valuation metrics show otherwise. As such, we are delving deep into Acuity to determine whether this is a place where your hard-earned cash should go or not.Data by YChartsThe Internet of Things (IoT), along with cloud computing, seems to be the next big thing in technology. IoT essentially refers to the concept of connecting everything in your life to the internet to achieve complete control of everything you do. For example, you could turn your lights on or off from your mobile phone while on vacation.The total number of IoT devices is expected to be over 20 Billion by the end of 2020. On top of that, the estimated investment to be made by companies in IoT is $15 trillion between 2017 and 2025. Acuity has two brands that are currently operating in the IoT space and could garner a significant portion of the industry.Atrius is a brand that is focused on using lighting grids as sensors and collecting data for various companies, while DGLogik is focused on the development side of IoT as it provides software solutions for developers to program their IoT devices to their liking. As IoT becomes an integral part of our life, Acuity could potentially profit greatly from its current brands.Any mid-cap company, such as Acuity, is bound to have a few lawsuits filed against it. However, Acuity seems to have attracted significant trouble as far as the legal side of things is concerned. A brief look at its 10-K reveals that it has legal proceedings “including, but not limited to, patent infringement, product liability claims, and employment matters.”On top of this, the company is involved in multiple securities class action suits filed by investors who lost money during the stock’s massive crash towards the tail-end of 2016. The company is either partially, or completely, insured against some of the claims that have been made and claims that most of the legal proceedings against it should have no impact on their cash flow or financial condition even if the outcome is adverse. However, it remains to be seen whether that is actually the case or not.Two of the lawsuits filed against the company state that directors mislead investors by overstating the company’s ability to generate profits. If that is the case, Acuity is a company that investors looking for a safe investment should definitely avoid. It is quite difficult to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. Because of this, the lawsuits currently cast a shadow of uncertainty over the company.In terms of growth, Acuity Brands is currently struggling. Although a brief look at the company’s revenues and net income may lead you to believe that there is ample growth in the company, the actual operating profit fell in 2018, after a minor growth in 2017, and the increase in net income has been mainly artificial due to tax breaks.Along with the increase in revenues came an increase in operating expenses. Not only did the cost of sales go up by a proportional amount, but so did the administrative and general expenses. This shows that Acuity is failing to achieve economies of scale and this could lead to growth and scaling problems down the road.Acuity also falls short when it comes to our DCF analysis. Even when we assume a 5% growth for the next 5 years, a 2.5% growth for the 5 years thereafter, a terminal value multiple of 16.8 (its current TV multiple), and a discount rate of 10%, the intrinsic value of the stock is $127.09 a share. The price of Acuity's stock at the time of our analysis is $132.90, making this a slightly overvalued stock.The problem is that these growth rates are fairly optimistic considering Acuity’s current growth problem. If we perform a conservative analysis which factors in only a 2% annual growth for the next decade, we find the stock’s intrinsic value to be $113.29 - making it quite a bit overvalued at its current price.The balance sheet also paints a dire picture for Acuity. Not only are its receivables increasing massively every year, but its inventories are also rising. This shows a decrease in operational efficiency. In addition, its current assets have decreased to $1.21 billion in 2018 from $1.41 billion in 2015, while its current liabilities have increased from $520.90 million to $682.70 million over the same period.Acuity Brands is currently stagnant. Despite their increase in revenue, it has failed to show any substantial gains in profits. If it fails to capitalize on the IoT trend (the advent of which is in itself not a guarantee and thus, is a risk), it could face large problems in the near future.On top of this, the multiple lawsuits that threaten Acuity could cause them significant losses. The lawsuits, of which we are especially worried about, are the ones relating to securities fraud. More information on the lawsuit can be found on the KTMC website, which is one of the firms currently in a legal battle with Acuity.Acuity seems to have better prospects for its future. On top of that, the fact that the stock price is half of what it was over two years ago seems to suggest that it might be a worthwhile investment based on value. However, our valuation of some of its fundamental factors suggests that the company is overvalued at this time.Even if you factor in a reasonable amount of growth over the next decade, the company still seems to be slightly overvalued. As such, we recommend only investors looking for a high-risk high-reward opportunity consider Acuity or those looking to add a small position to capitalize on the trend towards IoT."
4158486,25120,2018-03-23T12:13:38-04:00,"Acuity saw a huge, multiyear momentum run between 2009 and 2016 that I never really understood.With sales growth slowing down and coming to a standstill, shares have lost half their value as multiples are now in line with the market.Growing end markets, valued at a market multiple, and a resilient balance sheet appear to create appeal following the correction.I'm not buying AYI just yet as the company appears to be losing market share amid a growing economy, as technological changes in the market might claim another victim.","I never really understood the crazy run higher seen in shares of Acuity Brands (AYI) during the 2010s, as valuation multiples always seemed to get way ahead of themselves. Shares of the company traded at just $20 during the 2009 crisis, only to see a momentum run to a high of $275 by 2016. After that, shares have fallen by 50% while the rest of the market continued setting new records. This has certainly improved its appeal, yet continued changes in the industry landscape and apparent market share losses at the moment prevent me from pulling the buy trigger just yet.Shares of Acuity increased tenfold in the time frame of just a few years, far outpacing growth in the real operations. The company makes lights and building management solutions, including controls, components, controllers, etc. The company claims to sell a solution in terms of energy efficiency, user-friendliness and adaptability to certain conditions.As architects find light continuously very important in design, the shift toward more environmentally friendlier lights continues. As the world shifts from its current installed base to more efficient lighting, the future of Acuity looks good. That is still the case, as the company has more than recovered from the crisis.Sales fell from $2.0 billion to $1.6 billion during the crises, but ever since have gradually recovered to a peak of $3.5 billion in 2017, resulting in decent growth over this decade long period. Margins have expanded from the low double digits to levels around 15%, amid a flattish share count, as earnings per share have doubled to roughly $7-$8 per share.This is quite impressive, but I failed to understand why such earnings power was awarded an earnings multiple in the mid-thirties by 2016. This is especially the case as some of the growth was ""bought"" as well, as multiple deals in 2016 came at a cost of more than $600 million that year alone.Let me put it this way: Acuity was always too expensive to my taste, but a 50% correction amid strong market conditions and a healthy economy seems a little aggressive. The earnings multiple in the mid-thirties by 2016 was too expensive, yet more factors have been at work.For an explanation, lets's review the situation ever since. During the calendar year of 2016, the business was doing quite alright. In fact, revenues rose by 15% for 2016 to $3.3 billion, aided in part by acquisitions. Operating profits expanded to nearly 15% of sales as the company earned nearly $7 per share that year, those being GAAP earnings.Shares started slipping late in 2016, but that was nothing worrisome and just a small move as they still traded comfortably above the $200 mark. Alongside the release of Q1 results for the fiscal 2017, in early January 2017, shares dipped as the company talked about softness in Q1 that could linger into Q2. Sales were still up 16% year on year for the quarter, aided in part by dealmaking. Tthe company has not specified how much of this growth was achieved on an organic basis, and how much has been the result of acquisitions.Q2 sales growth slowed down to just 3.5% as the company warned that slower growth could persist into the third and fourth quarters as well. This warning prompted shares to fall toward the $175 mark as investors were reducing the growth expectations, and thereby the multiples they were willing to attach to the business. Q3 sales growth recovered to 5% to come in at 3.5% in the fourth quarter again. By the time fourth-quarter results were released, in October 2017, shares had fallen back to just $160 at the time.For the year, Acuity still managed to grow sales by 6.5% to $3.51 billion, accompanied by operating earnings of $519 million and earnings of $7.43 per share. Note that this is the GAAP earnings method with adjusted earnings coming in roughly a dollar higher. The company guided for low single-digit growth in its end markets for 2018, cautioning investors that the slowdown is persistent and other factors might be at play given the strong state of the economy.The company started the calendar and fiscal year of 2018 on a bad note in January. After shares recovered to $180 shares resumed their fall as first-quarter sales were down a percent, accompanied by 6% deleveraging in operating in earnings. Despite some operational weakness and pressure on margins, earnings could hold up pretty well in 2018 given the positive impact from a reduction in the tax rate.Shares continued their slide, aided by a couple of downgrades, and trading at $134 per share they trade at 18x the reported earnings of $7.34 per share reported last year. Even better, Acuity remains conservatively financed as it actually operates with a modest net cash position, although that is gone if pension liabilities are included.The switch to LED and growing construction markets, combined with tighter environmental standards, were the key drivers that pushed shares of Acuity up to a 35x earnings multiple in 2016, only to see the multiple cut in half. Trading at a market multiple, I am not buying the dip just yet for quite a few reasons. One is technological change that means innovation is key, and Acuity's R&D budget is quite low. I furthermore note that the company enjoyed both high and stable margins in the past decade, yet this might change if the company is late in adopting new techniques. While Chinese competition is certainly a risk, that might be mitigated to some extent if tariffs are imposed across the spectrum, although that has the negative consequences for the economy as well.What seems safe to say is that the company is losing market share at this point in time given the decline in first-quarter sales. The promise of new technologies has been a costly endeavor for investors in Cree (CREE) as well, for example. Besides emerging Chinese competition, technology names might find the space interesting, as well as devices that can more easily be integrated with smart homes or workplaces.Given the fact that Acuity is losing sales and market share at a good point in the cycle, I see no compelling reason to buy shares at a market-equivalent multiple, despite the 50% pullback already seen and the sound balance sheet. Another negative for the stock (on a personal note) is that I have bought too early (with Cree, for example) in the past. Industry changes might be very beneficial for early adopters of a trend, but that could eventually hurt them too if they respond too late to changing market conditions."
4163756,76425,2018-04-18T12:32:13-04:00,The stock price has taken a 50% haircut.The company remains the market share leader in a promising industry.Management has been and continues to be shareholder friendly.Company is trading at low historic valuation.,"Acuity Brands (AYI) provides lighting solutions primarily to the North American industrial and construction industry. I last wrote about this company when it was trading at high multiples. The company was experiencing massive growth as the cost effectiveness and energy reduction properties of LED fit well with the industrial construction boom.Things change. The stock price is now more than 50% off its highs as AYI has experienced declining profit margins and slower growth despite that it serves an industry that is experiencing high growth and continued bright forecasts. There are several catalysts in place that indicate a turnaround in stock price is imminent.Management has been less than stellar in forecasting earnings as most quarters have resulted in misses but they have an excellent record of growing revenue and earnings. These earning misses may have led to over correction.Let's take a look at the stock chart.The stock price is below the simple 200 day moving average and therefore in a downtrend. Interesting to note that AYI's stock price remained in an uptrend, above its 200 day moving average, even during the industrial construction slump of 2010.AYI is the market share leader in North American lighting solutions for industrial and commercial construction. I think the number one catalyst for share price appreciation is the company strategy of leveraging its position in lighting in order to expand into the higher margin area of holistic lighting solutions and building maintenance data analytics.The company introduced Altrius last May, a combination IoT software and cloud platform service that gathers raw data and provides smart lighting solutions. AYI recently acquired Lucid Design Group, a building analytics company doubling down on this strategy.AYI derives half its revenues from new construction and half from renovation. Revenue growth has slowed down from prior years to just 1% for the two most recent quarters. The most recent earnings report explained that revenue growth has been impacted by heavy competition in the lower end lighting products sold at national chain stores and by conditions in the industrial construction industry.The lower end lighting products represent 20% of total revenue. AYI beat out competition by lowering prices in this category. The price cuts resulted in lower earnings with lower margins. To address demand for lower end products without advanced features the company is rolling out a new line of low cost products.The slowdown in industrial construction appears to be short lived. AYI will be a laggard in benefiting from the current construction cycle as lighting products are used toward the final stages of construction as demonstrated in Zach's industry outlook stats. The outlook for the U.S. industrial construction market is extremely positive with a heavy backlog of large projects in the works. The outlook for lighting solutions is even more positive with a forecasted CAGR of 21.5% over the next five years.I expect that as AYI has previously gained from demand fueled by cost savings and green energy interest it is now positioned to benefit from even more cost savings opportunities for customers from analytics but other beneficial elements such as health benefits of altering lighting, smart cities, smart campus, intelligent parking solutions along with the decreasing cost of LEDs.In the words of CEO Vern Nagel at the last conference call, ""We have purchased over $1 billion worth of shares, almost 15 million shares, over the last decade plus we have done acquisitions totaling about $1.1 billion. We have returned dividends probably north of $300 million.""The company board of directors recently authorized a new 6 million share repurchase plan which is unlikely to be completed in the next 12 months without new financing if the company makes another acquisition. Speaking of acquisitions, the recent Lucid purchase as is generally the case for AYI was completed from free cash flow as are the dividends.Evidence for the likely recovery in stock price is the disconnect between rising free cash flow and the stock price.AYIs stock price seems to be in concert with its gross profit margins.The rise in S G & A seems to have leveled off.Management has implemented a cost cutting program but realizes that more meaningful improvement on profitability will have to come from market acceptance of the new products.The possibility of higher margin products and growth in an adjacent industry are potentially compelling catalysts. The technical picture is still negative and I would never recommend buying a stock at a new low despite valuation or perceived catalysts.AYI has a history of making the right moves to remain the market leader and appears to be poised to gain from the IoT wave in construction. I suggest waiting for a solid earnings report indicating that AYI's game plan is catching on. Applying a PE of 16 to analysts' estimates results in a stock price of about $155.AYI is dependent on the success of its new products. Further risk is that there is no guarantee that the construction industry will continue to flourish."
4198966,104210,2018-08-14T12:12:21-04:00,"Acuity Brands has posted strong fundamental performance in the past.IoT technology is entering the space and Acuity is poised to take advantage of this trend.Poor performance in the 1st and 2nd quarters have been reversed with a strong 3rd quarter, giving the stock a short-term catalyst.","Sometimes an exciting investment can be found in a boring industry. I believe this to be the case of Acuity Brands (AYI). The company has strong fundamentals with several short-term catalysts. One of the primary short-term catalysts is the improvement in the non-residential construction sector. Besides this, the company has achieved high rates of return on equity and investment while using little leverage. These factors make Acuity Brands, a leading manufacturer of luminaries, a potential addition to your portfolio.According to the National Electrical Code, a luminaire is defined as “a complete lighting unit consisting of a lamp or lamps together with the parts designed to distribute the light, to position and protect the lamps and ballast (where applicable), and to connect the lamps to the power supply.” A luminaire could best be described as a light fixture, and it is hard to imagine a world where light fixtures will not be needed. Therefore, wherever there is a need for a light there is a market for Acuity Brands products. This fact gives the industry and company a certain level of attractiveness because the need for the product will always be there and the chance someone will reinvent the light socket and up-end the industry is slim. The downside of this is light fixtures are a commodity that follows the cycle of construction and renovation spending. However, with new IoT technology, there is an opportunity to put a new twist on an old product, increase margins and separate oneself from the pack.Over the past year, the cyclical nature of the business manifested itself in Acuity earnings. Revenue lost steam through 2017, but has rebounded in the recent 3rd quarter, which ran between March 1st and May 31st of 2018. This improvement was in part due to a turnaround in the Commercial and Industrial construction cycle, where 60% of Acuity Brand's earnings come from. According to management in the 3Q 2018 earnings call, the company's sales typically lag non-residential construction data by about 6 months because lighting normally is bought at the end of building projects.Source: ycharts.comThe weak revenue reported in 1Q 2018 and 2Q 2018 can be correlated with the mid-2017 dip in construction spending, while the strong 3rd quarter revenue follows the pickup in spending in late 2017 and early 2018. An investor can use non-residential construction spending as a leading indicator for Acuity Brands' earnings. Due to strong spending in the middle of 2018, there is a good probability that strong earnings will continue to be reported in the 4th quarter. Part of the increase in sales will likely be due to new technologies that Acuity Brands has invested in.One of the leading units in the 3Q 2018 growth was luminaires that are IoT enabled on their Atrius Platform, which grew at 40% last quarter and now represent 15% of the company’s net sales. This is up sharply compared to the 20% growth rate the segment had in the 2nd quarter, according to their 3Q 2018 investors call. Atrius is a platform that goes well beyond lights and into the entire building management space. Luminaires that are enabled with the platform are then sold alongside it.Source:www.acuitybrands.comThe expansion into building management has also manifested itself in the acquisition pipeline as well. Recently, Acuity purchased Lucid, a company that specializes in building management using big data. While the company sees building management as an opportunity, they do not appear to be giving up their lighting manufacturing business. Rather, they see it as a way to better serve customers and complement their exciting portfolio of products. The move into this sector is already helping boost earnings over the short term and will continue to help Acuity brands over the long term as they prepare for a digitizing world.Source: www.lucidconnects.comCompetitors like Signify, formerly Philips Lighting, and Eaton Corporation have also rolled out connected lighting solutions as well. However, they mostly focus on just the lighting and not on all elements of building management. Therefore, if someone were to buy a competitor's system, the business would still have to have another system for the other components of building management. The Atrius system would cover multiple needs and not just lighting. Since most companies upgrade to these systems during renovations or new construction, they probably do not have building management software in place already and therefore could see the advantage of using just one system rather they having multiple suites of software. Having a complete platform should help position Acuity Brands to keep performing at the high levels of its past.The company's past performance demonstrates that they are well-managed. This can be seen in the consistently high rates of return on investment and equity the company generates. According to Morningstar, the 5-year average return on investment and equity are 15.3% and 17.8%, respectively. The company also exhibits strong cash flows and converts income into cash at a high rate. The 5-year average net income is $242 million while the 5-year average free cash flow is $232 million, almost all of the company's income is converted into cash. This gives Acuity Brands the freedom to pursue acquisitions and buy back shares without taking on much debt. However, they do carry some long-term debt and have a debt to equity ratio of 22%. Due to strong free cash flows, this debt should not be a problem for the company.Most of the company’s long-term debt is in $350 million worth of bonds due to mature in December 2019. However, the company recently put in place a $400 million senior unsecured loan due 2023, with delayed draw provision, to be used “mainly for opportunistic share repurchases, with possible other uses of acquisition funding and debt repayment.” Acuity Brands also increased their revolving loan from $250 million to $400 million giving them even more flexibility moving forward.Some the increased borrowing will likely go towards share buybacks. In the past, the board has exhibited wise judgment on when to buy back shares. Acuity Brands has recently been repurchasing shares at a fast rate. However, before the 3rd quarter of 2017, no shares had been repurchased since 2011, according to the companies 2017 10-K. Between 2011 and 2017, the company had a PE ratio that often reached up into the high 30s, at this high valuation Acuity did not buy any shares. Instead of buying back expensive shares, the company deployed capital organically and through acquisitions to the tune of 15% return on investment. Now that the PE has decreased to 18, the valuation is more attractive to buy back shares, and as the share price began to slide in 2017, the company started repurchasing shares once again. Since the price has reminded low, the board increased the share repurchase program to 6 million shares or about 15% of the company. This should give the share price a short-term catalyst and demonstrates the good judgment of the board, making Acuity Brands a good long-term investment as well.The combination of increased share buybacks and new strength in the non-residential construction sector could propel a well-managed Acuity out of its slump and towards new highs. Along with short-term catalysts, the long-term potential is also strong. There will always be a need for luminaries, and new technologies are helping to differentiate products, allowing a small moat to be built in this commoditized industry."

With the Fed undercutting investor confidence with deflationary efforts, and the almost-impossible task of precisely determining what impact tariffs (and the trade war) will have on demand, it would seem that our outlook on Acuity Brands (AYI) is presently an affirmative sell. However, we foresee double-digit growth over the next year or two, with several entry points throughout.Acuity Brands (AYI), a conglomerate of Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc., and other subsidiaries, is one of the world’s leading providers of lighting and building management solutions for commercial, industrial, institutional, infrastructure, and residential applications. Its principal office is located in Atlanta, Georgia. The Company’s building and lighting management solutions include devices such as lighting controls, luminaries, power supplies, prismatic skylights, drivers, and controllers for various building systems, as well as integrated systems designed to optimize energy comfort and efficiency for various outdoor and indoor applications. In addition, it continues to expand its solutions portfolio to provide a host of other economic benefits, including software and other services that enable the Internet of Things (“IoT”). The company's IoT solutions provide customers with access to robust data analytics; support the advancement of smart cities, smart buildings, and the smart grid; and allow businesses to develop custom applications to scale their operations. As of May 31, 2018, the Company has under its operation seven distribution facilities, 20 manufacturing facilities, and three warehouses to serve its extensive customer base.Presently, AYI has a balanced debt to equity ratio when compared to its peers in the Construction Supplies & Fixtures industry. This is suggestive that its earnings would be less volatile than other related companies. Also, with its P/E Ratio on par with its counterparts, investors are willing to pay the same amount for its level of earnings relative to future growth. Furthermore, the company has more cash to spend on business due to its high Gross Margin. This can be attributed to its ability to control its costs and expenses; and reinvesting its earnings more efficiently than 85% of its competitors. Finally, the EPS Growth Rate of the company greater than 66% of its peers; which altogether is indicative of the company’s efficiency, demonstrated in its ability to move inventory and generate sales.AYI has achieved a solid performance in the third quarter of 2018, in spite of a backdrop of current market conditions. For instance, it recorded net sales of $944 million, an increase of about 6%, when compared with last year’s report. Its operating profit was tagged at $105.9 against $131.5 million of last year, while its diluted earning per share was $1.80 compared with $1.90 of last year. In the third quarter of 2018, the company recorded an adjusted operating profit of $135.8 million compared with $148.3 million of the previous year. There was an increase of 10% in the company’s diluted earnings per share at $2.37. Furthermore, the company’s net cash provided by its operating activities was $301 million when compared with $198 million of last year. This further emphasized the company’s financial flexibility.AYI has had favorable Net sales since the beginning of fiscal 2018. For instance, it recorded a 6% increase in net sales over one year period from last year. There was sales growth in most channels and geographies influenced by several factors most especially the increase in sales volume brought about by greater shipments of products.Acuity Brands has acquired 14 companies. Its latest acquisition in fiscal 2018 is Lucid Design Group, Inc. on February 12, 2018, and IOTA Engineering, LLC on May 1, 2018. Lucid Design Group, Inc., located in Oakland, California, provides a data and analytics platform to make data-driven decisions in other to improve building efficiency and drive energy conservation and savings.Using cash on hand and borrowings available under existing credit arrangements, Acuity acquired all of the equity interests of IOTA Engineering, LLC (“IOTA”). IOTA, headquartered in Tucson, Arizona. manufactures highly engineered emergency lighting products and power equipment for commercial and institutional applications both in the U.S. and internationally.The recent acquisition of these companies has helped Acuity Brands outperform its competitors.On January 3, 2018, a shareholder filed a class action complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the Company and certain of its officers on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company’s stock between June 29, 2016, and April 3, 2017. On February 20, 2018, a different shareholder filed a second class action complaint in the same venue against the same parties on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company’s stock between October 15, 2015, and April 3, 2017. A motion to consolidate the cases has been filed and is presently pending, unopposed.The cases were transferred on April 30, 2018, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaints allege that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements and/or omitting to disclose material adverse facts that (I) concealed known trends negatively impacting sales of the Company’s products and (II) overstated the Company’s ability to achieve profitable sales growth. The plaintiffs seek class certification, unspecified monetary damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees.The Company disputes the allegations in the complaints and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. Estimating an amount or range of possible losses resulting from litigation proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages and are in the stages of the proceedings where key factual and legal issues have not been resolved. For these reasons, the Company is currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of or reasonably estimate the possible losses or a range of possible losses resulting from the matters described above. The Company is insured, in excess of a self-retention, for Directors and Officers liability.(Source: thefly.com)Here are our two favorite ETFs with exposure to Acuity Brands.(Data: Yahoo Finance)QCLN has a broad portfolio of US-listed firms in the clean energy industry.

This is not without some potential bumps along the road, as AYI is higher beta compared to the US Electrical market industry average (1.4 vs 1.24), and carries a PEG of 2.6, hinting at growth being solidly priced in. At the moment, higher cash flow -- 23.99% free cash flow per share increase YoY vs 2016 -- should translate into a higher share valuation for FY 2019.Comparing these results to its competitors, the company’s reported total revenue increase in the third quarter of 2018 by 10.82% year on year. In the same quarter, its sales growth was also found to be above its competitors' average revenue growth of 7.17%.For Acuity Brands, the latest earnings are $341.10M, which has risen by 11.58%, against the prior year’s figure. Moreover, the annualized five-year value for net income stands at $196.78M. This shows that Acuity has been able to grow its earnings steadily over the last few years and it is expected to continue at an attractive rate. In addition, management has shown extensive commitment in promoting the growth of the company. For instance, it has taken a number of actions during the past months, aimed at offsetting much of its recent inflationary cost pressures, as well as other measures to improve productivity and reduce costs. We believe that although the overall growth rate for the fourth quarter 2018 will be flat to slightly down, continuing the sluggish trend over the last several quarters, the aforementioned (linked) actions will begin to offset current pressures midway through its first quarter of FY 2019.(Data: Yahoo Finance)With recent climactic volume being evident, it is our opinion that the majority selloff has already occurred, and that AYI will be one of those ""do something,"" stocks until somewhere around Q2 2019, where a rebound will take place.Hypothetical 1) If we already owned shares of AYI as part of a long-term strategy, we would consider locking in any applicable profits on a portion of our position, and then holding while we wait for Q2.Hypothetical 2) If we weren't already in, but looking play, we would begin establishing a core position by entering below VWAP where technical entry points present -- keeping lot sizes small, and accumulating over time as news or market events attracted activity from the momo crowd.Author's note: If you enjoyed our article, and would like to see more from us in your feed, don't forget to give us a follow.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational and entertainment purposes only, and nothing in this article should be considered financial advice."

Acuity Brands (AYI) appeared in all the three screens that I performed since early March. Its stable presence points to the fact that the stock remains underappreciated in up and down markets. In this article, I will examine AYI as a potential stock pick. For now, it looks like there is reasonable value in the stock that is attractively priced in the context of this stock market.For more information about the Magic Formula or the latest screen, please have a look at my last article (that should be open to non-subscribers).The chart below shows the tickers of the 30 Magic Formula stocks with a market cap of over $2.5bn, including their sectors and industries.Source: compiled by author, magicformulainvesting.com was used to get the tickers, the sectors and industry classifications follow the GICS methodology.There are different approaches possible to this collection of stocks, ranging from the rigid application of the Magic Formula investment script of buy & hold for 1 year, to using it as a source of potential stock ideas.The Magic Formula bases its ranking on earnings yield and return on capital. The earnings yield is calculated as EBIT/EV and the return on capital as EBIT/(net working capital + net fixed assets).Acuity's earnings yield is a straight forward 11% ($390m/$3,525m), which is pretty good. The NWC is $318m when leaving out operating lease liabilities and NFA is $275m which only consists of PP&E because the Magic Formula ignores intangible assets, and these two add up to $593m. The return on capital is, therefore, 66% as TTM EBIT is still the same $390m.Needless to say, a 66% return on capital is very high and should indicate the presence of at least some competitive advantages. The combination of the high return on capital and high earnings yield earned AYI its place on the list.Acuity Brands is in the lighting & building management solutions business. It primarily produces non-portable luminaires, lighting controls, fixtures, and the like. 98% of revenue comes from North America where it has a market share of about 18%, based on the company's addressable market estimate.The company's range of brands serves various niches. One example is Luminaire Led, which sells vandal-resistant fixtures. These are commonly used in prisons or outdoors. It's one of those things that few people think about, but do exist. A nicer example is Eureka Lighting that provides more aesthetic solutions as shown below.Source: Eurekalighting.Source: Eurekalighting.The lighting solutions that the company offers are LED-based. Part of the company's success is owed to the early shift to LED-based fixtures. The company often sells LED lights as part of its lighting solutions, but these lights are purchased from third-party vendors, not designed or produced by Acuity.While the market is fragmented and the company has a good market position, the company has sizeable competitors, of which the larger ones are vertically integrated players, such as Signify (OTCPK:PHPPY) (formerly known as Philips Lightning). In addition, there are 'low-cost Asian imports' as the company describes, but we would have to take into account that these concern the more commoditized parts of the market and that Acuity itself also has relatively low-cost sourcing via its manufacturing footprint.Source: AYI 2019 10-K.Finally, there is some seasonality and cyclicality in the business as both new construction and commercial applications represent a significant share of the company's revenue. The company says that the addressable market did not grow or perhaps shrunk in fiscal 2019. That is consistent with the sales growth of the company itself in that year.X-axis uses company fiscal quarters. Trailing twelve months sales are on the right axis, quarterly sales on the left. The company's fiscal years end in August, which would make Sept., Oct., Nov. the first quarter, etc. Source: author's own calculations based on data in SEC filings and on Seeking Alpha.Nevertheless, the company's TTM sales figures have been trending down, which is a worrisome trend. In addition, there is clearly a leg down in sales. Also important is that the gross profit margin remained strong over the past years.Still, as stated before, the poor recent sales performance is not solely something of the last quarter and can't be fully attributed to the pandemic. In its Q2 report (for the period ended February 29, 2020), Acuity reported a decrease in sales volumes of 12% compared to last year. This was caused by a 'low single digit' market decline, elimination of certain products in the portfolio that did not meet return objectives and a lower activity of large projects.One thing I always watch when analyzing a company is how much cash flow it made over the past years and how that was spent. The chart below shows what the company did with its cash from operations over the past five years. It seems that Acuity has maintained a strong capital generation level over time, partly thanks to slowing YoY sales in Fiscal 4Q19 and the latest quarter, which freed up working capital.Source: author's own calculations.On the spending side, the company behaved quite responsibly, shunning transformative acquisitions, but instead going for reasonably-sized ones, once every two years or so. The CapEx spend is quite modest too, so free cash flow generation is quite strong. That FCF has partly been used to pay a dividend and to buy back shares, which is a positive. The dividend is quite modest and the company primarily returns cash to shareholders through buybacks.If we ignore the TTM figures and look just at the five years from 2015 to 2019, free cash flow comes in at $313m on average, or 8.7% of the current market cap of $3.6bn. This FCF yield is not too bad in my opinion, especially because the company has no net debt and even has a net cash position of over $100m. Added is the fact the FCF is the average over multiple years, so we're not cherry-picking a peak FCF number like the $500m realized over the past four quarters.One of the criticisms that AYI has drawn here on Seeking Alpha is that it doesn't spend enough on R&D. The company has been working on that over the past years, raising the spending from $52m in fiscal 2017 to almost $75m in 2019, a 44% increase. Apart from that, I'm wondering why lighting fixtures and controls should be R&D intensive. They are not trying to compete in inventing the next generation LED technology, but rather the fixtures for it which arguably has less of a rocket science feel to it. Because of the difference in 'R&D intensity', there is really no point in comparing the R&D of AYI with that of vertically integrated players.Overall, I would consider the fact that the company is spending more on the development of its products over the past years a strength, given that R&D rose as a percentage of sales. This also ties into the R&D efforts surrounding building technology and IoT themes. I think that investors should take the R&D expenditure as a positive.Acuity Brands is a company that is on the Magic Formula list for the right reasons. It has a continuously high level of return on capital and is valued cheaply because of very bearish expectations of its future.Overall, I don't find much troubling about the business. Acuity has a strong market position as a manufacturer and seller of lighting fixtures. I can see the concern of the sales development, but I think that the company is nevertheless valued quite cheaply compared to this market."

As the legacy lighting players continue to catch-up while Acuity (NYSE:AYI) invests near-nothing in R&D, its product advantage will fade. As Chinese upstream manufacturers which are operating in a very low-margin environment start to integrate downward, aggressive cost-cutting is imminent. Finally, we are likely at a peak in the LED lighting cycle, while investors largely predict secular growth unencumbered by slowdowns in the economy.Relevant CompsLIGHT-NV, CREE, HUBB, ETNCatalystAny material economic uncertainty accompanied with a slowdown in Acuity's business will cause this business to re-rate downward.Aggressive action by Chinese competitors to enter the market will spell disaster for margins.Business OverviewAcuity is a leading manufacturer of commercial (85% of sales) and residential (15%) downstream lighting products and solutions. 98% of revenue comes from North America. Over the past several years, Acuity has been the beneficiary of strong industry tailwinds with the adoption of LED lighting from previous incandescent and CFL solutions. Acuity has been able to use its broad LED product portfolio to grow sales in the low double digits (roughly twice that of its competitors), taking share from historically strong players such as GE (NYSE:GE), Philips (OTCPK:PHGFF) and Osram (OTCPK:OSAGF). LED luminaires now represent approximately 66% of AYI sales.LED Lighting IndustryLED lighting solutions provide a massive value proposition to end users. LED light bulbs last 22 years - around 20x longer than incandescents, and 2-3x longer than CFLs, while using 1/6th of the energy of incandescents and half the energy of CFLs. All told, the value to consumers is very clear.Acuity operates purely in the downstream segment of this market, meaning that it sells and manufacture luminaires, lighting controls and lighting systems, while purchasing the actual LEDs from upstream LED manufacturers. The market is highly fragmented. Acuity claims the highest market share at just 18%, and competes with vertically integrated players, such as Cree (NASDAQ:CREE) (~12%), Philips (~8%) and Eaton (~10%), as well as a variety of smaller private players. Downstream production has historically yielded the strongest operating margins, of around 10-15%.ThesisWhile we admit that Acuity has historically been successful in growing its business and expanding its margins, investors are forgetting that lighting has historically been a hyper-competitive business. We believe investors are extrapolating forward unsustainable levels of growth/market share and margin expansion, while applying a growth multiple to an inherently cyclical company, to boot.Industry low R&D spend will impede AYI's long-term ability to maintain leadership and Threaten IoT ambitionsAcuity has historically been able to gain market share in the nascent LED lighting industry because of its far superior LED product portfolio. In particular, Acuity made precisely the right strategic decision to shift into LED lighting, while integrated industry titans were slow to move away from legacy solutions. For example, as late as GE's 2013 Annual Report (published February 2014), it mentioned LEDs just one time. Acuity was able to leverage this ""first mover advantage"" to develop the most LED SKUs of any competitor and solidify itself as a leader in the space.While we wrote ""first move advantage"" above, we believe that Acuity's business possesses no natural barriers to entry. As discussed above, the industry is highly fragmented and Acuity's brand name is hardly a household name, especially in competition with GE or Philips Lighting. There are no recurring revenue streams – lighting solutions are largely one-off affairs, and with a 20+ year LED life cycle, repeat business should be negligible. Finally, AYI has no cost advantage, as gross margins are largely in line with the industry, even as AYI has moved 80% of manufacturing to Mexico.With this in mind, the only surefire way to ensure that AYI can maintain leadership in the industry is by consistently owning a better product portfolio than its competitors. While CEO and ex-Private Equity guy Vernon Nagel's lean operation has largely been a boon to shares of Acuity, his strategy on R&D is bound to be a huge liability moving forward. Acuity has an industry low R&D spend, both on an absolute level and as a % of sales. The graphs below are made worse by the fact that Acuity consistently touts itself as a leader in ""smart lighting"" and the Internet of Things.Management has continued to set expectations on calls that they will continue to be able to grab market share from competitors. However, these statements are out of touch with the reality that this market is highly competitive and portfolio advantages will diminish without at least equal investment.As competition intensifies and the legacy players catch up, Acuity has aimed to stay ahead by building out ""smart lighting"" and Internet of Things capabilities. We believe that whatever perceived or real advantage AYI has in these spaces is tenuous at best. Though Acuity has made a series of acquisitions in these fields (Distech, Bytelight, Geometri), its R&D budget has hardly moved, indicating that the company is choosing to buy technology as it becomes available, rather than proactively finding ways to usher in new product adoption. With this attitude, it is far more likely that a true tech player such as Google, Apple or Samsung come to dominate this space, as even a moderate amount of investment for these giants would put them far ahead of Acuity.Margin momentum set to flip as Chinese competition finally arrivesPricing pressure in this industry has thus far been relatively modest. For the past four years, AYI has recorded just a 1-2% drag on sales due to a worse y/y pricing/mix. We believe that this does not tell the whole story, though. LED products typically have a higher average selling price than legacy counterparts, and AYI's business has grown from 33% of net sales in 2014 to 66% today. We estimate that like for like LED sales have likely decreased ~5+% per annum over the past several years, which has been acceptable in the face of 15+% volume growth.However, this price deterioration has largely been without any aggressive action from Chinese competitors. To examine what happens when Chinese competitors enter a space without barriers to entry, we need look no further than Cree and the upstream LED market:LEDs are essentially just semiconductors that emit light. Beginning 5-7 years ago, when Chinese and Taiwanese manufacturers realized the extraordinary potential of LEDs, they began leveraging their semiconductor manufacturing expertise and cost advantage in production of LEDs. This has been very bad news for companies like Cree, which had previously been a leader in upstream LED manufacturing. As Chinese producers have slashed prices, Cree has seen its gross margins cut in half in just 6 years, from 51% in 2010 to 27% in 2016. Cree made a loss in 2016, down from a once-healthy 23% operating margin.None of the above directly affects Acuity. In fact, the Chinese competition has boosted Acuity's margins as they now face far lower LED costs to put into their lighting systems. We estimate that 1-2 percentage points of Acuity's gross margin expansion has come from upstream Chinese competition.What's interesting is how Cree responded. Faced with a rapidly deteriorating core business, Cree did the only logical thing: it moved away from Chinese upstream competitors and moved downstream to lighting systems and solutions. Once a LED manufacturing business, Cree now generates over half of its revenue from its Lighting Products segment that directly competes with Acuity.With upstream margins already tight, the logical next step for Chinese manufacturers is to take their manufacturing efficiencies downstream and further intensify competition. We have already seen this beginning:These initial deals are just the beginning and highlight the ominous truth that the Chinese are coming; however, very few analysts are talking about this very real threat.Recent growth has distorted the fact that lighting is a cyclical business and deserves a cyclical multipleInvestors have been quick to welcome LED lighting as a secular growth trend and apply historically unprecedented multiples to the lighting space. Well off its 2016 highs, AYI still trades at a 16x EBIT multiple and 14.5x EBITDA, despite retaining a highly cyclical profile. In 2Q17, we saw just how closely tied this industry is to consumer sentiment, as management attributed meager sales growth of just 4% (compared to an outlook of upper single digits) to political uncertainty.Much of the high multiple can likely be attributed to Acuity's promise of higher margin solutions in smart lighting and the Internet of Things; however, as we discussed above, we are skeptical that Acuity can generate real value with an R&D that's peanuts compared to that of the tech majors. Bringing Acuity's multiple in line with its lighting peers (LIGHT, HUBB) already moves multiple down to 10-13x; however, we believe that the industry is mispriced as a whole.Acuity derives approximately 50% of revenue from new construction and 50% of revenue from retrofitting. New construction is of course highly cyclical and will be strong when the economy is booming but anemic in times of uncertainty. While retrofitting would seem to offer some relief from cyclicality, we are skeptical that retrofitting isn't also highly cyclical. LEDs provide clear value as retrofits, but the payback period is still several years. Furthermore, it would require potential worker disruption and is therefore something that customers will be unlikely to undertake during volatile times. Since the economy seems to be firing on all cylinders now, it is quite likely that we are at a peak for this industry.While the growth profile of AYI is marginally better than the broader construction industry, the cyclicality profile is nearly identical. Since these industries typically trade at EV/EBIT multiples of 8-12x, we feel a 12x multiple is more than appropriate for potentially peak-cycle AYI earnings.ValuationOver the next two years, we see industry growth at 5-7% and expect Acuity to grow in line with the industry. Further, we expect gross margin to decline from a 2016 all-time high of 43.6% to pre-2015 levels of approximately 41% due to continued pricing pressure causing EBIT margins to decline from 14.4% in 2016 to 12.2% in 2018, before stabilizing at that level.With the deteriorated growth profile and realization of AYI's inherent cyclicality, we apply a 12x EBIT multiple to a projected 2018 EBIT of $461M and arrive at a PT of $120, a -30% return from today's price.(Editors' Note: This is a republication of an entry in the Sohn Investment Idea Contest.

4143763,50241,2018-02-06T20:48:06-05:00,We provide perspective on a selection of issues which we believe are commonly misunderstood with respect to Acuity.We see potential tailwinds associated with upcoming adoption of stricter energy codes.The decline in the share price over the last 18 months brings the shares into a range where long-term investors may wish to consider the company.,"Acuity Brands (NYSE: AYI) is a manufacturer of light fixtures, sometimes technically referred to as luminaires, and associated control components. The company has experienced a wide price swing over the last several years driven by the accelerating adoption of highly efficient LED lighting, although the earlier euphoria has been tempered over time.In this article, we divert our focus from the strictly financial aspects of the company to address a few of the key misconceptions and/or misunderstandings associated with Acuity's products and markets which we’ve seen in other discussions of the company. The perspective we provide may not change but should inform one’s investment viewpoint in addition to providing a basis for our belief that the decline in the company’s shares may begin to represent a potential opportunity for long-term investors.First, we’ve observed a significant amount of commentary about the company focused on the extended life of LEDs versus legacy incandescent and/or fluorescent products and the resulting impact on replacement cycles. In many cases, this represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the fixtures and the market.A traditional (non-LED) fixture generally consists of two distinct components, the light fixture and the lamp(s) (commonly referred to as bulbs) that go into the light fixture. The luminaire is the complete package – the fixture (housing) and the source (lamps). In traditional fixtures such as incandescent, fluorescent or any other lamp source, the purchase of the light fixture was an initial expense, but once purchased, the fixture would remain in place for the life of the space. In contrast, the lamps represented a recurring source of revenues as lamps burned out and were replaced in the same light fixture. The recurring revenue stream was captured by the manufacturers of lamps, such as General Electric (NYSE: GE) and Sylvania while the one-time initial purchase of the light fixture was captured by the fixture manufacturers such as Acuity. Acuity’s core business was never the manufacture and supply of lamps but the manufacture and supply of the light fixtures into which the lamps were installed, such that the replacement cycle of the light fixtures – Acuity’s core products – haven’t changed significantly with the advent of LEDs.In essence, the replacement cycle for a light fixture (as opposed to the installed lamps) is essentially the same as before the advent of LEDs and remains the typical 10-20 year expected life of the constructed space into which the light fixture was installed in the first place.In fact, the significant change associated with the longer life of LEDs isn’t related to the extended replacement cycle of the source so much as the replacement of traditional lamps with integral LEDs. The integration of LEDs versus the use of lamps shifted the value capture of the ongoing revenue stream from the manufacturers of lamps to the manufacturers of the light fixtures themselves, reflected in the higher pricing associated with LED light fixtures versus traditional light fixtures, and benefiting companies such as Acuity at the expense of lamp manufacturers.The result is that the extended life of LED fixtures does not in itself significantly impact, in the aggregate, demand for light fixtures in the marketplace and in fact represents a value transfer to light fixture manufacturers. We don’t consider the extended life of LEDs a risk to the company. The shorter term increased demand associated with replacement of legacy lighting options with LEDs does represent a temporary boost, but the magnitude of the installed base is so large that even this replacement cycle should persist well into the future.Second, while lighting, as with construction, is cyclical, there are compelling future considerations which will serve to mitigate any downturn in construction spending. In fact, the advent and ongoing adoption of stricter energy codes will continue to propel retrofit and replacement installations well into the future.In prior iterations of the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) and ASHRAE 90.1 (ASHRAE), the two most common energy efficiency codes governing, among other factors, the required efficiency of lighting or buildings, owners of spaces to be renovated could avoid replacement of existing lighting provided the scope of work met certain exemptions. The most recent versions of the IECC (and other related energy codes) significantly curtails these exemptions.A good example is one of the exemptions included in versions of the IECC prior to 2015. In broad terms, the earlier versions of the energy code provided an exemption for projects where less than 50% of the existing fixtures in a given space were replaced during the work. In effect, half the lighting in a space could be changed without having to bring the entire space up to current energy codes which, in most cases, would almost certainly require the replacement of tradition fixtures with LED fixtures. The exemption was (and in many jurisdictions still is) widely used in order to avoid incurring the expense of replacing existing lighting and lighting controls. However, in the subsequent iterations of the IECC (beginning with the 2015 version), this threshold is reduced significantly to 10%, a threshold with which only the most cosmetic renovation projects will be able to comply. The result is that more spaces which would have once been exempt from compliance will not be required, by code, to comply with current energy standards.Moreover, since the jurisdictional adoption of updated energy codes tends to be slow, the full impact of these far stricter requirements for compliance of renovation projects with current energy code standards won’t be felt for at least a few years. The slow adoption process provides an extended runway for ongoing growth in the replacement market as more projects require compliance.Of course, this is not to say that construction in the aggregate won’t slow in a recessionary environment. A slowing would certainly impact revenues and profitability. However, the stricter energy codes and their incremental adoption will continue to support the replacement and retrofit cycle going forward even in a recessionary environment. Indeed, with many institutions and entities specifying internal energy savings objectives based on outperforming the adopted energy codes, the underlying market may be surprisingly robust.Third, we consider the threat of Chinese competition moving downstream into fixture manufacturing to be somewhat mitigated by the nature of the lighting marketplace.In many cases, traditional and standardized products have lead times of 4-6 weeks. Light fixtures and control components often represent one of the longer lead time items for most construction projects outside of large new construction where lead times for major mechanical equipment such as chillers, air handlers, etc. will exceed those of light fixtures. Moreover, this time frame only covers the period from order to delivery and does not account for the weeks associated with bidding, compiling construction submittals, submittal reviews, etc. In many cases, large manufacturers also offer “quick ship” options for their most standardized products, which are manufactured on a continuous basis due to consistent demand and can cut lead times to as little as two weeks. The result is that inventories of light fixtures are generally low relative to volume as reflected in Acuity’s financial statements where average finished goods inventory is a mere 30 +/- days of cost of goods sold, a notably low value for an industrial manufacturer.The result is that, in most cases, manufacturing in North America is essentially the only available option to meet lead time expectations for construction schedules. In the event Chinese competitors did indeed move down market, they would need to either manufacture a significant proportion of their product in North America or maintain a significantly higher inventory than domestic competitors in order to be schedule-competitive, thus blunting any potential cost advantage associated with manufacturing overseas. In fact, given that the typical sea shipping time from China to the United States is between 2 and 4 weeks (port to port depending on termination port and excluding final destination) this shipping time alone would consume much of – or exceed – the entire lead time versus a domestic competitor.The alternate option of maintaining a sufficiently large domestic inventory of fixtures to bridge the sea shipping time issue would similarly add significant expense and narrow any cost advantage. A (greatly) simplified calculation would suggest that a manufacturer would need to hold the same inventory level as Acuity – let’s say 4 weeks – plus the inventory in transit simply to maintain a comparable lead time although this could still leave inventory insufficient depending on the flow of demand. The additional (up to) 4 weeks of sales required in inventory – resulting in roughly twice the ongoing inventory requirement of domestic competitors – would constitute a significant additional investment of hundreds of millions of dollars in working capital. Finally, this would only be practical with the most common and commoditized fixtures which are already the lowest cost and lowest margin (and sometimes loss leader) fixtures in the market.Indeed, it’s worth noting that the success of Chinese (and, more generally, Asian) manufacturers so far is in the largely commoditized LED manufacturing space, components which are small, light, easy to ship, and universal as compared to the complex selection of light fixtures available from a light fixture manufacturer.In the custom and semi-custom market, lead times can be longer, which may provide a better opportunity, but again, even if lead times extend to 6-12 weeks, a three-week average sea shipping time frame would consume half – or at best a quarter – of the schedule.Finally, in the commoditized market, it is not uncommon for light fixtures from one manufacturer to be substituted for those of another due to lead time issues. The cost associated with lighting is often comparatively small relative to the overall construction cost of a project and lead time considerations often override simple cost considerations since the cost associated with an extended project completion schedule often greatly exceeds potential savings on discrete components.In essence, while Chinese manufacturers may move downmarket into the development and sale of the light fixtures themselves, a successful effort in this area would likely require manufacturing parallel with domestic competitors, limiting any potential cost savings and pricing advantage relative to incumbent peers.We don’t disagree with other contributors regarding the valuation of the company’s prior valuation. In our view, share prices reflecting price-to-earnings ratios approaching 30 times earnings were clearly excessive despite the advantages of the business. The company also faces competitive challenges. A key criticism of the company has been that the product lines have been focused on generating incremental revenues from updating legacy products and form factors with LEDs rather than implementing design based on the opportunities unique to the use of LEDs. The mix is slowly changing in some respects although this has been an issue across the broad market and not specific to Acuity. The advantage, though, is that the lighting business is so fragmented that being a major supplier with a broad selection of lines under one roof provides intangible advantages for design specifiers looking to simplify their selections rather than attempting to source from a large number of different manufacturers.However, as the company’s shares have depreciated significantly from the peaks reached when euphoria was running high, we see several entrenched misunderstandings of the market coupled with forthcoming tailwinds which make consideration of the company’s shares worthwhile."
3857256,99706,2016-03-03T15:23:19-05:00,"Acuity Brands is a mid-cap company specializing in commercial LED lighting, by all accounts a prudently run business, and a US leader in a sector projected to experience large growth.The company and stock price have grown steadily for over 15 years, mainly due to acquisitions over time,.The rise to the recent all-time high mirrored the incredible US mid-cap bull run, market sentiment will have to remain bullish to justify this earnings multiple and valuation.Cyclical business, bigger companies deciding to compete in the space, and risk factors are not being priced into the stock, which is historically volatile.","Sometimes the best place to find a short is to look at a company where everything is going right. I didn't hear swarms of people yelling ""Short Apple"" in July 2015 when the stock was $132, because the company could do no wrong on its multi-year winning streak: crushing earnings, crushing estimates, breaking records. Nobody was in the mood to predict a 26% decline in the stock of the most dominant company on Earth, and yet here we are.You could argue that Apple gets too much attention, that it is a bellwether for the broader market, and that it has built up expectations so high that one earnings miss sends volatility up and the stock price down. Such is the fate of many growth stocks on the market. Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) is one of these growth stocks. It has a long history of earnings that partially supports their high-flying valuation, but not all of it. They have a product line focused on the future: LED lighting, specializing in commercial rather than residential, with tie-ins to ""ideas of the future"" like the internet of things and smart grid technology. A 2012 McKinsey report predicted a long runway of growth for this industry and several analysts have repeated the thesis since. Industry trade journals are extremely bullish on LEDs long-term prospects predicting 70% global penetration by 2020. Even though AYI is no billion dollar tech unicorn with zero earnings, this is a bit too much hype.Here is the background: the company has been growing its earnings with little interruption and maintaining a modest dividend of 13 cents since the beginning of the 2000s. The company did miss one dividend in March 2009 and actually cut it from 15 to 13 cents when it resumed, where it has remained ever since, but with a 0.26% yield, seniors are not loading up on this stock for income. Since it was on sale for $9.99 back in December 2001, at first glance, this has been a growth stock that has never looked back.The company's explosive growth is not, in fact, due to the explosion in demand for its products. It has relied on acquisitions for growth to maintain its competitive position. On March 9, 2015, they acquired the Canadian company Distech Controls for $252 million and on December 11th they bought Juno Electric from France's Schneider Electric USA division for $385 million (generating a loss on that investment for Schneider). Management is clearly bullish on long-term prospects spending over $600 million in acquisitions last year, significant for a company with $8.9b market cap. These acquisitions boosted profit by 34% when the company reported earnings on January 7th, but because the market was caught in a nasty downdraft at that time, the stock barely moved until this past Friday, when the Dow gained 383 points and this stock shot up 6.67%.Why is this the short idea of 2016? Everything is going right with this company. Management has bolted on a number of acquisitions without taking on any debt. Analysts love the stock and are almost unanimous in their buy recommendations and price targets. It's held by several top rated mutual funds according to morningstar. This is the kind of stock you buy thinking it's a slam dunk because you don't see dark clouds anywhere on the horizon, and you don't mind paying $37 for $1 of earnings, which is currently the case.But the market has already priced in all of this sunny optimism, just like it has priced a lot of bearish sentiment on a bunch of companies with solid, dirt-cheap earnings.The stock is also very expensive relative to its historical averages. For my Short of 2016 thesis, I want to zero in on the period covering the past five years. At the beginning of January 2011, the stock was trading at 59.77. At that time, the company had reported $2.08 earnings per share for fiscal 2010, so the P/E was over 28 at that time. Over the past 13 years, however investors were comfortable paying ~ 17.5x earnings for a share on average as was helpfully pointed out by an SA colleague in August 2015. It could be argued that this is too cheap for a growth stock, but I really think the catalyst was the bullish forces which were unleashed after the market malaise year that was 2011. If I take a sampling of two other US mid-cap companies that are somewhat unique in their business sectors and compare it with the Russell 2000, which would include all three, I see relatively comparable performance. This was a case of a rising tide lifting all boats.Were these stocks just too cheap back at the end of 2011? Was there just wild pent-up demand in the US economy for these products that nobody was noticing? I think the short answer to what happened is yes, partially, but the QE/Taper narrative context gave us 3 years of uninterrupted, stellar returns, especially in the mid-cap space if you look at the 14.63% and 37% returns the Russell delivered in 2012 and 2013, respectively. When you look at this bull run with increasing skepticism as I do, I just have to think that a stock like AYI will be among the first to bail.This is because I think a stock like AYI with everything going for it is going to revert to something more in line with its long-term price and earnings multiple averages and catch all the bulls unawares. The stock price cracked $200 for the first time in August 2015 and has been struggling to break through that resistance for a sustained period of time since then. As much as the first chart that covers a 15-year period seems to show a linear trajectory upward, the historical data shows the performance has been choppy and inconsistent:For 7 of the last 9 years or 77% of the time since 2006, Acuity Brands experienced a significant decline at some point during the year. If you exclude the rip-roaring years that 2009 and 2013 were for the US stock market, it's a much riskier name than the bullish thesis and management's outlook indicate.Bulls are also probably excited that Acuity appears to have 1) Crushed its competitors over the short, medium, and long haul and 2) not really have direct competitors. Acuity is the only public company of its size in the United States with this degree of focus on commercial LED solutions. The closest company is probably Cree Inc., which has had a much harder time turning a profit, and Hubbell Inc, which is a more traditional electric lighting business with an LED division:Rather than chest-thumping at its market position and dominance, I see this as a vulnerability, in terms of ""disruptors"" and upstart competitors, and well-established industrials like GE's foray into the field is also documented. Acuity is well aware of such concerns as they are documented in the risk factors section of its most recent 10-K SEC filing (October 27th, 2015). They are of course required to exhaustively document all possible risks they could face, but here's one that stood out to me which I think merits a short position at this near market high:Technological developments and increased competition could affect the Company's operating profit margins and sales volume.""The Company competes in an industry where technology and innovation play roles in the competitive landscape. Securing key partnerships and alliances as well as...having access to technologies, services, and solutions developed by others, and obtaining appropriate patents play a significant role in protecting the Company's intellectual property and development activities. Additionally, the continual development of new technologies...by existing and new source suppliers - including non-traditional competitors with significant resources - looking for either direct market access or partnerships with competing large manufacturers, coupled with significant associated exclusivity and/or patent activity, could adversely affect the Company's ability to sustain operating profit margins and desirable levels of sales volume.""Here are some more potential trouble sources I noticed in the 10-K risk factors section that I wanted to highlight:-No recall provision for increasingly complex products that require a correspondingly complex supply chain management system.-Exposed to Home Depot alone for about 10% of total sales.-Exposed to FX and International law risks with more than 50% of the workforce located outside the United States.-Existence of a defined benefit pension plan, rare now in the private sector due to the outsize risk and potentially prohibitive cost.Clearly, these guys are not like P&G or J&J making Tide and Band-aids into infinity. They have to continually grow the business (complex) and earnings (reliant on volatile economic environment) to justify this high multiple and I doubt the stock's ability to maintain this price level particularly through a downturn (a real one of which we have still arguably not experienced since 2008-09). The LED story is interesting but at 5.9 price to book and 37 times earnings it trades at double the industry average (according to Morningstar). I agree that management has done a great job for shareholders but nobody can bat 1.000 forever and that's no knock on them.People have short memories. Acuity pursued its long march upward in the 2012-2015 period when bears were nowhere to be found. The complacency was finally smashed in August 2015 with some severe bouts of volatility in the market, which resurfaced in October as well as this January. Acuity was not immune to this and its Average True Range has more than doubled from 2.99 to 7.61 between June and now, meaning the stock has been markedly more volatile lately. Although it has just experienced a notable breakout over its 50 and 200 days SMAs and the Technical crowd will skewer me for this, it is only due to one major upmarket day. I think you can expect things to get worse before they get betterThe short ratio of 1.97 million or 3.39% of outstanding shares (source: yahoo finance) is at the upper end of its two-year range, near October's high. This is good because it means the thesis is not overly obscure but it's not one of the top shorts either, which is never a good sign. The put/call ratio is not excessively bearish, at 0.71. I also note that the four year run-up has been characterized by stable but not overly heavy volume. Heavy volume has been non-existent since the great recession which leads me to believe that institutions have played a large part in discreetly driving this thing up, because media coverage is few and far between.A candidate like AYI is as good as any: bullish analysts, institutional money, all time high with bullish chart setup set to swing to a new leg, and lots of profit to cover the dividend. All that sounds great to a CEO, and you can tell he thinks so too, until like the unsinkable Titanic on which nothing can go wrong, this gets slammed by a sell-off/downdraft.Shorting the stock, currently at $197, like this would tie up ~$2000 to commit to 10 shares. There are only four option expirations available right now: February, March, May, and August. Currently 1 August $200 put, slightly in the money costs $21.20 or a bit more than 10 shares, but would be the most profitable way to profit alongside the decline while also giving you a longer amount of time to be right. There is a $175 put with the same expiry that you could sell for $11.40 right now; if you wanted to reduce your cost to enter the strategy by over half, but you will limit your profit to the $2500 (the difference between the two contracts), will cost you. The puts, either 1 contract or in a combination, give you an opportunity to profit from the likely decline of a company just flying too high right now whose risks are not being priced into the stock."
3985064,101875,2016-06-28T19:36:51-04:00,"Acuity Brands' stock price took a dive after Brexit.Since Acuity has very little European exposure, this drop in price has very little logical backing.With earnings coming out and a solid history of growth and meeting expectations over the past year, confidence will restore the stock price to earlier levels.","Thursday's Brexit has had a resounding impact on the market. Stock prices in all sectors took a hit as market confidence dropped. Obviously, a decline in the European economy and currencies can have a very negative impact on a company, with sales abroad being worth less and declining consumer confidence potentially hurting sales. This has, however, opened up opportunities. With such a broad hit to the markets, many stocks that have little European exposure may have seen an unnecessary drop in price.Company OverviewAcuity Brands Inc. (NYSE: AYI) is best described as an electronics manufacturing and design company. It concerns itself with the design and sale of custom lighting fixtures and arraignments as well as electronics systems. The company has a market cap of 10.21 billion and a share price of $244.03 at the time of writing, previously opening at $254.00 before the events of Thursday. Acuity did $2.706.7 billion in revenue during 2015, and has maintained a solid growth rate over the past three years (about 13%). Finally, its second quarter of this year was a very strong success, citing improvements of over 18% compared to Q2 of last year. Overall, the company seems to have been in a very good place during the past couple of years, with reasonable top line growth, improving margins, EPS growth and a nice upward trend on its price.So what's changed? Well, not much other than the state of the macro economy. With that being the case, we must ask how exposed AYI is to Europe and Britain, and how this will impact the company in the long run.Europe and AYIAYI has very little European exposure in both its suppliers and customers. The vast majority of its manufacturers are based out of Mexico and the United States, with only 2% of its finished product coming out of Europe in 2016.With customers, it is a very similar trend. A small portion of AYI's sales are in Europe - only 9%. Additionally, the company has stated in its 10-K that its growth will be focused in North America. With this in mind, the shakeup in the European economy should not impact AYI that much, because it has minimal exposure to European markets.A Brief Analysis of The Past YearAYI has been growing at a steady rate - in short, both Q1 and Q2 have had at least 10% more revenue than the equivalent quarter of last year. Additionally, margins have improved. All of this has trickled down to the bottom line, with the past six months of comprehensive income improving by 51.5% from the equivalent six months last year. The company also has a great record of meeting its earnings expectations, hitting them for the past six quarters. EPS has steadily grown, and this has translated to solid stock price growth.AYI data by YChartsThis consistent record indicates that AYI has a solid likelihood of hitting its earnings and bringing confidence in its stock back to normal levels and possibly exceeding those levels.ConclusionWith tomorrow's earnings on the way, assuming the company continues its trend of solid growth, we will see a return of confidence in the company, bringing it back up to pre-Brexit levels. It's also certainly something that will be addressed in its earnings call. Overall, if the company performs as it is expected to and addresses the fears Brexit has created, we will definitely see a rise in stock price. The stock is underpriced right now compared to where it was, and that should be remedied after the earnings are released tomorrow."

Acuity manufactures or procures lighting devices primarily in North America, Europe and Asia. During 2014, Acuity manufactured 25% of their products in the U.S., 53% in Mexico, 2% in Europe and procured the remaining 20% from other manufacturers. Acuity's principle customers include electrical distributors, retail home improvement centers, electric utilities, lighting showrooms, national accounts and energy service companies. Acuity's customers serve new construction, renovation and maintenance and repair applications. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is Acuity's largest customer with 12% of fiscal 2014 sales. Sales that originated in North America accounted for approximately 98% of net sales during 2014. Demand for Acuity's products is based on residential and non-residential construction, both new and renovation activity. Demand for Acuity's products is sensitive to the volatility of general economic factors. Lighting demand from renovation and retrofit activity in the U.S. has experienced accelerating growth in recent years.Strength in Construction Construction is one of the stronger parts of the U.S. economy right now. During the financial crisis, residential and non-residential construction dropped off precipitously, and the following years were a time of underinvestment. Now the construction market is coming back and it will take several years to recoup this underinvestment.A competitor of Acuity in the lighting space is Eaton. During Eaton's 2Q conference call, Alexander M. Cutler, CEO, acknowledged the strength in construction and lighting:""...the strength in the marketplace is really in the lighting area, it's in residential, and it's in selective parts of the non-residential construction market...""During Home Depot's 2Q conference call, Edward P. Decker, EVP Marketing, called out the strength in lighting.""The departments that outperformed the company's average comps were appliances, tools, plumbing, decor, lighting, kitchen and bath, hardware and flooring.... Pro heavy categories continue to show great strength and we saw double-digit comps in water heaters, power tools, commercial lighting, flooring tools and materials and power tool accessories... While cleaning, wiring devices, circuit protectors, plumbing repair parts, pipe and fittings and light bulbs all had comps above the company average. In decor categories, tile, in-stock kitchens, recessed lighting, bath fixtures, vanities, ceiling fans, faucets, interior lighting and bath accessories also had comps above the company average.""I expect strong construction activity to power economic growth in coming years, and I believe lighting will continue to be a particularly strong segment of the construction market.Addressable Lighting Market And LEDsAcuity estimates the fiscal 2014 North American lighting market to be $14 billion. Acuity's 2014 market share was 17.1%.Light-emitting diode lamps (""LEDs"") are disrupting the lighting market in a big way. The LED segment is the fastest growing segment for lighting. During fiscal 3Q, Acuity saw 13.2% growth in total revenue, but LEDs grew 55% and represented more than 45% of total sales. This obviously implies a significant decline in florescent lighting as LEDs disrupt the lighting market.LED prices have dropped enough to make the payback economic in many new applications. For a modestly higher upfront cost, LED lamps offer significant energy savings. Payback periods have dropped to the 2-4 year range for many more applications and caused demand to switch from florescent luminaires to LEDs. High-Bay Lighting is used in warehouse, industrial, sporting, retail and transportation facilities. In 2013, several high-bay LED products were launched that provide exceptional quality in a price range that allows for acceptable paybacks from energy savings.Navigant Research forecasts LEDs to grow at a 19% CAGR from 2015 through 2024. The market for every other lighting technology will contract during this period. Due to the increased lifespan of LEDs over florescents, Navigant Research forecasts global lighting revenue to peak in 2017.Acuity is benefiting from disruptive LED technology. Acuity is currently experiencing accelerating revenue growth due to demand from retrofit activity as the installed base is converted to LEDs. This conversion is expected to take several more years to complete.ByteLightAcuity's purchase of ByteLight during fiscal 3Q shows Acuity's growth strategy beyond the retrofit-LED pop in demand. ByteLight combines Visible Light Communication (VLC), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and inertial device sensors to transform LED lights into indoor location waypoints. This technology can be used in location-based marketing. ByteLight makes LEDs ""talk"" to any smartphone and tablet with a camera and/or blue tooth smart technology that opts-in to ""listen.""ValuationI see Acuity generating about $260 million of free cash flow in 2016. With an enterprise value of $8.3B, the multiple to FCF is about 32x. If Acuity is able to grow earnings in the 17% range, the PEG is about 1.9x. I think the stock is fairly valued.ConclusionAcuity is in the right geography i.e. the U.S.. Acuity is benefiting from a disruptive technology, and Acuity's management is investing in the future growth of the business. I see Acuity as an attractive business at a fair price, and I advocate buying the stock.Original blog post"

Since then, ROA' has increased steadily, reaching 27.2% in 2015. Meanwhile, Asset' growth has been volatile, positive in eleven of the past fifteen years, and ranging from -16% to 15%.Performance Drivers - Sales, Margins, and TurnsIt can be helpful to break down ROA' into its DuPont formula parts, Earnings' Margin and Asset' Turns, which are the cleaned up margins and turns metrics used to calculate ROA'. The chart below details both Earnings' Margin and Asset' Turns historically, to help us better understand the drivers of the firm's profitability and performance.Improvements in ROA' have been driven by improvements in Earnings' Margins and volatile Asset' Turns. While Earnings' Margins declined from 9.6% in 2000 to 4.4% in 2002, they recovered back to 9.0% in 2008, before stabilizing at 8% levels from 2009-2011. In 2012, Earnings' Margins returned to 9.0% levels, where they held steady through 2014, before increasing to 10.6% in 2015. Meanwhile, Asset' Turns, which declined from 2.7x in 2000 to 1.9x in 2006, recovered to 2.2-2.3x levels from 2007-2009, only to decline back to 1.9x in 2009. Since then, however, Asset' Turns have improved steadily, reaching 2.6x in 2015.Embedded Expectations AnalysisAs investors, understanding what the market is embedding in the stock price in terms of expectations is paramount to making good decisions. Without understanding what the market is pricing in, it is impossible to claim that the market is wrong. We derive market expectations for the firm from valuations and historical performance trends, to give a clearer picture into what the market is projecting for the firm.AYI is trading at a 27.2x V/E', which is near historical highs. At these levels, the market is pricing in expectations for increasing ROA', from 27.2% in 2015 to 59.8% in 2020, accompanied by 2.8% Asset' growth.Analyst and Management Expectations and AlignmentAnalysts' expectations are in line with the market, expecting ROA' to increase to 36.4% in 2017, accompanied by 8.2% Asset' growth.However, Valens' qualitative analysis highlights that management appears concerned about the sustainability of sales and EPS growth. Furthermore, they appear concerned about increasing SDA expenses, and may be downplaying the impact of higher compensation expenses. They may also be exaggerating the future growth that they expect in the lighting market, and the robustness of their pipeline.Valuation Matrix - ROA' and Asset' Growth as Drivers of ValuationWhen valuing a company, it is important to consider more than a singular target price, and instead the potential value of a firm at various levels of performance. The below matrix highlights potential overvalued or undervalued prices for AYI at various levels of profitability (in terms of ROA') and growth (Asset' growth.) Prices that are in excess of 10% equity upside are highlighted in black, and prices representing an excess of 10% equity downside are highlighted in red.To justify current prices, AYI would either need to see ROA' improve by over 2x, or would need to start growing the business by upwards of 20% a year going forward. Considering historical trends in Asset' growth, it is unlikely the firm grows at rates sufficient to justify current valuations. Additionally, management's concerns about the sustainability of sales and EPS growth, as well as increasing SDA expenses, indicate that expectations for substantial improvements in ROA' may be unwarranted as well, implying that equity downside may be justified.Our Chief Investment Strategist, Joel Litman, chairs the Valens Equities and Credit Research Committees, which are responsible for this article along with the lead analyst, Rafael Formoso. Professor Litman is regarded around the world for his expertise in forensic accounting and ""forensic fundamental"" analysis, particularly in corporate performance and valuation."
3394625,90335,2015-08-04T10:32:38-04:00,"Acuity Brands is a quality company with a history of solid fundamentals.However, valuation always matters – and at these levels, Acuity seems overvalued.Current shareholders might consider taking profits and patient value investors might do well to seek a more favorable entry point.","IntroductionOne of the most valuable benefits of Seeking Alpha is the opportunity to consider different viewpoints. While Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) has recently been discussed in terms of recent results and growth efforts, this article seeks to add to the conversation by putting a sharp focus on the current price-to-valuation relationship for this company.The thesis here is that AYI is a quality company but that the recent share price run-up has gotten ahead of valuation. In other words, shares are relatively expensive at current levels.This article will provide a summary of fundamental metrics and then provide a valuation method to consider. A possible reasonable entry point will be offered, and then two different strategies will be summarized for consideration.Balance Sheet MetricsIn order to understand the story of fundamental balance sheet performance, numerous metrics are included in one graphic. The metrics include:-assets per share (atps)-cash and equivalents per share (cashps)-common equity or book value per share (ceps)-debt long-term per share (dltps)-debt per share (dtps)-invested capital per share (icaptps)Source: fastgraphs.comIn my opinion, the data and graphical portrayal below demonstrate that AYI has consistently grown relevant balance sheet fundamental metrics over the past decade.Income Statement MetricsTo understand the story of fundamental income statement performance, numerous metrics are included in one graphic. The metrics include:-capital expenditures per share (capxps)-cash flow per share (cflps)-dividends declared per share (dvxps)-dividends paid per share (dvpps)-levered free cash flow per share (lfcflps)Again, it seems clear that AYI has delivered strong results on fundamental income statement metrics.So it seems reasonable to have confidence in the quality of the company. But the thesis of this article isn't about AYI quality - the thesis is that current price levels may well be elevated. Let's take a look at a valuation method which may validate this line of thinking.A Possible ValuationWhen valuing a company, I like to compare that company against its own historical valuation.In the chart below, the orange line represents earnings history and what could be considered ""fair valuation"" at a price/earnings multiple of 15X. The blue line represents a historic normalized average P/E. Finally, the black line is the market price of ALB.Note that a normal P/E for AYI over the past 13 years has been 17.5X earnings. Today ALB is priced at 36X earnings. And even if we apply generous growth to earnings estimates for 2016, the forward P/E is over 28X.Visually, the graph below demonstrates this data well: first, notice how historically the market price (black line) follows the valuation line (blue PE line). And then notice how today the black line (market price) is well above historical valuation lines. In my opinion, this really is an example where ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" as one reviews the price-to-valuation relationship.In my opinion, the key question that an investor must answer is this: is AYI growth so aggressive and so predictable that it warrants paying 36X earnings or more? Keep in mind there were periods during each year from 2010 through 2014 this company was available for about 16X earnings. This company has enjoyed a tremendous run-up in price, and frankly I wish I would have enjoyed that ride. But at current levels, the price seems stretched.So What Might Be a Reasonable Entry Point for a Patient Value Investor?One method to consider might be to apply the normalized P/E to even 2016 estimated earnings. This results in a potentially reasonable entry point around $120ish.Two Strategies to ConsiderFirst, if you are a shareholder, it would be reasonable to sell covered calls above the current price if you are willing to part with the shares at that level. This way you could either a) keep the premium if the share price does not reach that level or b) sell your shares at a price you can live with.Secondly, if you desire to enter a position, you could consider selling a cash-secured put at a level below the current price. This way you either a) keep the premium if shares stay about that price or b) have an entry level below the share price today.All of the above opinions offered for your consideration. It is intended as a contribution to the discussion only. Thank you very much for your time."

The company generated sales growth of 13% to $683.7 million, relative to the past year quarter. Its strategy of expanding portfolio towards digital lighting solutions and energy-efficient luminaries led it to generate strong growth in sales. Acuity Brands' LED-based luminaries generated 55% sales growth in the third quarter. These LED-based luminaries now account for 46% of overall sales. In addition, its strategy of expanding revenue base with acquisitions, partnerships, reaching new geographies and verticals allowed it make a double-digit growth in sales.Moreover, favorable market trends are also helping it to make big profits. On earnings announcement, its CEO predicted North American lighting market to grow around mid-to-upper single-digit range for the rest of fiscal 2015. In addition to the favorable trends, the company is outperforming growth rates with its smart business expansion strategies and potential to introduce innovative products.On earnings side, Acuity Brands generated solid growth in margins and profits on positive pricing and recovery in new construction market. In the third quarter, its gross margin increased 290 basis points to 43.2%, while adjusted operating profit margin also enlarged 290 basis points to 14.8%, relative to the past year quarter. Its net income increased 47% to $64.5 million and diluted earnings per share increased 47% to $1.48, relative to $1.01 per share in the past year quarter.On the cash side, I'm not seeing any problem for the company, as its operating cash flows are expanding on constant increase in earnings. In addition, cash and cash equivalents increased by $99.6 million in the past nine months. In the second quarter, the company generated operating cash flow of $158.2 million, when its capital requirements were at $46 million and dividend payments around $17 million. Thus, the company is left with huge amount of free cash flows to invest in growth opportunities.Its stock is on momentum, as investors are admiring its business strategies and solid financial performance. On earnings announcement, its stock gained almost 4.40% and gained more than 30% in the past twelve months. In my recent article, I advised investors to look at this stock for big profits. I predicted that the company is likely to keep its growth rates on the back of tenant improvement projects, increasing renovation, introduction of new products and lighting solutions and expansion in under-penetrated markets. In addition, the company is offering low dividend yield, which is allowing it to invest in growth opportunities. Its latest results, share price appreciation and favorable market trends validated my opinion.In ConclusionOther than negative currency fluctuations, I'm not seeing any risk to its business model and financial performance in the coming days. Acuity Brands is likely to sustain its momentum on favorable market trends, innovative culture, and diversified product portfolio and expansion strategies. Its cash generating potential will allow it to keep investing in growth opportunities. In addition, its focus on human development and hiring talented workforce is allowing it to respond quickly to the changing market trends. Thus, I recommend investors to buy this stock despite higher valuations."
3270025,54312,2015-06-19T08:42:25-04:00,Acuity Brands is making record growth.Its business expansion strategies are working.Its diversified portfolio of innovative lighting control solutions and energy-efficient luminaries are driving strong growth.The company is likely to post record results this year.It is a good buy.,"Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) is making big profits over the past couple of years. On average, its revenue growth remained around 10%, and earnings growth stood very high about 19% in the past three year. This is significant growth by any company in a volatile business environment. Acuity Brands is operating in a rapidly growing electronic components industry. With a market capitalization of around $7.96B, Acuity Brands is engaged in designing, producing and distributing lighting solutions, components, and services for commercial, institutional, industrial, infrastructure, and residential applications all around the globe.In addition to attractive business model, the company is working on smart business strategies to make a consistent growth in sales and earnings. On the back of investments in human development and hiring talented workforce, the company is quickly responding to the changing market trends. The company has a diversified product portfolio and it has been rapidly introducing new products based on industry trends. In addition, it is continually expanding portfolio of innovative lighting control solutions and energy-efficient luminaries. At present, the company offers more than 1.7 million SKUs to choose from, more than triple the number from 2008.Its timely strategy to expand lighting controls and solid-state product offerings has clearly expanded its portfolio and revenue base. In the most recent quarter, its LED sales increased 60%, relative to past year quarter. LED-based luminaries accounted for almost 42% of its total sales. In addition, Acuity Brands continues to invest and expand its capabilities to work on its integrated tiered solutions strategy. The goal of this strategy is to leverage its diverse portfolio by offering solutions that best meet customer's needs.Moreover, Acuity Brands is expanding its geographic reach and product portfolio with acquisitions and joint ventures. Recently, the company announced potential acquisition of Distech Controls along with a strategic partnership with Sensity Systems.Its business strategies are working. In the most recent quarter, the company posted record sales and earnings growth. In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, Acuity Bands generated significant sales growth of 13% to $616.1 million, relative to the past year quarter. Strong growth in LED-based products led it to generate record results. Moreover, net income increased 42% to $46.4 million and diluted EPS increased 43% to $1.07 relative to the past year quarter. This is a very strong performance to me by any company, when international growth is slow and currency fluctuations are impacting financial performance.Investors are also admiring its smart business strategies and financial performance. Its stock is on momentum over the past twelve months. Its stock looks pricy based on price to earnings ratio of 40.40, when industry average is around 16. However, its forward price to earnings ratio of 27.7 suggests strong upside potential. I'm also optimistic about its share price performance, as the company is set to make another year of record sales and earnings growth.Before moving to any conclusion it is wise to look at risk factors associated with Acuity Brands. Due to its extensive foot-prints, the company is exposed to currency fluctuations. Negative currency translations declined its sales by 1% in the most recent quarter and expected to impact sales growth in the following quarters. In addition, unfavorable weather conditions and product pricing could also decline its sales growth. Overall, these risks are beyond its control and the company has potential to off-set these short-term challenges.In ConclusionThe company is likely to keep its growth rates on the back of tenant improvement projects, increasing renovation, introduction of new products and lighting solutions and expansion in under-penetrated markets. Its cash generating potential is also enhancing with the growth in earnings. In addition, the company is offering low dividend yield, which is further allowing it to invest in growth opportunities. I strongly believe that its share price will keep upward momentum, as Acuity Brands is likely to generated record results in the remaining two quarters of this year. Thus, it is a good stock to me despite higher valuations."
3082656,31101,2015-04-21T13:02:04-04:00,"Acuity Brands Lighting, provider of lighting solutions, has acquired indoor location start-up company ByteLight.Acuity Brands provides lighting solutions to a wide variety of industrial, commercial, institutional and residential sites.Acuity has recently been exploring use of their LED lights for indoor location positioning for mobile applications.Acuity's acquisition of ByteLight makes clear the importance of cutting edge technologies for future growth of even the most mainstream industries.","Last week, Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) announced their acquisition of ByteLight, a U.S.-based start-up company whose technology enables mobile phones to use signals from LED lights to track their location indoors.Followers of the technology industry are used to seeing acquisitions of start-up companies, particularly in indoor location and other mobile-related areas, by major technology companies. Other indoor location technology start-ups have been acquired by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), InvenSense (NYSE:INVN), Aruba (NASDAQ:ARUN) and others. Why is a lighting solutions maker acquiring a high-tech start-up?As smartphones and mobile applications have become mainstream, the desire for smartphones to track their locations is becoming even stronger. Even the least cutting-edge smartphone users have come to rely on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Maps and Waze applications to help them navigate. These users are naturally wanting to be able to find their way around large indoor sites as well. If we can use Waze when driving, why can't our smartphones help us find our way around shopping malls, museums, hospitals, airports and big office complexes?Unfortunately, the GPS technology that enables our phones to track our locations outdoors doesn't work indoors. This has inspired over 150 companies to research how smartphones can track locations indoors. Many major companies and start-up companies have announced and started selling technology for indoor location applications.Unfortunately, indoor location technology has proven to be a challenge to deploy. Many solutions involve deploying ""beacons,"" or small radio units, all around a site. These beacons communicate with phones to help them track their locations. Deploying and maintaining beacons every forty or fifty meters around a site is harder than originally thought. Many other solutions, based on Wi-Fi or other technologies, have proven hard to deploy as well.This is what led Acuity, ByteLight and others to focus on lighting. Any site that wants to deploy indoor location applications already has lighting installed throughout. Increasingly, as sites are seeking to lower their costs, they are switching to LED lighting. LED lighting is an opportunity to deploy indoor location solutions based on infrastructure that's already deployed and budgeted.The key innovation is that LED lighting generally includes a microcontroller, a small computer that controls the lights. A number of companies have researched how these microcontrollers can ""modulate"" the light they produce, and in doing so, encode signals in the light waves that communicate the light unit's location to any device that's nearby. Smartphones can pick up these modulated light signals with their built-in cameras, while people cannot see any difference in the light. This technology is called VLC, or ""visual light communication.""VLC has been worked on by start-up companies like ByteLight and a few others, as well as major companies such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Samsung, LG, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Sony (NYSE:SNE) and others.VLC offers the promise of delivering indoor location positioning to smartphones throughout a site without having to deploy or maintain any additional infrastructure such as beacons or Wi-Fi access points. VLC provides fairly accurate location tracking. ByteLight's technology determines location to within one to two meters, which is sufficient for most applications and better than the five or six meter accuracy delivered by many other technologies.As more and more sites want to deploy indoor location solutions, VLC technology is becoming a differentiator in the selection of lighting. If Acuity's lighting supports VLC, and a competitor's lighting doesn't, a site's plans for the future may lead them to use Acuity's lighting.Several lighting providers have announced or started selling lighting that supports VLC. By acquiring ByteLight, Acuity has taken this one step further, bringing the mobile solution in-house for receiving signals and delivering location-based applications.As indoor location goes from early-adopter to mainstream, and more and more big sites plan to deploy indoor applications, VLC technology will increasingly be a differentiator in the lighting industry.What will be the next mainstream industry to be impacted by cutting edge technologies such as mobile indoor location? Will future acquisitions of mobile start-up companies be done by companies in mainstream industries? Acuity's acquisition of ByteLight may signal a shift in which high-tech and mainstream are blending and a wide variety of mainstream industries will be looking to cutting edge technologies."
3057516,63483,2015-04-08T13:36:34-04:00,"North American lighting market is expected to grow at double digits throughout the remainder of the decade.FX headwinds will continue, but should be limited.Customer concentration is not worrying.Further margin expansion will be difficult due to industry rivalry, expect volatility with regards to margins due to fluctuating input costs.DCF model indicates Acuity Brands is currently fairly valued.","Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) is a manufacturer of lighting solutions. The company is expected to benefit from tailwinds such as the double-digit growth of the North American lighting market. As the company has a material amount of non-U.S. operations, Acuity should continue to be adversely affected by FX headwinds going forward. Although the company has significant customer concentration, it is not a huge concern. Further margin expansion will be difficult due to industry rivalry, despite the fact that the company currently has productivity-enhancement initiatives underway. Expect volatility in the company's profit margins in the future, as input costs continue to fluctuate.North American lighting market is expected to grow at double digitsAccording to a PRNewswire press release, the North American LED lighting market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21% throughout the 2014-2019 period. This growth is driven primarily by the preference for cost-efficient lighting. Most notably, many lighting systems used in buildings throughout the U.S. are many years behind in terms of cost efficiency. Based on the square footage of existing buildings, Acuity estimates a potential market size of $300b, a majority of which is driven by the need to replace older, less efficient lighting systems. As mentioned above, Acuity is a manufacturer of lighting solutions. In addition, the company also offers unparalleled breadth and depth in terms of its product offerings, evident from the fact that the company currently has 1.7m SKUs, triple the amount compared to 2008. LED sales now comprise of over half the company's top line. Furthermore, in the company's most recent earnings call, CEO Vern Nagel continues to report strong and resilient demand for the company's offerings. Without a doubt, Acuity is poised to grow its operations in the near term.FX headwinds will continue, but should be limitedBy now, most would be familiar with the fact that the dollar has recently been appreciating vis-à-vis other major currencies. This is due to the diverging monetary policy stance taken by the Fed, compared to its central banking counterparts. Although the recent FOMC meeting stemmed the strengthening of the dollar, the fact remains that the DCI has appreciated by approximately 20% since last year, according to CNBC data. In terms of foreign operations, Acuity derived 10% (per fiscal 2014 data) of its net sales from non-U.S. locations. The company has announced (as per Q2 2015 earnings call) that it has entered into several forward contracts in order to hedge its FX exposure. Though I am skeptical as to whether this would result in a positive outcome, the net benefit/loss should be minimal at best. Hence, although one should expect the company to continue being adversely impacted by fluctuations within the foreign exchange market, these effects should be limited going forward as the company derives only a small portion of its top line from international sales.Customer concentration is not worryingSeveral companies operate with elevated levels of risk due to the fact that they are highly dependent on a small number of customers. This obvious negative would be that if said customers leave, their desertion would deliver a huge blow to the company's operating results, leading to massive drops in revenue and profit. Although it is true that some companies that fit the above description are able to manage this risk of customer desertion effectively due to offering unique value propositions that result in a meaningful degree of customer stickiness, many are not able to.In this context, Acuity falls in the former classification. The company's largest customer is Home Depot (NYSE:HD), with the home-improvement retailer comprising of 12% of Acuity's top line per fiscal 2014 data. I am of the belief that Acuity is able to command a material degree of customer stickiness due to the breadth and depth of its offerings. This is not a mere hypothetical as company data supports my assertion - Home Depot has consistently been a customer of Acuity for many years. Furthermore, the home-improvement retailer's contribution to Acuity's growing top-line has been in the range of 10% historically. Said another way, Home Depot has continued to make larger purchases from Acuity year after year. This scenario can be extrapolated to the lighting giant's smaller customers. For the reasons outlined above, I believe that Acuity's customer concentration is not a problem. As long as the company continues working on improving and expanding its product offerings (as it has), expect cash flows to continue to be annuity like.Further margin expansion will be difficult, expect volatility in profit marginsAcuity operates in a highly competitive and fragmented industry where no one player can direct the entire industry. Although this may seem contradictory to my earlier statements where I asserted that Acuity has an edge over its competition due to the unparalleled breadth and depth of its offerings, I assure you that this is not the case. It is true that the variety of Acuity's offerings under its many brands is unrivaled. However, at the end of the day its customers prioritise low cost. Hence, although one may expect Acuity to be able to command a certain degree of pricing power due to the sheer diversity of its products (making the company the one-stop shop for lighting solutions), the customer's fixation on low-cost prevents such a favourable situation for Acuity and its peers from playing out. Therefore, I am of the opinion that opportunities for margin expansion are few and far between. Although the company has a productivity-enhancement initiative underway, according to the CFO (per the most recent earnings call), net benefits should be minimal going forward. Volatility and fluctuations of profit margins are to be expected in the future, as a significant portion of the company's costs stems from raw materials, whose price change daily.ValuationAs seen in the above DCF model, company revenues are expected to grow at growth rates of 13% to 10% throughout the 5-year projection period. This growth is supported by favourable industry tailwinds such as the need to replace older lighting systems with newer and more cost-efficient systems, as well as Acuity's historical growth rates. EBITDA margins are expected to remain flat at 14.4%, due to the fact that the company operates in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, as discussed in earlier paragraphs. Although I have mentioned that volatility in profit margins should be expected, I have not incorporated said fluctuations into my model, as doing so would require me to forecast the direction of the unpredictable commodity markets. The company currently trades at 18.2x LTM EBITDA. Using this figure, along with an 11% discount rate (due to the company's size and stability of its cash flows stemming from a meaningful degree of customer stickiness), the model produces a fair value of $182 for Acuity Brands. This indicates that the company is fairly valued at current prices. My outlook on the company is hence neutral - investors are advised to wait for a significant pullback to form a material margin of safety before initiating a long position."
2937826,24491,2015-02-22T00:20:18-05:00,"Acuity Brands already has the top market share in North America with 1.7+ million SKUs.
        In a near-$14 billion addressable market, the company still has a long runway of growth opportunities.
        But growth will always be a component of the valuation equation. Let's find out if Mr. Market is offering Acuity Brands up for a bargain, the relevant question.","Very few companies can showcase the selection of commercial and residential lighting products as Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) does in North America. Though the firm is tied to cyclical end markets, it's hard for us to not like the sustainable strength of its economic returns. But as we know all too well, it's not how much we like a company that matters, but whether Mr. Market has put the company's shares on sale. Said differently, is Acuity Brands shining too bright that investors have driven shares too high? Let's derive an estimate of Acuity Brands' intrinsic value and compare it to its share price to see if this might be the case.Acuity Brands' Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Acuity Brands provides lighting solutions for commercial, industrial, and residential applications throughout North America and select international markets. The firm's lighting solutions include devices such as luminaires, lighting controls, and LED lamps. It has the top market share in North America with 1.7+ million SKUs.• Acuity Brands' business quality ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively.• Acuity Brands has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 9.4% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 1 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 23.3%. Variable contribution margins at the company are often north of 30%.• Acuity Brands estimates that the size of its addressable lighting market in North America is ~$13.6 billion and growing. The market (both renovation and retrofit) is expected to grow in the mid-to-high single-digits during fiscal 2015. The company has opportunities for share gains as the industry remains quite fragmented.• The firm is well-positioned to benefit from expansion of under-penetrated geographies and channels. New products and lighting solutions could be a source of upside, as Acuity Brands addresses energy/environmental concerns and digital lighting solutions.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisHow can we talk about how much we like a company if we don't compare its returns with the cost of attaining the capital to generate such returns? In our view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread.Acuity Brands' 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 32%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.4%. We assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT as a result. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisCash flows form the building blocks of the valuation equation. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Acuity Brands' free cash flow margin has averaged about 6.6% during the past 3 years. We think the firm's cash flow generation is STRONG as a result.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Acuity Brands, cash flow from operations increased about 35% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 12% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisAll of what is known is in the past and all of what has value is in the future. The future free cash flows determine a company's intrinsic value, and the future free cash flows will always have a degree of uncertainty attached to them. This reality forms the backbone of why we apply a fair value range in our work. We value Acuity Brands' shares between $114-$170 each, a relatively wide range but one that considers its cyclical end market tendencies.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $142 per share, the midpoint of the range, is meaningful below the firm's ~$160 per share price tag, implying that Mr. Market is in a love affair with the company. It doesn't appear that he is going to give up shares on the cheap.Our enterprise free cash flow model, which drives the fair value range, reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 11.3 during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 10.1%. The valuation model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 15.8%, which is above Acuity Brands' trailing 3-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 4.9% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Acuity Brands, we use a 10.4% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.To learn more about how we think about our modeling assumptions within the discounted cash-flow model, please spend 15 minutes with Valuentum's Brian Nelson here.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $142 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Acuity Brands. We think the firm is attractive below $114 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $170 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueUnderstanding why fair value estimates should change is an important part of stock analysis. As outlined above, we estimate Acuity Brands' fair value at this point in time to be about $142 per share.As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Acuity Brands' expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $191 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $142 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Wrapping Things UpWe're big fans of Acuity Brands' fundamentals, and we think its opportunity in North America remains as robust as ever. However, so does everyone else. The company's shares aren't trading at much of a bargain -- in fact, they are trading at a price higher than our fair value estimate. Though we think Acuity Brands will eventually ""grow into"" its valuation on the basis of the future path of our estimate of its intrinsic value, we're not seeing the potential for outsize returns at the moment. Acuity Brands is another great example of a good company, but one that is not trading at a discount to intrinsic value. There's a lot of that today on the market.Pro Forma Financial Statements)"
2809285,47561,2015-01-09T10:12:56-05:00,Q1 2015 earnings were released on January 9.Earnings per share and revenue beat expectations.Global volume increased 14%.The stock has responded by rallying over 6% higher.,"Acuity Brands (NYSE: AYI), one of the world's leading providers of lighting solutions for both indoor and outdoor applications, announced earnings results for its first quarter ending on November 30, 2014 this morning and its stock has responded by rising over 6%; let's take a closer look at the results to determine if we should consider buying into this rally or if we should wait for a better entry point in the trading sessions ahead.The First Quarter BeatHere's a summary of Acuity's first quarter earnings compared to what analysts had expected and its results in the year ago period:Acuity's adjusted earnings per share increased 37.5% and its revenue increased 12.7% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2014; these results were driven by adjusted net income increasing 38.6% to $57.4 million and a 14% increase in global volume. Also, the company noted that sales of LED-based products increased more than 70% from the year ago period and represented approximately 42% of total sales in the first quarter.For the quarter, Acuity's gross profit increased 15.1% to $273 million and its adjusted operating profit increased 33.6% to $96.7 million, as its gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 42.2% and its adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 14.9%; these very strong results can be attributed to costs of products sold and selling, distribution, and administrative expenses increasing just 10.9% and 10.4%, respectively, both of which were outpaced by the company's 12.7% increase in revenue.Lastly, Acuity generated $46.7 million in net cash provided by operating activities and invested $18.5 million in capital expenditures, resulting in $28.2 million of free cash flow; the company utilized this free cash to pay out $5.6 million in dividends and grow its hoard of cash and cash equivalents by 5.5% from the fourth quarter to $583 million.Is Acuity Brands A Buy Today?Acuity Brands is one of the world's leading providers of lighting solutions, and increased demand for its LED-based products led it to a very strong first quarter performance; the company achieved double-digit percentage growth in earnings per share, revenue, volume, gross profit, and operating profit, while expanding its margins and generating $28.2 million of free cash flow, and its stock has responded by rising over 6%.Even after the post-earnings pop in Acuity Brands' stock, I think it represents an intriguing long-term investment opportunity, because it trades at favorable valuations, including only 24.6 times fiscal 2016's estimated earnings per share of $6.16 and a mere 20.2 times fiscal 2017's estimated earnings per share of $7.50, all of which are very inexpensive compared to its five-year average price-to-earnings multiple of 28.6. With these valuations in mind, I think long-term investors could consider buying into this rally, with the intention of adding to the positions on any weakness provided by the market in the trading sessions ahead."
2766905,56382,2014-12-18T15:55:45-05:00,"Acuity Brands is following a smart strategy by expanding its product portfolio and focusing on technology improvements to benefit from the LED lighting market.Acuity is looking to deliver integrated solutions to customers while it is also aiming to outperform the overall LED market in terms of the growth rate.The difference between Acuity's forward and trailing P/Es shows that its earnings are expected to grow rapidly in the future, indicating more upside.","It isn't surprising to see that Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) is performing well this year. As LED lighting gains momentum, Acuity's prospects have improved and the company is making the most of the opportunity present in front of it.According to a report:Now, to tap this fast-growing market, Acuity is focusing on improving the efficiency of its product portfolio, along with expansion into key verticals of the LED lighting market.Technological expertise and end-market developments will be a catalystAcuity's technological know-how is playing an important role in the company's growth. It is focusing on the appropriate usage and control of light while lowering the energy usage. As a result, the company is being able to develop intelligent lighting solutions. Now, since its products consume lower electricity and deliver bright lighting, the company should be able to see growth in interior and exterior conventional energy-efficient luminaires, solid-state devices, and lighting controls.As such, Acuity is ramping up the portfolio of its solid-state luminaire and lighting control systems, which are finding adoption in both residential and commercial markets. Industrial and commercial, which is its biggest channel, is increasing at a rapid pace owing to increasing demand for renovation and new construction projects in the residential and non-residential markets.Moreover, Acuity Brands is keenly focused on expanding and leveraging its solutions and product portfolio, apart from increasing its presence across markets. CEO Vernon J. Nagel is bullish on the company's growth prospects in the new fiscal year, and expects to achieve above-market growth rates due to improvement and renovation projects, innovative product launches, and foray into untouched channels.According to a statement from the CEO:To outperform the broader market, the company is expanding its presence into the construction market where demand for energy-saving solutions should lead to the adoption of its products.A broad product portfolio to tap the LED marketAcuity is continuing its fast pace of innovative product launches concerning the development of its product and lighting solutions, and thus, it is increasingly expanding its industry leading position and portfolio of unique lighting control solutions and energy-efficient luminaires. At present, Acuity Brands offers its customers over 1.7 million varieties of SKUs, thrice of what it offered in 2008.Acuity Brands is also focusing on the growth of integrated lighting solutions for applications such as commercial office buildings, healthcare facilities, schools, and several outdoor applications to completely utilize its portfolio of lighting fixtures, components, and controls. In addition, Acuity is continuously developing luminaires comprising of varied light source technologies like organic LEDs, and is also expanding its superior portfolio of unique products.The takeawayThus, Acuity Brands is progressing nicely to tap the growing market for LED lighting. At the same time, the company's valuation is also attractive. Trading at 32 times last year's earnings, Acuity might seem expensive at first. However, on a forward P/E basis, the stock is cheap at a P/E ratio of just 21. Additionally, the company's earnings are expected to grow at a decent double-digit rate of 13% over the next five years. Thus, Acuity Brands seems to be in a good position to deliver more upside going forward, making it a good investment prospect."

The company is transitioning to higher dependence on sales of LED products and is in a sweet spot to benefit from environmental concerns, an improving economy and the advent of the Internet of Things.Financial results for the first quarter of 2015 were just outstanding as the company established quarterly records for operating profit, operating profit margin, net income and earnings per share. This was the seventh quarter in a row with double-digit volume growth. LED sales improved 75% over the year-ago period and now account for over 40% of total sales which grew almost 13%.LED is popular with customers because it saves them money. LED lighting requires lower energy and is therefore less costly. LED usage reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to fluorescent lighting. LED is forecast to provide 36% of U.S. lighting demand by 2020 and almost 75% by 2030 according to the Department of Energy.AYI offers more LED products than any other company. Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Lee recently upgraded his rating on AYI to buy from neutral. In a research note, he said Acuity's growth rate in LED lighting is more than double the industry average.Zacks noted the strength in the Building Products-Lighting Fixture sector ranking it in the top 27 out of over 250 industries and placed AYI at the top of its sector citing the recent upward earnings revisions.Moody's raised AYI's debt rating in December to AA2 with a stable outlook citing AYI's ""leading market share, modest leverage, solid interest coverage, attractive returns on capital, consistent free cash flow and higher margins as the company transitions to higher volumes of LED lighting fixtures and controls.""LED technology has come a long way. Today it does not just offer lighting at a lower cost, but offers lighting that is similar or an improvement over other technologies. This year's Super Bowl is going to be played under LED lights because of ease of use, reduction of shadows and that it provides better viewing quality for television audiences.The Internet of Things is just beginning to be developed and provides many opportunities for AYI, particularly in industrial and commercial construction which account for 90% of AYI's sales. AYI is leading the way as the Internet of Lights meets the Internet of Things. With this technology, a facility's lighting system can communicate with other systems to direct people to open parking spaces or tell you what the weather is like outside. Some systems can even hook up with a shopper's smartphone and direct her to within a few feet of the product she's looking for.AYI suffered from lower sales during 2009 and 2010 as construction declined during that period. Future success is dependent on continuing demand for smart lighting solutions and a healthy construction environment."
3279655,69675,2015-06-25T03:45:42-04:00,"In recent years, revenue and earnings at Acuity Brands have risen significantly, sending the company's stock sky-high.
        Add to the performance the fact that management is attempting to innovate and it makes sense why investors are excited about the company.
        But with shares trading at extremely high multiples and with the uncertainty surrounding any innovative project, I can't help but to think that shares may be too risky here.","Times have been particularly good for Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI), a provider of lighting services and equipment globally. As of the time of this writing, the company's shares are trading 77.6% above their 52-week low and within a small margin from their 52-week high. For some investors, this is scary while for others it's a sign that there could be a great deal of upside moving forward as the market pushes the business's shares higher in response to innovation by management. Although it's possible that the latter group is correct, I personally fit in the more conservative, former group who's a bit concerned that Mr. Market may be overly excited about the company and the prospects it offers.Strong growth in the past with potential growth aheadOver the past five years, Acuity has benefited significantly from growing sales. During this timeframe, the business's revenue grew 47.1% from $1.63 billion to $2.39 billion. Much of this increase can be chalked up to the company's U.S. operations which, as of the end of its most recent fiscal year, accounted for exactly 90% of overall revenue at $2.16 billion. Outside of the U.S., there is no one country that accounts for a large slice of the company's sales, which makes it a good prospect for investors like myself who prefer U.S.-centric businesses.AYI Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsOn the bottom line, performance has been even stronger. Between 2010 and 2014, the company's net income skyrocketed 120.9% from $79.6 million to $175.8 million. In addition to benefiting from an increase in revenue over the past five years, Acuity's bottom line has grown significantly thanks to a meaningful decrease in its selling, general and administrative expenses, which declined from 30.5% of sales to 28.4%, while its cost of goods sold inched down from 59.3% of sales to 59.1%. Just as in the case of sales, most of this profit (about 96.8%) come from the company's domestic operations.AYI Net Income (Annual) data by YChartsYear-to-date, matters have only continued to improve. In the first two quarters of its 2015 fiscal year, Acuity saw its revenue hit $1.26 billion, 12.7% above the $1.12 billion seen the same quarter a year earlier. The company's net income has done even better than this, rising 26.3% from $77.2 million during the first two quarters last year to $97.5 million this year.There have been two things driving both the company and its share price. On the company side of things, Acuity has seen a significant increase in demand for its products in recent years, which has pushed sales higher. For the most part, this increase recently has been driven by the company's LED-based luminaires which, during 2014, accounted for 33% of sales after doubling from a year earlier. In the first two quarters of 2015, the company saw a 65% year-over-year improvement in this products and, as a result, roughly 43% of all revenue now comes from this category.On the stock side, there has been one other thing pushing shares up; innovation. Right now, management is exploring different ways to capitalize on Acuity's strengths. One of the more recent endeavors by the company has been to launch ByteLight Services. As you can see in the image below, the company is currently piloting this program, which will allow lighting within a store, combined with technology from your smartphone, to guide you not only to products you want but to make you aware of items that are on sale.Are investors paying too much for this?Based on Acuity's revenue and earnings growth, as well as the innovative ideas that management is working on, it's clear that shares of the business deserve to be trading at a premium but I'm afraid that Mr. Market may have gotten carried away with things on the valuation front. As you can see in the graph below, shares of the business are currently going for 3.33 times revenue. This represents a significant premium compared to where the business has been trading in the recent past and is well above any other point the stock has been over at least the past five years.AYI PS Ratio (Annual) data by YChartsA similar phenomenon is taking place with Acuity on a price/earnings and a price/free cash flow basis as well. As you can see below, shares of the business are trading for an extraordinarily high 45.74 times last year's earnings. They are also trading at a price/free cash flow ratio of 40.27, which is also quite high. Although neither of these metrics show the company's valuation at a five-year high, they do come awfully close to passing that threshold.AYI PE Ratio (Annual) data by YChartsThe last way I looked at things was through the lens of net asset value (all assets less all liabilities). Just as in the case of the company's price relative to sales, we can see that shares of Acuity are trading at an at least five-year high of 6.43. In all fairness, if you add back the current value of treasury shares to the equation, this picture looks a little more modest with shares going for 2.64 times book value, but that's still on the pricey side of things for a business that provides relatively low-margin products and services.AYI Price to Book Value data by YChartsTakeawayRight now, Mr. Market seems very excited about Acuity and I understand why. In addition to growing its business rapidly in recent years, the company has cut down on costs and is in a phase of innovation that could create value in the long run. Having said that, however, I am very cautious about things moving forward since innovative endeavors are far from guaranteed and, even if they are successful, it's uncertain how profitable they might be. While it's possible the company's efforts could yield amazing fruit in the years to come, the uncertainty associated with this expectation and the otherwise sky-high share price is enough to keep me away from the action."
2538035,25120,2014-10-03T03:42:00-04:00,"Acuity Brands posts solid results and issues a comforting qualitative outlook.
        Solid multi-year opportunities and strong insider ownership, combined with fat earnings and solid balance sheet are appealing.
        As the strong multi-year momentum has resulted in little risk-reward appeal at current levels in my eyes.","Investors in Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) had a reason to celebrate in a market which is seeing some downside momentum recently.A strong fourth quarter earnings release which was accompanied by comforting words for the upcoming year, triggered enthusiasm among investors as some investors have been cautious following a previous disappointing earnings release.Given the great momentum witnessed already in the stock price, and the premium valuation resulting from that, I remain cautious being only potentially interested at around $100 per share.Fourth Quarter HeadlinesAcuity Brands posted fourth quarter sales of $668.7 million, a 15% increase versus last year. Reported sales came in above expectations of analysts at $649.2 million.The company did a great job at leveraging this sales growth on its bottom line with net earnings being up by 22% to $54.8 million. Reported earnings on a per share basis rose by a similar percentage towards $1.26 per share, thereby beating consensus estimates by four cents.Management Is PleasedCEO Vernon Nagel was ¨extremely¨ pleased with the report as it demonstrates the differentiated value of innovative lighting, control solutions and great service. Nagel noted that LED lighting solutions nearly doubled versus last year, making up 40% of quarterly sales.Total sales volumes rose by some 17% as lower prices and an adverse mix component resulted in a 1% impact on reported revenues, with adverse currency moves subtracting another 0.5% in sales. This came as reported gross margins of 42.4% improved by some 380 basis points on the back of strong sales leverage and lower costs.Operating earnings came in at 13.6% which was up just 10 basis points versus last year. Variable employee incentive compensation expenses rose by $15 million in the quarter, reflecting the great performance. The lack of operating margin expansion aids in the company's mission to have a flexible cost structure, keeping earnings up when sales might see an unexpected fall.Confidence For The FutureCEO Nagel remains very confident about the future noting that key leading indicators suggest a mid to high-single digit increase in the North American Lighting market for the fiscal year of 2015, a trend expected to continue for multiple years to come.Despite the optimism displayed by management, the company failed to quantify these words into an actual number prediction going forwards.Solid Financial Position, Premium ValuationAt the end of the quarter, Acuity held some $552 million in cash and equivalents, having some $354 million in total debt outstanding. This results in a net debt position of some $200 million which is very comfortable.The company currently has some 43.2 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter which values equity in the business at $5.6 billion with shares trading at $130 per share. Subtracting the net cash holdings and operating assets are valued at around $5.4 billion.This values operating assets at 2.2 times annual sales reported at $2.4 billion for the past year. This furthermore implies a valuation at 30 times trailing earnings of $176 million as reported this year.Recent Growth, After Year's Of StagnationThe very strong growth rates might give you the illusion that Acuity is growing rapidly while a quick look at the past decade learns that trailing sales of $2.4 billion are just up slightly from the $2.1 billion reported ten years ago. Shares are up significantly from the lows of $1.6 billion in 2010 however.Important is that profitability has improved significantly recently, although the recent sales growth is largely ¨shared¨ with employees given the higher incentive based compensation being paid out. It must be said that the company managed to keep the outstanding share base rather flat, as the company steadily turned a net debt position into a steady net cash holding at the moment.Underlying the recent uptick in reported growth rates are some real changes. Acuity's LED based offerings are growing at a rate of nearly 100% per annum now, and make up 40% of reported sales over the past quarter which has a real impact on the bottom line. The combination of products, controls & systems and services appears to be a real hit, driving this growth.The increased focus on the environment, rising energy costs, developing technologies and higher standards set by politicians are all driving the increasing favorable conditions for the company to operate within. This is the reason why the company anticipates the addressable market to increase by 50% between 2013 and 2018.Final ThoughtsFor most of the past decade, shares have traded in a $20-$60 range between the years of 2005 and 2012 before they rose sharply after they peaked at around $145 per share at the start of the year. Following a pullback to levels around $110 this summer, shares have been on the increase again, driven by the solid fourth quarter results in particular.Consequently shares have risen more than 40% already over the past year, increasing expectations along the way on the back of the strong current results, further anticipated growth and strong insider ownership. Consequently shares now trade at around 30 times trailing earnings, although analysts anticipate earnings per share growth of around 25% for the upcoming year, making the multiple already more acceptable.Yet I wonder if this is the right time to jump into the shares. A 20 times earnings multiple based on forward earnings would translate into a targeted entry point at around $100 per share which appears fair in my eyes. This valuation multiple reflects both the long term optimism as well as somewhat stagnant long term performance.While the current negative market momentum could provide a drag on shares, I suspect that shares will hold up relatively well if the pullback in general equity markets might continue. This is as investors continue to base their decisions on the solid earnings report.Consequently I see few opportunities for a meaningful pullback towards levels which I find attractive. Therefore I remain cautious and disciplined, placing the shares on my watchlist for now."
3313865,86166,2015-07-10T09:58:45-04:00,"AYI reported robust results in Q3 on account of growing LED sales and higher volumes.
        AYI should be able to sustain the trend going forward as the market for LED lighting is expected to be worth $42 billion in 2019 from $4.8 billion in 2012.
        AYI is launching new and more efficient products to tap growth in the end market.
        AYI, however, could face stiff competition from the import of cheap Chinese LED bulbs into North America, which accounts for 98% of its revenue.
        But, AYI should overcome the challenges by investing in product development due to a strong fundamental position, while its valuation also indicates upside.","Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) has been in fine form on the stock market in 2015, with its shares gaining more than 32% so far this year. This is not surprising, as Acuity operates in the fast-growing market of LED lighting, which has allowed it to record consistent growth in the past few months as shown below:AYI Revenue (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsThe company's strong showing continued last week when it reported its third-quarter results. Acuity announced third-quarter net sales of $683.7 million, up 13% year-over-year. The improvement in the company's revenue was driven by a 14% jump in volume. Additionally, Acuity posted net income of $64.5 million, up 47% over the same period last year, and beat the bottom line estimate by a comfortable margin.In fact, Acuity has outpaced the Street's bottom line estimate in each of the last four quarters, driven by the traction that it is seeing in LED lighting sales. For instance, last quarter, sales of the company's LED-based products increased nearly 55% year-over-year, accounting for over 45% of its quarterly sales. Looking ahead, it is likely that Acuity will be able to maintain this rate of growth on the back of growth in its end market and operational improvements.The end market opportunity is strongThe LED lighting market is anticipated to grow at an impressive pace. This is not surprising, as LED lighting solutions are way more energy efficient than incandescent lights and last for a very long time. As per WinterGreen Research:As a result of these advantages, the adoption of LED lighting is expected to grow at a rapid pace going forward. In fact, MarketWatch reports that the size of this market will grow from $4.8 billion in 2012 to $42 billion in 2019, clocking an annual growth rate of 45%. Moreover, due to their environment-friendly nature, LED lighting is gaining traction in countries such as China as the government looks to curb emissions by banning incandescent bulbs.Thus, it is evident that the market for LED lighting will continue growing across the globe.How Acuity plans to tap the end-market opportunityTo capture the available growth in the end market, Acuity is fast expanding its product portfolio. For instance, in April, the company launched a LED and OLED lighting solution, known as NOMI, that can be used both indoor and outdoor. The specialty of this product is that it offers multiple lighting distributions, has color temperature options of 3000K, 3500K, and 4000K, and can last up to 40,000 hours.Additionally, at the end of May, Acuity had launched LED streetlights that are capable of delivering 60% higher efficiency and require half the maintenance as compared to identical HID luminaires. Thus, it is evident that the company is focusing on a mix of variety and consistency in order to attract more customers going forward. This strategy has worked well for the company so far, and the trend can be expected to continue in the future.Specifically, Acuity gets 98% of its sales from the North American market, as shown below, and the opportunity over here is expected to grow rapidly going forward:SourceThus, Acuity is doing the right thing by focusing primarily on the lighting market by launching new products, as this will help it capture a bigger pie of the overall LED market.ThreatsHowever, Acuity needs to be wary of bigger players in the LED industry, such as Philips (NYSE:PHG). Recently, Philips announced that it is selling its LED lighting business for $2.8 billion to Go Scale Capital. As a result, the sold entity will now be able to focus more clearly on the LED lighting business as Go Scale is a ""technology fund that will seek to expand the company's automotive and LED businesses.""Additionally, Philips will still be supplying technology to Lumileds, the division that it has sold. In fact, Lumileds has more than 600 patents covering LED manufacturing and automotive lighting, and there is a chance that it might sell or license these patents to Chinese manufacturers. As reported by LED Inside:This will create a headwind for Acuity Brands, as the U.S. is the largest export market for Chinese LEDs, accounting for 20% of total exports. If Lumileds licenses its technology to Chinese LED companies, they could reduce the cost associated with manufacturing LEDs, thereby undercutting the likes of Acuity brands.Valuation, fundamentals, and conclusionFrom the above discussion, it is evident that Acuity Brands is making smart moves in order to tap the LED opportunity. The company has a strong position in North America, and is trying to consolidate the same by launching new and efficient products. Although it might face stiff competition from Chinese LED manufacturers, investors should not forget that Acuity has a strong balance sheet that will enable it to continue investing in innovation.For example, Acuity's debt of $353 million is lower than its cash position of $601 million, while the company has also generated $251 million in operating cash flow over the past year. This indicates that it has enough liquidity to invest in product development and come out with better products. Moreover, the company's valuation is also favorable. Acuity trades at 41 times last year's earnings, and the multiple comes down to 27 on a forward P/E basis. This indicates that its earnings are anticipated to increase going forward.Hence, all in all, Acuity looks like a smart investment and it is probable that its strong run on the stock market will continue going forward."
2373195,50602,2014-08-02T05:16:25-04:00,"Economic data is showing a positive trend towards progress in the United States.Investors looking for exposure to cyclical stocks need to be careful when finding undervalued names.Acuity Brands is a rapidly growing company with room to grow and high demand for its products, and is selling for a discount due to a recent earnings miss.","Over the last six months, as economic data has continued to shed light on the domestic landscape, it has become quite clear that the United States is showing real industrial progress. Unemployment and jobless claims are at their lowest levels since 2008, ISM manufacturing data is showing robust growth, and consumer spending ranks among their highest levels in four years. These trends point to a steadily improving U.S economy, and investors need to position themselves for a continuation of these trends for the foreseeable future. The challenge, however, is finding stocks tied to economic growth that haven't already rallied into fair or over-valued territory. Enter Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI). This mid-cap industrial has mastered a cyclical business model and is in perfect position to take advantage of any future economic progress. However, due to a slight earnings miss in its most recent quarter, the stock has taken a hit, and is now valued below its normal level of growth and performance. If investors or traders have missed a part of the huge rally in stocks since 2012-13 and want to find a way to catch-up, AYI could be the solution. The company sees massive future potential in its various markets, and has a dedicated management team and new products to take advantage of its opportunities in a favorable industrial landscape.OverviewAcuity Brands is the leading domestic provider of lighting solutions for commercial, industrial, and residential applications throughout North America and abroad. Customers in its various business channels include electrical distributors, retail home improvement centers, utilities and energy service companies. Acuity's largest single client is Home Depot, which accounts for 13% of total sales and has a large presence in the United States. AYI perfectly fits the definition of a cyclical stock - earnings and revenues are directly ""…affected by volatility from a number of general business and economic factors, such as GDP, employment levels, energy costs, and commodity costs"" (Form 10-k). The company's primary market is non-residential construction, which provides exposure to a highly cyclical business without relying too heavily on new home sales or consumer real estate. A major component of current and future cash flow for Acuity Brands involves not only installation of lighting during construction, but renovation of old or out of date products. AYI's management has referred to this market as a $250 billion opportunity, which not only gives the company a large market to grow into (50x its current market cap), but a guaranteed steady stream of future income. Investors can feel confident that demand for Acuity's products will continue to increase as efficiency standards for lighting become stricter and construction spending in the United States picks up.At the helm of Acuity Brands is CEO Vernon Nagel, who took over his position in 2004. Before taking the CEO job, Nagel served as CFO since 2001 when the company first went public. This means AYI has an experienced and time-tested manager leading the company going forward, with an impressive track record to show for it. During Nagel's 10 year career as CEO, AYI's stock price has risen by an average of over 38% per year, including the crisis years of 2008-09. This performance should certainly raise eyebrows compared to the 8% per year average return for the S&P 500 over the same period.If Nagel's past performance doesn't give confidence to investors, then his expectation of future success should. Nagel currently owns close to 200,000 shares of AYI stock, which translates to more than $22 million at current prices. To put this in perspective, Nagel has over 3 years of his current annual compensation invested in his company - if this doesn't show his belief in the business, I don't know what does. With the amount of autonomy and clarity Nagel has over Acuity Brands, the amount of money he has riding on the company's future shows how bullish the future is for Acuity Brands.Apart from the CEO, other company insiders have been scrambling to up their positions in Acuity as well. As you can see above, insider selling has turned into insider buying over the past few months, with close to 50,000 shares purchased, or $5.4 million at today's prices. When company employees and executives are buying their own stock, investors should buy alongside them, because insiders usually have better knowledge about future results and are motivated enough to put their hard-earned money where their work is, so to speak.EarningsOne reason insider buying might have picked up recently is due to the 21% drop AYI's stock has experienced since the beginning of July. The fall was attributed to the company's most recent quarter, where earnings and revenue both missed Wall Street expectations. Keep in mind, however, that Acuity Brands doesn't give earnings or revenue guidance, which could mean higher than average volatility around its quarterly reports than other companies. Opportunity or risk, consider it however you wish.On the conference call, Nagel talked about the current situation for the company, and where he expects business to progress. Specifically for the company's LED division, business was reported as booming, with sales doubling year over year. Nagel put it into perspective:Management also talked about the introduction of new products, which should continue to increase future demand. Acuity's R&D division, as well as its recent acquisition of eldoLED in 2013, allowed it to win the coveted Innovative Product of the Year Award at the Las Vegas light fair (yes, a light fair does indeed exist…). AYI's eldoLED acquisition seems to be paying off, as the opportunity for the LED driver market was discussed as ""a $1 billion potential within the next 10-12 years."" Management sounded quite confident about their plans for the future of the company given the reaction the stock took the following day, and showed no concern over increased competition or regulatory intervention. In fact, they took competitors head on, stating that their products are the best on the market and rival producers such as Eaton or Phillips can only compete by shrinking their margins to offer lower prices to consumers.While investors may have been spooked by AYI's earnings miss and subsequent price drop, many saw the quarter for what it was - a strong performance building towards a successful 2014-15. A week after Acuity unveiled results, BB&T upgraded the stock to a Buy with a $138 price target. This is a gutsy analyst call, because in most other situations where a company reports misses on both the top and bottom lines, analysts revise their estimates down to keep pace with the declining share price. Instead, BB&T went against the current and called for shares to appreciate more than 16% from where they were on July 7th when the call was made. For an analyst to make a contrarian call in the face of a declining stock price, there had to be evidence that the company wasn't in as bad shape as investors first presumed. If any positive news is announced about Acuity in the future, look for other analysts to follow suit and send the stock price higher.ValuationWith these earnings in mind, the value of Acuity Brands can be compared to the recent performance of the stock, which has had a rough few weeks since it reported earnings. At current prices AYI trades at 28 times earnings, which is lofty compared to the S&P 500 and other more mature industrial companies. However, when taking into account earnings growth of this relatively small and young company, AYI's multiple can be easily understood. Over the past 4 years, Acuity has grown EPS by 27% annually, underscoring the success management has had in building a strong brand and growing its product portfolio to meet increasing demand. Given this growth rate, AYI's PEG ratio, or multiple/growth rate, is quite reasonable, especially compared to its competitors:AYI PEG Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsAYI PEG Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsDespite a stellar share performance over the past decade, Acuity Brands is still growing at a significant rate, and should be rewarded with a higher multiple as a result.CatalystsLooking ahead for the rest of 2014 and 15, Acuity Brands has a number of developments that could contribute significantly to its top and bottom lines. The first, and potentially most important, is the debate over government spending on infrastructure in the United States. As has been discussed for many weeks and months now, roads and bridges across the country are aging rapidly, and many are becoming unsafe to use. Amid the budgetary debates of 2012-13, many in Congress and the White House brought up the issue of repairing the nation's infrastructure to maintain adequate safety standards and spark much needed - if only temporary - job growth. If more money is allocated to infrastructure spending in the future, Acuity Brands is the company that would benefit directly from it. AYI's 10-K mentions that ""construction spending on infrastructure projects such as highways, streets, and urban developments has a material impact on the demand for the Company's infrastructure- focused lighting solutions"". This is the exact need that Washington is discussing solving, which could mean large-scale projects coming Acuity's way in the future.Other catalysts for AYI involve its seasonality of earnings towards the second half of the year. With an earnings report that triggered large blocks of selling, many investor and analyst expectations are likely to be shifted downward for the rest of the year. Coupled with a lack of earnings guidance given by the company, many are unsure of growth numbers for AYI for the remainder of 2014, which could provide a short-term opportunity. Until AYI reports earnings again, the stock is unlikely to show any momentum to the upside, which allows investors to buy into the company at depressed levels. When the company reports its results next quarter, which should include seasonally higher business growth, analysts and other potential investors would react positively to an upside surprise, which would send prices back to their highs. Just last January when AYI reported an upside surprise, shares jumped 17% in one day. The company's last quarter could be setting investors up for another positive surprise like this, which means significant gains in a relatively short amount of time.To gauge AYI's results without earnings guidance from management, I would look to Home Depot's performance for a clue. Home Depot accounts for 13% of Acuity's sales, which represents a large portion of total business in one client. If Home Depot's earnings show growth, it could translate positively to Acuity's earnings as well. If HD's earnings disappoint, however, it may be an omen of weakness from suppliers. This connection between companies can be seen through their earnings trajectories:AYI EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YChartsIf either companies' earnings diverge from each other, it could mean either a change of business strategy or a sign that the other company's earnings will follow suit. With this indicator in mind, investors can discern AYI's potential results without relying on management forecasts.ConclusionAs the economy improves, cyclical stocks are sure to show appreciation in both earnings and share price as investors clamor for a piece of the industry. For those of you who need to play catch-up, AYI provides the opportunity needed to up your return in this bullish cycle. With an impressively strong business, increasing demand for its products, and a valuation at a discount to its recent growth trend, Acuity Brands is a company that insiders love and a stock that should rebound significantly in the future. Even though shares have underperformed over the past few weeks, a noticeable increase in insider buying and analyst upgrades since its last quarter suggest better times are ahead for the stock. Before its next quarter, potential buyers can pick up a rapidly growing business that has been taken off the community spotlight, and is sure to return there once the 2nd half shows progress in earnings. With help gauging future results from companies like Home Depot, downside risk is muted in shares of AYI until growth numbers impress again.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2126993,59641,2014-04-04T17:58:45-04:00,,"By Mitchell Clark, B.Comm.There’s one company that is likely to have a very good year in 2014.As my readers will know, the most valuable information going as an equity investor (businessperson) is what an enterprise says about its business conditions. And according to this company, business conditions are looking up.Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) is a well-known lighting company out of Atlanta that serves mostly commercial and industrial markets. The company operates a number of brands, selling through independent agents, electrical wholesalers, and sales reps.Total sales for the company’s fiscal second quarter (ended February 28, 2014) grew a solid 12% over the comparable quarter to $546 million.Earnings grew substantially, up 32% in the quarter to $32.7 million. Earnings per share also grew 32% over the comparable quarter to $0.75.Sales in the most recent quarter actually grew 13%, but this growth was reduced by one percent due to unfavorable currency translation.Company management cited an improving marketplace for retrofit and renovation lighting applications. Fiscal 2014 should experience mid- to high-single-digit growth over the last fiscal year, with March order rates showing solid improvement.Acuity Brands actually missed Wall Street consensus on both revenues and earnings, but the stock went up anyway after management said its order trend was improving. The company’s one-year stock chart is featured below:Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.comBut even with the relative good news and positive market reaction to the company’s latest results, Acuity Brands remains one expensive stock. And this is the dilemma for a good portion of this market.Stocks have already gone up. Many good businesses have seen their valuations and share prices expand to a point that’s beyond reasonable, considering their growth rates and corporate outlooks.The Fed’s lavish catering to Wall Street’s short-term needs continues to skew the sensible. Acuity Brands should have sold off on its earnings report.Trading at 27-times (X) its forward earnings, the company’s share price appreciated by more than three percent on the day it reported. Expectations for new order growth were solid, but the earnings miss was around $0.08 per share.This is the market investors have to live in these days, and it’s likely to remain this way, so long as the Fed is so unabashedly accommodative with its monetary policy and words.Acuity Brands is a good business, but I don’t want to buy the stock at an all-time record-high at its current valuation.Value in the equity universe is becoming a tough thing to come by. (See “This Energy Stock to Be Major Beneficiary of LNG Build-Out?”) It’s part of the reason why I view investment risk as being so high for new positions, and it’s why investors shouldn’t be in any rush to buy stocks now.Also reporting very good growth for a mature enterprise was Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM), which is the largest producer and distributor of fresh eggs in the U.S.Sales for its fiscal third quarter of 2014 (ended March 1) grew 10% to $395.5 million, while earnings grew a whopping 40% on the back of what management said was strong retail demand for eggs, even with higher prices.Cal-Maine Foods has doubled on the stock market over the last three years and is fully priced.No doubt, it’s tough to be a buyer in this market. Everything’s already gone up.Disclosure: None"
2055423,20568,2014-02-27T14:59:24-05:00,,"When I think of the top three most exciting industries a company could be in, lighting fixture manufacturing does not come to mind. However, if you look at our Zacks Industry Rank, you will see this business is the top industry of the 265 we rank. Granted, there are only 2 stocks in the space, but nonetheless it is surprising.Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) is the world’s largest lighting fixture manufacturer and pegs our meter as a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). I am not an expert on the lighting fixture business, but I know good numbers when I see them. In the last 60 days, 10 analysts have revised their earnings estimates to the upside for the current year and next year. The magnitude of the consensus move is very encouraging, with current year estimates up from $4.17 from $3.87 a share and next year to $5.07 from $4.70. Over the last 3 quarters, the company has surprised earnings to the upside and the stock has followed suit as well. The price and consensus chart helps outline the earnings revisions along with the stock price over the last few years. Here we see steady earnings growth year over year, and recently, the upwards revisions I already mentioned. Note how the growth in earnings has been accompanied by continued appreciation in the stock price.The technical picture is what makes this stock a certified Bull of the Day. The stampede started a long time ago and there is no sign of letting up yet. Last quarter’s earnings report, surprising to the upside by 12.94%, was a major catalyst, pushing the firmly through $110 into the stratosphere at $135. After pulling back to $125, the stock is pushing higher again and currently trades at $140. The 25 day SMA displaced to the right by days (25x5 SMA) is down at $129.49 and gives us a good area for a stop loss shortly below. It will be interesting to see how far the breakout of $135 can go before a serious pullback. The stock has traded for the most part above the 25x5 since July 2012. Those trying to chase this breakout should remember a couple of basics. First, set an initial stop loss within 8% of your entry. As an example, a buy at $140 should have a stop loss at $128.80. In the case of AYI, we have the 25x5 SMA as support at $129.49 so we could put the stop up here and further limit our initial downside risk. Second, once the breakout moves in your favor by 8%, $151.20 in our example, then move your stop loss to break-even. This way you are playing with the house’s money and letting a volatile stock take its course. ACUITY BRANDS (AYI): Free Stock Analysis Report (email registration required)"

1941931,59641,2014-01-13T10:10:40-05:00,,"By Mitchell ClarkAcuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) manufactures lighting, and business is really good. The Atlanta-based company just reported an excellent quarter and the stock blasted higher after handily beating consensus on earnings and revenues.The stock has been a powerhouse, up five-fold since its 2009 low, and has been especially strong over the last 12 months, like so many other positions.Acuity Brands provides all kinds of indoor and outdoor lighting and its products are sold all over the world. Any application you can name, this company likely makes a light for it. The company’s products are mostly for industrial/commercial use in offices and buildings, but the company also produces lighting for sports facilities, underwater applications, garages, emergency exits, decorative and landscape applications, and parking lots, along with some residential lighting.In its fiscal first quarter of 2014 (ended November 31, 2013), the company said it achieved all-time records in first-quarter sales, earnings, and diluted earnings per share.Earnings were $44.5 million, representing a substantial 70% gain over the comparable quarter (including a $5.0 million insurance recovery gain).Acuity Brands finished its fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $398 million, for a gain of $39.0 million over the previous quarter. Management said it expects demand for its lighting products to improve and become more broad-based. The renovation and tenant (improvement) markets are expected to be growth areas.On the stock market, Acuity Brands jumped 15% on the day of its earnings report. The company’s one-year stock chart is featured below:Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.comThe fact that this position is richly priced did not deter investors from bidding the stock after its latest earnings on a down day for the broader market. The company surpassed Wall Street’s expectations by a wide margin and once again demonstrated just how good a business it is. (Read about another stock that’s excelling in its business in “Why This Company Should Be a Case Study in Business Schools.”)I view Acuity Brands’ results as a positive economic indicator and I give credit to the company for filing its SEC form 10-Q commensurate with its earnings press release.With the exception of a one-percent unfavorable impact to sales due to currency translation, all of the company’s increased sales during the latest quarter were due to stronger volume. The company cited North American sales were increasing especially significantly. LED-based lighting, which represented just over one-quarter of the company’s total first-quarter sales, saw sales more than double comparatively.Management estimates that the North American lighting market, which is helped by new construction, renovation, and retrofitting, should grow by the mid-single digits in fiscal 2014. Wall Street currently expects the company’s fiscal 2014 total sales to grow approximately 10% and nine percent in fiscal 2013.I suspect the Street’s revenue and earnings estimates for Acuity Brands’ future periods will creep higher over the coming weeks. The company’s fiscal first quarter was very solid.Other than monetary policy, the most important data for equity investors is what corporations say about their businesses. For industrial lighting, business conditions are improving.Disclosure: None"
1111701,40891,2013-01-15T04:54:04-05:00,,"Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) designs, produces, and distributes a variety of lighting solutions for the commercial, industrial, and residential applications. On January 8, 2013, the company released its earnings results for Q1 FY13. Acuity reported net sales of $481.1 million and adjusted earnings of $0.69. The street was expecting $498.8 million and $0.81.Given the recent earnings report, the company's near-term outlook, and its elevated valuation, it's time to sell AYI. The shares also present a short opportunity with an excellent risk/reward.The Next Two Quarters Look Tough For AcuityFollowing the earnings miss by Acuity, consensus estimates were lowered for each of the next two quarters. Earnings estimates for Q2 FY13 dropped from $0.70 to $0.63, and Q3 FY13 estimates dropped from $0.94 to $0.89. Revenues are now expected to be $469.6 million and $513.0 million for Q2 and Q3, respectively.To determine whether Acuity can meet these lowered expectations in the near term, I have modeled the company's income statement for the next two quarters. With the continued downward trend in Acuity's end markets and falling margins, it appears that the company will have trouble meeting these lowered revenue and earnings estimates.Starting first with the forecast of Acuity's sales, my model correlates Acuity's historical results with monthly Manufacturer's Shipments, Inventories, & Orders data for electric light equipment provided by the Census Bureau (category U35AVS), as well as non-residential spending provided in the monthly Construction Spending report. The model is updated with the latest information available and that information is used to project the shipments and spending based on current trends. To account for seasonal changes in these figures, the model focuses on year/year growth rates for comparison.The chart below shows the correlation between Acuity's sales and the shipments of electric light equipment for the past several years. Note that the chart also includes data for the upcoming quarters (Q2 and Q3 of FY13). The model assumes a decline in year/year growth in light equipment shipments of 4.0% and 3.6% for those two quarters.The next chart shows the correlation between Acuity's sales and non-residential construction spending. For Q2 and Q3 of FY13, the model assumes year/year growth in non-residential spending of 0% and -0.25%, respectively.Based on these correlations and the growth assumptions for future quarters, Acuity's year/year sales growth for Q2 should be approximately 0.9%, which equals sales of approximately $461.9 million. Sales for Q3 should increase at the same rate and total $491.0 million. These sales projections are currently below the $469.5 million and $513.0 million consensus estimates for Q2 and Q3, respectively.In its earnings release, Acuity blamed the decline in sales on a lull in demand for the non-residential construction market and a general ""wait-and-see"" approach by its customers. It expects a more stable demand in the second half of FY13, but noted that Q2 is the softest quarter of the year from a sales perspective, and demand will be inconsistent. These statements are all consistent with the sales projections generated by the model.Acuity identifies two primary operating expenses in its income statement: Cost of Goods and Selling, Distribution & Administrative expense. In the most recent quarter, the Cost of Goods increased slightly over the previous year and caused gross margins to drop just over 40 bps. In its earnings release, the company identified temporary inefficiencies associated with the closure of a production facility as an explanation for reduced margins. However, Acuity classified these as special charges and provided adjusted earnings to exclude them (the adjustments are reflected in the model).For Q2 gross margins, the model assumes a drop of 130 bps from Q1 (compared to an average drop of 160 bps in the past four years). For Q3, the model assumes an improvement of 160 bps from Q2 (compared to an average improvement of 156 bps). The chart below shows how the gross margins of 39.1% and 40.7% projected for FY13 Q2 and Q3 compare to the company's historical gross margins. Note that the historical gross margins in the chart are grouped by quarter because they vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to seasonal effects.To complete the earnings estimate, the model projects that Selling, Distribution, and Administrative expenses will be 29.45% and 29.00% of sales for Q2 and Q3, respectively. This assumes an increase of 23 bps from Q1 to Q2 and then decrease 45 bps from Q2 to Q3. This compares to an increase of 20 bps and then a decrease of 49 bps for these same two quarters in FY12. The other significant items in the income statement are the tax rate, which was set at 35% for both quarters, and the outstanding shares, which are projected to increase slightly to 42.5 million.Under these sales and expense assumptions, Acuity will earn $0.57 and $0.76 per share in the next two quarters. Both of these estimates are below the street's current projections of $0.63 and $0.89.With any forward-looking model, it is always a useful exercise to understand the sensitivity on the projections with any change in the underlying assumptions. For FY13 Q2, there is a 6-cent difference between the model and the street's estimate. Of the 6 cents, approximately 1 cent corresponds to a difference in projected revenues and 5 cents relates to the difference in projected expenses. In the model, every 20 bps change in the gross margin or SD&A expense will move the earnings estimate a little more than a cent. The same is true for every 1% change in the tax rate. For the Q3 projection, approximately 4 cents of the difference is due to revenue projections and 9 cents relates to the difference in projected expenses.Acuity's Sales and Earnings Growth Are On the DeclineTo determine whether the recent downturn is just a bump in the road for Acuity, I also looked closely at the trends in overall sales and earnings growth. To account for seasonal effects, my analysis focuses on year/year growth rates using a four-quarter rolling average.As the chart illustrates, the rolling year/year growth rates for sales has dropped from a peak of over 11% a year ago to low-single digits. The earnings growth has seen a more significant decline. It peaked six months ago and will actually move into negative territory later in the year if my model is accurate. Even under the street's estimates, the earnings growth rate will drop below 5%. The lone bright spot here is that Acuity has been able to maintain a consistent 6% profit rate over this time period. Thus, the numbers show that relatively small changes in sales growth can have a big impact on Acuity's earnings growth rate.Acuity Is OvervaluedAcuity currently trades at a 20 P/E multiple based on the street's estimated earnings of $3.27 for FY13. The sales and earnings growth rates do not support this multiple, and the current trends suggest that resumed growth is several quarters off in the future.So why then does Acuity trade at a 20 multiple? Before reporting FY13 Q1 earnings, Acuity was expected to earn $3.52 per share this fiscal year (representing 17% growth year/year) and $4.22 in FY14 (almost 20% growth year/year). In this market, this level of projected growth can support a 20 multiple.With the current downward revisions, however, the expectations are now $3.27 (or 9% year/year growth) and $4.00 (23% growth) for FY13 and FY14. It is apparent from these projections that many of the analysts that cover the stock have not properly adjusted estimates for FY14. Indeed, the estimates range from a low of $3.33 to a high of $4.50. If Acuity's earnings are consistent with my projections, investors will eventually turn on this stock and the P/E multiple will likely drop.According to Yahoo Finance, the average multiple for other companies in Acuity's sector is just above 14. At that same multiple, AYI would trade at around $46, which is $20 below the current price. With the average P/E multiple for the S&P 500 around 12, there are far cheaper stocks that you can pick up with a better potential for growth and far less risk.The Short TradeOver the past six months, AYI has traded between four horizontal levels (indicated by the blue lines in the chart below). Just before Acuity reported earnings for Q3 FY12, the stock traded between $50 and $57. Over the following three months, the stock peaked just under $70, but fell back to the $57 support level after disappointing Q3 FY12 earnings. Investors shrugged off the disappointment and the shares climbed up to $70 again earlier this month. After disappointing Q1 FY13 earnings, the shares found support at the $62 support level again and currently sits at $66.With the recent earnings miss and sales/earnings in a downtrend, it is unlikely that the shares will breakout above the $70 mark in the near future. Thus, the downside risk for a short trade here is around $4. The reward is potentially far greater. A move down to the $57 or $50 levels is a possibility. For example, if the stock were valued at a 15 multiple (just above the sector average), that would put the shares at around $49. The potential downside in the shares provides an excellent risk-reward for a short trade.Disclosure: I am short AYI. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

The concepts aren’t new, but they make good sales pitches these days when the market for improving energy efficiency is growing.HID Laboratories in Menlo Park, Calif., for example, has developed a device to control high-intensity discharge lights that can be found in stadiums, factories and large retailers (see HID Labs and the Modern Dimmer Switch). Panasonic recently began selling a new type of florescent lamp that is equipped with a sensor that figures out how bright the room is in order to adjust the bulb’s luminance.That’s exactly what Acuity is banking on. Lighting can use up to 40 percent of the power in commercial and industrial buildings, according to Acuity, which sells all sorts of indoor and outdoor lighting fixtures.The company, part of Atlanta-based Acuity Brands Inc.

The second quarter should be a time of easy comparisons as the economy hit a trough leading into spring of last year. If there is any credence to the argument that the economy is on a sustainable path to recovery, we should expect bullish forecasts and impressive year-over-year comparisons. Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) had the misfortune of missing on both counts. The Atlanta-based manufacturer of lighting equipment reported earnings that motivated investors and traders to send the stock lower over 11%. Year-over-year results were very lackluster:AYI was a small-cap company until last week when S&P announced index rebalancing that placed AYI into the S&P MidCap 400. Despite its size, I am always interested in hearing commentary and forecasts from the company on the commercial real-estate market. AYI has been very consistent quarter after quarter after quarter communicating the poor prospects in the construction of commercial and office buildings. The only difference this quarter is that the market seemed to finally care about the poor forecast (and the resulting soft earnings results) (emphasis mine):AYI was also characteristically optimistic about its ability to outperform its competition, cut costs, increase margins, and capitalize on unique opportunities. This time around, such encouraging words were not enough for a crowd that must be getting impatient waiting around for concrete signs of a sustainable turn-around. AYI’s stock broke down below its 200-day moving average (DMA) for the first time since last July. The stock is now oversold, but the high-volume breakdown sets a bearish tone that is likely to keep the stock under sustained pressure. After some kind of oversold bounce, I expect AYI to retest, and then break, the February lows. (It is not clear to me why AYI was performing so well prior to earnings, especially relative to the larger market).Be careful out there.Disclosure: No positions"
1485661,47721,2013-06-06T13:46:05-04:00,,"Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) is a North American market leader and is one of the world's leading producers, distributors and providers of lighting solutions for both indoor and outdoor applications. The company has a highly configurable product offering, consisting of roughly 500,000 active products comprising over 2,000 product groups, which are sold to a broad and diverse customer base. The company employs approximately 6,000 people worldwide.The company's lighting solutions include devices such as luminaires, lighting controls, power supplies, prismatic skylights, light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, and integrated lighting systems for indoor and outdoor applications utilizing a combination of light sources, including daylight, and devices controlled by software that monitors and manages light levels while optimizing energy consumption.The company's principle customers include contractors, corporate accounts, government, distributors, retail home improvement centers, electric utilities, municipalities, lighting showrooms, and energy service companies located in North America, as well as select international markets serving new construction, renovation, and facility maintenance applications.Operations:Company operations are divided into two segments including domestic and international, respectively. The domestic segment includes the North American region, and the international segment includes China, Mexico, the UK and Spain, respectively. The company generates most of its revenues from the North American region, which totaled 96 percent in 2012, with the remaining 4 percent from international operations.The above graph shows the company's revenues breakup of lighting solutions by sector in the North American region. The company generates most of its revenues from non-residential customers (commercial and institutional), which was 36 percent in 2012. Residential customers also compose a big slice (17 percent) of the total pie, and as the residential industry is growing in the US, there is a huge opportunity for the company to increase its residential market share.Margins:The above graph shows the company's revenues and its operating margins since 2009. As you can see, a consistent growth in revenues over a four-year period is indicated by a linear line, with CAGR of 4 percent. Over the year, the company has managed to grow its operating margins from 9.3 percent in 2009 to 10.8 percent in 2012, respectively. Over the year, the company has managed to grow its operation through a series of acquisitions and innovative products.DuPont Analysis:The above chart indicates a breakdown of Acuity Brands' ROE into three parts: net margin, asset turnover and financial leverage. This analysis shows that the ROE is showing an upward trend in the long run, indicated by the linear trend line, and it is supported by net margins. The company has managed to grow its ROE by reducing its financial risk, which is reflected by the decreasing financial leverage ratio of the company and increasing profit margins, which is also a positive sign for investors.Competitive Landscape:The lighting market served by Acuity Brands is highly competitive. The company is competing with a number of small, medium and large-sized companies. The company's largest competitors in the North American lighting market include Cooper Industries Plc., Hubbell Incorporated (HUB), and Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V (NYSE:PHG).The market for lighting solutions and services is extremely competitive and continues to grow. Certain global and more diversified electrical manufacturers may be able to obtain a competitive advantage over the company by offering broader and more integrated electrical solutions utilizing electrical, lighting, and building automation products.In addition, there have been a growing number of new competitors, from small startup companies to global consumer electronics companies, offering solid-state (primarily LED) lighting solutions to compete with traditional lighting providers.Comparative Analysis:The above graph shows a comparison of cumulative total return of the company with respect to industry indices, over a period of five years (assuming $100 was invested in 2007 in stock or index, including reinvestment of dividends). You can see that the company outperformed its sector and the industry index with impressive margins. Over the five-year period the company was able to generate a CAGR of 7.7 percent, while the S&P Mid Cap 400 Index, DOW Jones US Electric Component & Equipment Index and DOW Jones US Building Material & Fixture Index generated CAGR of 3.2 percent, 3.1 percent and 2.4 percent respectively.Stock price performance:The above chart indicates the historic price performance of key lighting industry market players operating in the North American region, including Acuity Brands . As you can see, the company stock outperformed its peers with a price appreciation of 48 percent, with the exception of Royal Phillips. The reason Phillips outperformed Acuity Brands is that Phillips is a global market leader in the lighting industry with a large market capitalization. On the other hand, Acuity Brands is a mid cap company, generating most of its revenues from the North American region.Conclusion:Over the years the company has grown and strengthened its operations through acquisitions and innovation. But the only problem with the company is that its focus is directed toward only one region, North America. The company has extensively diversified its product portfolio, but its focus on demographic diversification is quite limited. There is a lot of potential in emerging markets where energy prices are quite high. Despite its limited reach in the global market, it has a competitive edge, as it provides complete lighting solutions for both indoor and outdoor applications, while most of its competitors only provide products and services.The future outlook of the lighting industry is quite impressive in coming years. The increasing number of households, decrease in unemployment, rising energy prices, demand for energy conservation and rebounding economic conditions are the key factors contributing to this market growth. The lighting market has also been witnessing an increasing penetration of LEDs in the market, to reduce electricity costs. Furthermore, federal, state and local governments continue to seek ways to cost-effectively upgrade public buildings and infrastructure. As a major user of energy, lighting will be targeted for upgrades that maximize energy savings and lighting quality.The company has a quite impressive financial position with impressive revenue growth and consistent margin. The company also has an inspiring product portfolio and remarkable lighting applications to cater to the increasing demand, mostly in LEDs, in the region. My recommendation for this stock is to buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

197183,21950,2010-04-06T02:09:00-04:00,,"Over the past several quarters I have looked to Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) as a potential signal of the earnings season to come, especially when it comes to commercial real estate. For several quarters, AYI has reported dour news about its industry and the economy. Sometimes traders and investors sold the news, sometimes they bought it. This time around, AYI again indicated that a poor economy will impact its results, but the company expressed confidence in its own performance relative to its industry. The stock launched to fresh 21-month highs on the back of a 6.4% one-day gain. It closed up another 4.7% Monday. It seems the market is now starting to price in some kind of V-like recovery for cyclicals, especially industrial names. Shorts remain high in AYI at 10% of the float, so it is also possible a fresh short squeeze is underway.Chairman, President, and CEO Vernon Nagel had the following to say:Clearly, the market has chosen to focus on the opportunities and all but ignore the on-going malaise in commercial real-estate (Monday, we learned that office vacancies are at a 16-year high).I took particular interest in AYI’s growing cash cushion from operations and refinancing. Cash and cash equivalents have now soared from $18.7M to $155.8M. While AYI’s valuation remains “reasonable,” it is getting pricey from an historical basis. Trailing P/E is 22 and forward P/E is 17. The average trailing P/E peaked in 2005 at 19. Price/sales is 1.2 versus the peak average of 1.0 set in 2007. Price/book is 2.8, just under the peak average of 3.0 set in 2008. At least debt-to-equity continues to drop to historical lows, sitting now at an attractive 0.34.From a technical standpoint, the stock is overbought. However, the volume behind the buying has been impressive, making this breakout more convincing. I might look to buy for a swing trade on a dip with a stop below the pre-earnings close around $42. Other than that, I am still not on the V-recovery bandwagon and remain on watch for the high-volume selling that typically follows low-volume buying (in the general market).Be careful out there.Disclosure: No positions."
696921,20485,2012-07-02T11:37:54-04:00,,"Acuity Brands (AYI) gained 9.6% Monday morning after the company posted its fiscal third quarter earnings results. The maker of lighting solutions posted EPS of $0.82 before a special charge, beating analysts' consensus expectations for $0.78, as per Yahoo Finance. The company's operating and share performance is notable for some very important reasons.Industry comparables including Cooper Industries (CBE), Hubbell Inc. (NYSE: HUB-A), General Electric (GE) and Eaton Corp. (ETN) are trading mostly lower today. Few companies that benefit from construction are finding support today despite the latest Construction Spending data, which was reported increased 0.9% for the month of May. The shares of PulteGroup (PHM), Toll Brothers (TOL), Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are also mostly lower, because broader economic concerns are weighing as other economic data has come in dire from Asia, the EU and here at home as well. AYI's operating and stock performance is especially notable, as non-residential construction was reported unchanged in May.Acuity Brands reported net sales gained 6.4% to $487.5 million in the quarter ended May. Growth came on unit volume increase of more than 5%, on North American growth that offset weakness in the company's Spanish market. The remainder of the sales increase benefited from product prices and product mix.Operating profit increased 14.1%, on operating margin improvement of 80 basis points, but when excluding the special item, the company marked a 110 basis point margin gain in the quarter against the prior year period. The company attributed its operating leverage on its introduction of more energy efficient lighting solutions and market share gain. Its success is evidence of the company's ability to push through higher component and materials costs via price increases implemented in 2011. Also, margins expanded despite the company's growth initiatives involving product and market development.Acuity's special charge was tied to the closure of a Georgia facility, allowing the company to streamline operations and save approximately $8 million annually. AYI experienced a slightly higher tax rate, limiting its net margin expansion a bit. Still, its 32% adjusted net earnings per share growth was quite enough to enthuse investors Monday.Advising on its outlook, AYI said that while global economic concerns weigh on most business, it could continue to outpace. The company expects to leverage better growth in non-residential construction (versus residential), and to gain market share through growth within under-penetrated markets and through innovation and rising interest in environmentally friendly and energy efficient lighting solutions. The company reported no material change to its outlook, but analysts are likely to raise their estimates slightly, in my view.AYI trades at 15.2X the analysts' consensus EPS estimate of $3.68 for FY 2013 (August), with that EPS estimate likely to increase slightly after today's result. That P/E ratio compares favorably with the analysts' forecasted EPS growth of 23% for FY 13. The PEG ratio is 0.7 based on that one-year growth outlook. Analysts' peg the company's five-year growth potential at 15.3%, giving AYI a PEG ratio of 0.99 on its FY 13 EPS estimate and 5-year growth projection. Thus, I would say today's 9.6% price gain is justified and should hold for now.However, AYI's beta of 1.6 or so dictates that it will be impacted by economic news and market movement. Still, its valuation says it has some margin of safety. On this information alone, and without further due diligence that would require several days of company and industry research, I would say AYI is worth accumulating for diversified portfolios due to performance and valuation. That said, it bears market related risk as the global economy remains pressured. Its operational results could also be impacted should its markets come under increasing pressure.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

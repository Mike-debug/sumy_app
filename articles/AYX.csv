4378335,105556,2020-10-09T10:22:18-04:00,"With many cloud stocks rallying to new highs even as of most recently, few obvious bargains seem to be left.Alteryx, a leading data analytics software company, was one of the hardest-hit software companies due to COVID-19 revenue growth slowdown.However, the company is shifting to disclosing ARR. Despite revenue slowdown, ARR growth remains solid.Warren Buffett: ""The best thing that happens to us is when a great company gets into temporary trouble. We want to buy them when they're on the operating table.""","While not technically a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) cloud company, Alteryx (AYX) is a high growth analytics software company with a land-and-expand adoption model.After its Q2 earnings, which showed a significant revenue growth slowdown due to the COVID-19 recession (as the company had guided to, by the way), Alteryx sold off by as much as 40%.Overall, though, management still seems bullish about the long-term business potential. Alteryx has also shifted to reporting annualized recurring revenue (NYSE:ARR). This metric shows a much healthier picture of the company, and hence may suggest that Alteryx's issues might be mostly near term.Since Alteryx's status among investors as a high growth company is in jeopardy after its most recent earnings, now may be an excellent time to start a position in the name. Especially, since value in the broader SaaS sector is currently quite hard to find elsewhere.As a Warren Buffett (BRK.A)(BRK.B) quote goes:Alteryx is a data science/business intelligence and analytics software company.Alteryx provides an end-to-end platform for data analysts. As such, it is digital transformation tool that should improve their productivity. Alteryx will often use the term citizen data scientist for its target users. This means they can have any background, but still use data. This is achieved through low code/code-friendly or code-free tools. In general, such a workflow consists of collecting data from various sources, such as Excel or Snowflake (SNOW), building a predictive model, and thirdly, applying it, which could mean for instance visualizing the data, which could involve third-party software such as Excel or Tableau. For businesses, use cases are often around generating ROI by using data to optimize solutions, thereby saving money. It can also be used for automating data tasks.Alteryx often uses the term Analytic Process Automation (NASDAQ:APA) as the category that the above description entails. Its key pillars are democratizing data analytics (""citizen data scientist""), automating processes, and upskilling people.Alteryx is not necessarily a (pure) SaaS company, but foremost a software company, and charges annually per seat and per server. This has been a point of debate among investors, for example, some arguing that lacking a cloud solution is a disadvantage in the current age. However, Alteryx argues that (1) it actually has had a cloud solution for a long time already, and (2) that its product should be used where the data is, and that remains mostly on-premise. Nevertheless, Alteryx says it is monitoring this space and customer feedback, so additional progress on the cloud side might come at some point.Its products have a hefty price, but Alteryx deems these justified given the value and ROI they provide. For example, Designer costs $5,195 per year per seat, Server costs $78,975. Various other products and suites also have their own additional costs.Despite some of the macro issues further discussed below, Alteryx has a healthy innovation pipeline.For example, in Q2, Alteryx launched Intelligence Suite, Analytics Hub, and AMP engine.Intelligence Suite consists of additional code-free modelling tools. Analytics Hub is positioned as an alternative to Server. The AMP engine is not a specific product, but an engine for higher performance.Alteryx is not the only player in this space, as for example, IBM (IBM) and the big cloud providers also have solutions in this space.Alteryx was first named a leader in the Gartner 2018 Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms. This is the 2020 quadrant, showing Alteryx as a leader and, while lacking in vision compared to several other leaders, it makes up firmly in execution.According to Gartner, leaders ""demonstrate strength in depth and breadth across the full data exploration, model development and operationalization process"".The explanation for Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft's (MSFT) place in the quadrant, as visionaries is their lack of on-premises platform. The Forbes article indicated the AWS's SageMaker offerings were announced after the cut-off date; otherwise, it might be placed similar to the other two cloud giants.Alteryx views itself as an end-to-end data platform, which gives it an edge over its competitors:Simply put, then, Alteryx presents investors with an opportunity to invest in a leading, pure-play data science company.Lacking personal experience with the tool, to check the narrative presented so far of Alteryx as a leading data analytics company, I looked through evaluations of the software.Some points that were mentioned included: time saving, easy of use, product support, scalability, features. Disadvantages included cost, reporting, and sharing data and integration with other tools. As one example, this quite recent Seeking Alpha comment:In general, user product reviews seemed in line with the capabilities that Alteryx management talks about and likely warrant its elevated pricing.Alteryx provides a data analytics platform and is considered a leader in this space. While there are quite some competitors, Alteryx's capabilities are among the most powerful, and Alteryx also says that it is still 'competing' quite a lot with spreadsheets.It actually seems to compare quite similarly to my investment thesis for another company I have covered regularly: Intel (INTC). The Intel thesis is based on the ever-exploding demand for compute in what is called the data economy (""data is the new oil""). In particular, while data generation keeps surging, the analysis of data to gain insights is still trailing behind.From that view, the APA category that Alteryx has defined is still quite emerging and it can be readily expected that demand for data analytics tools will keep increasing. For example, Alteryx still serves only a bit over a third of the Global 2000.On a slight tangent, coincidentally, Intel is also currently on the operating table, so to speak.Most investors will be primarily interested in is the pace of adoption and perhaps the size the company could become in later stages.For some quick facts: IPO in 2017, 1,500 employees, $418M revenue in 2019, 6,700 customers, 37% of the Global 2000.Alteryx's goal is to consolidate the analytic process on its tools. Alteryx claims that its ""transformative platform"" benefits from network effects. I have not found further explanation of these effects but assume this may be because broad adoption creates a knowledgeable community that is convinced of the tool's benefits and therefore, perhaps likely to recommend the software to peers. Alteryx claims this results in a winner-takes-most opportunity. Given the quite large competition as discussed previously, this may be somewhat exaggerated, but at the same time that comparison also showed that Alteryx indeed has one of the leadership data platforms.A previous company I covered that benefited from network effects was Slack (WORK): Network Effect Will Propel Slack Adoption, Outperforming Stock Performance To Follow. In Slack's case, this effect is more obviously seen, but market share gains are, of course, also possible simply by having a best-of-breed product.As growth can, indeed, also benefit from having a large market opportunity. It is likely the world is nowhere near 'peak data' yet, as COVID-19 has also shown. To that end, Alteryx claims it plays in a $50B market, which means it has about 1% share of this opportunity.The way Alteryx goes about converting this opportunity is via the tried and tested land-and-expand model. This is how Alteryx sees a typical customer journey towards 'standardizing' on the Alteryx Platform:Further growth comes from international expansion, channel/partner ecosystem, community expansion and new products.Alteryx's earnings at a glance:After a strong Q4, revenue growth in 2020 so far hasn't delivered at quite the same pace as its historic trend: revenue has more than quadrupled from 2016 to 2019. Nevertheless, gross margins remain best-in-class at 91%, ARR stood at 40% growth, and the net expansion rate also remains strong, although trending downward for quite some time now. Net expansion for the G2K was above corporate average at 137%.The key point behind the investment thesis in Alteryx is its large market opportunity in data analytics as a leader and pure-play in this space. However, revenue growth has been trending downward in the past year, which requires some analysis and evaluation.As mentioned in the preliminary conclusions section, I deem the opportunity has not subsided. COVID-19, however, has introduced various effects which affect its financials.Most notably, the main point that this affects is around revenue recognition, and this is the strongest argument that arguably even despite the weak headline growth numbers, the fundamental business actually remains solid.In Alteryx current revenue recognition scheme, most revenue is recognized upfront, which indeed is different from most SaaS companies. This creates quite some lumpiness (which may further translate into 'lumpiness' in the stock market). It seems this can exaggerate growth during a quarter with many design wins, but the opposite can also happen, where the underlying business can be growing faster than revenue growth indicates.To that end, Alteryx has decided to start reporting ARR. The comparison is quite stark. Alteryx is currently guiding to 11% YoY revenue growth in 2020. On the other hand, ARR guidance calls for exiting 2020 with $500 million, which would be an increase of 30% YoY.As further discussed below, I would suggest investors evaluate the company based on ARR, especially given COVID-19 macro trends.As it has done to many other businesses, COVID-19 has also impacted Alteryx. Several effects can be noted, with some likely playing a role in near-term revenue growth:The overall thesis, though, is that the business is likely to re-accelerate as the macro environment improves. While I noted that Alteryx adoption is spurred for a large part due to the ROI it generates (from its models, automation capabilities, etc.), it is obviously not a critical part of a business. And due to charging per seat, downsizing can be a means for businesses to directly save costs in turbulent times.One of the main ways the COVID-19 impact was seen, and how Alteryx reacted, was in the surge of its 'adoption licenses': 60% YoY and 100% QoQ. These are lower cost, and they also have shorter contract duration. However, adoption licenses, Alteryx claims, are a tried and proven method of converting to full licenses (land-and-expand) since they allow companies to prove to themselves the value it generates before committing long term.So, while this will directly affect revenue (lower cost, shorter contract duration), it serves as a way to keep engaged with customers during COVID-19 and could indicate a reacceleration is possible once customers expand their investment in Alteryx as visibility improves.And indeed, Alteryx noted that its community remains healthy. Touching on those network effects, land-and-expand and COVID-19, a relevant quote from the earnings call:So, to that end, management expects that COVID-19 may provide a boost towards the adoption of the APA category in the longer term. While initial lands may be smaller (adoption licenses), at least the land activity remains strong, which is arguably more important than revenue during this time.The growth of these licenses to me indicates that the business continues growing quite firmly; it's just in a way that results in the associated revenue being delayed.The earnings call provided investors with some additional information that may interest some investors.Alteryx on SaaS and Cloud AdoptionExpanding on the cloud discussion:While the hybrid approach is indeed one that is often heard, for investors looking for a company with a more cloud-focused approach, the Snowflake IPO may catch their attention. The difference between these companies is that Snowflake is more about the storing of data, while Alteryx is used for the analytic process of using such data; Snowflake to that end can be one source of data.Alteryx also discussed use casesAlteryx on APM engineThe stock has fallen back to a value first seen in mid-2019. Alteryx is currently valued at about 17x forward P/S. For a company supposed to grow at 30% levels or higher, this seems quite a reasonable valuation. If revenue growth can rebound, as this thesis calls for, the sell-off has provided the stock with an opportunity for multiple expansion.The 30% growth mentioned seems justified based on ARR, as discussed.The main risk is likely that Alteryx may be unable to return to 30% or higher revenue growth in the near term, given the COVID-19-driven slowdown in 2020. On the plus side, though, the slowdown seems entirely driven by these macro issues.COVID-19 has clearly provided enterprises with some reluctance to invest in non-critical tools, which Alteryx might perhaps be considered. While Alteryx has responded, for example, by providing adoption licenses, it is unknown how long this current business environment will persist and affect Alteryx operating capabilities.Nevertheless, while revenue growth has slowed down, the ARR metric at >30% shows quite a different picture of a(n underlying) business still growing at quite a pace. If anything, it seems to me that revenue growth may rebound with a vengeance when all is said and done.Alteryx had been on my radar for a while, but like many cloud/SaaS or related growth companies, valuation held me back from rushing to initiate a position.But after Q2 earnings, other investors were rushing en masse to the exit doors, and hence Alteryx suddenly found itself in a position where it got on the operating table. So, when this happened, Alteryx caught my attention and I initiated a position.Alteryx touches on a key computing theme: data analytics, or using compute to gain useful information from data. While this initially seemed to many investors as beneficiary to the COVID-19 trends, it did turn out that businesses tended to downscale as the realities the pandemic set in.Nevertheless, as a leader in this growing category, I expect Alteryx will go back to its previous highs and continue to make new highs thereafter, based on a re-acceleration of the business. Alteryx's dollar retention, customer growth and ARR (and even adoption licenses growth) metrics support this, to a greater extent than its revenue metric. As the CEO said at some point during the Q2 Q&A:Given an over 30-40% drop in stock value, Alteryx is currently one of the few growth stocks with also a reasonable valuation, and as such may likely be considered one the less risky growth investments currently. This is a similar investment thesis to Pinterest (PINS), which I recommended while it was below $25, far from its all time highs.Overall, Alteryx's CEO remains bullish on the long-term and leading its product category, which seems reasonable given this dawning age of AI.Summing up, others are concerned about short-term revenue growth. Nevertheless, ARR growth is firmly above revenue growth, with the surge in adoption licenses being another proof point of the current macro realities."
4377878,103480,2020-10-06T15:44:06-04:00,"Alteryx unexpectedly raised its Q3 guidance to 22-24% y/y growth, up from 7-11% y/y growth that the company originally guided to.Shares rose >25% on the news, essentially bringing Alteryx back to the levels prior to the disastrous Q2 earnings release.Alteryx is also changing up its C-suite, appointing a board member as its new CEO.The company still has challenges ahead: it still has to maneuver a recovery in expansion rates while bringing down operating costs closer to its long-term model.The stock looks appropriately valued at ~15.7x forward revenues for a company that has been proven to have very lumpy, license-based revenues.","Alteryx (AYX) has been one of the most volatile stocks in the enterprise software sector this quarter. This longtime market darling suffered one of its worst stock price crashes in its history in early August, when the company reported Q2 earnings and issued a third-quarter guidance range that implied, at the low end, growth crashing to the single-digits. This was an almost impossible scenario for a company that, prior to the pandemic, had been growing revenue at a >60% y/y pace.Yet perhaps in a signal of how difficult it is to predict revenue for a software company that relies primarily on licenses and not on monthly subscriptions (and Alteryx's licenses are incredibly expensive, with Alteryx Designer starting at $5,195 per year per user), Alteryx reversed course and boosted its Q3 guidance, sending long-awaited shockwaves of relief to Alteryx's investors. Shares rocketed up ~25% on the news, essentially bringing Alteryx back to its pre-Q2 levels, and up 36% on the year - beating the S&P 500 by about 30 points.Data by YChartsSo now investors are at a juncture: is this the beginning of a recovery to the ~$200 level for Alteryx, or is this a temporary, choppy lift? My take: I prefer to remain on the sidelines for Alteryx.I continue to view the company as a mixed bag. On the positive side, I'm a firm believer that Alteryx is a best-of-breed contender in a massive market that the company has sized at $49 billion. As data becomes increasingly important to the C-suite, organizations are going to be increasingly comfortable shelling out large portions of their IT budget on tools like Alteryx that help them harness the value locked in their own data. Figure 1. Alteryx Gartner rankingSource: Alteryx Q2 investor deckAt the same time, however, the road ahead isn't completely smooth for Alteryx. As can be seen in the Gartner chart above, even though Alteryx is named a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for data science platforms (a coveted ranking by arguably the most respected software industry reviewer), there are plenty of competitors with similar products. Execution-wise in the near term, Alteryx also still has a lot to live up to. We're not certain yet if Alteryx's guidance raise for Q3 means that the company is on track to bring up its net revenue retention rates, which have been falling for several quarters and a source of concern for the company. There's also the question of profitability - Alteryx has the advantage of being more profitable on more cash flow positive than many of its similarly-sized software peers, but will the company be able to consistently move toward its long-term operating target?To me, Alteryx is fairly valued again after baking in all of these uncertainties. At present share prices near $145, Alteryx's market cap is $9.56 billion. After netting off the $974.4 million of cash and $714.0 million of debt on Alteryx's most recent balance sheet, its resulting enterprise value is $9.30 billion. This represents a heady 15.5x EV/FY22 revenue multiple, based on Wall Street's consensus FY22 revenue of $592.4 million (+27% y/y, which is even slightly stronger than Alteryx's revised Q3 guidance growth range).To me, that multiple represents very little upside - so I'd be more comfortable continuing to sit on the sidelines.Let's start with all the new updates coming out from Alteryx. First up is the guidance raise we mentioned at the beginning of this article. Poor Q3 guidance was the sole driver behind Alteryx's ~20% stock tank at its Q2 earnings report, and now an upward-revised guidance is the reason driving the stock back to where it was.Figure 2. Alteryx guidance updateSource: Alteryx press releaseAlteryx is now guiding to $126-$128 million in revenue (+22-24% y/y growth), far above its prior guidance range of $111-$115 million (+7-11% y/y growth) as well as consensus of $113.5 million (+9% y/y). The question that begs asking, though: is this guidance increase enough to justify the massive bump in share prices? Alteryx's more-optimistic Q3 signals that the company's recovery from pandemic impacts has been swifter than expected, but Alteryx is still far from its pre-pandemic growth trend of 43% y/y. Back then, when the company was growing north of 40% y/y, it had been much easier to justify a >15x revenue multiple for Alteryx - but now, it's harder to make that same argument with mid-20s growth. The fact that consensus is calling for high-20s growth in FY22 indicates that few are expecting Alteryx to return to >40% y/y growth, and perhaps not even >30% y/y growth.The other piece of news that Alteryx announced alongside this guidance upside: CEO and co-founder Dean Stoecker is stepping down from his post. Replacing his post is Mark Anderson, an Alteryx board member for two years and a seasoned enterprise software executive. To me, the CEO change isn't a negative move. Alteryx's selection of Anderson is an indication that the company wants to make sales its top focus. In his long career in Silicon Valley, Anderson has led growth and go-to-market activities for a variety of companies both large and small, including Anaplan (PLAN), where he served as Chief Growth Officer; Palo Alto Networks (PANW), where he served as President, as well as several earlier VP/EVP sales roles at f5 Networks, Lucent Technologies, and Cisco (CSCO). Especially if Alteryx is entering a current sales slump and needs new leadership to revamp its sales approach, new leadership could give Alteryx the injection it needs. Alongside Alteryx's growth trends, there remain two key items to watch going forward, both of which have heavily driven sentiment on Alteryx shares.The first is net revenue retention rates. Alteryx has long prided itself on its land-and-expand model: that is, its initial deployment with a client may be small, but a lot of its future growth comes from that same client adding more users and modules. In recent quarters, net retention rates have declined - a big contributor to Alteryx's receding growth rates and its stock price slump in Q2. Figure 3. Alteryx net retention trendsSource: Alteryx Q2 investor deckIn a recent investor event hosted by Citi (C), outgoing CEO Stoecker was quoted as saying:Hopefully, Alteryx's guidance raise also means that Q3 retention rates can start climbing back up to the normal 130s.The other major watch list item is Alteryx's profitability. As seen in the chart below, Alteryx has a multi-year target of hitting 35-40% pro forma operating margins and 30-35% FCF margins,, which is roughly 20-25 points higher than where 2019 landed. Due to revenue compression in the pandemic-impacted quarters, 2020 so far hasn't produced much in terms of profitability progress (in Q2, for example, sales and marketing costs ate up 52% of revenue, while R&D clocked in at 21% of revenue; overall Q2 pro forma operating margins at 0% were one point worse than the prior year-Q2). Figure 4. Alteryx target operating modelSource: Alteryx Q2 investor deckFor Alteryx's stock to continue rallying, the company also has to show that it can make meaningful progress toward these profitability targets as its growth rates slow down. With a massive >25% lift in Alteryx shares, I think all the upside has already been priced out of Alteryx's recovery with the stock trading close to ~16x outer-year revenue. Especially the lumpiness of Alteryx's growth trend, plus uncertainties over its declining net retention rates, I'd prefer to remain on the sidelines."
4376806,69905,2020-09-29T10:10:25-04:00,"Alteryx is no longer a high growth story. In fact, Q4 2020 is poised for negative growth rates y/y.On a positive note, Alteryx has very high net retention rates, which lead to plus 90% gross profit margins.On balance, it's very diffiult to make a reasoned argument that the stock is undervalued. In the best case scenerio the stock trades at fair value.","Alteryx (AYX) has gone from being a highly valued and high-growth company to a company whose revenue growth rates are leaving much to be desired. Meanwhile, the stock still remains expensively valued.On the other hand, Alteryx is able to lay claim that its very high net retention rates are being translated into impressively high gross profit margins. This investment is a mixed bag. I assert that investors can find more attractive investment opportunities elsewhere.Source: Q2 2020 Investor PresentationThe data science and analytics platform Alteryx was once the poster child for high growth. But those days now appear only in the rearview.Even though the need to quickly and easily transform data continues to rapidly increase in demand, and provides a fertile ground for the likes of Alteryx, this doesn't appear to be translating itself into high revenue growth for Alteryx. Indeed, Alteryx asserted during its earnings call that it does not anticipate a material improvement in 2020.Source: Author's calculations; **high-end company guidanceEven if we take the high-end company guidance, Q4 2020 is likely to arrive at negative 6% y/y growth rates. In short, the days when Alteryx was growing at more than 60% are now far gone. Alteryx puts its TAM at $49 billion meaning that its opportunity remains large.What's more, as you can see below, Alteryx is positively recognized by Gartner as a Leader in Data Science and Machine Learning:Source: Q2 2020 Investor PresentationFurther bullish considerations include the fact that Alteryx still has noteworthy dollar-based net expansion rates:Source: Q2 2020 Investor PresentationOver time, you would expect a software company's expansion rate to migrate towards 100%, as customers' contracts start lapping. However, the longer it takes for the net expansion rate to reach 100%, the stronger the companies' growth rates are poised to be near term. On this front, we can clearly see that Alteryx's dollar-based net expansion rate of 126% as of Q2 2020 is not only strong but amongst the highest in the SaaS space, and certainly punching alongside top-performers Twilio (TWLO) at 132% and Datadog (DDOG) at 130%.Having said that, Alteryx is not a pure SaaS company, as it makes its sales upfront and not on a recurring basis.Nonetheless, Alteryx consistently reports very high non-GAAP gross margins:Source: Q2 2020 Investor PresentationAs you can see above, over the past few years Alteryx's non-GAAP gross margin has trended high, despite already starting at 81% in 2016. Most recently, Alteryx's non-GAAP gross margin reached 91%. Having said that, on the so-called Rule of 40, Alteryx doesn't fare particularly well. This is a measure of how well a company is balancing growth and profitability, with Q2 2020 reaching just 17% -- less than halve the desired 40% benchmark.The investment gets even more complicated once we consider Alteryx's valuation.Alteryx has two main problems. The first one is that while the whole sector is rapidly expanding, Alteryx is being left behind. These facts don't align particularly well with the narrative of Alteryx either having much of a moat or being a resilient high-growth company.The second issue at hand is the case of sentiment. There's little doubt that sentiment towards Alteryx had been pipping hot until it reported its Q2 2020 results. However, right now, investors are questioning whether Alteryx is as compelling as it appeared to be? And investors appear unwilling to consider this investment opportunity. Why?The strongest reason to stay away from the stock is that it's already fully priced. Consider this, despite showing erratic growth rates, Alteryx is still being priced at more than 16x forward sales. If we compare with Salesforce (CRM), that company has a clear line of sight to be growing at approximately 20%, yet it's only being priced with on an 11x forward revenue multiple.On the other hand, if we compare with PagerDuty (PD), that stock has visibility and is easily expected to grow at 23% to 26%, yet its only priced at 10x forward multiple.Obviously, these are very different companies, and they don't compete with Alteryx, but I use them to show what investors are willing to pay for other software companies. Alteryx appears to be less stable than many investors expected.Even if we take into consideration it's very high gross profit margins and strong retention rates, I'm still struggling to find a valid reason why investors would be willing to clamber into this stock, as it trades for close to 16x forward sales.As investors have started to be slightly more discerning these past few weeks, particularly in the richly valued tech space, I believe that investors would do better to look to entering this stock at a lower price point."
4369695,105186,2020-08-19T10:38:24-04:00,"Alteryx is a great example of the dangers of buying into a narrative.The quarter wasn't that bad considering the circumstances.I crunch down expectations and conclude $95 and below is the zone in which I believe investors can achieve double-digit returns over the next 5 years with Alteryx.Alpha can be generated by any security at the right price, but I explain what prevents me from owning Alteryx.","Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) has been pummeled, down over 30% since my article, Alteryx: Listen To Redditors, Not Company Presentations, was published on July 20th. I gave this warning:Every single concern the market has about the business today existed before earnings, and before COVID-19. The market chose to ignore these concerns, and the momentum ran wild. These concerns were mostly covered in my previous article.When a stock craters significantly, there will generally always be an argument to be made to buy the dip unless fundamentals have rapidly deteriorated. Stocks are simply more attractive to buy as prices decline. Investors will use a disappointing quarter to explain why stocks move up or down aggressively on earnings day. Instead, investors should assess whether or not long-term expectations were misjudged by the market.It's easy to point to the weak quarter as the catalyst, but long-term investors are always looking out at the horizon, not in the mirror. Alteryx's most recent quarter wasn't that bad considering much of the world had been shut down for some time. I encourage Alteryx investors or those thinking about owning the stock to stretch out their thinking and not pay so much attention to the most recent quarter. This works both ways, one bad quarter is not a reason to sell a stock, nor is it a recent to buy a stock just because the price is cheaper.Source: AuthorAbove is the model I included in my previous article. I like to keep models and forecasts as simple as possible. For the most part, assumptions turn out to be wrong. I don't believe models are helpful for us to justify our thinking, but useful in gauging what the market expects in relation to what is practical. As covered in my previous article, I cast doubt on the company's assessment of the business's total addressable market, leading me to believe the 25%+ growth for the foreseeable future may not be realistic.While this was my belief, even implying such future growth left us with a predicted stock price of about $213 in 2025, leaving us with mediocre forward returns even if such an optimistic forecast was achieved. Well, things have changed, and now, it isn't quite so easy to paint an obviously pessimistic future for Alteryx shareholders. At a $115 share price, if one believes this is an accurate prediction of Alteryx's next 5 years, this target implies an annualized return of about 13%, pretty solid, and probably worth starting a position. But we must crunch our expectations down to an even more realistic picture.Source: AuthorThe first component is updating consensus revenue estimates over the next three years. The street is expecting $56 million less in revenue in 2022. I've already voiced my concern that revenue growth could slow sooner than expected, so I have reduced growth to 20% for 2023 through 2025. I've also slightly slowed margin expansion, reducing FCF margin to 15% from 17% in 2025.These small changes have reduced my 5-year price to $155 from $213. Again, this is not a compelling return, but this forecast is more realistic, and the stock has been somewhat de-risked by the selloff.On the other hand, Alteryx has generated very little free cash flow, and margins did not expand in the most recent quarter. Oftentimes, companies are able to improve free cash flow during recessionary periods because growth spending is slashes. Netflix (NFLX) is an example, though it's debatable if this spending is truly growth spending or maintenance spend.If I were a believer in Alteryx, the $95 level seems about right to begin buying the stock. This is about the level where my more reasonable model implies double-digit forward returns over the next 5 years. But I won't be buying.Growth stocks allow investors to use their imaginations to construct oversimplified futures. The company knows this when explaining its story to investors, all information covered in my previous article.But, in short, buying into a story is very dangerous. Alteryx's vision of creating ""data scientists"" out of ordinary Excel users is not an accurate picture of who uses the product and why they pay for it. Stories give investors little solace when their position is down over 30% without a meltdown in the broader markets. Technical momentum and narrative-driven stocks' prices will only last so long. Valuation doesn't matter until it does. Investors need to fight back against promotional ideas with cold hard facts and reasonable assumptions of the future.Alteryx solves a very specific problem, giving users an interface to the coding language R. That's what the business does.The purpose of Seeking Alpha is implied in the name, provide investors with ideas that will outperform the broader markets. Even terrible businesses are worth something if they exist as a going concern. Thus, any investment is capable of generating alpha at the right price.Given my crunching of expectations, I believe the opportunity to outperform the broader markets over a 5-year period exists with Alteryx at a price of $95 and below. But I won't be buying there. Why is that?At the end of the day, Alteryx is a one-trick pony with a restricted TAM.Great businesses are able to innovate their way through expensive valuations. Businesses like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have continuously innovated throughout their histories in order to justify trillion-dollar plus market caps. Alteryx solves a problem for its customers, but its software is not a platform, or suite of tools that has broader appeal. When this is the case, I believe investors have to be far more aware of the price they pay. I want to own businesses that can continue to compound year over year rather than ""value investing"" by buying securities that trade below their intrinsic value, which I have assessed would be Alteryx below $95.Many of my failures (some of which I have written about on Seeking Alpha such as Momo (MOMO) and GreenSky (GSKY)) have come when I considered valuation before how great a business is. I want to make as few portfolio changes as possible and own businesses that I believe in regardless of market movements, and I don't feel that way about Alteryx. The restricted nature of the business should make investors very careful with the price they pay."
4376319,98236,2020-09-25T11:06:16-04:00,"Alteryx shares have fallen out of favor with growth investors after reporting a disappointing quarter and providing very cautious guidance.Unlike many other software companies, Alteryx has forecast that its results will be pressured by the economy through the balance of this year.Depending on specific estimates, for the first time in many years, Alteryx shares have reached bargain levels in terms of EV/S valuation.There is no evidence that the longer term future for analytics has dimmed, and indeed it is part of the digital transformation revolution whose adoption, overall, has probably been accelerated as part of user reaction to the pandemic.Alteryx continues to maintain its leadership in its space and has been able to expand its TAM by adding features and functions to its core platform.","This article was highlighted for PRO subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Alteryx (AYX) has been one of those names that I had never contemplated selling. I had bought a significant position in the shares in the fall of 2017, and continued to maintain a substantial position, although I had trimmed some over time because of the need to maintain a balanced portfolio for my Ticker Target service. I have viewed Alteryx as being a company in the right space with strong user satisfaction and a powerful selling motion, and a pioneer in its space that has been well acknowledged as a category leader. Who doesn’t want to invest in advanced data analytics solutions. Who doesn’t want to invest in a company that formulated solutions for citizen data scientists. I happened to sell my entire position in the shares, more by luck and chance than because I had contemplated the quarter that the company reported on August 5, 2020. My sale was based on raising cash in the Ticker Target portfolio, as I contemplated a market that had become quite frothy and was not a call on the Alteryx quarter, or the outlook I had for Alteryx. And at the time I sold it, the shares had appreciated something like 7X and there is something comforting about ringing the register But really, the essence of the transaction was that I got lucky.It has been almost 2 months since I sold the last shares of my Alteryx position. There has been a mini-correction in the IT space as a concomitant to some sector rotation away from the Information Technology space. Overall, Alteryx shares have fallen by as much as 38% since I sold the last of my position. Lately, with the return of concerns regarding persistent and even rising Covid-19 infections, particularly outside of the US, there has been a return to favor of “work-from-home” software companies. Trading stocks these days is often a matter of gauging analogs which are used by algorithmic funds to manage their portfolios. Algorithmic trading is said to account for as much as 70% of overall daily trading in stocks. While the business analogs between Alteryx and most stalwart remote work businesses are tenuous, at least to the mind of this writer, apparently AYX is perceived to have some similarities to names such Atlassian (TEAM) and Twilio (TWLO). The amount of compute power used to develop analogs and algorithms is far beyond that available to this older commentator-suffice to say that there appears to be a modest bid for AYX shares as I write this, and the bid appears to be based on analogs to work at home names.AYX is not a work at home name, although its solutions can be used by remote citizen data scientists, so-called, to facilitate that paradigm. It has certainly faced headwinds from the economic contraction wrought by the pandemic. On the other hand, analytics as part of an overall digital transformation process, is likely to be a longer-term beneficiary of the trends set in motion by the pandemic. I am recommending purchase of Alteryx shares at or about current valuations at this time but not because of any correlation with demand from a work-at-home spike . The shares have been punished enough, and more than enough to account for the business conditions brought on by the pandemic. As the economy mends, demand trends that had been accelerating before the pandemic, will resume, I believe.This is not a call on the results I expect to see Alteryx report for the September quarter. Alteryx has guided to revenues of $111-$115 million, or year on year growth of 7%-11%. Sequentially, that would be growth of about 18%. That doesn’t sound that terrible, until one looks at prior year results when growth was almost 26% between Q2 and Q3. The company has also forecast Q4 results which are not reassuring. While sequential growth between Q3 and Q4 is forecast to be 30%, it was more than 50% between Q3 and Q4 2019. Indeed, the specific numbers that the company has presented are that revenues will fall by 6% year over year. That is quite a comedown for a high growth company.This article is a recommendation to start rebuilding or adding to a position in Alteryx. I want to be clear that while this is not a call on either Q3 or Q4 of 2020-Alteryx shares, even after their substantial fall, will not appreciate unless the company achieves results that are significantly better than guidance the company has presented. My best guess is that the company will do so, but of course I have no specific information to buttress that conclusion.Compared to some other IT vendors, Alteryx can and has produced quite substantial upsides. For example, when Alteryx provided guidance for Q4-2019 it was about $130 million in revenues at the mid-point. The actual results surpassed that forecast by no less than 20%. There is a very specific reason for that kind of variance compared to forecast results: Alteryx essentially reports 35%-40% of its bookings as revenue in the quarter they are received and it typically forecasts rather conservative close rates relating to its forecast..In a typical quarter, Alteryx receives 70% of its revenue from the balance sheet and from its RPO balance. In addition, the company expects that an additional 15% of its revenues will come from scheduled contract renewals. The company, therefore, is only forecasting that it will close a minimal level of net new business during this current fiscal Q3. This is a scenario that has been repeated again and again for Alteryx. It is why its quarterly growth pattern has been one of consistent over attainment. And while I obviously lack the information I would need to forecast how this quarter will come out, I think a reasonable betting man, looking at the results of other companies in this space and the overall economic macros being reported, might logically conclude that the odds favor AYX achieving an over-attainment this quarter. While at the end of the day, that really ought not to matter all that much, given that my recommendation is long-term in nature, I would obviously like to reenter this name with a tailwind to start off my new position.It might be remembered that AYX achieved 75% revenue growth, to $156.5 million in Q4-2019 as its business accelerated in the last half of 2019. In that quarter, bookings rose to $290 million in total contract value, and for the full year, total contract value of bookings rose to $600 million. Self-evidently, Alteryx has notable bookings seasonality, and that is reflected as well in quarterly revenue because of the company’s revenue recognition model. Alteryx, because of its revenue recognition model, has struggled a bit to find a metric that accurately depicts its growth adjusted for contract duration. I personally always favor ARR as the most appropriate metric in evaluating a company such as this. The company reported ARR of $430 million exiting Q2, and it is forecasting continued growth of ARR of 30% through the end of the year. I do not know if the company will resume reporting bookings. I do not think Q4 was not really an incredible outlier and the trends seen then would most likely have continued but for the pandemic and its concomitant economic contraction. But that said, AYX does not need to book $290 million in total contract value in a quarter to support its current valuation, in my opinion.Used properly, the Alteryx solutions generate exceptional ROI-indeed one has to use an analytic solution to solve some of the problems that Alteryx offerings can solve. So, as businesses return to something like normal, or a new normal, so too, should the company’s bookings and growth in its ARR. If that happens, the current valuation will look like an exceptional bargain in my opinion.I have been asked by some subscribers to my Ticker Target service if it was time to revisit the name with a view towards rebuilding a holding. My answer is that I am ready to begin to rebuild an Alteryx holding. While the company CEO, Dean Stocker, didn’t specifically call an inflection point when he made a virtual presentation during the Citi Global Technology event on September 10th, I thought his comments were a bit more constructive than what he had to say in August during the earnings report covering the period through the end of June.. I have thought, and continue to think, that the analytics space is going to be a priority for users for many years to come. And I haven’t seen anything to dissuade me from the viewpoint that Alteryx is, and will continue to be the leading company in the space.The fact that it continues to sell its offerings at $5k/seat, even during the pandemic, strongly suggests that user satisfaction and reputation is very high-when some observers/commentators talk about Tableau/Salesforce (CRM) or Microsoft Power BI (MSFT) as competitors, they seemingly ignore the yawing gap in price and functionality between offerings that cost a few dollars/month and offerings that cost $5k/year.Conference call scripts are usually thought to be the equivalent of commercials for the company presenting. That is their rationale and often the commercial aspect of the presentation can make them less than ideal for an analyst. But that said, they can contain nuggets of information well worth considering. My case for Alteryx is based on the fact that it sells what are very high ROI solutions which please users/buyers and typically lead to expansion in terms of seats and sometimes in terms of modules. The issue with Alteryx is that because of the economy some users have been reluctant to expand their seat count-and to me that is understandable. But this is what usually happens,” While we see incredible ROI stories every quarter, in Q2 two stood out. The first example was like so many activities during this pandemic delivered virtually in a webinar in early July. In this session, Neil Leibowitz, Vice President of Tax at SiriusXM described the journey his tax team had in landing and expanding with the Alteryx APA platform. It began in Q3 of last year with an adoption license to create efficiencies and compliance in provision process along with developing cash models for the complex tax of federal and state apportionment. Neil stated that “Alteryx was easier to use and more likely to be adapted by a larger audience”.Early use cases that drove hundreds of hours of savings led to a third expand in Q2 of this year to support shared services and accounting operations with a focus on automation and its ROI. The business case for analytics process automation was defined in 157 use cases with potential savings of more than 9,200 hundred hours annually. In a period of just 90 days, they automated more than 40 used cases and contributing more than 2,500 hours of annual savings. Over their short nine-month journey of transformation Neil indicated that COVID has successfully forced them to think more critically through a financial lens to justify technology investments.""I have heard similar stories from many other industry contacts. The reason I believe that Alteryx had achieved the growth it enjoyed 9 months ago and before was pretty simply because it was able to offer potential clients very strong ROI. This reference from Sirius is not a particular outlier and it represents the kind of thing that most larger customers have to do. And it also explains a bit why Alteryx has seen its growth compress.Alteryx solutions save client hours-that is a very common outcome of its adoption. Most of the time, that kind of ROI is something that is very appreciated and easy to understand by enterprises. During this current part of a business cycle, that is not always the case. Many companies have had to make layoffs in administrative staff. So, they are not looking to save hours when they are cutting back on administrative staff in any event.The current AYX forecast is based on the state of business conditions that led to lay-offs of administrative staff. In that environment, saving hours does not create ROI. When the environment changes, and I believe it is currently in the process of doing so, the ROI for many projects involving Alteryx will rise to historical levels, and sales cycles will shorten and upsells and expands will resume their favorable trends. Judging Alteryx by what happened in the quarter that ended in June does nothing to describe the outlook for the company as the economy slowly returns to a more normal pattern.Analytics can be a complex space for investors to decipher. Some of the analytic tools that are offered are quite basic. These tools involve basic data integration and preparation capabilities, tools that allow for the graphical display of data and tools that facilitate simpler queries. These are the tools available from Tableau and Microsoft BI-and for that matter from many other vendors. The category has been around for some time now, and there have been generations of technology in the space.But while these tools are inexpensive, and learning to use them is pretty straightforward (I can actually use Tableau), they are not adequate to solve the kind of business problems that most enterprises look to solve using the oceans of data they have available. Alteryx’s corporate slogan is ”the art of solving,"" and that is really what distinguishes Alteryx from its best known rivals in the space-although they really do not act as rivals for the most part. Even after all the hype and tons of electrons questioning some Alteryx/Tableau rivalry, the two companies still have a tactical alliance and often co-sell. Alteryx doesn’t offer any visualization technology and Tableau’s analytics-well as I said, I can use it which should suggest something to some readers.Many organizations are looking to find deep relationships in their data. In other words, they are looking to determine what is really correlated with what. This can be a very daunting challenge to solve, and it can be difficult to frame queries, let alone find tools that help analysts figure out where to look and determine which variables amongst thousands really have relationships.A fairly typical Alteryx use case documented by the Alteryx community relates to a project undertaken of an industry consultant called HAI Analytics on behalf of the National Center for Education Statistics. The project was to determine the student retention rate in order to maximize tuition income. The project involved predictive modelling using the Alteryx Designer tool. HAI helps various institutions model student retention and then uses the predictive modelling function to determine the increase in retention by increasing financial aid, and providing other financial incentives. Most of the data necessary to “solve” the question already exists in different persistent data sources. One task is to integrate the data from the different sources so it can be used effectively. Once the data is integrated, some way has to be found for testing the impact of aid adjustment.Neither Tableau or Power BI currently is able to deal with this type of query/model. There are other modelling tools that exist, but one of the keys offered by Alteryx is the combination of data integration and predictive modelling on a single platform with some level of automation. And the further advantage is that a non-data science professional who is more familiar with the business issues, is able to undertake creating a model and developing an answer that maximizes net tuition income after expanding the student aid funding.While Alteryx has reported some elongation of sales cycles, and some organizations that have not gone very far with analytics are pausing its wide scale deployment, I think it is pretty straightforward to suggest that the rising use of analytics is inevitable and that growth in demand for complex analytics solutions will re-accelerate sharply as the economy stabilizes and starts to see growth closer to the trend line. The value of making better decisions-or offers or many other kinds of choices presents enterprises with an exceptional opportunity to improve their efficiency, improve their competitive positioning and to best leverage their capabilities. The pause that Alteryx has seen and may still be seeing in growth in demand is a pause, and is almost certainly not any permanent step down in any long term growth rate. The digital transformation that can be achieved using analytics has too high of an ROI for it not to be a priority for most institutions.Queries can get far more complex than the examples I have provided; Alteryx tools were partially designed to solve geospatial queries such as those involved in exploring for oil and gas which are far more complex as can be imagined , and in such circumstances, the tools offered by Alteryx tend to have specific advantages in terms of speed, accuracy and discovery for many users.As I write this, Snowflake (SNOW) has recently gone public. Some readers have queried me (no pun intended) on the relationship between Snowflake and Alteryx. Let me say-they are not competitors. Their use is much more likely to be complementary. The Snowflake database is far more efficient for data warehouse uses than legacy data warehouse solutions and is self-evidently providing users with a multi-cloud experience they desire which cannot be done with the data warehouse solutions offered by the most well known of the cloud vendors.Here is what the CEO of Alteryx most recently said about Snowflake, “We love what they're doing. We think that they'll have a fabulous IPO. We think, it creates another tailwind for us. What -- as a persistence layer, what they want is compute loads. We make it easy for people to get compute load efficiency in Snowflake. We have several hundred customers, joint customers without having a partnership, without doing go-to-market execution together. And so, we're trying to figure that one out with them.”I often write to subscribers that I tend to view guidance and conference call commentary as not necessarily the gospel when it comes to evaluating an enterprise. And yet, I do spend quite a bit of time studying a transcript and sometimes visiting with CFO’s regarding the precise meaning of their comments. One of the impediments I have had in terms of taking advantage of the obvious opportunity on Alteryx shares was the way the company chose to tee up its guidance. Not only was the guidance itself very off-putting, but the company’s commentary-at least as I look at it was worse.Since Alteryx reported its results, many IT companies have reported. Most of them had better quarters than they had forecast, but the so too did Alteryx-although its beat was proportionately quite modest. Most of the companies that reported continued to provide conservative guidance, although few did so to the extent of weak guidance provided by Alteryx.Almost no companies in the space provided guidance for negative growth in their quarters at the end of the year. Some of that relates to the way Alteryx makes guidance forecasts which really is not based on a traditional definition of what that term implies and some of that is a function of the huge over attainment Alteryx achieved in its Q4-2019 results. But that said, the commentary that Alteryx provided back in August was less than insipid, and quite at odds with the commentary provided by almost every other IT vendor.Specifically, the CEO said, “ Based on what we see today, we do not anticipate a material improvement in business conditions during 2020.” And the CFO, expanding on that comment said, “Now turning to our outlook. The current macroeconomic environment continues to be in the state of turmoil and we expect conditions will remain fluid. Taking this into account. We’re providing revenue, operating income and EPS guidance for Q3 consistent with historical patterns. We’re also providing a full year outlook for revenue and ARR.”One issue that has been a factor for many IT vendors has been one of contract duration. During the pandemic, many customers have chosen shorter contract terms, and most vendors, including Alteryx have obliged. Alteryx has offered its users what it calls adoption licenses. Adoption licenses increased by 60% year over year and more than 100% sequentially. Eventually adoption agreement typically convert to normal business arrangement. This has been a way of supporting users during these trying business times. But to some extent, adoption licenses weigh on certain metrics such as the DBE ratio. If the economy improves, and conversion to normal terms transpires, Alteryx will see accelerating growth. That is part of what I am counting on to happen.Most IT vendors, and particularly those in the highest growth cohorts commented that they had seen turns in terms of demand starting in May/June and continuing into September. Until now, I have been unable to overcome those kinds of comments that Alteryx has provided that do not call out any demand inflection; if Alteryx hasn’t acknowledged an inflection point in its results, it is hard for me to call a turn without any specific information.But one thing I have seen is increasing evidence in a turn in the economy after a bit of a step back in July. The NYS manufacturing index was particularly strong. The Wells call on growth was also encouraging. And even such minor events as the Citibank delinquency rate suggest a healing economy with growth starting to accelerate. As I will explain in the course of this article the business outlook for Alteryx has been one more affected by macro headwinds; as winds veer around to a positive direction, I believe they will benefit Alteryx and do so noticeably, given the company’s very cautious guidance.At the moment, and leading to a decent set-up in terms of share price performance, I have been surprised that no one has chosen to write about Alteryx a view toward raising their rating. There are apparently 15 analysts who forward their recommendation to 1st Call. 11 have buy rating on the name, must of those have price targets 50% or more above the current price for Alteryx. That is unusual these days, when so many of IT names are selling well above the price targets of analysts, regardless of how they have chosen to rate the shares.I did think that some of the commentary provided by the CEO in his appearance at the Citi investor conference was a bit more optimistic than what had been said by Alteryx management during their August conference call. Specifically, he talked about his view of the market that is reflecting more visibility,” I think that we've guided to what we can see in the marketplace. There's some improved visibility although not a ton coming into Q3,” That said, the CEO called out a study from Gartner that said that analytics spend would be flat this year compared to growth of 18% last year. That study was done at a point in time-what it did not provide was expectations for growth in analytic spending in 2021.I think most readers will recognize that many IT vendors, although far better off than other business segments, have seen the contracting economy upset their growth plans. Many, many times in the course of evaluating IT companies, I come across those who are going through a dreaded sales execution challenge. It might sound as if sales execution is something that can get fixed rapidly, but that is just not the case. Fortunately, that is not the issue that Alteryx faces. It has a well-organized and disciplined sales process and it has been able to attract and retain a solid cadre of sales personnel who report positive experiences in terms of representing the company and its solutions.One of the things that is quite different when it comes to Alteryx is their revenue recognition policy. There is nothing non-standard about how revenue is recognized for this company, but as has been observed in the past, the company does recognize 35%-40% of its bookings as revenue in the quarter they are received. Most other companies using a subscription model, probably recognize no more than 2-3% of the total value of a typical transaction in the quarter it is signed. Of course, over time, revenue recognition evens out, but for a company with the growth trajectory this company has had, it creates a picture that can show more rapid growth than would be the case for other companies with a SaaS revenue recognition model.That has led in the past to some very strong quarterly results that might be discounted by analysts. As mentioned earlier, in Q4, 2019, Alteryx reported 75% revenue growth. That was a product of extremely strong sales execution in the quarter (as mentioned earlier, bookings rose by 82% in that quarter and were close to double the level of reported revenues), but also a product of slightly longer duration in terms of in-quarter bookings.In addition to the issue of revenue recognition for Alteryx relates to the issue of expansion. Earlier in this article, I quoted commentary about a typical expansion deal for Alteryx with Sirius Satellite. That kind of evolution is how expansion deals have unfolded for Alteryx in the past.Most companies have and have had some analytic capability. What they do not have is a paradigm that provides full blown, high-end analytics access to most of their employees who could use that functionality. I think it is important to start by understanding that what Alteryx needs to sell are deals in which large enterprises commit to buying thousands of seats for employees whose primary function is not that of a data scientist. Since Alteryx has been public, the company has talked about an addressable market of 27 million+ of what it calls citizen data scientists. The issue for Alteryx is that not all of its customers can afford what it sells all of the time, and it can be hard in a severe economic contraction for potential users to justify expanding their use of Alteryx.Many Alteryx expansion deals have been justified because they substantially improve the productivity of citizen data scientists-that is what happened at Sirius. But in an economic contraction where layoffs are and have been substantial, the ROI or the actual savings from some Alteryx based projects is not immediately realizable. And some users have chosen to elongate the tempo of providing all of their employees with analytic capability, simply because they have chosen to delay most corporate initiatives that are not specifically connected with immediate cash generation or data security requirements.Finally, and perhaps not really so different for this company, is the rather severe impact of economy on smaller Alteryx users-its commercial sector. This is not all that different than the kind of results reported by many other IT vendors-again what makes it a bit different for Alteryx is that the relationship between bookings and revenues is more immediate because of the revenue recognition model, and to a certain extent, because bookings within the company’s commercial user segment have declined from such elevated levels. In some cases where there was but a single Alteryx developer, in an organization, that relationship was paused, and similarly to what was reported by Slack, for example, the overall churn within the smaller users was higher than historical patterns. Alteryx indicated that it has redeployed some sales resources from its commercial to its enterprise business segments-it is possible that this will have some positive impact that might be seen when the company reports its Q3 results.Summing up, Alteryx has experienced some headwinds from the effects of the contracting economy that have knocked down its growth rate substantially, from levels that were exceptional at the end of 2019, to about 30% in terms of ARR projected this year.I like to look at bookings growth which is a function of reported revenues, and the reported change in RPO. Bookings growth was essentially nil this past quarter and the company is not forecasting bookings growth in either of the next two quarters. The specifics of how that seems likely to happen indicate a transitory phase that has nothing to do with the global acceptance of analytics, the company’s competitive position or the company’s selling motion. It really doesn’t make great sense to evaluate Alteryx and its prospects based on the trough of activity. I think it makes much greater sense to look ahead and see what is most likely to happen to Alteryx and evaluate what its shares might be worth in a recovery scenario. The company is managing expenses prudently, and is essentially forecasting minimal growth in non-GAAP expenses sequentially.I have discussed lots of numbers and references in this article at what no doubt seems great length to some readers who have managed to stick with the prose. Some of this might lead some readers to forget that this is an operating company with a product strategy that I believe is widening its competitive moat and increasing user satisfaction.For example, modelling is a typical concomitant of an analytics paradigm. The company has embraced AI and code free technologies to assist citizen data scientists in creating sophisticated models. Almost all enterprises have individuals looking to model various phases of business and this capability has probably been one of the most sought after new function that Alteryx has made available.The company also introduce an Analytics Hub is designed to automate some of the analytic processes for smaller work groups and to integrate with both Connect and Promote and to provide automated modelling capabilities. Finally, the company introduced what is called Alteryx Multi-threaded Processing (AMP). As analytics has developed a need for faster processing speeds has become more substantial. Alteryx, with this new release, is allowing its users to use massively multi-threaded processing. This capability speeds up processing in 4 MB packets and that facilitates dramatic performance improvements for many analytic applications.Many readers, when they think of Alteryx, probably do not appreciate the complexities and the elaborations that can be done with analytics. When investors look at a “land and expand” paradigm for Alteryx in particular, they may not realize just how complex an enterprise analytics framework can be. Prior to the pandemic, Alteryx had been achieving a DBE ratio of 130 or a bit higher. That has fallen to 126. But what is interesting is that looking at the DBE for the Global 2000 users, the ratio was still at 137 last quarter. In other words the Alteryx land and expand strategy is working for users who have the resources to look beyond the economy of the pandemic. When the churn and downsizing of commercial accounts abates, Alteryx clearly has one of the better longer-term growth opportunities when compared to most other enterprise software vendors.I have commented in the past that many IT companies have accelerated their path to profitability by themselves reigning in the growth of operating expenses. Alteryx was able to improve its margins in Q2 at least sequentially, but did so because its costs fell by a greater percentage than revenues. That is not usually what I mean when I comment about an accelerated path to profitability. Management did not speak of any unusual expense constraint strategy going forward, and it did not provide operating expense guidance for Q4. I am inclined to believe that the company will continue its spending trends to take advantage of the opportunities that exist to expand its product leadership.Alteryx has a very high gross margin which has been close to 91% for several quarters. The company spends lots on IP and its has some unique offerings that have allowed it to deliver value such that pricing is seldom a gating factor in closing a deal.Last quarter, non-GAAP operating expense rose around 20% year over year, while revenues rose a bit more than 17%. On the other hand, non-GAAP expenses fell by about 14% sequentially, while revenues fell by 11%. This allowed the company to report marginal profitability for the quarter. The company is forecasting somewhat better operating margin trends in Q3, with revenues rising about $17 million, or about 18% sequentially, while non-GAAP operating expenses are forecast to rise by about 11% sequentially.Overall, last quarter the company incurred an R&D expense ratio of about 21% compared to 18% the prior year. The sales and marketing expense ratio was 52%+ last quarter, compared to 55% in the year earlier period. I believe Alteryx has a business model with lots of potential leverage; as churn declines and expand revenues improve, I expect the trend towards a lower sales and marketing expense ratio will accelerate and to be the major source of future operating leverage.To wrap up here I think readers need to consider the company’s relative valuation metrics. Prior to the advent of the pandemic, and the economic contraction associated with it, I think most analysts had expected Alteryx to grow at hyper-growth rates for the foreseeable future. The company provided guidance at the start of this year for growth of 35%. At the start of 2019, the company had forecast growth of 38% and it wound up reporting 65% growth for the full year. Prior to the advent of the pandemic, I imagine most holders, and certainly this writer, expected that Alteryx would exceed its estimates by a noticeable amount as has been the case for quite some time. I know that I had been estimating 3 year growth for Alteryx of nearly 50%.Currently, the 1st Call analyst consensus is almost exactly in line with company guidance. Just on the past record, that makes little sense. This company certainly uses a methodology in presenting guidance that is far more likely than not to be exceeded. The 1st Call consensus for 2021 is for revenue growth of 27% or about $500 million in total.Currently, Alteryx has an enterprise value of about $9 billion. While I certainly have no way of determining a specific growth inflection point, I would be surprised if there wasn’t a return to historical growth patterns over the next 2-3 quarters, and I certainly wouldn’t be shocked if the first signs of growth inflection weren’t seen in the current quarter. Overall, I have used a 4 quarter forward estimate of revenues of $575 million, and that is probably 20% above consensus values for that period.While I have trimmed my 3 year CAGR estimate to 42%, the reality is that if the economic environment reverts to the growth pattern of the end of the last decade, my guess, as I have presented in this relatively lengthy article, is that growth will average higher than that forecast and certainly decisively greater than the 27% growth presented as the 1st Call consensus.As subscribers realize, I look at valuations using my own estimates for revenues and a CAGR which I then compare against a best fit line. Alteryx, using my estimates for revenue and CAGR as detailed above is at the absolute greatest discount in terms of EV/S when compared to any other name I follow in the low 40% 3 year CAGR growth cohort, with a discount slightly greater than that of Elastic (ESTC), Anaplan (PLAN) and Smartsheets (SMAR). Interestingly, AYX shares are valued at about average in terms of EV/S for a growth rate of 27%. But at my estimated growth rate of 42%, the shares are more than 40% below the average as defined by the best fit line.Alteryx is marginally free cash flow positive, and that is about average for its valuation. The company did see positive trends in deferred revenue, but those were not matched by RPO growth. This company, in a different economic environment, will generate cash flow at decent rates. Again, adverting to Q4-2019 for comparison, the company was able to report a free cash flow margin of just under 10%. I have chosen to use a 2% free cash flow margin in my valuation input. That brings the company to just around average for the growth cohort I have forecast.I am recommending to subscribers and to other readers that this is a good time and a good entry point for Alteryx and I see the company returning to hyper growth as the economy heals."
4371312,20521,2020-08-28T06:05:36-04:00,Alteryx early this month reported its second-quarter results that beat analyst estimates.The stock dipped on its disappointing outlook.It is currently trading at $109.96 with a market cap of $7.28 billion.,"Data science and analytics platform provider Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) early this month reported its second quarter results that beat analyst estimates. However, its disappointing outlook sent its stock sliding.For the second quarter, Alteryx's revenue grew 17% to $96.2 million, beating analyst estimates of $93.8 million. GAAP gross profit was $86.6 million, or a GAAP gross margin of 90%, compared to GAAP gross profit of $72.7 million, or a GAAP gross margin of 89% a year ago. GAAP net loss was $(35.3) million compared to GAAP net loss of $(3.2) million a year ago. Non-GAAP net income was $1.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net income of $0.9 million or $0.01 per diluted share a year ago. Analysts expected loss of $(0.14) per share.At the end of Q2, it had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments of $974.4 million compared to $974.9 million as of December 31, 2019.With customers going for higher levels of scrutiny, sales cycles have elongated, and deal sizes have become smaller. It ended the quarter with 6,714 customers, up 27%, with 271 net new customers. It achieved a dollar-based net expansion rate of 126%. It ended the quarter with over $430 million in ARR, an increase of over 40%.For the third quarter, revenue is expected to be in the range of $111 million to $115 million or a growth range of 7%-11%. Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.09 to $0.14. For the full year 2020, Alteryx expects revenue of $460-$465 million, a growth range of 10%-11%. Analysts were expecting 15% growth for the third quarter and 21% for the full year.Alteryx recently introduced its next-generation Alteryx Multi-threaded Processing engine, or AMP. It allows customers to execute workflows simultaneously, resulting in processing efficiency on larger data sets with complex analytical processes. While not a stand-alone SKU, the AMP engine is shipped with every Designer, Server, and Analytics Hub.Alteryx has been investing on improving its analytic process automation (APA) platform, which unifies analytics, data science and business process automation in one, end-to-end platform. To extend the functionality of the APA platform, it introduced Alteryx Analytics Hub and Alteryx Intelligence Suite. Alteryx Intelligence Suite provides a designer add-on bundle of assisted modeling for building robust machine learning and advanced analytic models in a code-free environment. Intelligence Suite's text mining and natural language processing building blocks also deliver improved capabilities for working with semi-structured and unstructured data through OCR recognition, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. Early customers include Siemens Gas and Power, Bell Canada, QDOBA Restaurant, Mars, General Dynamics, and the U.S. Naval Research Lab.Alteryx Analytics Hub helps in up-leveling automation, collaboration, and data discovery in a secure and governed way, allowing everyone across the entire enterprise to benefit from actionable data and analytics. Hub blurs the lines between the design time experience in Designer and run time automation in Server and provides an affordable path for smaller work teams to leverage the benefits of automation.Alteryx's APA platform is used in over 6,400 companies globally and in over 37% of the Global 2000 to democratize data across an organization, automate business processes and upskill people.The pandemic has pushed engagement levels and user growth across its developer community. There has been over 60% growth in the monthly active users of Community. Last quarter, Alteryx launched the Advancing Data and Analytics Potential Together (ADAPT) program to offer free data analytics training. So far, nearly 10,000 people from 125 countries have participated in the program. A recent drive to recruit student developers also garnered strong response.Early this year, Alteryx announced a five-year partnership with PwC U.S. As part of the agreement, PwC will leverage Alteryx's data science, analytics, and process automation platform as part of its consulting and digital solutions. PwC recently indicated that it has 55,000 users of Alteryx Platform. Alteryx further broadened its partner network by adding Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and UiPath as its technology partners.Alteryx Partner ecosystem depends on partnerships with global system integrators, leading technology companies, global consulting firms, and major data partners to deliver powerful business outcomes. It also teams up with resellers, consultants, and analytic experts with a deep understanding of the Alteryx Platform across verticals to deliver value to its mutual clients.While smaller VARs are part of their ecosystem, we have not yet seen an ISV ecosystem emerge on their PaaS. This is the likely evolution of their PaaS strategy.Alteryx doesn't have a marketplace of products from developers yet. However, in its recent earnings call, it talked about a potential marketplace for third parties to monetize assets to the growing audience of Alteryx users.For companies to get the most out of their PaaS strategy, it is vital to share metrics and how much they are making from this strategy. We need more metrics on how many apps they have, how many developers are developing apps on their platform, how do the developers make money, etc. We want to see more from Alteryx by way of ecosystem metrics.Its stock dipped on its disappointing outlook. It is currently trading at $109.96 with a market cap of $7.28 billion. It hit a 52-week high of $185.75 in July this year. It hit a 52-week low of $75.17 following the COVID-19 crash in March.Original postEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4370055,41961,2020-08-21T00:26:53-04:00,"Alteryx's stock price has crashed more than 30% from recent highs.Poor earnings guidance is the principal reason for the price collapse.Underlying trends still remain favorable and demand has just been deferred rather than disappeared.Alteryx looks attractive to me at these levels, and I have increased my personal holding.","Alteryx (AYX) recently reported earnings and the market reaction was distinctly unhappy.While the reported results were generally acceptable, it was the guidance that triggered the violent market reaction, with the stock price promptly selling off more than 35%.Alteryx reported relatively good revenue growth in the circumstances. Q2 revenue increased some 17% year over year, noticeably slower than growth in Q1 and the rate of growth that Alteryx had seen throughout most of 2020.What was of particular concern to investors was the guidance provided by Alteryx, not only for Q3, but through the end of the year. Alteryx indicated that Q3 revenue was likely to be in the range of $111M-115M which suggested a year-on-year revenue increase of a little over 10%.Further, full-year 2020 revenue guidance was for a range of $460M-465M. This would actually imply Q4 revenue of approximately $145M, suggesting a revenue decline from the $156M that Alteryx delivered in Q4 of 2019.Investors seemed to take away from Alteryx's result that not only is the situation for Alteryx not improving, but that it may actually be getting worse. I would suggest that the situation looks a lot worse than what it seems. Looking beneath the surface the issues that are plaguing Alteryx appear to me to be short term in nature and largely timing-related.I wasn’t one to sit and lament the collapsing price and was happy to add to my existing holding recently. Here are the 4 reasons why I bought the dip.The data tsunami problem which Alteryx so effectively solves for hasn’t miraculously gone away because we are in a pandemic and because customer wallets are tight. Data analysts across the Fortune 2000 are still confronted with the problem of how to best prepare and format data in such a way that it is easy to consume and straightforward to run detailed analysis.The challenge of formatting data in a way that is consistent across different data types such that it can be standardized in a useful way for modeling is a significant challenge for analysts. In fact, status quo for analysts in getting data prepped is a time-consuming 8-hour-a-week task. This takes away valuable time from the task of data analysis and distilling useful learnings from the data.Source: Alteryx Q2 2020 ReportNot only has the problem not gone away for the data analyst, it has likely gotten worse. Digitization of supply chain, inventory management and manufacturing data have all been proceeding rapidly since the pandemic and have all added to the mountain of data to prep and analyze.Alteryx software still remains best of breed for the challenge. It sits comfortably within the extremes of high priced, expensive custom implementations that are available through companies such as SAS which are purpose-built and relatively inflexible.On the other hand, relatively simplistic, cheap software packages or open-source tools that require a lot of manual data manipulation create significant burdens for a data analyst to use. Microsoft Excel (NASDAQ:MSFT) lacks the power to handle heavy-duty data formatting, while open source programming languages like Python require a data analyst to spend a lot of time writing custom code to ingest and format data correctly before it can be analyzed and interpreted.Data will continue to be generated, and no new and better solutions exist to handle this, so Alteryx still remains best of breed for data prep.What was pleasing to note from Alteryx's results is that the customer love for Alteryx remains. It is just that this customer love is more accentuated with customers who have a consistent history using the Alteryx product in a meaningful way and who have many users in the business who do.Existing customers continued a multi-year trend of increasing the license spend that they have with Alteryx. At first glance, it looks like there was a major retraction in spending, with Alteryx's dollar-based retention rate declining from 133% in prior corresponding period to 126% in the current quarter.Source: Alteryx Q2 ReportIn fact, Alteryx is faced with a tale of two segments, something which Alteryx CEO Dean Stoecker shed some perspective on during the conference call. While existing customers with multiple licenses continued to spend largely as planned, ""most of the customer churn was driven by organizations with only a single designer seat that has not yet expanded"" and in accounts with ""less than $100M in revenue.""This was something that was additionally apparent in the breakdown of Alteryx's net expansion rate. While in the Global 2000, Alteryx saw a net expansion rate of 137%, its overall expansion rate declined to 126%, indicating not only quite a steep drop-off in expansion rate at the smaller end of the market, but also a high level of churn there.This speaks to the ongoing value creation and strong return on investment that Alteryx continues to drive in organizations where it is already a core part of the data analytics process. In organizations where Alteryx is not embedded, it may take time for them to see value, and expand more slowly.Alteryx didn't have any issues in the last quarter in driving new customer acquisition. Customer growth continued to increase 27%. Unfortunately, the sales cycles with acquired customers are now more elongated and the deal sizes are smaller. Alteryx's CEO hinted that while customer digital transformation efforts aren't at large scale, these efforts continue in smaller increments in different parts of the organization.Source: Alteryx Q2 2020 ReportOverall, this is a positive for me. What this suggests is that in the Fortune 2000, where Alteryx has historically delivered significant value, enterprises will continue down the path of digital transformation, through perhaps at a more measured pace, rather than pursuing massive projects.As such, expansions in Alteryx license volume will be a little slower than historically, with small data analytics projects steadily expanding over time, rather than massive company-wide business transformation requiring many licenses simultaneously.Thus the reduction in Alteryx's near-term demand is merely a deferral, a steady moderated project expansion with respect to unique market conditions, as opposed to Alteryx's product not hitting the mark.Alteryx will see a return to demand as these projects pick up broader scale and spread company wide once again, as the effect of the pandemic wears off and budgets for digital transformation are loosened.In the interim, it appears that Alteryx is better focused concentrating its time and attention on the Fortune 2000 part of the market and being diligent about any customer acquisition efforts focused on smaller customers. Customer acquisition may be slower, and deal sizes may be smaller, but large enterprises will be the part of the market that will provide Alteryx with the best returns on its efforts in the near term.In recognition of this more challenging environment, Alteryx has reset its customer acquisition strategy in favor of a less expensive 6-month adoption license.These allow a business to get better acquainted with the platform and steadily expand, rather than more traditional software licenses which create higher churn, particularly among smaller customers at the renewal point.This is likely to be much more successful in the current environment, and consistent with a steady expansion within a customer, while still allowing Alteryx to be embedded within a customer environment and experience the benefits.With the massive pullback in Alteryx's share price, the business has returned to the levels which it traded at in early March and April. Yet the problem it solves is still acute, and customer budgets are only temporarily tight.Unlike malls, commercial property or in-store retail, there are no secular headwinds here, rather temporary customer tightening brought about by a very unique event.Source: Seeking Alpha Premium, Alteryx estimatesAlteryx is still expected to continue growing its revenue by 25-30% over the next medium term. The company's forward Price to Sales ratio is now a lot more attractive for the eventual resumption in growth, being priced at 13x forward sales.Source: YCharts.The pandemic has likely created some long-term reshaping of underlying trends in the economy. The demand for tools to simplify data analysis is something I firmly believe remains intact, and Alteryx is one of the best ways to play this. At a price that is more than 30% less than recent highs, the company now offers a favorable entry point as well."
4369280,104882,2020-08-17T15:06:39-04:00,"Following a nearly 40% beat-down after earnings, Alteryx may have found a bottom with what appears to be little downside left for the stock barring any greater macroeconomic headwinds.With the potential to return to highs over the next year to year and a half, Alteryx could easily deliver as much as 60% upside.An industry-leading software in the high-growth data analytics and AI sector along with an experienced team makes Alteryx a solid, long-term investment.","Alteryx, Inc. (AYX) has been a tremendous growth story over the last six months finding new all-time highs again and again as it shortly breached the $180 mark. The company's constantly expanding valuation has in turn led to what looks to be an overblown sell-off due to lowered guidance. In this article, I will help to determine a fair value for AYX stock going forward in both the short- and long-term viewpoints.Alteryx has established itself as a leader in both Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, two of the fastest-growing areas of tech. The company is able to differentiate itself from competitors with the breadth of analytics its software can cover (Figure 1). This is what has allowed it to consistently deliver solid growth up until the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has brought with it cost-cutting, and one of the areas being cut for many companies now that remote work has been established has been in data analytic improvements. This has reduced Alteryx's future guidance and made it significantly harder to value the stock.(Figure 1) Alteryx Provides Users With A Multitude Of Services Unlike Other Data Analytics SoftwareLooking at both forward and historical data, it is possible to get a fairly decent estimate on where this stock will go in the near and distant future to establish a strong investment thesis going forward.Alteryx is generally viewed as a pure growth stock. With that being said, Price to Earnings alone is not a good metric to truly measure its value. Instead one must look towards growth in comparison to competitors to get a good idea of the company's current fair valuation. Following the recent pullback, AYX is trading significantly cheaper than peers, Datadog (DDOG) and Coupa Software (COUP) despite normally delivering similar revenue growth (Figure 2). What will be key going forward is whether or not this slowdown in growth for Alteryx is due solely to the coronavirus or whether a peak growth has been established. Next quarter's earnings and guidance will be huge in showing which of these situations is the case.Data by YCharts(Figure 2) Alteryx Has Newfound Value Following A Q2 Slowdown And Lowered GuidanceAnother key metric that displays Alteryx's value within a growth stock is the Price to Book Value ratio which is significantly lower than peers. If this metric holds true, a fair valuation would be closer to a 60% uptick from current prices. That indicates either an overvaluation by peers or fair value of closer to the $176 mark.Now, this fair value range was very reasonable before the adjusted guidance given in the most recent earnings call. Even with the updated guidance, the FY20 revenue estimates are only expected to drop around 10% from prior estimates while the stock underwent a nearly 40% pullback in comparison. This also does not take into account that AYX has a long track record of giving conservative estimates and consistently posting earnings beats.Therefore, in the short term, I have a hard time seeing this stock dip below the ~$105 resistance that was tested back in early May unless further macroeconomic issues drag on the sector as a whole as Alteryx currently trades at a rare value for a historically strong growth stock.In the long term, we will need to continue to see earnings beats and accelerated growth (~50%) if the stock looks to continue this run. With big data and AI becoming more important than ever, I see this being entirely possible, allowing AYX to return to 52-week highs over the next year to year and a half especially if an effective vaccine is released before the year-end allowing work to return to normal and funding for big data experimentation to grow.The biggest risk I see with AYX is if this reduction in growth truly is a signal of a peak. If growth is reduced for longer than the next quarter or two that may be a good signal that the lifetime of AYX as a growth stock may be coming to an end and a lower price to earnings will reflect this. The company has plenty of experience (Figure 3) and its long-term debt to capital is nothing to worry about so some of the major risks that are often associated with young growth stock companies are just not there with Alteryx.(Figure 3) The Alteryx Team Has Years Of Focused Experience & Expertise in Data Analytics Software & Related BusinessesIf the sector as a whole turns sour it may be time to get out, but with peers like Datadog and Fastly (FSLY) still posting solid growth, this may just be a COVID anomaly for AYX, and if this holds true, I do not see much more than 5% downside risk following the 40% decline the stock has already undergone.Alteryx has been beaten down and much of this appears to be an overreaction following what has been a significant run-up. This pullback opens up a valuable buying opportunity as the stock appears to have leveled out and potentially found a near bottom in the most recent week. For the first time in years, there is value in this growth stock and this opportunity has opened up as much as 60% potential upside with as little as 5% downside as long as the sector as a whole stays strong in a few crucial upcoming quarters. AYX has plenty of potential, but will need to be carefully monitored going forward as any further signs of weakness could be pretty tough news for this growth story."
4368745,104905,2020-08-14T11:58:20-04:00,"Alteryx reported a dismal second quarter of 2020 and even worse guidance which had investors run for the exit.The company has always been an enigma in terms of its revenue recognition. The growth picture is again quite complicated. ARR maybe a better metric to use going forward.Adoption licenses could be a problem, but we don't really know to which extent. Is Alteryx giving price discounts?Shares are not cheap after the sell-off considering the business performance. I would look to cut oversized portfolio weightings and be careful to open new positions for the time being.","Note [Aug 15, 2020]: I just found an error in my example used about upfront revenue recognition and corrected it. I also clarified it in the comment section.Alteryx (AYX) reported second-quarter 2020 numbers and it looked pretty ugly. The company reported only 17% growth in Q2 2020 and guided for only 11% growth for the full year, which is significantly lower than the growth seen in 2019 at 59% and 65% respectively. It is safe to say that COVID-19 has put Alteryx's growth journey at least on a temporary halt and management does not expect a material improvement in business conditions during 2020.Shares immediately saw a huge sell-off and ended the day after the earnings announcement down 28% and dropped a further 10% as of this writing. At first glance, this seems warranted considering that Alteryx is held up to much higher standards by the market in terms of growth.Many investors, including myself, will ask themselves now if Alteryx is still worth owning. This article tries to shine a light on the quarter and what can be expected going forward.Since Alteryx is supposed to be a company in its highest growth phase, revenue growth is the most important metric to track as an investor. Alteryx used to be a poster child of the revenue growth metric in 2019. Its growth from Q1 to Q4 2019 looked like this: 51%, 59%, 65%, 75% - it was going up, up, up! The market loves that - rightly so - and has rewarded shareholders accordingly.Alteryx reported revenue of $96.2 million in Q2 2020 (up 17.32% yoy), which was barely above their guidance of $95 million. What is even more disappointing is their full-year guidance (they didn't provide updated full-year guidance in Q1 2020 because of uncertainty), which calls for 2020 revenue of only $465 million (+11% yoy), a full $100 million below their initial guidance in Q4 2019. The guidance also implies only 11% growth in Q3 2020 and revenue shrinking by 7% in Q4 2020. Thus, the sequence of revenue growth from Q1 to Q4 in 2020 will likely look like this: 43%, 17%, 11%, -7%.While investors already knew that COVID-19 would negatively impact Alteryx since the first quarter of 2020, it has become painfully clear that things are much worse than the market predicted.This business deceleration was very unexpected to me. Alteryx has a history of low-ball guidance that they easily beat by a wide margin. Also, management seemed quite upbeat in the Q1 conference call despite the tough environment. However, looking back, as a shareholder I was biased in that judgment. In the Q1 2020 earnings call you could find plenty of red flag-phrases like ""abrupt and significant change in customer buying behavior"", ""sales cycles lengthen"" and ""customers paused spending"". Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to it back in May and instead gave more weight to Alteryx's ability to adapt to the new challenges and rebound quickly. This rebound probably won't happen in the foreseeable future, as CEO Stoecker made clear in the Q2 2020 earnings call: ""Based on what we see today, we do not anticipate a material improvement in business conditions during 2020.""In the Q2 earnings call, management talked about initial deal sizes shrinking, expansion business sales cycle slow, and customers postponing or downsize larger initiatives. CFO Kevin Rubin admitted that they were too optimistic in their Q1 earnings report and that changes in customer buying behavior did not become apparent to them until later in the second quarter. These changes were most evident in the expansion business. Along with these trends, sales and marketing productivity declined for the quarter, and also churn rates increased globally.In other words, both the ""land"" and the ""expand"" part of their growth strategy are facing problems and there is no visibility when these problems might disappear.On top of that, Alteryx seems to be forced to use ""adoption licenses"" to maintain customers. These are short-term test contracts that typically last six months - that's only a quarter of the average contract duration of two years. In Q2, these adoption agreements increased by over 60% year-over-year and more than 100% sequentially.Considering Alteryx revenue recognition under ASC 606 this could have huge implications on their reported revenue. Remember, instead of recognizing the total contract value (TCV) ratably over the contract duration, Alteryx recognizes 35%-40% of the TCV upfront upon signing as revenue, plus the remaining 60%-65% of the TCV ratably over the lifetime of the contract.Imagine, Alteryx signs a contract for $100k a year for a contract duration of two years at the beginning of the quarter. Because of ASC 606 revenue recognition rules, Alteryx has to recognize up to 40% of the TCV ($200k * 40% = $80k) plus 3 months of the remaining 40% ($120k / 24 * 3 = $15k), i.e. $95k or 47.5% of the TCV. Only 52.5% of revenue from that deal remain for the next seven quarters - that's only 7.5% per quarter.While this revenue recognition method accelerates reported revenue growth in good times (we saw that in 2019) it also creates amplified problems when new deals and/or renewals get scarce (as we are seeing now).This is even more intensified by the discounted and shorter-term adoption licenses - a term that came up 20 times in the earnings call (as opposed to two times in Q1).Just consider what a six-month contract duration would do to revenue recognition in the example above (without any price discounts!): The TCV drops from $200k to $50k. The recognized revenue in the first quarter drops from $95k to $35k, which is 63% less revenue recognized even though ACV ($100k) stays the same and - if they can maintain the customer - there is no revenue and cash flow impact in the long term.Unfortunately, management stayed a bit vague on adoption licenses. They noted that they typically offered up adoption licenses as an ask from customers (mostly in the commercial vertical) but provided them carefully and not to anyone. As an example, they would consider them for customers who are implementing major transformations and are not sure whether they need 200 users or 2,000 users or 20,000 users. That's how Alteryx keeps these customers on their transformation journey and engaged with the company.They also did not see any material change in the average contract duration despite the increased use of adoption licenses. This is because contract duration is weighted on a dollar basis and since adoption licenses are sold at a ""low entry price"" (according to CFO Rubin) they have a small impact there.This raises another question: Does ""low entry price"" mean that Alteryx is giving price discounts with adoption licenses, or does the lower entry price only come from shorter contract durations?The problem is, we cannot really say. This is from the call:So is pricing lower here? I have no idea from this answer. I did try to clarify this with Investor Relations and got this short reply:In other words, while it would really be interesting for investors to understand in detail the impact of adoption licenses and pricing, Alteryx chooses to downplay the issue. Although to be fair, it is understandable Alteryx is not openly talking about price discounts. Can you imagine their customer's reactions the day after admitting discounts? Exactly. Where is MY discount, Alteryx?Since the company didn't clearly say ""no, we don't use them"" to the subject of price discounts, it has to be assumed that they are employing them in some form or the other. This makes the long-term investment thesis a bit less appealing to me.Does Alteryx have pricing power or not? Are their products so good that customers have to have them and will pay the price that the company dictates?While we don't have complete information to answer these questions at the moment, the picture has become much more clouded around them. It seems to me that they don't have as much pricing power as I hoped.How should we assess ""real"" revenue growth going forward? It is a tough question. Since I own shares of Alteryx, and this goes back to shortly after the IPO, there have been a lot of discussions about this issue. As mentioned earlier, especially the transition to ASC 606 has been problematic in this regard. I have given this issue considerable thought and have read many comments about it. Ultimately, I think you have to accept some limitations in deciphering all relevant information.One interesting fact, that I haven't read about yet, is that Alteryx is reporting its revenue in two categories since Q1 2020 - subscription-based software license and PCS (post-contract support) and services. If you make the calculation with the data available (only numbers for Q1 and Q2 of 2019 and 2020 were provided yet) you can see that subscription-based software license revenue (the good recurring revenue part) typically made up around 45% of total revenue. However, in Q2 2020 subscription revenue plunged by 32% sequentially (it was up 5.8% sequentially in Q2 2019) and now only makes up 36% of total revenue. Unfortunately, this is another negative data point.But why, then, did the dollar-based net retention rate only tick down by 2% sequentially to 126%? And how did the company not see a bigger positive impact from the 271 customers it added (+27% yoy)? And didn't Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) come in at $410 million (+72% yoy), which still implies very strong growth? Finally, the company expects to exit 2020 with approximately $500 million of ARR or annual recurring revenue which translates into over 30% yoy growth. From this perspective, things look much better. But the devil is in the detail.The dollar-based net expansion rate is a trailing four-quarter average of the annual contract value (ACV) so it is still held up by two very strong quarters at the end of 2019. We have to expect that this metric will drop further in the next two quarters. Furthermore, the number of customers doesn't really tell you about the size and quality of the customer - the anemic revenue growth suggests that these new customers were no big fish. And yes, RPO was up 72% from last year, but it is basically unchanged since Q4 2019 (when it was $407 million).Lastly, there is ARR, the one metric that still looks promising. According to the company, ARR represents the total annual contract value for active customer subscription contracts as of the measurement date. The company announced that it crossed $400 million in ARR in Q1 2020 (although they didn't give a specific number). In Q2 they stood at $430 million in ARR (+40% yoy) and they expect to grow it to $500 million by the end of the year (up more than 30% yoy).This suggests, that the company ended 2019 at around $385 million ARR and is consistently adding to their total ACV every quarter, regardless of the deceleration of recognized revenue. Management mentioned in the call that their revenue mechanics and ARR (annual recurring revenue) are disconnected. Revenue is driven by TCV, while ARR is the accumulation of ACV (annual contract value) over time.What became clear in this quarter, in my opinion, is that reported revenue is not the right metric to assess ""real growth"". It overstated revenue growth in good times where the company signed a lot of new deals (FY 2019) and is understating revenue growth in bad times when there are not a lot of expansion deals to sign (FY 2020).Alteryx never was a plus 60% revenue growth company since the IPO. It's also not a sub 20% grower now either. They are most likely a 30-50% grower and ARR seems to reflect that growth better than any other metric.What to do with shares right now? It is a tricky question.If you are interested in companies that are firing on all cylinders with little doubt in the investment thesis (and Alteryx was such a company two quarters ago), you should clearly sell Alteryx now. There are so many yellow and red flags in the report and no visibility when they might disappear that no mental acrobatics could convince you that everything is fine here. For all you know, this stock will be dead money for at least the next two quarters. Why hold it then? And who knows if there are not more negative surprises to come?However, I also think that it would be wrong to say that the investment thesis for Alteryx is completely broken. What makes me feel a bit better about the Alteryx investment case is that Alteryx's business problems did most likely not appear because of bad execution. There is no doubt that the current business environment is unusually troubled and of course all companies try to tighten their belts where it is possible. It just seems that saving on expensive data analytics software is one of the places where it is a bit easier to cut back spending.The investment opportunity here really is that things will return back to normal sooner than later and that 2021 will see healthy growth again, which should take the shares higher, too. CEO Stoecker seems to be convinced that this will happen and referred to this as the ""fourth event"" in his career where things turned south for a while, just to return swiftly again. He is banking on the long-term trend towards more data analytics and believes that Alteryx will be one of the primary beneficiaries which sound good to me.However, I would be careful to confuse this price drop as a great buying opportunity. Sure the valuation came down to ""more attractive"" levels. The problem is the valuation drop came hand in hand with bad business performance and an even worse outlook. You also have to understand that coming into the report shares were trading at a way too high valuation in relation to growth anyways.Data byYChartsFellow SA contributor Steve Auger recently showed a nice graphic where Alteryx seemed fairly valued at the moment.I have to admit that I'm undecided about what to do with my shares at the moment. It used to be an 11-12% position in my portfolio. After the price drop and without selling any shares yet, this has been reduced to 7.9%.Part of me wants to sell and just move on to something with a better outlook. But another part of me still likes the long-term outlook of this business and doesn't want to pay taxes on shares that were bought as low as $25.Yet, Alteryx is a small company, unprofitable, and in a highly competitive market. This is not a company with a dominant market position like Amazon or Netflix that you can buy and forget. Visibility is key here. And currently, we are flying blindfolded for the rest of 2020. Thus, it will be hard to judge if this business weakness is really all just macro pressure.That's why, in my opinion, it's reasonable not to have an oversized portfolio position in Alteryx at the moment. My current idea is to trim my position to well below a 5% portfolio weighting."
4367228,102764,2020-08-10T16:00:39-04:00,"Alteryx crushed by almost 30% due to disappointing guidance last week.The negative impact from the recession is very real and material.However, it is also transitory by its own nature.The business fundamentals remain intact.Expectations how now been reset, and the stock is well positioned for attractive returns at current price levels.","Alteryx (AYX) got downright obliterated last week, the stock collapsed by more than 28% on Friday after the company's earnings report was received with relentless selling by the market. The struggle is real, Alteryx is feeling the impact from the recession and the timing for recovery is unclear at this stage.However, the slowdown is most probably transitory as opposed to permanent, and short-term weakness in a high-quality business seems to be creating a buying opportunity for investors in Alteryx.Alteryx actually reported both sales and earnings numbers above Wall Street estimates during the second quarter of 2020. But forward guidance was clearly disappointing, and management did not provide many reasons to expect a recovery in demand in the short term.It is important to understand that Alteryx provides software to make the data analysis process simpler, easier, and more efficient. This is not a company that benefits from specific work from home trends such as those in online communications or cloud computing. Alteryx offers a relatively expensive software solution in times when companies are cutting their spending as much as possible, and this obviously has a negative impact on revenue growth.Nobody should be too surprised to see Alteryx suffering the impact from the recession, but management comments in the previous quarter may have provided a wrong impression because the company was not yet fully experiencing the deceleration in April.In the words of Kevin Rubin, Alteryx's CFO:Revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $96.2 million, an increase of 17% versus the same quarter in the prior year. This is a big deceleration in comparison to growth rates in prior quarters, but it is not such a bad number considering the economic environment. The revenue number was actually above analyst estimates by more than $2 million.However, guidance was a very different story. Alteryx is expecting revenue in the range of $111 million to $115 million in the third quarter, representing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 7% to 11%. Analysts were on average expecting $119.11 million.For the full year 2020 revenue guidance is for $460 million to $465 million or a year-over-year increase of approximately 11%. In comparison, analysts were expecting $505.1 million in revenue 2020, so the guidance number is materially below expectations.Adding to the concerns, there were no signs of improvements in the trend during the quarter. CEO Dan Stocker said:Alteryx stock was trading close to all-time highs leading to the report, and high expectations combined with a material disappointment in guidance can produce significant damage to the stock price.It was quite obvious when looking at the guidance numbers that this was going to trigger a sharp selloff in the stock, although the magnitude of such a selloff seems to be exaggerated from a long term point of view.Accounting revenues can be messy for Alteryx. Due to accounting standards requirements, the company recognizes most of the revenue from a new contract in the quarter in which the contract is signed as opposed to spreading revenue evenly through the duration of such a contract. This means that accounting revenue numbers can be quite noisy, and decelerating growth can have a disproportionately high impact on revenue during a quarter.Besides, management is generally quite conservative when it comes to guidance. Alteryx has delivered revenue numbers above expectations in the past 14 quarters in a row, quite an impressive track-record showing that management tends to consistently underpromise and overdeliver.Source: Seeking AlphaOther important metrics regarding business fundamentals look much stronger than what the slowdown in revenue would indicate. Alteryx reported a dollar-based net expansion rate of 126%, which is a more than healthy number by industry standards. The company also ended the quarter with $430 million in annual recurring revenue, an increase of over 40% year-over-year.Alteryx added 271 net new customers during the quarter, including six of the Global 2000. The company currently has more than 6,700 customers around the world including 37% of the Global 2000. Engagement levels are at record levels, so customers are clearly finding in Alteryx a valuable tool to make decisions in times of uncertainty.Source: AlteryxManagement expects to exit the year 2020 with approximately $500 million in annual recurring revenue, representing an increase of 30% year over year. These numbers do not reflect a declining business, quite on the contrary.The company also delivered solid cost discipline during the quarter, with gross profit margin remaining resiliently high in spite of the slowdown in growth.Source: AlteryxYes, revenue guidance was materially below expectations and there is no way around that. However, there is a huge difference between a company that is facing a slowdown in growth due to challenging economic conditions and one that is facing a permanent deterioration in fundamentals.When it comes to Alteryx, the company is delivering a level of performance that most other companies in the world can only envy during a recession, and the business fundamentals look as healthy as ever.Alteryx is implementing a series of initiatives focused on jumpstarting revenue growth. Adoption licenses are short term contracts, generally for 6 months, allowing customers to test the platform without a large commitment in time or money. These licenses are obviously easier to sell when customers are on a tight budget.Adoption agreements grew 60% year over year and more than 100% sequentially last quarter. If the company manages to retain a large share of these customers going forward, the overall impact on revenue could be attractive over the middle term.Alteryx is increasingly focusing on strengthening and expanding its ecosystem. The company announced a global elite partnership with PWC in the first quarter and new tech partnerships with Adobe (ADBE) and UiPath in the second quarter.New hires among sales reps have underperformed other historical cohorts recently because it has been harder for them to get the right training and learn the sales playbooks in a work from home environment. Alteryx is building new learning platforms and adjusting its sales playbooks in order to restore sales and marketing efficiency to historical levels.It is hard to know what kind of impact these initiatives are going to have in the short term, but one thing looks quite clear: based on the evidence currently available, the company's problems seem to be temporary and due to external factors as opposed to internal and permanent.The stock was priced for perfection before the report, and now valuation is accounting for a much tougher reality. A forward price to sales ratio of 13.5 looks fairly reasonable for such a high-quality business.Data by YChartsThe most important thing to consider is that the fundamentals are intact and Alteryx is well-positioned for much better performance when the economy recovers from the recession. Markets are forward-looking, so I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock moving in the right direction if the prospects for the economy start to improve over the middle term.Market expectations for Alteryx have now been reset to much more modest levels, and potential returns for long term investors look clearly attractive at these price levels."
4359327,105186,2020-07-20T08:02:34-04:00,"Alteryx estimates a $50 billion TAM; I believe this figure might be far too generous.Reddit forums of Alteryx users provide useful context for understanding precisely what Alteryx's software does.Alteryx is primarily a data blending tool with predictive analytic capabilities that run the coding language R in the background.Alteryx should easily benefit from advantages of scale, but revenue growth might be stunted sooner than the market expects.With 25%+ revenue growth priced in over the next five years, and a cloudy market opportunity, I believe investors are buying the narrative over the fundamentals at the moment.","Data has become the oxygen of business. Businesses that can extrapolate what their customers want through understanding behavior are positioning themselves to succeed in the data driven era. Data driven insights can also drive operational efficiencies. The world never sits still, businesses of all shapes and sizes are learning the power of harnessing their data. When a company like Alteryx (AYX) comes along with the belief that they can make data scientists out of ordinary Excel users, it's easy to see how investors can be extra jubilant and look past some critical details. Alteryx's market opportunity might be much smaller than its current valuation implies. The current stock price implies 25%+ growth for at least 5 years which may not be sustainable. I believe that the market is overestimating Alteryx's potential because of broad parameters that are used in evaluating the business' revenue potential. Alteryx is merely a tool that makes sense for certain customers to use, not a transformative data platform that will be able to compound aggressively for shareholders. Collecting data based on customer behavior is the first challenge. But, once we have that data, we must make sense of it. This is a complex process. As an investor, I believe that when analyzing a business like Alteryx, too much time is spent focusing on what the business is saying, and not enough time is spent on what the customers are saying. Alteryx's value proposition is that they can save precious labor hours, and that their tools enable the average employee to partake in garnering insights from data. This article from Wired with CEO Dean Stoecker exemplifies the Alteryx story well. An excerpt:Alteryx has a good story that is backed by revenues that have gone from $86 million in 2016 to $451 million over the past twelve months. The company estimates a TAM near $50 billion. SourceAlteryx derived these IT figurers from a Gartner report detailing analytics and business intelligence. This is obviously a large category. Alteryx doesn't appear on Gartner's magic quadrant for analytics and business intelligence in 2020, Alteryx does appear on this year's data science and machine learning quadrant as a leader in the ""ability to execute"" category, but not in the ""visionary"" category. The Line-of-Business market is the the company's estimate based on the number of spreadsheet users that worked on advanced data preparation and analytics. While the business made an attempt to quantify its TAM, I believe this encapsulates a market far too obtusely. Customers use Alteryx for a specific purpose, making it very difficult to hone in precisely what the market size is. To understand why I believe Alteryx's TAM could be far less than $50 billion, we must get to the root of what people use Alteryx to do, and why they pay for it. I believe that the term ""Citizen Data Scientist"" is misleading. From this individual on an Alteryx blog post:There are millions of people that use Excel to perform their jobs. Excel is a powerful tool, but that doesn't necessarily make users experts in some related field. Anyone can build a financial model in Excel but if the assumptions are wildly inaccurate, the model is useless. In a similar fashion, Alteryx is used in such a way that helps employees construct models, but more so in a fashion of using preexisting data and prepackaged tools. Reddit threads with commenters who have firsthand experience using Alteryx seems like a rather rudimentary stream of due diligence, but in this case I believe it is some of the most valuable information that we can extract about the business. It's important not to rely on one experience, but getting a sample of what customers are using the product for is helpful. One Redditor asks the usefulness of Alteryx given his or her particular situation. This person is tasked with building models that are described as baseline and not overtly complex, and then training analysts on using and updating the models. The top reply:This statement hits at what Alteryx truly is. Alteryx is a specific tool used by specific people to perform a specific task. Alteryx is not a broad reaching technology platform that gives businesses insights they would not have otherwise gained. This customer feedback somewhat differs from Alteryx's CEO's statements on Mad Money that Alteryx is useful to 47 million Excel users and 2 million PhD's of data science. Another response:Alteryx enables employees who do not understand the coding language R to build data flows. In Stoecker's conversation with Jim Cramer, he mentions a number of data items tracked by NFL teams. But, implying that Alteryx enables such organization to make use of all its data simply is not true. It is a useful tool in some scenarios for analysts who are not well versed in coding. Again, this differs from the idea of creating ""Citizen Data Scientists."" The real heavy lifting is still being done by actual data scientists with far more complexity. Alteryx is primarily a data blending tool, enabling data analysts to conjoin and filter through data coming from a variety of different sources. And an expensive one at that. Alteryx licenses for its main product, Alteryx Designer, at $5,195 per year. Alteryx's predictive tools are essentially a user interface with coding in R working underneath the hood. Nonetheless, some Redditors do clearly see the value in Alteryx software:This user clearly sees the value in what Alteryx does, which is primarily conjoin and sort datasets from different locations. Ultimately, this matters because it tells investors that Alteryx's TAM is restricted. The more open ended the end market, the better chance investors have at compounding wealth over time should the business continue to innovate and execute. The big winners over time in enterprise software have been product suites creators such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe (ADBE), along with platforms that dominate major operations of large enterprises such as Salesforce (CRM) and Workday (WDAY). Alteryx's 47 million spreadsheet user TAM is difficult to reconcile when understanding what Alteryx's tools actually do. But, it is quite clear Alteryx offers nowhere near the girth of solutions as Microsoft or Adobe. Thus, valuing a business that provides one specific solution that the business itself loosely quantifies will requires liberal use of growth assumptions. Software businesses have magnificent operating leverage, so I don't deny Alteryx's margins will improve with scale. But ultimately, I believe Alteryx investors are in for disappointing returns moving forward. I believe the market has greatly overestimated Alteryx's addressable market by fundamentally misunderstanding use cases and have over relied upon recent growth trends as being indicative of future performance. Let's have a look at what the next five years might look like for Alteryx.Source: AuthorIn terms of Alteryx's margin structure will look like. In a recent article on Zoom (ZM), I evaluated a basket of software businesses and determined the average FCF margin was around 30%, and at the time the average FCF multiple was around 55x, but valuations have compressed a bit for the high flyers since then. Because software businesses generally have high operating leverage, I think Alteryx could reasonably expanded to FCF margin from about 5% to 17% in 2025, and there may be some more room to expand in the years following. I also assume the FCF multiple will compress from 210x to 50x. This group of software stocks used to compute the average 30% FCF margin included the likes of Microsoft and Adobe which have a far more robust suite of products designed for different use cases. For that reason, I don't think Alteryx will have the ability to achieve similar margins.One notable financial advantage that Alteryx has over many other software companies is low stock-based compensation. Alteryx's diluted share count has actually decreased over the past five years. I don't believe SBC is a real expense, but instead accounted for through dilution in the future. But, for Alteryx, the share count should not grow. Wall Street is expecting revenue growth to exceed 20% for the next 3 years. Pricing in 25% growth from 2023 through 2025 using the above margins and multiple, gives us a disappointing 5.6% compounded 5-year return. The stock market is pricing in significant growth and margin expansion for Alteryx, but the market that Alteryx is capturing is hazy. The margin structure of other software businesses gives us a helpful picture of what Alteryx will look like at scale. But considering we would only expect to achieve a 5.6% return with lofty expectations of revenue growth, investors should tread cautiously and be careful buying into narrative driven stocks. At $160, Alteryx appears priced for mediocre forward returns."
4354891,41961,2020-06-22T00:35:02-04:00,"The data tsunami is a major secular trend that is taking place in the economy.Data analysts are caught in the eye of the storm, with an increasing volume of data to format, standardize and make sense of.Alteryx is an invaluable productivity tool for this group, greatly easing the burden on analysts.Digitization has accelerated over the last few months, and IoT will provides another tailwind for the business.Enterprise sales disruption will be a temporary headwind, and Alteryx is in a name that should be bought on pullbacks.","Recent results from Alteryx (AYX) suggested challenges for the business in navigating the current pandemic. The company not only pulled full-year guidance for the year, but the guidance that was given for Q2 suggested a fairly sharp and material slowdown from the revenue growth that the business delivered in Q1. Alteryx grew revenues in the previous quarter by almost 43% year on year, with strong growth and addition of enterprise customers, which increased almost 30% year over year. The fact that the company is indicating a sharp deceleration in revenue shouldn’t be a cause for concern for investors. If anything, Alteryx is even more indispensable for its customer base then it was just three months ago.One of the key things that I look for in any of the investments that I make, particularly in more disruptive early-stage businesses, is to understand the pain of a problem that a business is trying to solve and the alternative solutions that exist to solve the problems. In Alteryx's case, the problem runs deep and it’s only getting worse.Source: Alteryx Q1 2020 reportData analysts are an increasingly stressed group these days. The myriad different data sources that they have to deal are only increasing with the digitization of the enterprise. It’s no exaggeration to say that data is the fuel of the information economy and the data analyst is caught right in the middle.Analysts need to take multiple streams of data, often in different formats which may not mesh nicely, standardize and prep this data, and ultimately provide intelligible output for stakeholders to make key decisions as to where new investments will be made, capital will be deployed and resources allocated. For data analysts, Alteryx is a key productivity driver in that mission to reduce repetitive tasks that equate to 26 hours of wasted work per week.Source: Alteryx Q1 2020 reportThe alternative options for data analysts are poor. Alteryx is primarily focused on displacing the humble spreadsheet, a tool which has hardly evolved in decades, as the main alternative.Other alternatives are very code-heavy, requiring an extensive knowledge of open source computing protocols such as Python, often a chore and significant time waster for data analysts who may have to familiarize themselves with the code. More fully featured platforms do exist, such as SAS, but they are often highly expensive, customized solutions that take significant time to deploy and lack the flexibility of Alteryx's light-weight implementation.Source: Alteryx Q1 2020 reportThese last few months have only made the burden for data analysts worse. The coronavirus pandemic has caused companies globally to accelerate the digitization of previously manual process. The factory floor and supply chain - areas that were chronically inefficient and manual - have been weak points for enterprises in this crisis and have now seen accelerated transformation, adding to the proliferation of new data sources with a more critical time-sensitive component.Anecdotes abounded during this crisis of companies cut short in responding to surging customer orders, with inadequate inventory on hand and an incomplete view of manufacturing. This has prompted the digitization of supply chains to optimize inventory flow, demand for greater real-time sources of data versus historical transaction data and new sources of digital marketing to be able to better anticipate customer demand. This will only further exacerbate the number of new data sources containing valuable signals that a data analyst will have to make sense of.The hype cycle around the Internet of Things (IoT) has been talked about for an extended period of time now. However, there are reasons to believe that this will now finally move into higher gear. Faster, lower-latency networks made possible by 5G make edge-based automation of equipment and machinery all the more real. It’s increasingly possible to get detailed insight into predictive maintenance issues on the factory floor as a result of machine data.The level of occupancy in a given facility can be determined by sensors in a building, allowing businesses to best determine whether they can consolidate building space. Pallet tracking will make it possible to have much better insight into inflows and outflows of inventory to get a better handle of real-time product availability.While these are all things that will greatly improve the quality of decision-making within enterprise, the complexities and challenges of handling and preparing machine data for analysis are significant. The data tends to be very noisy, extremely high-volume and difficult to sort and process.Alteryx has demonstrated a proven ability to help businesses like Daimler AG makes sense of trillions of rows of noisy data through assisting with the formatting and processing of data and connecting of different data sets all in one platform. This is something that would be impossible to conceive of doing through any type of spreadsheet. The key to Daimler AG unlocking value in IoT data was being able to use Alteryx as a single platform to format and organize data, create macros and pull published data to intelligence tools, which led to meaningful insights being extracted via visualization.Source: Alteryx Community ForumOne of the other key attributes for me in assessing a potential long-term wealth creator is to understand the vision of a leader and how they see the market evolving over a long period of time. I generally have a preference for founder-led businesses, particularly at the early stages of market penetration. I’ve been impressed with the clarity and vision of Dean Stoker, the founder of Alteryx, who’s been with the business since 1997.Single-minded focus and execution can be very important when defining a new market, and Alteryx is focused on unifying the analytics process via a single platform. Data analysts typically aren't coding experts like data scientists, which is reflected in a code-friendly product with a lot of pre-built modeling tools that come out of the box to assist in business modelling and the application of algorithms to help analysts extract value from data. While the platform is primarily geared toward data analysts, Alteryx also provides tools to help data scientists get their models into production.I like businesses that are capable of growing via viral adoption, where the customers tend to be the biggest evangelist for the products. This helps dramatically lower the cost of new customer acquisition, reduce churn and facilitates a land-and-expand motion, critical to growing revenues in a low-cost way and reducing churn. Alteryx has been extremely successful at doing this. This execution is clearly reflected in the high levels of customer love and glowing testimonials for the product.Source: Alteryx Community ForumThe business counts almost 37% of the fortune 2000 as customers, across a range of industries like healthcare, manufacturing and technology, indicative of its broad-based utility, yet still illustrative of the large market opportunity that remains in front of the business. This customer love is also reflected in Alteryx's high dollar retention rate of 132%, indicative that not only do customers not churn, but that they’re actively spending more with the business every year.Source: Alteryx Q1 2020 reportThe process by which this occurs starts with a highly stressed data analyst seeing efficiency and workflow gains and then acting as an advocate to other data analysts, which triggers additional use cases and data sets being consolidated on the platform. This eventually results in platform-wide licensing, with the chief data scientist ultimately acting as an advocate. This can be rationalized in a process where a single burnt-out data analyst uses Alteryx to become more productive.Enterprise sales can be a challenging process. It takes time to isolate the correct decision maker in an enterprise and close a sale, particularly in a new and emerging area. Budget authority may be unclear, and multiple decision makers may be involved. To this end, Alteryx has increasingly expanded its indirect sales motion in recent years, and now counts Accenture, (ACN) Wipro and PwC as go-to market partners. Of these, the ""Global Elite"" partnership with PwC announced earlier this year may be the most important. The large system consulting firms have deep reach across the Fortune 2000 and many existing relationships with key business units in decision-makers across these organizations.PwC and its competitors are also often the first point of call for enterprises considering business transformation projects. They help enterprises through strategic planning for business transformation and identify areas of opportunity, inventory available data sources, develop meaningful inferences and federate such data into internal BI systems and the like.Consulting firms value Alteryx because the platform helps make the case for business transformation, given it’s a tool that can be used to unlock considerable value from data transformation projects. The pandemic will likely create a temporary hiccup in this sales motion given that many business transformation projects require in-person consulting and implementation, something which is difficult at this time. At this stage, I view this as a temporary issue that is unlikely to persist for an extended period of time.Source: Alteryx Q1 2020 reportAlteryx is a financially disciplined business with very good economics. The business generates gross margins above 90%, and has expanded this over the last few years. Operating margins have been consistently improving over the last few years, as Alteryx is now generating operating profits. High-margin land-and-expand revenue has been contributing significantly to this, and I see this further improving as the company's reseller partnerships start to scale.Alteryx is investing for growth, and while profitable, is best evaluated on the P/S metric. On this measure, it is favorably positioned with its peer group of businesses, including The Trade Desk (TTD) and Okta (OKTA), which have exhibited similar levels of rapid revenue growth.While Alteryx is not unreasonably valued at this stage, this is a highly volatile name, and better opportunities will likely come on offer to pick this up. The tailwinds for a business are substantial though, and this is a name that should be strongly and consistently accumulated on pullbacks."
4366732,105668,2020-08-09T11:15:48-04:00,"The Q2 earnings shock (-28%) was brutal, but justified given a deceleration in growth and weak future outlook.Customer-buying behavior has changed: Longer sales cycles, smaller deal sizes, and higher scrutiny on spend characterize the decline in growth; this is expected to continue going forward.On a positive note, Alteryx unveiled a unified APA platform, expanding its product portfolio and connecting its disparate products under one umbrella.At an NTM EV/S of 15.7x, it is better to avoid the stock as it is still expensive.","Source: 1-yr Total Return of AYX vs benchmarks, using KoyFinI rate Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) a ""Hold"", maintaining my rating from my last article. The Q2 earnings shock has erased most of Alteryx's gains since late April/May due to very weak guidance for the rest of 2020, undercutting analyst expectations. Consumer buying behavior has changed for the worse and the company expects the slump to continue for coming quarters. Investors may be tempted to buy the dip on account of a cheaper valuation, but I think it's best to stay on the sidelines. Alteryx remains one of the most innovative companies in its industry, but the risk/reward isn't ideal for now. I intend to wait for the more favorable circumstances to add it to my portfolio.Source: Alteryx 8-K Q2 2020 on Seeking AlphaWhile the numbers beat guidance and estimates, investors who may have been expecting a stellar beat would have been disappointed. And given a ~20x EV/S multiple from a few days ago, outperformance should've appropriately been expected (>17% growth). While the company mentioned in its Q1 call that business activity in April was consistent with levels seen in 2019, May and June were very different stories.The dollar-based net expansion and ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) growth are quite strong all things considered, while the issues are constricted to new sales and landing customers. The ""land and expand"" strategy has been disproportionately delivering on the ""expand"" part compared to pre-pandemic levels. The takeaway here seems to be that the customers who buy the software, love it, and are happy to spend more to unlock digital transformation value in their organizations even during the pandemic. These are good signs for the long-term durability of the business.The discrepancies in ARR and Revenue can be attributed to ""Total Contract Value"" and ""Annual Contract Value"" as explained below:The company has moved towards offering more short-term contracts (with six-month periods) as an adaptation to uncertainty its customers face in the current environment. This had a material impact on TCV values and therefore revenue recognition. This trend will likely continue and suppress revenue growth for some time in my opinion.On the product development front, all Alteryx products are now unified with an end-to-end APA (Analytics Process Automation) platform that features new ""Intelligence"" and ""Insights"" suites. What began as a data-prep and blending tool (Alteryx Designer) has now evolved into a comprehensive product portfolio for everything in data science and automation under a single umbrella. The unification makes complete sense and should help keep the expansion rate and ARR growth high even with a weaker customer and contract value add.Source: Alteryx Investor Relations, Q2 2020 Earnings PresentationSource: AlteryxThe question investors might be asking is if the newer products produce a reasonable value addition to justify the high prices the company charges. That remains to be seen and it is early to tell how the data science community responds to the unified platform. In my non-tech underqualified opinion, the true star of the Alteryx portfolio has always been ""Alteryx Designer"", which has proved exceptional as a data-prep and data-blending tool. Data prep takes up a ridiculous amount of time (~70% of the total data science workflow) and the time savings alone with Designer have been brilliant going off of the tech community reviews and ROI perceptions. The ROI for other products and APA has been more questionable on a relative basis. I echo some of Joseph Kowaleski's sentiments from his last article on Seeking Alpha that critiqued the reported Total Addressable Market. Whether the products are ""nice to have"" or ""mission-critical"" is an important factor to consider when assessing future growth rates, especially now that the economy is more price sensitive.All in all, Alteryx continues to be an excellent innovative business in the SaaS space and is likely the best at what it does. It just so happens that selling expensive data-science software, no matter how good it is, in a hampered economy is difficult and will continue to be difficult for some time. So far, the company has shown higher-than-expected exposure to business and economic cyclicality. Not all SaaS is resilient in this pandemic.Source: Alteryx 8-K Q2 2020 on Seeking AlphaAlteryx will eventually re-accelerate its top line, but that is highly dependent on the speed of a broader economic recovery, which is anybody's guess leaving us a wide range of outcomes. I raised caution previously regarding a potential multi-quarter slump in sales and that indeed seems to be the case going off of guidance. The company has historically guided conservatively and has maintained a beat-and-raise strategy, so I expect outperformance for the rest of the year. It wouldn't be out of the question if revenues exited the year at 15-20% growth or so (above the 11% yoy FY2020 estimate). News of the recovery could catalyze spending from potential customers as well.So what level of outperformance from the coming two quarters would justify buying the stock? And if Alteryx is an inevitable winner of data science software, what premium does that certainty come with?I'm happy to pay for a higher share price for AYX if revenue does indeed re-accelerate by the end of the year, but I'll once again wait on the sidelines. Confirmation on new products landing and delivering value to customers beyond data prep would mean that its moat is indeed true and strengthen the bull thesis. The unified APA does appear to be incredibly promising and there isn't an equivalent platform on the planet which appears to have its capabilities. APA warrants some further research from my side.Source: AYX EV/S Multiples, using KoyfinAlteryx posted a negative FCF during the last quarter and holds a trailing twelve-month FCF margin of 3.4% according to my calculations (FCF = Operating Cash Flow - CapEx). The balance sheet is strong, and management stated it's amassed $1 billion in cash during the earnings call which should help withstand the rocky road ahead.The vicious drop post-earnings puts the company at a 1-yr Fwd EV/S of 15.7x. That figure might be adjusted higher if some sell-side analysts have yet to lower their sales forecasts. To put profitability and growth into perspective, it is difficult to stomach the valuation with an extended growth rate of <20% and FCF margins at around breakeven for multiple quarters. A sign for re-acceleration may lead me to reconsider. I'm aware that some software stocks are trading at 25-30x sales but they appear to be delivering significantly higher growth rates as well. The multi-year compounding power of sales growth makes all the difference in these valuations. Revenue growth will be a key driver for AYX going forward.Upside Risks: Vaccine and/or a quick economic recovery, rapid adoption of APA, further Fed stimulus that may boost digital transformation spending, acquisition risks from big tech, and generally massive outperformance on guidance.Downside Risks: Systemic market risks and volatility, fund flow rotations out of growth stocks and the tech sector, prolonged economic recovery, competition from cheaper solutions such as Salesforce/Tableau's (CRM) data prep tools, and potentially excessive cash burn.In my opinion, it's better to stay on the sidelines and not buy the dip. Growth prospects have drastically reduced for good reason and the Alteryx growth runway is more tied to the broader economic recovery which may well be delayed. At an NTM EV/S of 15.7x, the risk/reward isn't attractive. AYX is a ""Hold"".If you liked this article and would like further coverage on disruptive tech and other growth stocks, hit ""Follow""."

Alteryx provides a user-friendly data analytics platform for business intelligence. Current macroeconomic weakness leads some investors to believe the company’s momentum is permanently impaired. They are wrong. In this article, we review the business, the massive opportunity, competition, coronavirus impacts, valuation and risks. We conclude with our opinion on why Alteryx will be an absolute, post-pandemic, fortune maker stock.(image source)Incorporated as SRC, LLC in 1997, the company changed its name to Alteryx, Inc. in 2010 and began trading publicly in 2017. The company provides a software platform to its users to derive meaningful insights from input data for use in decision making. Alteryx’s software platform consists of over 200 in-built analytical models which enable data analysts to perform complex analytics without the need to master a sophisticated coding language. Additionally, the analytical models are open and modular and therefore coding experts can upgrade or adjust the underlying codes as per their business needs. Alteryx has both on-premise as well as SaaS based elements in its product suite, but most of the business is on-premise. It generates revenue from software licensing fees and post contract customer support which includes upgrades and other professional services. The customers typically enter into a 1-3 year subscription agreement and are billed in advance on an annual basis.Alteryx follows a “land and expand” strategy which involves initial deployment of Alteryx designer software on a small scale at an organization and later, gradual expansion of the deployments to multiple users in the same organization. As of Q1 FY 20, the company had 6,443 customers which included 731 of the top 2,000 companies globally.Data analytics is increasingly becoming an integral part of the decision making process at organizations, including large enterprises. This growth is fueled by global adoption of the internet in everyday lives, as well as the digital transformation at global organizations. However, data in its raw form isn’t meaningful and needs to be cleaned and processed in order to derive meaningful insights from it which can be used in decision making. Alteryx’s data analytics software (which provides code free as well as code friendly platform to its users) allows companies to do just that. As per Gartner, the data analytics and business intelligence software market segment has grown to over $25 billion. Additionally, Alteryx also targets millions of spreadsheet users worldwide who spend a significant number of hours on developing spreadsheet models and doing repetitive tasks which can be completed in much less time with the use of Alteryx’ self-service software platform. Alteryx values this market opportunity at an additional $24 billion.Source: Alteryx, Inc.Alteryx provides an end-to-end data analytics software platform to its users. It uses a drag and drop user interface and built-in analytical models that even users with no coding knowledge can use to conduct analysis. The data analytics process involves several steps such as data collection, data cleaning, data blending, data analysis, and interpretation of results. While there are several software products available in the market which specialize in parts of the process, Alteryx is a powerful tool that unifies the whole data analysis procedure on a single software platform.Source: Alteryx, IncAlteryx does face competition from large data visualization players such as Tableau (DATA), Power BI (MSFT), and Qlik. While Alteryx is the market leader in self-service data analytics, Tableau enjoys higher market share in self-service data visualization platforms. Tableau also supports lightweight data preparation tool which allows its users to conduct data analysis and generate visualization results. However, the data analytical power of Alteryx is much more robust as compared to visualization platforms such as Tableau. An added advantage of Alteryx’s software is its ability to easily integrate its results with other software platforms. Alteryx’s software output can be directly used in various other specialized visualization tools including Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, and Qlik. Many users of Alteryx’s data analytics software also use Tableau or other visualization tools to better derive results in a visual form. As such, some of the competitors of Alteryx also nicely complement its services in the data analysis value chain.In the advanced and predictive analytics space, Alteryx has several competitors such as SAS advanced analytics, RapidMiner, IBM SPSS Modeler (IBM), along with open-source software packages such as R and python. However, the in-built self-service modules and overall ease of use provide Alteryx an upper hand in terms of customer adoption. In fact, Alteryx was recently named a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning in terms of its ability to execute.Source: Alteryx, Inc., Gartner, IncAlteryx reported revenue of $109 million in Q1 FY 20, which represents a YoY increase of 43%. In fact, the company’s revenue has grown at an impressive CAGR of 67% over the past five years. This strong increase has been the result of both increases in customer count as well as a high net dollar expansion rate which represents additional sales made to existing customers or revenue from upselling of products.The number of customers has grown substantially from 3,392 in 2017 to 6,443 in Q1 FY20. Alteryx added 396 net new customers in Q1 FY20 and ended the quarter with a 30% YoY growth in customer count. Additionally, 731 customers out of the total are amongst the leading 2,000 global organizations. Onboarding of larger organizations provides Alteryx an opportunity to generate more dollars per account.Alteryx generated non-GAAP operating margin of 18% in 2019. This is despite heavy expenditure in R&D to consistently evolve its technology according to customer needs as well as considerable amount being spent on sales & marketing in order to drive penetration. We believe the company can grow non-GAAP operating margin to 30-40% as the company generates leverage on its sales and marketing expenses on a larger revenue base.It is hard to argue that record business closures and unemployment claims of over 40 million are not going to have a near-term impact on the company. Alteryx, being a technology services provider to global business enterprises, is not immune to this global slowdown. Although number crunching is an essential business activity and data analytics has become more important than ever for organizations, we believe that many organizations will significantly curb their operating budgets including IT expenditure at least in near to medium term. This will have a negative impact on customer count growth as well as subscription renewal of existing customers. Please note that although 37% of Alteryx’s customers are large enterprises, the other 73% include small to medium enterprises. The effect of economic slowdown is starting to become evident in the company’s momentum as per recent management commentary.The company estimates YoY revenue growth of 10-15% for Q2 2020 which is significantly below recent trends.Please note that although the data analytics software market segment is not immune to the global economic contraction, it is clear that in the future more data is going to be generated and more analysis will need to be done to make sense of that data. Therefore, the underlying market opportunity is likely to expand as the economy heals from the current downturn.Alteryx’s shares have seen a ""V-shaped recovery"" like most high-quality tech names post the COVID led sell-off. The stock is currently trading at an EV to sales of 21 times versus an average of around mid-teens multiple since its IPO. Given the macro weakness, lackluster business outlook coupled with management’s commentary around recent weakness in business trends, we believe the upside in the very near term may be challenged. Having said that, given the attractive market as well as the quality of the business, we believe over the longer-term investors will be rewarded even at these valuations, and those rewards could continue to arrive sooner than later.Competition: Although Alteryx is the best-positioned self-service data analytics software company in our view, it faces competition from large technology players in certain parts of the analytics value chain. The attractive market opportunity in self-service data analytics may attract interest in the space from large competitors. Having said that, a larger player may also look to enter the space by buying out Alteryx.Prolonged slowdown: A prolonged recession or an L-shaped recovery from pandemic led slowdown may result in considerable declines in customer count growth as well as an increase in customer churn rate in the near to medium term.Alteryx has enjoyed impressive growth in recent years, but the current coronavirus slowdown has some investors concerned. However, in our view, Alteryx’s long-term growth opportunity remains intact, and the opportunity is truly massive. Specifically, Alteryx is a leader in self-service data analytics, it’s well placed to resume its impressive long-term momentum, and for these reasons, we’ve ranked it number 10 on our recently list of top 10 fortune maker stocks (behind our report on DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) at number 9). Alteryx’s long-term secular growth dynamics are very much intact, and this is a stock that could reasonably increase 10x over the next 10 years based on the massive (and rapidly growing) total addressable market."

The sophistication, speed, and ease-of-use that Alteryx's platform provides are enhanced through very intuitive and highly repeatable visual workflows.In layman terms, the company offers a platform where you can utilize data analytics tools to maximize the power of your organization's data assets. In the 21st century, the philosophy 'good data beats opinion' has become crucial in the success of businesses.Nowadays, micro-level data analysis helps business managers to identify the KPIs (key performance indicators) that influence business revenues, profits, and costs; thus, enabling enterprises to make smart data-driven decisions rather than decisions based on opinions.As more companies begin treating data as an enterprise-wide corporate asset, sharing of data about products and customers creates opportunities to up-sell and cross-sell, while improving retention rates and customer service.By combining internal and external data, every company in the world can develop new products and services across lines of business. As a result, the need for data analytics and machine learning tools has never been higher than what it is today.Alteryx is a leading platform in the data analytics and machine learning space, with revenues growing at +65% CAGR over the last three years. Furthermore, the demand for the Alteryx platform is only going to accelerate in the near future, as companies undergo digital transformation and embrace data.Alteryx's APA platform is uniquely differentiated, which is evident in its gross margins of 90%+. The business is run prudently, i.e., even in its high growth phase, Alteryx is already a free cash flow generative venture. As the company matures, the free cash flow margins will improve, and this improvement, coupled with organic growth in the business, will drive Alteryx's free cash flow per share (i.e., share price) higher.In today's article, we will explore Alteryx's business in greater depth, after which we will run it through the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model to ascertain a fair value for the stock and projected returns on a ten-year investment.Now that you have seen Alteryx in action, you know that the platform enables users to perform code-free data analytics. However, I think you would be interested in learning as to why high-tech companies like Atlassian (TEAM), Box, Inc. (BOX), Cisco (CSCO), Amazon (AMZN), Dell (DELL), and many others are Alteryx's clients. The answer is Alteryx's rich data science pipeline for predictive modeling. To put things into context, even Alteryx's supposed competitor Tableau (NYSE:DATA) is also its customer!To further understand what Alteryx entails, let us hear directly from Alteryx CEO Dean Stoecker:In the video, Dean talked about how Alteryx's positioning (in the middle of the stack) in the client organizations makes the product crucial for its customers. Some of you might be wondering, but what does that mean? So, let's try to understand how Alteryx fits into the data analytics realm.Source: Alteryx Investor PresentationThe world is undergoing a digital transformation, and enterprises now have unparalleled access to data across their business units. Data scientists and analysts are working with big data to derive actionable insights that improve business performance. Alteryx provides these data operators with an easy to use, code-free, data analytics platform, where they could create repeatable workflows (automate processes), thus, saving a lot of time for the analysts who could focus on generating actionable insights. Source: Alteryx Investor PresentationThe Alteryx platform has countless use cases including but not limited to Customer Targeting, Sports Analytics, Shipping Optimization, and many others. Alteryx recently launched its APA (Analytic Process Automation) platform. To learn more about it, please look at the video below:Source: What is Analytic Process Automation? | AlteryxSource: Alteryx Investor PresentationAs I mentioned earlier, the Alteryx APA platform makes life easier for data scientists and analysts. The platform accepts inputs from several sources and allows users to merge data from multiple sources. Once the data is available within the platform, the analysts could apply more than 270 in-built analytics or create [code] their own analytics. The rich data science predictive modeling pipeline is making the Alteryx platform popular among the data science community.Source: Alteryx Investor PresentationAccording to Alteryx, its total addressable market is currently valued at $49 billion ($25 billion in IT and $24 billion in Line-of-Business).Source: Alteryx Investor PresentationLet's hear Dean Stoecker (Alteryx CEO) talk about Alteryx's addressable market and the $24 billion (i.e., 47 million Excel Users) opportunity.Dean thinks Alteryx's addressable market is a winner-takes-most opportunity. However, it's obviously unrealistic to assume that Alteryx will capture a 50% to 100% market share, as even with a superior product, limited sales teams will prevent such an outcome. Still, Alteryx's LTM revenue of only $450M means it could grow revenues at 20%+ CAGR for the next ten years.Alteryx's go-to-market strategy entails a 'land and expand' model. The company claims that it offers customers compelling business value by providing significant time savings and comprehensive data analytics that improve business outcomes.Source: Alteryx Investor PresentationThe success of Alteryx's sales strategy is evident from its dollar-based net retention rates. Since its IPO in 2017, Alteryx has consistently logged DBNR rates of more than 128% every quarter, which proves that Alteryx's users are happy with the platform's effect on business outcomes and want more.Source: Alteryx Investor PresentationI mentioned that Alteryx logged +65% CAGR revenue growth over the previous three years. The revenues have been supercharged by high net retention rates combined with rapid (+30% y/y) new customer acquisitions.Source: Alteryx Investor PresentationThe power of the Alteryx APA platform has enabled the company to serve more than 6400 customers across varied industries like Retail, Food Services, Consumer Products, Media, Financial Services, Energy and Utility, Healthcare, Travel and Hospitality, Manufacturing, and Technology. Alteryx finds applications wherever data is present, and data is everywhere!Source: Alteryx Investor PresentationAlteryx is not the only data science and machine learning platform. Its competitors include giants like SAS, Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM), and MathWorks. Still, Alteryx's execution ability is unmatched, which earned the company a place among Gartner's 2020 Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms.At this moment in time, Alteryx is the most complete solution in the market. Even its data prep and visualization rival Tableau has become Alteryx's client. Alteryx is well-positioned to garner a significant market share in the booming data science and machine learning market.Source: Alteryx Investor PresentationGiven the vast addressable market, a technically superior product, and high client satisfaction, I expect Alteryx to grow at an accelerated pace in the near term and become one of the primary beneficiaries of the Data Boom.As can be seen below, Alteryx's revenues have been growing explosively over the last three years. Moreover, gross margins above 90% are extraordinary and show the immense value of Alteryx's offering. Furthermore, the company is already profitable, as illustrated by ~5% operating margins (which the company aims to grow to 35-40% in the long term)Source: YChartsIn the last three years, Alteryx's revenues propelled from a meager $95 million to $450 million (~5x) at 65.57% CAGR. On top of that, gross margins expanded from 81% to 90%+. A gross margin of 90% is glorious (monopolistic) and indicates that Alteryx's platform is differentiated and highly valuable in the data science and machine learning marketplace. Source: YChartsAlteryx has been reinvesting its entire profits back into the business to harness future growth, which is evidenced by the high SG&A (67.23% of revenue) and R&D (18.02% of revenue) expenses. I take this as an energetic show of confidence by the management in Alteryx's platform and business prospects.Source: Alteryx Investor PresentationAlteryx is already operationally profitable on both GAAP and Non-GAAP basis. With scale, the company expects SG&A expense (as % of revenue) to be much lower. As a result, one can expect a boost in the operating margins in the future.Source: YChartsBuying Alteryx on the cheap is every investor's dream. The reason I say that is because Alteryx's extraordinary growth is also profitable, i.e., the company is already free cash flow-generative. While growing at a CAGR of 65% each year since going public, Alteryx has simultaneously managed to churn out positive free cash flow.Alteryx has a strong balance sheet with enough cash to pay off its entire financial debt. In the short term, Alteryx's current ratio of 4+ indicates that the company has no immediate liquidity concerns. Hence, investors do not need to worry about dilution. As the company matures over the next few years, I expect Alteryx's balance sheet to become a fortress due to the underlying strength of its business.To answer this question, we will employ our proprietary valuation model. Here’s what it entails:Now, let's check out the results!Assumptions:Using the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model, I determined that, conservatively speaking, Alteryx's fair value is $125.35, i.e., the stock is currently overvalued by 19.67%.Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelNow, keep in mind that Alteryx grew at 43% y/y in Q1 2020. And it's projected to grow at 27%+ over the next three years, as you can see below:Source: YChartsSo, this growth rate provides us our ""margin of safety,"" by which we can be very, very wrong, and still be right! Now, many analysts would stop looking at Alteryx after a DCF valuation, deeming it too expensive, but we go a little bit further.So, let's check out the returns one could generate if they were to buy at $150. The gains below are predicated on the growth of free cash flow per share. Our proprietary model calculates future free cash flow based on the assumptions provided above; then, I apply an assumed price to free cash flow per share (in the year 2030). Here's the result:Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelHence, I recommend investors to buy Alteryx for their long-term growth portfolios at the current price of $150 and add on any significant dips.Data in the 21st century is similar to oil in the 18th century: an immensely untapped valuable asset. Just like oil, there will be huge rewards for those who understand data's fundamental value and learn to extract and use it. Alteryx allows users (even ones with no technical acumen) to perform advanced data analytics through a code-free platform. The data science and machine learning boom is creating a vast market opportunity for Alteryx, and the company is well-positioned to make the most of it.The APA platform is genuinely at the epicenter of the future of data analytics. Alteryx is not the only player in town, but its platform is truly revolutionary, and I believe Alteryx is set to dominate its market over the next ten years. Even though the stock is trading above its intrinsic value, the expected returns of ~14% CAGR on a long-term investment make Alteryx a strong buy.Key Takeaway: I rate Alteryx a buy at $150 and below.As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow, and happy investing!"

In a previous post, I spoke how it was being clumped together with other companies based on its revenue growth and profile, and that there was room for multiple expansion. Over the past month, we have seen that and now the business is trading closer to fair value.Market tailwinds, channel checks, and a financial analysis lead me to continue to be long Alteryx. I will outline these reasons below.Source: AlteryxAlteryx is a leading player in the business intelligence and analytics field. There is a major industry shift occurring today with the explosion and structuring of business data that allows companies to make more informed decisions. However, many companies cannot afford a team of PhDs to analyze this new data. Alteryx fills that gap by allowing business users and technical staff to both analyze data.Here is a breakdown of the data ecosystem and the modern data stack:As an industry, Alteryx plays in the data science and machine learning space with many legacy vendors like SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and IBM (NYSE:IBM). It is capturing market share from these vendors which are mostly on-premise. It is important to note that a significant portion of Alteryx is also on-premise, likely due to customer demand.When asked about where Alteryx fits versus players like Snowflake, Couchbase, ThoughtSpot, and others, I can refer to this market map which outlines four key areas within the business intelligence universe. You can see that there are several well-funded venture companies in each of these market segments.These are large and growing markets, and you can see that DSML itself is not as crowded as some of the other verticals.Alteryx's vision is to build data automation, as per their recent product announcement in May 2020. I believe this product vision will guide them for the next 3-5 years in the right direction. It combines elements across analytics, data science, and automation to bring insights to companies with the data they already have.When I think about the market opportunity, it is growing. Alteryx has started with a focus on large organizations, and I do not believe it has to move downstream in the near future. Their target users are knowledge workers who often have to rely on spreadsheets today to manipulate data.Alteryx is also a very flexible platform with different use cases. As a platform play, it can reach across industries and problem types. Here are a few examples of those, pulled from Indeed job postings.A few sell-side analysts came out with very encouraging channel checks from May 2020. First, many concurred with my analysis of the product roadmap as a clear vision for the company. Second, they conducted a series of job checks to see the growth of the knowledge workers outlined above. That data came out very strong, as companies look inside with the extra time COVID-19 has given them.I have been long Alteryx for some time, and the stock does move up and down dramatically at times. Given its lack of consistent profitability, the only measures investors are often focused on are revenue and revenue growth. The comparable universe is based on a financial profile, but many pure-play competitors are not public or are at a different scale.In any case, my valuation analysis, based on their filings, shows the company as near value today. I would wait for a market pullback to add. For long-term investors, it is a good time to start a position.Source: Company materials"
4367067,103480,2020-08-10T11:21:14-04:00,"Shares of Alteryx crashed nearly 30% after the company reported Q2 results.Revenue growth cratered to just 17% y/y in the quarter (from 43% y/y in Q1), and the company is guiding to 7-11% y/y growth in Q3.The coronavirus has impacted Alteryx heavily as IT departments de-prioritize backend infrastructure work.Alteryx's valuation multiple and share price will continue to adjust downward to reflect this new low-growth reality.","The world has turned upside down for Alteryx (AYX), a big data preparation software company that helps businesses blend together data from different streams into a single platform ready for analysis. Once one of the fastest-growing companies in the software sector with revenues nearly doubling year-over-year each quarter, and thematically aligned to one of the hottest trends in computing (big data), Alteryx was a longtime Wall Street favorite from the time of its IPO in 2017 at just $14 per share - until now.At one point this year, shares of Alteryx had risen more than 70% as investors still looked to Alteryx's rich margins and middling (though no longer fantastic) growth rates as a sign of its durability. After reporting Q2 results, however, Alteryx suffered its largest one-day drop in history, falling nearly 30% (and its second sequential post-earnings dip):Data by YChartsThe latest quarter's performance - and most jarring of all, its outlook and commentary for the coming quarters - puts Alteryx solidly in the penalty box. This is a company that was once posting accelerating revenues despite an already-blistering growth pace - but now, the coronavirus has caused IT departments to reshuffle priorities to support remote work, while ambitious (and expensive) infrastructure products like Alteryx are put on pause. Management's outlook for the rest of the year is bleak, and sounds off a very cautious tone relative to many other software companies who have reported that revenue growth and billings growth had begun to normalize by the end of June.Most frightening of all is that Alteryx's guidance for the third quarter calls just just 7-11% y/y growth - a stark fall from grace for a company that was as recently as last year growing north of 70% y/y:Figure 1. Alteryx guidance updateSource: Alteryx Q2 earnings releaseWall Street, meanwhile, was already bracing for a slowdown but consensus was still hoping for $119.3 million in revenue, or +15% y/y. We note that this abrupt reversal in Alteryx's growth trajectory is bleeding over into a multiples re-rating. At its peaks, Alteryx had traded at north of 20x forward revenues. Now, as investors digest a low-teens growth rate for the undetermined future, that multiple is collapsing. At present post-earnings share prices of $121, Alteryx's market cap is $8.01 billion, and after we net off the $974.4 million of cash and $714.0 million of debt on its balance sheet, its enterprise value is $7.75 billion.That stacks up against Wall Street's FY21 revenue consensus of $660.1 million (+31% y/y), which essentially banks on a 2021 recovery from depressed coronavirus sales. That puts Alteryx's revenue multiple at 11.7x EV/FY21 revenues, one of the cheapest multiples Alteryx has traded at in years. But considering both of these factors:Now of course, I don't believe that Alteryx's valuation will get cut as deeply as to move back to the mid single-digits. Its combination of extremely high gross margins (>90%, among the highest in the sector) and best-in-breed reputation among data prep vendors will help Alteryx vault back to recovery. But as I noted last quarter as well, it will take time for Alteryx to regain its fundamental footing, and its share price likewise is highly likely to move sideways for the time being. As such, there's no need to immediately rush and buy the dip.Let's now dive into Alteryx's worst-ever quarterly performance in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 2. Alteryx Q2 resultsSource: Alteryx Q2 earnings releaseAlteryx's revenue grew only 17% y/y to $96.2 million. At face value, that did beat Wall Street's expectations of $94.1 million (+15% y/y) by a slight margin - but investors were more focused on the fact that revenue growth completely slumped relative to 43% y/y in Q1 (and even more starkly down versus Q4's growth rate of 75% y/y).Part of Alteryx's problem is that while the company does build up ARR, it primarily relies on (very expensive) license sales that aren't entirely flexible to consume. In other words, it's not SaaS. And the company's flagship Alteryx Designer starts at a steep $5,195 per year - per user. It's not surprising that when businesses are cutting back on expenses that they'd balk at installing Alteryx for this price.Figure 3. Alteryx Designer pricingSource: Alteryx.comAnd in Q2, Alteryx added only 271 net-new enterprise customers to its base, versus 356 adds in Q1 and 464 adds in Q4. Moreover, of the customers that Alteryx is adding, its ""land and expand"" model is sputtering, with net-retention trends slipping to 126% - indicating fewer upsells and seat expansions within Alteryx's customer base.Figure 4. Alteryx net retention trendsSource: Alteryx Q2 earnings releaseHere's some helpful commentary from CEO Dean Stoecker's prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call that helps to clarify the demand environment that Alteryx is seeing:The key in the comments above is that Alteryx does not expect a return to normalization by the end of the year, which is inconsistent with what most other software companies are saying and points to company-specific issues.Alteryx's revenue weakness also fed into profitability declines as well. While Alteryx's pro forma gross margins remained sky high and flat at 91%, pro forma operating margins in the quarter slipped one point, while in the first six months of the fiscal year margins have slipped three points to -2%.Figure 4. Alteryx profitability trendsSource: Alteryx Q2 earnings releaseCash flow, too, is tracking well behind the prior year. Free cash flow in the first six months of the year is -$3.8 million, versus positive $3.1 million in the year-ago period. While this isn't a huge reversal in dollar terms, it is a stark change of appearances for a company that used to be able to pull off the miracle of showing blazing growth plus margin and cash flow expansion at the same time. Now, Alteryx has neither.Companies like Alteryx that rely on expensive license sales are likely to see much more lumpy revenues than pure SaaS, and with management's cautious commentary on the possibility of a recovery, investors shouldn't get too excited either. While Alteryx remains a critical technology and a well-run company in the long run, I think the correction has further to go in the near term."
4348496,104952,2020-05-18T12:25:00-04:00,The launching of the unified APA platform solidifies Alteryx's market pioneering and leadership status in the market.We remain bullish on the stock despite the near-term slowdown in Q2.Alteryx has exceptional growth and profitability due to its strong moat in the enterprise segment.The business has a strong pricing power. Q1 customers still grew 30% YoY despite the recent increase in pricing.,"Our long-term thesis on Alteryx (AYX) is intact despite the potential near-term slowdown in Q2, where the company provides lower revenue guidance than the expectation. The overall business remains rock solid as revenue grew by 43% YoY in Q1. Having never announced its ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) since Q2 2018, the company also disclosed that it reached another milestone as it achieved a $400 million of ARR in Q1, twice as much as that of Q2 2018. The company’s announcement to launch a unified APA (Analytic Process Automation) platform in recent times has also solidified its status as a pioneer in the APA industry.In recent times, data analysis has become a giant trend where we see growing demand in each part of the ecosystem, ranging from preparation, analytics, automation, BI, and data science. Considering that Alteryx is tapping into all these segments, the long-term catalyst on the stock is very clear.(source: Q1 earnings call slide)Alteryx’s disruptive enterprise-grade data analytics offering has allowed it to pioneer the APA market. In that sense, it is done in a similar manner to which Uber (UBER), Salesforce (CRM), and ServiceNow (NOW) pioneered the ride-sharing, CRM, and ITSM automation markets. The fact that it is a market pioneer and a leader at the same time will put it in the best position to get the most out of the massive ~$40.6 billion TAM opportunity.(source: Q1 earnings call slide)It also already has both a disruptive track record and enough scale to do so. Revenue has grown over 10x to ~$417 million in only five years, while the business already turned profitable in the last two. The pricing power, which eventually is a result of the moat’s strength, is also there. Even before the price of the Alteryx Server offering was raised by ~35% in Q1, it already was an expensive tool. Alteryx’s offerings are priced between +$5,000 per user/year and +78,000/year, and there is even a more expensive version of the product not listed on the marketing page. Yet, the number of users has more than doubled in just over two years, wherein over 10% of them belong to the Global 2000. As a result, the already excellent +90% gross margin even has expanded a little bit within the same period.Furthermore, what Alteryx is doing to fill in every gap in its ecosystem is in line with what we believe a market pioneer should be doing. It solves the industry problem with not only software but also people. Recently, it launched a program to provide free data analytics training and certification, ADAPT. This is a strategic move, given the increasingly strong demand for data workers in recent times. Likewise, we have also seen strong demand from students and tech workers to gain new skills across data science, analytics, AI, machine learning, and automation. As a result, Alteryx can potentially leverage ADAPT to make its tool the de-facto industry standard while gaining new promoters for the product.The lower-than-expected $95 million in revenue guidance for the Q2 means that the company shall expect a slowdown in terms of landing new customers. While the Q1 churn rates in Europe increased due to the impact of COVID-19, it remains uncertain if the expected slowdown in Q2 will be COVID-19 related as well. As expected, industries such as travel and hospitality and SMBs are severely impacted by COVID-19. Though only 6% of the ARR is driven by SMBs, much-impacted industries still make up 25% of ARR.We have a bullish long-term view on Alteryx. Since our first coverage in Q4 last year, the stock has appreciated by ~17% to-date, though currently down ~18% from the YTD-high in mid-February. On the side note, the stock has also been quite volatile in recent times.(source: Seeking Alpha)Alteryx’s exceptional growth and scale, which reflect its market pioneering, has put it in the same bracket as The Trade Desk (TTD) and ServiceNow in terms of valuation. Both companies have become giants in their respective industries, though still consistently maintaining +30% growth.(NOW vs. TTD vs. AYX vs. ZEN. Source: Stockrow)Along with Alteryx, they all trade at ~19x P/S. The valuation seems fair, given that another category leader Zendesk (ZEN), which is of similar size to Alteryx, is punished with a P/S of ~9.7x as it has a slower growth rate. Zendesk’s customer experience market is also a competitive industry where we sometimes see some overlaps even among players outside the core industry, such as ServiceNow. Given the lower expectation for the year due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Alteryx can also use the opportunity to deliver some earnings surprises, which historically has correlated very strongly with its P/S. Throughout 2019 where Alteryx beat all of its guidance, P/S was on a sharp upward trend. It even consistently maintained an over 25x P/S in the second half of 2019. This is why at ~19x P/S, there is an upside opportunity in the near-term despite the potential slowdown, though our thesis mostly concerns the long-term prospects of the stock."

(AYX) is a market leader in analytics, data science, and process automation, three pillars of digital transformation that are seeing signs of maturation and bumping elbows as vendors start to expand into adjacent niches.Alteryx has a vision of being the front-runner of a market category that it calls Analytic Process Automation (APA). (Source: Alteryx)I'm not sure whether Alteryx has created a new market platform or this is simply a marketing ploy. From what I have been able to tell, this announcement has not spawned any revolutionary technology but simply expresses where the company is in terms of product offering.But in any case, I am impressed with Alteryx's strong revenue growth of 60+% that it has maintained over the years. Between the revenue growth, positive cash flow, and $760 million in cash and equivalents, Alteryx should survive the pandemic and recession quite nicely.(Source: Portfolio123)I should note that Alteryx management has withdrawn guidance for FY 2020 and provided very conservative guidance for the next quarter with YoY revenue growth of 10%-15%. I am not going to read too much into the low level of guidance as management got burned on Q1 earnings with a miss on analysts' estimates, something that is not well-tolerated by investors in SaaS companies.It is impossible to predict how Alteryx will perform for the remainder of 2020, but the company has a strong balance sheet, steady free cash flow, and exceptional revenue growth prior to the pandemic. Alteryx should be in good shape once the pandemic scare subsides and global growth restarts. Given the stock's reasonable valuation, I am maintaining my very bullish rating for Alteryx. This company is one of my favorites.The Rule Of 40One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The rule provides a single metric for evaluating both high-growth companies that aren't profitable and mature companies that have lower growth but are profitable. Revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) must add up to at least 40% in order to fulfill the rule. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can tolerate some level of negative free cash flow. But if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth. This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so ones.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to a previous article I have written.The two factors required for calculating the Rule of 40 are revenue growth and free cash flow margin. Alteryx's annual revenue growth is 61%. The company's TTM free cash flow margin is a steady 5%.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)I would like to make a point here. Every time I write an article on Alteryx, a commenter complains that I am not accounting for the effects of ASC 606 in the calculation of revenue growth. Accounting for the ASC 606 effect, revenue growth would be lower than I claim.Instead of waiting for the comment to show up this time around, I am going to address the issue head-on by bringing to the reader's attention to the Alteryx 2019 Q4 earnings call presentation. The snippet below is from this presentation.(Source: Alteryx)The financials for both 2018 and 2019 are provided according to ASC 606 accounting rules. The change in revenue from 2018 to 2019 was 100 * (417,900 / 253,700 -1) = 65%.While the switch to ASC 606 may have affected the revenue accounting in previous years, this is no longer an issue. Therefore, I will use the 61% revenue growth provided in the Portfolio123 database.The Rule of 40 calculation for Alteryx is as follows:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 61% + 5% = 66%The score is much higher than the necessary 40% needed to fulfill the rule of thumb, suggesting that Alteryx is strong and healthy, ideal for survival in the current market conditions.Stock ValuationThere are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher-growth stocks are valued more than lower-growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 150+ stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward sales, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how Alteryx stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward sales multiple.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the valuation. In this instance, Alteryx is positioned above the best-fit line, suggesting that the company is modestly overvalued on a relative basis relative to its peers.Another perspective is to use the estimated forward profit multiple instead of using the forward sales multiple for the Y-Axis of the scatter plot. When I make this adjustment Alteryx sits on top of the best-fit line, giving this company a fair valuation.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)I have highlighted several other ""Big Data"" stocks. You can see that Big Data is not in high demand at present. Cloudera (CLDR), Talend (TLND), New Relic (NEWR), Splunk (SPLK), and Elastic (ESTC) are all undervalued according to my relative valuation technique. Only MongoDB (MDB) is overvalued and in fact is quite overvalued.Investment RisksThere are several risks that investors should consider before investing in Alteryx. First of all, I view the current stock market action to be reminiscent of the Dot.com era, immediately prior to the crash starting in 2000. Back then, I quadrupled my investments in a few months. Technology stocks were hopping. But it wasn't long before the market turned into a disaster.While Alteryx is not overvalued some of its software peers are. Companies such as Zoom (ZM), Shopify (SHOP), Atlassian (TEAM), and Coupa (COUP), are extremely overvalued. A market crash led by these software stocks could cause Alteryx to get swept along with the crowd.The biggest risk to Alteryx's business is if customers are unable to continue making payments according to subscription schedules. 25% of Alteryx's customers are in sectors most affected by the pandemic.Summary and ConclusionsAlteryx is a Big Data company offering end-to-end data analytics starting with raw data into actionable insights. The company management would like to believe it is inventing a new platform called APA along the lines of customer relationship management (CRM), IT service management (ITSM), and human capital management (HCM). This may or may not be the case. It is too soon to make any kind of judgment. But I do know that Alteryx is putting up some very strong revenue growth figures, above 60% growth, a feat that few companies achieve for any length of time.Given that the company's fundamentals are strong, and, in my opinion, the stock price is fairly valued, I expect that Alteryx will emerge from the pandemic in terrific shape and continue to perform well thereafter. The stock price hasn't kept up with other digital transformation stocks, many of which are breaking out to all-time highs. I expect that Alteryx stock will soon follow suit in a very bullish manner. For these reasons, I am giving Alteryx a very bullish rating.And now I would like to leave readers with a quote from the 2020 Q1 Alteryx earnings call regarding the paradigm shift due involving digital transformation:"
4368310,35181,2020-08-13T09:54:40-04:00,"Alteryx beat on actuals but provided weak guidance according to analysts. The fact that they provided guidance at all for 2020 is a tribute to this exceptional company.The dollar-based net expansion rate of 126% and YoY ARR growth of 40% are impressive for this difficult economic environment.After the recent share price drop, Alteryx is now fairly valued relative to its software peers.With cash and cash equivalents of nearly $1 billion, the company will most certainly come out of the pandemic and recession in excellent shape.","Alteryx, Inc. (AYX) stock has been in a free fall since announcing Q2 results last Friday. It was not so much the company's performance that shook the investment community, after all, it did beat on both revenue and earnings. The poor reaction was more a case of the company management's future guidance, tales of poor sales execution, elongated sales cycles, and flat bookings, that shook analysts. The stock dropped from ~$180 down to ~$108 in a few days since the earnings call.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)While the drop in Alteryx stock price is alarming, it is not without precedence. This company has survived other significant price drops, such as back in February-March of this year when the pandemic started and also in September 2019. Each time, the stock has recovered and reached a new high. I expect that Alteryx stock will recover again. It is a strong company and a leader in data analytics, an important factor in digital transformation. This company will bounce back, and I believe that savvy investors would be smart to take advantage of the price drop to load up.It is really a case of the glass being half full versus half empty. Sure, analysts were expecting more from the company than the forward guidance of 11% YoY revenue growth for 2020 given that Alteryx has grown by 61% annually over the last 5 years. But let's keep in mind that Alteryx is actually guiding for revenue growth in this exceedingly difficult economic environment whereas most other companies have withdrawn guidance completely. I view any revenue growth as positive, especially when it comes to the management of a SaaS company which is known to be very conservative with guidance numbers.Alteryx did admit to having sales execution issues, primarily due to new hires that arrived prior to the pandemic. These hires had difficulty coming up to speed with training in the work-from-home environment. This situation is recognized and will no doubt be corrected over time. Alteryx also noted that sales cycles have elongated, a reflection of the difficult environment that its customers face.The company noted that bookings were flat YoY. I expect that this phenomenon is a result of the significant increase in adoption agreements instead of extended sales contracts. An adoption agreement is a vehicle that allows customers to be onboarded for a period of six months typically, allowing the customer time to evaluate the product and decide whether or not to commit to the product long term. This is a smart way of conducting business in the current economic environment and Alteryx has stated that the adoption agreement tends to lead to a better outcome than contract renewals.So, in my opinion, the glass is half full. Alteryx had an incredibly good quarter considering the pandemic and economic realities. The annual recurring revenue grew by 40% YoY and the dollar-based net expansion was 126%, not too shabby in an environment where GDP shrunk by 35% (annualized).In my estimation, the stock price is undervalued to fairly valued relative to its software peers (see below). In addition, Alteryx has almost $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents that will most likely be sufficient to carry the company through the pandemic and global recession. This makes for an excellent investment opportunity.The plot below illustrates how Alteryx stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward EV/Sales versus forward revenue growth. Note: Please refer to a recent article for more information on the scatter plot relative valuation technique.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)Alteryx is situated on the best-fit line on the scatter plot, suggesting that the stock is fairly valued on a relative basis relative to its peers.A better valuation technique may be to look at the EV/Gross Profit estimate, substituting this figure for EV/Sales estimate in the above scatter plot. With an exceptional gross profit margin of 91%, Alteryx appears to actually be somewhat undervalued based on forward gross profits as opposed to forward sales.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)It seems unlikely that we will see a vaccine until at least the spring of 2021 and that depends on everything going well in Phase 3 trials for vaccine candidates. I am ignoring the apparent release/approval of the Russian vaccine as I don't believe that it will be accepted by the western world. It will be at least a year (in my opinion) before we see a return to some kind of normalcy.While we wait, the government and the Federal Reserve are being generous with handouts and stimulus. But, how long will this last? The handouts are a heavy burden for taxpayers, and I can't see such handouts persisting for much longer, certainly not past the November election. When the handouts stop, I expect that the stock market may become very bearish.We are in the midst of a recession, if not a depression. Government employment statistics do not really capture the true extent of the state of the economy. Alteryx's future performance along with most other stocks depends on economic recovery.It is possible that Alteryx could be upstaged by other data analytics companies in the future. This field is certainly very competitive.Alteryx is a leader in digital transformation and data analytics with more than 60% annual revenue growth over the last 5 years. Revenue guidance for 2020 issued by company management is for 11% YoY growth. This has been interpreted poorly by analysts that have been expecting better numbers. But keep in mind that Alteryx is actually providing guidance whereas most companies have withdrawn guidance completely. YoY growth of 11% is not too shabby in this difficult economic environment. I expect that growth will rebound once we emerge from the pandemic, hopefully within the next year.Investors should really be focusing on the positive aspects of the company, such as the very good dollar-based-expansion of 126%, 140% growth in annual ARR, and almost $1 billion in cash reserves. We don't know when the pandemic will subside, and we don't know how the recession will play out, although it is very likely that it will be long and deep. Alteryx has a strong balance sheet and the likelihood of strong revenue growth post-pandemic makes it an ideal investment opportunity given the backdrop of high bearish sentiment. I believe that Alteryx stock is fairly valued on a relative basis and investors should not miss out on this rare opportunity to invest in Alteryx at a depressed stock price."

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.From time to time I keep reading about how ignorant retail investors are, or just how overvalued the market has become, or how no one pays example to historical precedent in valuing shares. One assumes that much that has been written in that vein, is composed by disgruntled portfolio managers who have been flat-footed by the rally and need a forum to explain how their strategy of avoiding equities will eventually prove out. It is self-evident by now, that the QE component of the Fed strategy has lead to an inflation in asset prices. That was the intention, and this is the effect. And the extreme and continuing fiscal stimulus has prevented the kind of implosion in personal income that might ordinarily be associated with the current economic conditions. The fact is that between the $1200 stimulus payment, and the supplemental unemployment insurance and the payroll protection program, most of the economically vulnerable individuals have been able to achieve some level of income maintenance - perhaps not all individuals and not at 100% replacement - but there is plenty of double dipping going on as well, albeit at the cost of massive deficits. Investors are simply responding to the various facts as they exist, and not trying to pass judgments based on the standards of prior economic dislocations.The fact is that this pandemic and the associated economic impacts are like nothing heretofore seen amongst living investors. The last pandemic that upended the US economy ended sometime in early 1919-and its economic profile was nothing at all like this one. Resemblances between the economy today and that of the economy in 2008-9 during the great financial crisis, or in the tech bubble of 2000-1 just do not bear close scrutiny. And that is why evaluating quarterly results and company guidance can be a fraught undertaking, knowing that the economy was closing in most of March and that businesses really have little in the way of analogs to guide their forecast. And that leads us to Alteryx, one of the better investment in the IT space, whose shares have pulled back based on what I consider to be a substantial mis-reading of projections and a mis-focus on the indeterminable.This is an article about Alteryx and its just reported quarter and not on economic macros and stock market valuation. But these days, it is impossible to separate the macros from stock recommendations and it is necessary to put results in context. By many standards, Alteryx had a very strong Q1 - but it would have been far stronger had the economy not imploded at the end of the quarter Alteryx (AYX) is sitting athwart one of the major trends in the economy, that of using analytics to enhance enterprise efficiency, flexibility and competitiveness. It is also sitting athwart an IT trend toward self-service in that its solutions can be used by the so-called citizen data scientist community as there is little code that a user must know to solve problems using the Alteryx tool. The ROI that most users obtain from Alteryx projects and Alteryx deployments is very high. It has proven to be high enough that recently, Alteryx raised prices on its designer edition without any serious impact in terms of demand. I have linked here to a current review of Alteryx pricing.Like many IT vendors, Alteryx saw a noticeable perturbation in its selling activity with the “shelter-in-place” orders from around the world in the last couple of weeks of March. The company was in a position to modify its selling motion and to continue virtual activities with clients. It continued to close deals at the end of the last quarter, including one 7 figure transaction it mentioned on its conference call that required 16 signatures from individuals in different locations.Alteryx, while a pure subscription company is not what some people define as a pure SaaS company. Because of the application of ASC-606 on revenue recognition for Alteryx, the company has presented what many would view as a highly ""prudent"" forecast. ASC-606 is not new, and normally is something to avoid writing about at all costs. But it might explain why Alteryx presented the guidance it did, to the initial detriment of share valuation.All of Alteryx sales are based on subscription pricing, but not all of its revenues come from ratable arrangements. With the advent of ASC 606, about 35%-40% of the revenues from a specific booking are recognized up-front. There is some differentiation between products; the company’s server product sees more up front revenues recognition.Specifically what that means is that while around 65% of Alteryx revenues come from the balance sheet and is completely visible in advance, and another 15% of revenues come from highly visible consulting arrangements, the company gets about 20% of its revenues as reported, from business it books in a particular quarter.How much business will Alteryx book this quarter? It is not something that is easily determinable in advance and this company took the path of extreme prudence. The fact is that not all the models in the world are capable of dealing with the kind of inputs from conditions that have no prior analogs. None! That said, there are reasons to think the company was using exceptionally prudent assumptions in establishing a 10%-15% growth forecast for Q2.Given the level of dollar based expansion (""DBE"") at 128% last quarter, and 140% for enterprise customers, the strong growth in ACV to a level greater than $400 million (the company’s forecast) implies rather substantial sequential contraction in revenues from $108 to $96 million, on its face seems a bit unreasonable. For that to happen, in-period bookings would have to decline by something like 40% or more.As it happens, April was a strong month for Alteryx. Yes, a strong month! The company during the course of the conference call indicated that it closed an equivalent number of transactions in April compared to 2019. And based on further answers during the conference call, I think the ACV closed in April was roughly equivalent to that closed in 2019.For most enterprise software companies, the first month of the quarter typically sees the lowest volume of business in the quarter-in the case of Alteryx, typically 20% of bookings come in April, 30% come in May and 50% come in June. So, success in April is not a dispositive indicator of how the quarter might turn out. At this point, and in this environment, there is simply no way to know if this company will close a significant number of large deals at the end of the quarter.That said, however, readers/investors should realize that this company, like some others, does not use guidance as a forecast, but as a marker for a minimum expectation. This is not the first time the company has forecast a sequential decline between Q1 and Q2-that happened in 2018 - and of course the results showed a 10% increase in revenues. Last year sequential revenues jumped 8% from Q1 to Q2. The company also indicated that in April, 35% of its business was coming from the most economically stressed verticals. Why? The most stressed companies are the ones that need to run the most alternative scenarios. They need to solve for pricing, they need to solve for cash conservation, they need to solve for many other contingencies and upsets that have upended their projections and will continue to do so until the worst of this crisis is mitigated.The CEO of this company, Dean Stocker, is considered by many as a bit messianic when it comes to analytics and the value that analytics brings to an enterprise. Given that he has been running Alteryx for 23 years now, that is hardly surprising. But given the use cases depicted on Wednesday’s call, and simply intuition, it would be hard to dispute the notion that in this environment, the impetus for digital transformation - and in this case that means using analytics broadly-has never been stronger.Obviously the countervailing trend is that some potential users simply can’t afford any capex at this point, while others users have re prioritized spending to revenue generating activity. The issue of layoffs cuts two ways. On the one hand, a company like this derives revenue from seat licenses; on the other hand, most organizations need more answers and have fewer headcount to get those answers - the automation wrought by analytics is a quick and fairly low cost way to bridge that gap. Alteryx has been a very successful company, to be sure; but even in the enterprises it has deeply penetrated, it simply does not have anything close to 100% of potential seats. I think the argument regarding unemployment feeding into diminished revenues for Alteryx is a non-starter.I have owned and recommended Alteryx shares for a long time now. Alteryx is, has been and is likely to remain the leading vendor in what is called the self-service analytics space. Analytics is a key component of digital transformation. Most enterprises are well aware by now, that digital transformation has to happen; not to transform is to insure putting an enterprise at a significant competitive/operational disadvantage. The company’s platform is used to aggregate and cleanse data. In that regard, there are many alternatives. But the platform is used by both professional and citizen data scientists who need to provide the companies at which they work with alternatives/answers. If an enterprise doesn’t use analytics as a baseline in terms of developing plans and alternatives, it will perform less well on most financial metrics. A crisis of this magnitude finds businesses scrambling to optimize their operations, and analytics is the technology that provides the answers to do so.The shares first entered the high-growth sample portfolio of Ticker Target, my investment blog as long ago as late August 2017, when the shares were $18. I have kept a substantial position in the name for the last several years, and it represented a 14% weighting in my portfolio as of 5/1. Needless to say, the after-hours pull-back in the shares of more than 10% was not pleasant reading for me or my subscribers. Of course the subsequent turn-around was lots more fund to watch.But after evaluating the specifics of the quarter, the data presented on the conference call, and the guidance provided by management, as well as the discussion I have had with the CFO, Kevin Rubin about his view of the future, I come away with the feeling that the opportunity now is stronger than ever and that the attainment in Q1 has been significantly underappreciated and under reported. The probability of a substantial beat in Q2 has to be rated as considerable, if not more than that.As it happens, Alteryx achieved strong growth in Q1 - actually noticeably stronger than the published headlines of 43% growth in revenues. Calculated billings, which includes a comparison that includes the net change in deferred revenues rose by 53%. And calculated bookings, which includes the net change in deferred revenue and the net change in remaining performance obligation rose by 66%. I don’t want to suggest that those kinds of growth rates should be used as a point of projection-but certainly they suggest that the growth pattern of this company is significantly greater than the levels expected by many writers, both on SA and amongst brokerage analysts. I might say as well, that while the company doesn’t forecast either billings or bookings, the attainment in Q1 was dramatically greater than consensus expectations. And so far as it goes, this kind of performance carried on the results seen in Q4. Alteryx, while still a small company is becoming or has become the de-facto standard in its space. There is a substantial reason for that; historically, the company’s principle competitor has been SAS Institute, an old-line company that is private. SAS is owned by a single family and it is run to maximize profits and cash flow, and not growth. This has provided Alteryx with a huge trove of low hanging fruit. And it has also provided Alteryx with a price umbrella. Readers might be interested in some 3rd party reviews of the competition on Quora. I will leave it to those interested to follow the link which is one reason that Alteryx is, and will be exceptionally successful. Is Alteryx better than SAS?The brief comments on Quora are really worth reading if an investor wants to understand why Alteryx is so successful and likely to continue to outgrow its space by a substantial amount.Overall, the company’s RPO balance grew by 87% over the last year, and that is actually a greater percentage increase than the 82.5% growth seen in Q4 2019. The company acquired 356 new customers in the quarter, and that was up from 305 net new customers acquired in the prior year. In the new customer cohort, the company acquired 12 G2K nameplates. Overall, the company reached a milestone with $400 million of current ARR. I believe that these metrics alone might suggest the underlying strength of this company’s business and demand for its solution set.Some companies these days are trying to focus investors on how they are not exposed to the sickest verticals in the economy. In that regard, Alteryx has computed that about 25% of its ARR comes from those verticals such as travel, hospitality, retail and manufacturing most affected by the economic contraction. Only 6% of ARR is coming from SMB’s within the most impacted verticals. The company has seen a modest increase in churn-some of the SMB’s in the impacted verticals have presumably closed. But churn is a bit misleading - it is typical for Alteryx to sell some one-two seat deals on the phone. Most of the time these deals expand rapidly since the utility of the product for most knowledge workers is self-evident. But when a particular client don’t expand, churn is possible although the revenue impact is trivial. Churn was a bit higher than average in March and that continued into April without any serious impact on revenue generationFrom my own perspective, while it is important to note that the company isn’t overly exposed to demand flowing from the most impacted segments of the economy, the case to own Alteryx shares is not particularly based on any specific vertical, or on the specifics of guidance for Q2. The case to own the shares relates to the strong position the company has within its market space, the rapid growth of the space and the ability the company has shown to pivot its selling motion. And while the CEO of this company has almost a quasi-religious belief in the ability of citizen based analytics to change the world for the better, the fact really is that in an incredibly fluid situation the specifics of Q2 performance, and in particular, the specifics of Q2 performance on the part of certain verticals, is not really something that I would use as part of a valuation analysis.The fact that April results in terms of major revenue related metrics are tracking at levels similar to those of a year ago is important to note, as that result, if continued through the quarter, would place results well above the specific guidance that management provided. But my recommendation to buy the shares at this valuation and at this time is because I believe the company’s operational performance will excel in the recovery, rather than be less bad in a downturn. Users need the capabilities offered by advanced analytics, and they need them more urgently now then when the economy was somewhat predictable.The company stepped up opex spending substantially in Q1. Some of the increased spending was related to factors associated with remediating the effects of the virus on the company’s business. For example, the company had to cancel its two largest sales events because of the health impacts of the virus. But the company stepped up its research and development spending at what I might describe as a dramatic rate. GAAP research and development spend rose 85% year over year, while sales and marketing, including one time expenses of $6 million, rose by 69%, or by 53% excluding one-time spending. The sequential growth in research and development spend reached 25%. The company has many far reaching product launches scheduled this year which I will not try to describe in this article. The strategy is to widen the gap between Alteryx, SAS Institute and rest of the field. The kind of spending seen here is likely to have a direct and noticeable impact on market share, setting the stage for a very strong recovery in revenue growth beyond current forecasts when the economy stabilizes and starts to recover. One of the reasons to buy Alteryx shares is that its market share gains, even in the context of a rapidly growing space, remain underappreciated.Are Alteryx shares expensive? The issue one has with valuation in the time of the virus is simply that it is impossible to forecast revenues for a particular period with any hope that the forecast is more than an informed guess. The company has properly withdrawn guidance for the balance of the year after Q2 because it lacks enough inputs to develop any kind of realistic forecast. Prior to the upside down economics currently affecting businesses, I had used a forward revenue expectation of about $620 million for 2020, which would have been growth of 48% year on year. That is not now likely to happen. I have chosen to use a revenue estimate for this year of $500 million which essentially implies very modest growth beyond Q1 levels in terms of new logo revenue generation when adjusting for seasonality. That takes the EV/S ratio to about 17X.I expect Alteryx growth to snap back in future years. I think the value of the company’s solutions provides investors with more visibility than exists for most high growth companies. However work is done in the future, regardless of the at-home percentage, the need for analytics is more now than it has ever been. And the need to equip more citizen data scientists with a no-code tool so they can improve their work processes is getting higher, and higher at a faster cadence.I have used a 3 year growth rate of 48% in evaluating the shares, as I expect the hyper growth of the last two quarter will prove to be more of a norm than an outlier. That puts the shares about 25-30% below average for its growth cohort. The absolute valuation at about 17X EV/S, therefore, looks high, but the relative value looks to be modest. I think it is fair to say that asset valuations these days have lots to do with QE, and expectations of more QE and fiscal stimulus. Whether or not readers like those policies, they are here, and are highly likely to be continued. This means that using any kind of DCF analysis will show a divergent and positive valuation for high-growth names such as Alteryx. And the fact is, that as this earnings season has progressed, the divergence in operational performance between most businesses and the IT space has continued to be glaringly apparent. The economy hurts most businesses, but IT vendors are quite a bit more nimble in avoiding the worst consequencesAlteryx shares have made back their initial losses and gone higher compared to their pre-earnings valuation. But my positive thesis on the shares suggests that they continue to trade at levels that support new money buys. I feel reasonably confident that by this time next year, the company will be back on its long-term growth path that implies reaching $1 billion in revenues by 2022."
4344691,103480,2020-05-08T11:00:00-04:00,"Shares of Alteryx pulled back nearly 10% after the company reported Q1 earnings results.Revenue growth decelerated to 43% y/y in Q1 (from a blistering 75% y/y in Q4), and Alteryx expects deceleration to worsen in Q3 to the mid-teens.The company has cited the coronavirus as a big headwind, as companies delay large and expensive IT projects like Alteryx.Even with its post-earnings fall, Alteryx has recovered ~40% from its March lows and remains fairly valued at ~11x forward revenues.","Alteryx (AYX), a software vendor best known for its data integration tools that help business users pull together various streams of data into a single platform for seamless analysis, has long been one of the fastest-growing companies in the software sector. And besides being prized for its growth, Alteryx exhibits one of the highest gross margins in the software sector as well as rich free cash flows - which, prior to the spread of the coronavirus, made Alteryx one of Wall Street's darlings in the sector.The upheaval caused by the coronavirus, however, has altered the company's growth trajectory. Alteryx is famous for being an expensive IT solution, and also one that many customers purchase on an upfront (and not recurring) basis. This has proven to be a major headwind as the lockdowns continued and businesses pulled back on non-essential IT spend. Post-Q1, we can now see the impacts of the coronavirus on Alteryx's business, and shares have lost nearly 10% as a result:Data by YChartsI was a longtime Alteryx bull. Though I typically shy away from software stocks with high valuations, Alteryx provided the rare combination of companies that could grow rapidly while expanding profit margins and cash flows at the same time, while also being a category leader in a critical and nascent area of infrastructure software that was seeing secular tailwinds from the growing trend toward ""data-driven decision making."" After seeing Alteryx's latest results - and particularly, its dour outlook for Q2 - I now think the stock is fairly priced.We note that while Alteryx is still down roughly 30% from highs notched in February, the stock has turned positive for the year, even after its post-Q1 fall. At current post-earnings share prices of ~$114, Alteryx trades at a market cap of $7.47 billion. Netting out the $991.9 million of cash and $706.1 million of convertible debt on Alteryx's balance sheet yields us an enterprise value of $7.18 billion. Prior to Alteryx yanking its guidance forecast alongside its Q1 earnings release, the company had guided to $555-$565 million in revenue for FY20, representing 33-35% y/y growth. Now, however, Alteryx has re-written its growth trajectory to fall to just 10-15% y/y growth by next quarter, as shown below:Figure 1. Alteryx Q2 guidance updateSource: Alteryx Q1 earnings releaseThis makes it more likely that Alteryx will land closer to ~20% y/y growth for the full year. Nevertheless, even if we take the $560 million midpoint of Alteryx's original revenue range, we still arrive at a heady valuation multiple of 12.8x EV/FY20 revenue. Given that growth could fall substantially to the mid-teens, and the fact that other ~20% growth peers tend to trade at high single-digit multiples, I find it unlikely that Alteryx can meaningfully expand its valuation multiples and rally from here.Alteryx's lowered performance has turned the stock into a ""wait and see"" situation. Keep monitoring price movements here (if Alteryx falls to a ~9x forward revenue multiple, or an $82 price target, it becomes far more interesting) but don't be tempted to buy the dip just yet.Let's now review Alteryx's first-quarter results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 2. Alteryx Q1 resultsSource: Alteryx Q1 earnings releaseRevenues grew 43% y/y to $108.8 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $105.6 million, or +38% y/y. While Alteryx did deliver a comfortable beat to consensus expectations, revenue did decelerate sharply from Q4's 75% y/y growth rate. And if we take Alteryx's Q2 guidance at face value, it implies that this high-flying business that was once nearly doubling its revenues will now only see growth rates in the mid-teens.Part of the culprit is Alteryx's slowdown in net retention rates. Though Alteryx has long been a proponent of the ""land and expand"" business model and continues to deliver solid upsell results, Alteryx's dollar-based net retention rate fell to 128% this quarter as customers continue to delay their IT investments.Figure 3. Alteryx retention trendsSource: Alteryx Q1 earnings releaseHere's how CFO Kevin Rubin characterized the weakness of the demand environment surrounding the coronavirus on the Q1 earnings call:Alteryx's exposure to the virus is more pronounced than most other SaaS companies for two primary reasons: first, its heavy 25% exposure to industries that are directly impacted by the coronavirus, and the fact that its revenue base comes primarily from license sales that depend on customers to renew and upsize their buys. When pricing for Alteryx licenses can start as high as $5,200, cash-strapped businesses are going to rethink making those costly investments during uncertain times.One uplifting note, however, was Alteryx noted that early data from April suggests new business activity is picking back up again at levels seen in April 2019 - though it's still in the early innings to tell if this strength can be sustained. Secular tailwinds for collecting data and making it readily available for executives to see will still benefit Alteryx in the long run, but at the moment, IT investments are oriented around immediate priorities like enabling remote work.On the profitability front, Alteryx didn't deliver any overwhelmingly positive results. On the bright side, Alteryx's pro forma gross margins, already among the highest in the software sector, inched up one point to a sky-high 91%. Pro forma operating margins, however, fell back five points to -3% - though the majority of this decline was due to $6 million of non-recurring expenses tied to the rescheduling of Alteryx's user conferences. Outside of this expense, pro forma operating margins would have been flat at +2%.Figure 4. Alteryx margin trendsSource: Alteryx Q1 earnings releaseAlteryx also delivered $15.0 million of free cash flow this quarter at a 14% FCF margin, though that's flat to 1Q19's FCF of $14.5 million at a 19.1% margin. With nearly $1 billion in cash on the books and positive free cash flow, we're not worried about Alteryx's ability to navigate through the current pandemic even if sales remain depressed for multiple quarters.Alteryx's mid-teens revenue valuation multiple was always based on its astronomical growth rates, often nearly doubling year-over-year and on an organic basis, without material contribution from acquisitions. But now that the company is expecting growth rates to fall to the low teens, we question whether Alteryx's current ~14x forward revenue multiple can still hold. It will likely take several quarters for Alteryx to fully digest the impact of the coronavirus and for the company to chart a course back onto meaningful sales growth - and until that happens, Alteryx's stock is likely to flounder. Keep a close eye on price movements here, but don't immediately catch the dip."
4336285,105400,2020-04-06T15:41:56-04:00,"Alteryx has fallen roughly 48% since its 52-week high.The company has grown strongly with revenue growth rates above 45% in recent years.Moreover, Alteryx is undervalued by 97% based on my estimates.","Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) stock price has fallen roughly 48% from its 52-week high, mostly due to multiple adjustments from the recent market turmoil. Despite the big drop in share price, I believe that Alteryx has a strong track record and brand with growing switching costs. At $81, it is undervalued by roughly 97% based on my base-case assumptions.(Source: Google) The company has achieved very strong revenue growth in recent years. Revenue has grown from $54M in 2015 to $418M in 2019, compounding at 66% year on year. Throughout the same period, gross margins have expanded from 80% to 90%.In its Q4 2019 investor presentation, Alteryx estimates its total addressable market as $77B. At its revenue for $418M, Alteryx has only penetrated 0.5% of the entire market. This market is likely to be expanding as well as more customers move towards data-driven workplaces. As such, Alteryx's products and platforms have a long runway for growth.Alteryx has been named a leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning. Being a leader helps Alteryx acquire new customers in trying out at least one of its services before potentially expanding to other services. This helps to drive growth more efficiently than other companies in this space. (Source: Gartner)Alteryx also has a diverse customer base which consists of 36% of the Global 2000. This helps diversify Alteryx customer base so that it is not reliant on a few companies for the bulk of its revenues. (Source: Q4 2019 investor presentation)As companies become more entrenched while using Alteryx's data platform, they become increasingly unlikely to switch even if cheaper competing services emerge. Companies generally do not want to risk lost data and productivity which leads to business disruption. If Alteryx continues to attract large enterprise companies, it increases the switching costs for Alteryx's platform.Alteryx benefits from a deep user community as well which helps spread worth of mouth for the products within and across organizations:(Source: Alteryx latest 10K)To ensure that smaller companies like Alteryx do not run into liquidity issues, one way to determine that is to monitor its cash and debt balances, as well as its cash-burn rate.Looking at its latest balance sheet, Alteryx has $410M of cash, $377M of short term investments, with $68M of short-term and $630M of long-term convertible senior notes. Since Alteryx had negative cash flow in 2019 of only roughly $17M, this provides a large cushion for Alteryx to invest in growth. It also helps Alteryx tide through any operational difficulties in this volatile period.(Source: Alteryx latest 10K) When the economy experiences a downturn, customers might cut back on non-essential services to preserve cash. If these businesses deem that Alteryx is not crucial to their operations, it might lead to a larger-than-expected churn rate for Alteryx's customer base.According to the Gartner Magic Quadrant, Alteryx also faces competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and SAS, which have the resources to compete with Alteryx in a significant way. Without a strong value proposition, it may lead to slower customer adoption on its platform. Alteryx has to ensure that its platform continues to delight customers to gain market share and keep them from switching over to competitors.1) Revenue growth at 35% for the next five years, then dropping to 2% in perpetuity, starting from the year 2025. The high growth rates in the first five years reflect Alteryx's track record of strong revenue growth and the high likelihood that it will penetrate into its total addressable market. However, Alteryx faces many potential competitors in this space and may experience some headwinds in growth if it is faced with execution issues.2) Operating margin of 35% from 2024 onwards. Software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. Alteryx's gross margins have remained above 90% since 2018. Once Alteryx scales further and profitability becomes a priority, the company should experience a high level of operating margin expansion through operating leverage. However, if Alteryx has to incur higher customer acquisition costs due to strong competition, there could be some downward pressure on its margins in the near term.3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate Alteryx will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) Alteryx has a weighted cost of capital of 8%. Since it is already profitable, 8% cost of capital is reasonable for the associated risk.(Source: Author creation using Alteryx financials) (Figures are in $millions except per share data and percentages) The value I derived for Alteryx is roughly $10B for the entire company. This represents a 97% upside from its current price. As with all DCFs for high-growth companies, my point estimate valuation of $160 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against other software companies.(Source: Author creation using data from Seeking Alpha)Compared to other high-growth peers, Alteryx's pricing looks cheap in terms of price/sales and EV/sales ratios. Alteryx is profitable like Trade Desk but has a much higher growth rate. Alteryx also has higher growth and better-operating margins than MongoDB and Okta which trades at higher multiples.Potential investors have to decide if they believe Alteryx will be able to execute according to my base-case assumptions in the long run. If competition turns out to be stronger than expected and pushes down future sales growth, the recent pullback might not make Alteryx a definitive buy."

The company has held significant pricing power, which they've so far exercised liberally, without having to sacrifice growth.However, with the pandemic uncertainty, management expects headwinds and issued weak Q2 guidance. A significant hit to growth is expected, even after accounting for the usual outperformance on consensus estimates.Alteryx may be a future winner, but I don’t see enough upside at the current valuation (NTM EV/S of 16.3x) to justify buying, considering risks. In this article, I discuss the Q2 guidance, impacts from C-19, and how the weakened economy factors into the competitive landscape. I recommend HOLD.Alteryx offers an end-to-end data analytics platform that is code-free and code-friendly. The motivation behind their products is to empower “citizen data scientists”, or employees who lack the technical capabilities (such as programming) to otherwise practise data science. Their software is designed to be easy to learn and easy to use, playing well with both skilled and relatively unskilled data scientists.So what does end-to-end mean? To convert raw data into actionable insights, there are a few steps in between. Data needs to be sourced correctly from multiple locations, cleaned, and combined before one can use it for analytics. This data preparation typically takes up the majority of data analysts time.Analytics can comprise of descriptive analytics, predictive/prescriptive analytics, and spatial analytics to name a few. These workflows often encompass machine learning algorithms and a variety of AI techniques to produce insights out of the data. The results are filtered to inform business decisions or are visualized to be presented to an audience. All this can be carried out within Alteryx, and the company offers additional products/services to schedule tasks, govern and automate procedures, and carry out machine learning deployments. It is a complete data science and machine learning platform.Image Source: Alteryx Press KitTheir key products are:Source: Alteryx WebsiteOverall, Alteryx is immensely capable and has so far successfully executed their land and expand strategy, which usually begins with sales of “Alteryx Designer”, followed by upselling other products. This is evident in their impressive TTM revenue growth of 51.6% yoy and a 128% net expansion rate. Q1 Results came in strong. The company noted an abrupt slowdown in growth in late March but saw a return to normal new business activity in April. The following excerpts provide some detail on what to expect from the company:Source: Seeking Alpha, Q1 2020 Earnings TranscriptManagement proceeded to provide weak guidance for Q2 2020 expecting only about 10%-16% growth yoy in Q2 2019, considerably down sequentially from Q1 2020s 43% yoy.The difference between the qualitative remarks and guidance estimates is somewhat perplexing. CEO Dan Stoecker noted that the company has been historically conservative with guidance estimates. He also noted that they used the Alteryx platform to make the estimates and their accuracy depends on the quality of data factoring into their models. The data is likely less robust than it was in previous quarters.As far as one could interpret the above information, Q2 growth could be anywhere between 10% yoy (the bottom guidance range) to even above 30% yoy in my opinion, considering the company's long record of historical surprises and a wider range of outcomes in the face of uncertainty. If new business activity has truly returned to normal and Alteryx’s adoption is mission-critical as management claims, the company could potentially blast through their guidance in the coming quarter and cement its position as a digital transformation juggernaut that would power through Covid-19 with some vigour. On the other hand, churn rates, highly impacted industry verticals, and a falling net expansion rate could translate to a multi-quarter slump. Regardless, the predicted growth hit marks a tangible slowdown in the top-line after factoring in the outperformance.Should an investor forego the short-term play and remain invested for the long-term? That depends on how long the effects of Covid-19 last and how it impacts both existing and new business activity. Alteryx’s landed customers may not want to expand further, and potential customers may not want to write out big cheques.In a stock market that is seemingly disconnected from economic reality, I urge investors to consider the second-order effects on Alteryx. Covid-19 is a wake-up call and accelerator for digital transformation adoption, which would benefit Alteryx as a first-order effect. Digging deeper, a likely second-order effect would be IT spend budgets contract across enterprises that are on their path to digital transformation that would, in turn, affect Alteryx. Another second-order effect would be customer bankruptcies that simply cut away sections of Alteryx’s existing revenue base. While this is speculative, the degree to which headwinds and tailwinds interact can vary significantly.I do not buy the “V” shaped recovery argument and I’m more in the camp for a “Nike-swoosh” shaped recovery. The economy has structurally shifted to favour some industries and disadvantage others. For Alteryx’s long-term story from here on, it is worth analyzing the competition.The following extract from the latest earnings presentation provides some colour:Source: Alteryx, Q1 2020 Earnings PresentationAlteryx has stressed on their software as the one platform to do it all, while competitors cover only partial sections of the full data analytics workflow.Let us say that Alteryx is right and it is the endgame platform for all analytics. They are also certainly priced like it. As a best-of-breed product, justifying their high price tags may have been previously easier in good times. In the current economy, cost-cutting may take some precedence for some businesses that may consider cheaper alternatives.As discussed earlier, the majority of a data scientist’s time is taken in data preparation, that involves scouring through spreadsheets and manual repetitive tasks. Other data prep platforms may fit workflows for lower prices, while skilled data scientists use open source tools, libraries, and languages for AI & ML post-data-prep. Alteryx has seen excellent product-market fit so far, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll continue to win in an economy which is likely far more price-sensitive than it used to be. Digital transformation projects will need to be balanced with tighter IT budgets.For the analysts out there, this can be compared to deciding between a Bloomberg Terminal subscription versus FactSet or a Seeking Alpha Premium subscription. Bloomberg might be the most complete financial database provider, but you’d likely be willing to forego the extra bells and whistles and choose an alternative which could get the job done when you’re short on cash.My discussion presents hypotheticals which may not materialize as we have little visibility into customer buying behaviour that Alteryx also mentioned in their earnings call. However, with weak guidance, one should consider pricing as a potential explanation for sales hits.The future competitive threats will be companies with network effects and deep resources. Alternatively, they should have the agility and an innovative streak to succeed in filling in the gaps of an end-to-end platform offering. That brings us to Tableau, now owned by Salesforce (NYSE: CRM).Image Source: Alteryx Press Kit; Alteryx Designer ScreenshotImage Source: Tableau Website; Tableau Prep Builder ScreenshotThe above images show the uncanny similarities between “Tableau Prep Builder” and “Alteryx Designer”, that follow a visual workflow and database user interface.“Tableau Creator” costs $70/user/month and includes “Tableau Prep Builder”, their data preparation software (in the screenshot below). Capabilities may not be as comprehensive as Alteryx, but they are constantly adding new features and may be considered a viable alternative for less complex workloads. I believe there is a fair chance that Tableau will release their own AI & ML features to fill in the gaps for a full data science platform. They have an expansive user base which they can upsell new software to, and can tap into Salesforce’s expertise in artificial intelligence. Tableau and Alteryx even appear to be naming their products similarly: “Tableau Creator” and “Tableau Server” vs. “Alteryx Designer” and “Alteryx Server”.Unlike Tableau’s offerings, Alteryx Designer comes with the full platform for $5,195/user/year. There isn’t an a-la-carte option without the AI & ML features. Pricing may work against Alteryx’s favour in the long-term if the competition takes off. For some organizations, Alteryx would likely provide diminishing returns on their investment going beyond data preparation. This is where I see a compelling argument for the far cheaper Tableau solutions.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is also a potential threat if the company expands towards lateral capabilities of their ""Power BI"" platform to encompass data prep and high data science. Microsoft has demonstrated a habit of producing in-house clones of popular SaaS, such as ""Teams"" and ""Teams Meetings"" to go against Slack (NYSE: WORK) and Zoom (NASDAQ: ZM) respectively. Source: Author, data from KoyfinRevenue growth has been excellent so far. The above chart represents TTM sales and growth to smoothen out seasonality trends. Q1 2020 posted a 43.1% yoy growth. As the revenue base increased, growth has naturally decelerated in recent quarters. With the current guidance, I expect the growth rate to drop sharply, even if it outperforms.

With weaker profitability guidance, I expect the FCF margin to reduce and perhaps turn negative in the coming quarters. This won’t be a cause for concern as Alteryx is financially healthy and has enough cash to weather the storm. At this stage, it is appropriate for the company to forego profitability to pursue their significant long-term market opportunity. I expect the business to continue to be top-line driven for the near future.Source: KoyfinAlteryx has seen a strong run with the recent bull rally and is trading at late-2019 levels.

4345705,102764,2020-05-10T11:15:31-04:00,"Alteryx reported remarkably strong numbers last week, but guidance was below market expectations.Management is always very conservative when it comes to guidance, and chances are that they are being even more conservative in this context.Alteryx is providing valuable solutions to companies trying to reduce costs and answer critical questions during the pandemic.At current prices, Alteryx is attractively valued in comparison to other high growth players in the industry.The business is as strong as ever, and the bullish thesis for Alteryx remains intact.","Alteryx (AYX) reported earnings on Wednesday, May 6, after the market close. The numbers for the first quarter were clearly strong, but guidance for the second quarter came in below expectations and the company provided no guidance for the full year 2020. As a reaction, some Wall Street analysts are cutting their price targets on Alteryx, citing factors such as disappointing Q2 guidance.There is a considerable chance that management is being overly conservative with guidance, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if the numbers for the second quarter turn out to be materially above expectations. Besides, the business fundamentals are as strong as ever, and Alteryx is proving that it can provide valuable solutions for clients during the pandemic and the recession that comes with it.At current prices, Alteryx looks conveniently valued in comparison to other high growth stocks in the sector, and the company offers plenty of upside potential in the years ahead.Total revenue during the quarter grew 43% to $108.8 million, and the company generated $20 million in operating cash flow during the period. Alteryx added 356 net new customers and the net dollar retention rate was remarkably strong at 128%. The numbers show that the company kept gaining new customers and also making more revenue per customer during the period, so the value propositions for customers is as strong as ever.Source: AlteryxHowever, management is expecting a modest increase of 10% to 15% in revenue during the second quarter. This was the main weak spot in the report and the main reason for disappointment among the analysts following the stock.To begin with, it is important to keep in mind that Alteryx always provides modest guidance numbers, as the company likes to keep expectations at bay and consistently overdeliver. In fact, Alteryx has delivered revenue numbers above Wall Street expectations in each of the past 13 quarters in a row.Source: Seeking AlphaOne of the analysts in the conference call asked for more precision regarding the guidance numbers, and this is what management had to say.In a nutshell, management is saying that the numbers for April showed some encouraging signs, and the company did in fact close some deals with customers that are being highly affected by the pandemic.But Alteryx is always conservative when it comes to guidance, and the current economic environment is unprecedentedly uncertain, so it makes sense for the company to be especially modest in its assumptions for the second quarter of 2020.Data analytics is increasingly important for companies all over the world, not only to identify new growth venues but also to increase efficiencies and reduce costs. The company calculates that its total addressable market is worth nearly $28 billion, and over the coming years, the size of such a market opportunity is expected to reach as much as $49 billion.Even among existing customers, the company still has a lot of room for further growth, and Alteryx is barely getting started in terms of international expansion.During a recession, it can be hard for a company such as Alteryx to gain new customers among companies that are facing a big slump in revenue. However, it is also worth noting that businesses are increasingly relying on data analytics to maximize all kinds of efficiencies and to reduce costs.Management highlighted during the conference call that Alteryx did business with several top players in highly impacted verticals such as leisure and entertainment, energy, and financials.Some of the names mentioned by the company are Caesars Entertainment, Choice Hotels, Copa Airlines, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, Chevron USA, Dominion Energy Services, Mid-American Energy Company, BNP Paribas, Royal Bank of Canada and Standard Charter Bank, among others.The fact that Alteryx's solutions are being demanded by these companies situated at the eye of the storm shows that making sense of data and focusing on efficiencies can be remarkably important during a recession too.In other areas, Alteryx is even benefitting from increased analytics needs because of the pandemic. An existing public sector client purchased additional Alteryx licenses to analyze and measure the effectiveness of a multi-billion-dollar aid program. Similarly, a hospital leveraged Alteryx to quickly adapt their supply chain and to build predictive models to understand the need for ICU beds.Alteryx is a top player in high-quality data analytics, and the business is benefitting from enormous opportunities in the years ahead, with or without the pandemic. Even during tough periods for the economy, effective analytics is not only a growth investment but sometimes even a necessity for survival.The table below shows some key statistics for Alteryx in comparison to other highly successful companies in the industry: Twilo (TWLO), Okta (OKTA), The Trade Desk (TTD), Data Dog (DDOG), and Zscaler (ZS). The comparisons are not very straightforward since these 6 companies operate in different segments and there are some important differences in their business models.However, it can still be illustrative to compare Alteryx versus other successful industry players with similarly elevated growth expectations. To begin with, Alteryx has the highest gross margins in the table, and the second-highest operating margin behind The Trade Desk, which is an exceptionally profitable business.In spite of having similar expected growth rates in revenue and comparatively attractive profitability levels, Alteryx is trading at the lowest price to sales ratio in the table.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123Many of the companies in the table are actually beneficiaries of the shelter at home directives during the pandemic, and this needs to be considered when assessing relative valuation metrics. Nevertheless, it looks like Alteryx is more than reasonably priced on a relative basis.An interesting way to look at valuation is inverting the process. We can take a look at the growth expectations and try to assess if the company can meet or exceed those expectations. If the company can outperform growth expectations in the future, this means that the stock could offer attractive upside potential from current prices.The table below shows revenue estimates, year-over-year growth rates, and the price to sales ratio implied by those expectations. Estimates for 2020 are obviously very uncertain, but the market is expecting a 30.7% increase in revenue during 2021 and a subsequent deceleration in the following years. This would represent a material deceleration versus a 43% increase in sales during the first quarter of 2020, which includes the impact of the recession in March.It is generally safer to make conservative growth assumptions when valuing a stock, but I wouldn't be surprised at all to see Alteryx exceeding growth expectations in the coming quarters and years.Source: Seeking AlphaValuation should be interpreted in its due context. A company that generates strong profitability and consistently beats expectations deserves a higher price to sales ratio than a business with below-average profitability and underperforming expectations.However, it can be difficult to incorporate multiple factors into the analysis and quantify them in order to see the complete picture. In that spirit, the PowerFactors algorithm is a quantitative system that ranks companies in a particular universe according to a combination of factors: financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123The backtested performance numbers show that companies with high PowerFactors rankings tend to deliver superior returns over the long term, and the higher the ranking, the higher the expected returns.Alteryx has a PowerFactors ranking above 85 as of the time of this writing. This means that the stock is comfortable in the top 20% of companies in the US stock markets based on financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength together.It is important to keep in mind that an algorithm such as PowerFactors is based on current data and current expectations about future data. This provides an assessment based on hard data as opposed to opinions, but it also has some limitations.In essence, forward-looking returns will depend on the cash flows that the business can produce in the future. The algorithm is saying that Alteryx is attractively priced based on current expectations and past history. However, the company needs to continue leading the industry and capitalizing on its long-term growth opportunities in order to meet and ideally exceed expectations going forward.The main strength of a quantitative algorithm is that it provides a quantifiable approach based on hard data to make investment decisions supported by evidence. However, investors should always assess the business behind those numbers in order to analyze if the numbers are sustainable or not going forward.The main point is that Alteryx is reasonably valued in comparison to other high growth companies in the sector. Future growth expectations among the analysts following the stock are more than reasonable, and the valuation metrics based on multiple factors are clearly strong. As long as management keeps leading the company in the right direction, Alteryx should be able to deliver solid returns from current price levels."
4324628,103480,2020-02-17T12:00:00-05:00,"Shares of Alteryx jumped ~10% to fresh all-time highs after reporting fourth-quarter results.Revenue growth accelerated ten points to 75% y/y, versus 65% y/y in the prior quarter.Alteryx's revenue guidance for 2020 calls for only 33-35% y/y growth, which is highly conservative and sets out a path for a consistent ""beat and raise"" cadence.Margins and profits also continue to soar, distinguishing Alteryx from other hyper-growth software stocks.","For me, value-based investing and buying into technology stocks at reasonable prices has been a golden rule. But every rule has an exception, and Alteryx (AYX) is a big one. The big data software company, which helps its customers load and blend business data from different sources in order to prepare it for analysis, has jumped ~10% to fresh all-time highs after reporting strong fourth-quarter results. Year to date, Alteryx has jumped ~50%, vastly outperforming the S&P 500's ~3.5% rise and falling second only to Tesla (TSLA).Data by YChartsOrdinarily, I would caution against buying into such a hyped company with an overextended valuation. But I keep Alteryx in my portfolio for a couple of key reasons:This is one of the rare technology companies that is still in the infancy of transforming enterprise software. Executives in almost every industry are still waking up to the value of their internal data, and ""data-driven decision making"" has become a theme across corporate board rooms. But in order to unlock the value of the data that lies in different customer systems, internal portals, etcetera, tools like Alteryx are needed to piece all that information together. The fact that Alteryx has managed to generate 130%-plus net revenue retention rates speaks volumes to the value that customers are finding in Alteryx, which keeps them buying more.Despite the strong year-to-date rally, I believe Alteryx still has plenty of steam left to rise higher. We note as well that Alteryx's 2020 revenue guidance is, to put it bluntly, a joke. Alteryx is projecting only 33-35% y/y growth for 2020, despite exiting Q4 at a massive 75% y/y growth rate. To me, there's at least fifteen points of y/y growth opportunity in this guidance outlook, which sets up Alteryx nicely to blow past expectations each quarter and raise its outlook (giving the stock plenty of bullish catalysts throughout the year).Figure 1. Alteryx 2020 guidance updateSource: Alteryx 4Q19 earnings releaseStay invested in this company for the long term.Let's now dive into Alteryx's fourth-quarter results in greater detail:Figure 2. Alteryx 4Q19 resultsSource: Alteryx 4Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew 75% y/y to $156.5 million, absolutely demolishing Wall Street's expectations of $130.7 million (+47% y/y). The company added 474 net new customers in the quarter, bringing its year-end customer base total to 6,087, up 30% y/y.Kevin Rubin, Alteryx's CFO, made the following comments on the Q4 earnings call regarding the huge revenue upside that Alteryx achieved this quarter:Equally important to note, as previously mentioned, is the fact that Alteryx has notched a strong 130% net revenue retention rate. This essentially means that the average Alteryx customer is expanding their purchase by 30%. For comparison, most other enterprise SaaS companies are seeing net retention rates in the low ~110s. Because expansion revenues are cheaper to attain than new business (it costs less sales dollars to upset an existing customer than to win a bakeoff with a new customer), this strength also drives Alteryx's profits.To flesh out the idea that Alteryx is still at the tip of the iceberg, see the chart below which shows Alteryx's estimate of its TAM at >$70 billion. This suggests that Alteryx is currently less than 1% penetrated, and its expansion into new products can bring tremendous organic revenue growth:Figure 3. Alteryx TAMSource: Alteryx 4Q19 earnings deckAs Alteryx has grown on the top line, its profits have soared as well. The chart below shows the company's evolution in margins over time. Note that Alteryx's pro forma gross margins of 92% are among the highest in the industry:Figure 4. Alteryx margin trendsSource: Alteryx 4Q19 earnings deckIn Q4, Alteryx's pro forma operating margins leaped three points to 33%, up from 30% in the year-ago quarter. Its long-term operating model calls for 35-40% in full-year operating margins (about double the current margin profile), suggesting there is still room for improvement.Alteryx's pro forma EPS also doubled in Q4 to $0.64, also more than doubling Wall Street's expectations of $0.29. The company also grew operating cash flows by 45% y/y to $20.7 million.Each passing quarter provides yet more evidence that Alteryx is a rare asset in the technology sector, one that is deserving of its current ~16x forward revenue multiple (again, near-term revenue multiples are less meaningful when Alteryx's revenue growth is so large, and shouldn't be a detractor in investing in the company). Hold onto Alteryx for the long term."
4326026,41961,2020-02-21T02:36:39-05:00,"Alteryx plays a pivotal role in assisting enterprises on their journey toward data transformation by improving the productivity of data gathering and preparation.The business reported very good results recently, showing revenue growth of 75%.While expensive in terms of valuation, tailwinds point to long-term growth for the business, and this could be one to bottom-drawer.","Alteryx (AYX) provides self-service data preparation software. The company’s platform provides organizations with the ability to prepare, blend and analyze data from a wide variety of sources to quickly benefit from data-driven decisions. Alteryx has a market capitalization of approximately $10 billion and generates almost $500 million in revenue. The company has provided investors with one-year return of almost 115%. The business is a core holding of the SG Emerging Leaders portfolio and was added a few months ago.Alteryx recently reported very strong results, growing revenue at 75% year over year in the last quarter and also recording a strong earnings performance, which also exceeded market expectations. Impressively, Alteryx also substantially increased guidance for 2020 as well, with an expected guidance at the mid-point of $560 million for revenue growth, implying forecast growth of 34%. The market liked these results and promptly sent the stock up some 10%. However, there is likely to be significantly more upside potential for the business in the years to come.Source: Alteryx Q4 2020 ReportEssential productivity multiplier for predictive data analysisThere has been a general renaissance in the appreciation of the role that data plays in the transformation and digitization of an enterprise. That awareness has only seemed to reach hype-level proportions in the last few years as the sources of data within an organization are unlocked and expand as a result of factors such as the Internet of Things, which allow additional operational insights on data. More powerful algorithms that allow greater inferences to be derived from data. However, underlying all of this is a real movement to making more data-driven decisions that can provide strong predictive power to businesses, influencing operations and decision making.A critical element in that data analysis exercise is being able to find and gather relevant data streams, prepare that data in a manner that can be easily processed and understood, and finally, run sophisticated processes and algorithms to actually produce meaning and value from that data. Alteryx has a solution that executes across all elements of this value chain. While terms like predictive data modeling have an exciting ring to it, the process of finding and preparing data is anything but.In a typical enterprise, data exists across multiple data bases in a variety of file formats and sources, which firstly has to be accessed in a consistent way. Without access to a broad and rich data set, the predictive power of data is significantly reduced. Once the data is located, this all has to be prepared and standardized into a single usable format before it can be analyzed and processed. Sourcing through multiple different databases and data streams to collect and standardize data is typically an extremely time-consuming process, sometimes taking hours, if not days.Alteryx has integrations into databases, process workflows and applications to pull and source data for analysis. The company removes much of the human intervention that’s associated with data parsing and manipulation that is typically done in MS Excel. The testimonials on Alteryx’s website speak in glowing terms of the time saved by using the company’s tools to enhance data productivity. The company estimates that 6 billion hours per year are wasted working on manipulating spreadsheets, with 8 hours per week spent working on solving repetitive tasks, creating $60 billion in wasted annual inefficiency that Alteryx is solving for.The success that Alteryx has seen is borne out in the marquee customer list that it has. With 34% of the Fortune 2000, the business has a roster of marquee customers, including General Dynamics (GD), Raytheon (RTN) and IKEA.Source: Alteryx Q4 2020 ReportSticky service with high switching costs and built-in growthOnce companies have gone to the trouble of standardizing on a data analytics platform and started to see some ROI benefit from data analysis, such a data platform becomes a mission-critical, sticky service that becomes relatively difficult to displace.Alteryx’s land and expand strategy helps with this process. Typically, individual user groups such as data analysts within a business start out with an Alteryx Designer subscription to improve data productivity and replace manual processes. As the power of the platform becomes more apparent, this very quickly leads to other data science professionals within a group getting a better understanding of the Alteryx platform and benefits, leading to additional users and new use cases.At this point, internal user groups start to standardize and share workflows, leading to the deployment of use cases and new licenses leading an organization to move to Alteryx's Server and Connect products. Eventually, many users within an organization are using Alteryx licenses, making the move to Alteryx Platform and getting an enterprise-wide license under the scope of the Chief Data Officer a logical conclusion. Not only does an enterprise's spend with Alteryx increase at each progressive stage, but Alteryx's network effect within an enterprise progressively deepens, increasing AYX's hold on a company as new users and internal consumers of data get trained on how to feed data in and understand outputs.Source: Alteryx Q4 2020 ReportMoving to a new platform would then typically requires users to ramp up their understanding and awareness of how to pull and process data in a new platform. There is also a period of disruption in migrating over to a new platform where there is a lack of visibility into data insights while a new data platform is being rolled out. As a result of this, retention tends to be high once platform selection is made and value is realized.This effect can be seen in Alteryx's own numbers. This business has over 5,600 customers, and has an impressive net dollar retention rate of over 132%. This suggests that the company has been successful in having existing customers increase their spend at least 30% or more, in addition to just retaining its customers.Large TAM with a limited competitor setAlteryx's market opportunity here is substantial. The company estimates the Big Data and software analytics market to be close to $50 billion, with the contribution of 47 million users who work on advanced data preparation in Excel being worth close to $26 billion, resulting in a total addressable market opportunity of nearly $75 billion. With only 35% of the Fortune 2000 as customers today, Alteryx has a long trajectory to capitalize on this space. What is also interesting about the company's approach is that the business is developing relationships with heavy hitters in the Systems Integration and Consulting spaces who are building practices around implementing digital transformation solutions and best practices.Source: Alteryx Q4 2020 ReportAlteryx counts Accenture (ACN) and Wipro (WIT) among SI partners, and it most recently added PwC. Not only do these businesses have massive account reach across the Fortune 2k, but they are often the first point of call for enterprises which are evaluating business transformation and having to inventory available data sources, develop meaningful inferences and federate such data into internal BI systems and the like. The fact that these large players are building practices around Alteryx is a powerful endorsement for the company, not to mention something which should progressively open up more, and larger, opportunities than Alteryx itself would be able to penetrate.The company's competitor set is also fairly narrow. Contrary to popular opinion, business intelligence visualization providers such as Tableau (acquired by Salesforce (CRM)) are not direct competitors, but rather offer complementary tool to assist in the visualization of data output. Alteryx itself denotes SAS as its main competitor. While SAS has developed sophisticated data modeling and algorithmic capabilities, it's fair to say that they haven't been productized as elegantly or met with such broad-based adoption as Alteryx, and typically require extensive system integration resources just to deploy and get started, without the virality of Alteryx's adoption.Source: Alteryx Q4 2020 ReportOne of the most impressive things about Alteryx is its strong revenue growth, which is indicative of high demand for the platform. Revenue has grown at almost 70% p.a. annualized for the last 3 years. The business is also profitable, and the company produces positive cash flow - a rarity for a business at this stage and with this level of growth. Gross margins for the business are at an impressive 90%.Unfortunately, none of this growth in Alteryx necessarily comes at a bargain price. AYX trades at 150x earnings, with P/E essentially meaningless for a business that is still rapidly acquiring share. That said, even its price/sales ratio at 25x revenue is toward the higher end of high-growth SaaS companies. What gets interesting with AYX is that given the growth of the business is so rapid, its forward P/S ratio is only around 17x.This business may be one to buy and bottom-drawer for long-term investors with any short-term pullback in the stock. Natural secular forces are all converging towards a data-driven enterprise, which stand Alteryx in good stead, as more powerful compute, cheaper and more prevalent cloud storage and the instrumentation of data everywhere will create a deluge of data that businesses of all sizes will need help making sense of."

Andres is also on Twitter @andrescardenal.Listen and subscribe to the Marketplace Roundtable on these podcast platforms:Okay. Let’s get into it. Andres, welcome to the podcast.Andres Cardenal: Thank you very much.NB: Great to have you. Why don’t we start off and tell us a little bit about your investing strategy.AC: Well, I mostly use a combination of quantitative and qualitative research. I like to relate numbers on things that have proven to work over a long periods of time. I have some quantitative strategies that mostly follow rules because that provides a set of certainly and it makes the research much more measurable, but also I had big stocks based on quantitative factors such as company strength, management quality, and I think at the end, mixing qualitative and quantitative research is probably the best was to describe my strategy.NB: Interesting. Yes, your Seeking Alpha page says you are naturally flavored, which I thought was a pretty interesting touch and it kind of captures what you're – what you just mentioned. Okay, cool. So, you’ve been doing this for a long time, obviously, since 2002, which was, if memory serves, pretty much the bottom of a bear market several cycles ago. What would you say is something that you’ve learned in your investing over time?AC: Well, back in 2002, I started working for a hedge fund, it was Global Hedge Fund. We were doing the value research and that’s the different stage in my career, I was deeply focused on the numbers like valuation and financial performance and adjusted financial statements. And over time, I learned that you can develop a edge when you start looking at [unquantified vitals] such as the quality of the management team. For example, if you buy a company that is run by the right people, visionary leaders, honest people, that makes a massive difference over long periods of time, although it’s something that you cannot always see in the numbers at first sight. You need to do some quantitative research, some in depth analysis of the company.NB: Okay. What kind of stuff do you look for when you do a research?AC: On the qualitative aspects?NB: Yes.AC: It’s mostly management, company strength, and long-term growth opportunities. So, for example, I mean if you have a [indiscernible] and you have [indiscernible] competitive stress like the companies has the scale and has the data and it has financial resources and then it has the long term growth opportunities, in online retail and in cloud computing, then you have like three aspects that I’m not just [visiting] in the short-term in the numbers, but make a huge difference on returns over multiple years.NB: Interesting. Okay, cool. I was going through your page on Seeking Alpha here and I saw something that caught my interest, which is a recent article you wrote on February 16, the bullish case for Uber, which is a bit of a contrarian call considering Uber, all the noise that’s been around that and also the stock market has rebounded this year, but it has a – had a hard time previously since the IPO. Can you tell us a little bit about what you saw there, specifically as it affects the management team?AC: Yes, I think most of the time it’s important to understand that the return from the stock are going to come from the results in comparison to expectations. So, going ahead, I mean Uber has been operating, you know, in a really, really horrible industry landscape because a lot of companies having trouble in money. They are right here in service and especially at food delivering, so competition has been brutal and with the previous management team, Uber was like kind of also throwing lots of money at lots of revenue generating activities without paying too much attention to profitability.Going forward, the company is much more focused on trying to improve on profitability metrics. Management is explicitly saying that they are accelerating their profitability targets. So, sometimes when you go from a really better place, it’s relatively easy to make its improvements like, I don’t know, if you 30 kilos to lose of weight, it’s the first 10 kilos that come really fast because it’s relatively easy to have a lot of extra fat to trim. I think that Uber is kind of in that situation.I won’t be surprised to see the company making big improvements over the next several quarters. Then over the long terms, there are lot of variables that need to be assessed. I mean the regulatory landscape is really tough, and, you know, the competition in food delivery is also very tough. But the company has the scale and scale is crucial here because the lean player, they attract more gas store and they attract more drivers, so I won’t be surprised to see Uber delivering big return from [indiscernible].NB: Interesting view, yes. And by the way 30 pounds is about – I’m sorry 30 kilos is about 60 pounds, which is kind of a lot a weight for somebody to lose, but, yes, anyway, but point taken. Okay, so as we record this mid-February 2020 towards the later stages of the month actually, and it's been an interesting year already here in 2020 following a very bullish year for stocks last year. How does this compare with other periods that you've been observing in markets? And what would you say is something that you've learned over the last year or call the last 18 months or so?AC: Well, I will say that the most important thing is that you need to understand the kind of – sometimes returns in the market are going to depend on a few amount of buyables and I think that you have to focus on only thing that is liquidity and credit because over the next decade I would – the past decade I would say, we’ve been in an environment in which economic growth has been kind of lackluster, especially in international markets, but when you have the federal reserve, [indiscernible] around the world, foreign liquid in the markets, and especially if you have great flow in, you know, credit spreads are very low, there’s no sign of stress in the grade market, that miss the money flowed really through the economy and that gives companies access to financial resources, so they can – well, it reduces interest expenses and they can repurchase stock, they can pay dividends that gives consumer more flexibility.So, in this kind of environment, when money is available, chances are that we’re going to have – you’re still going to have [indiscernible] of course because the markets usually gets a [indiscernible] but in the end, those pull backs are going to be really shallow and you’re going to be in a fairly [benign] environment as long as you have hedge flowing through the economy.NB: Interesting. You mentioned the Fed, how much do you pay attention to the macro variables, the central banks and such?AC: Very much. I think that’s a crucial thing because you’re [indiscernible] the economic cycle around now. So, the most – when you look at history, the biggest bare markets they come [indiscernible] recessions, you’re going to have some sizable corrections, we have the recession or we have the great crisis, but the big market draw downs, I mean above 30%, 40% that generally come when you have a recession and/or a financial crisis or at least a big crunch. So, as long as you don’t have debt, these are mostly buying opportunities. If you have that, then you need to continue to taking some profits, raising some cash or protecting the portfolio.NB: But to your earlier point, you think the environment now is pretty benign and that's the economic cycle has a little bit more room to run, right?AC: Yes, because when you look at this kind of the economic cycle, it has been very long, but it has also been very weak, so you are having [indiscernible] growth. Yes, I mean we have an economic expansion. We have been outside of pro forma recession, by the way, we had, you know, a contraction in manufacturing last year, a contraction in the export last year, so it’s been kind of weak growth and when you have weak growth and you’re having inflationary pressures, then the Fed can keep balancing the situation by providing more credit to the markets, so that is why you had last year a contraction in manufacturing, a contraction in exports, but no recession.NB: Okay, cool. What are some things that you’re watching here as we conclude the first quarter of 2020 and into the rest of this year that you think are vital and you think listeners should also pay attention to?AC: Oh! China is a big piece of the puzzle because…NB: Chile or China?AC: China, China, I’m sorry.NB: I’m sorry, okay.AC: Yes, because, you know, it’s really a big engine of economic growth for the whole world. China, you know, is like a major engine for economic growth and the country was really held, but the [trade war] last year and now they have the coronavirus. That’s going to be mostly a temporary factor, while at the same time, it provides a big excuse for the Chinese Central Bank and for all Central Banks all over the world to provide more liquidity to the markets. So, as long as China does not get into a prolonged contraction, a big recession, that could set the stage for accelerating economic growth over, I would say, the next six month or so. So, thus that could be a game changer for different sectors.For example, interest rates have remained very, very low. Maybe if you have an accelerating growth, we can see some rebounding interest rates that could be good for financials; that could be good for the consumer sector, you know, and that’s going to play a major role [indiscernible] very, very weak. If China accelerates after the coronavirus, that’s going to be good for growing the prices and maybe this like a biggest thesis to watch. It could be a game changer, but you have to see if it plays out, you know, it’s like a big idea.NB: You’re not concerned about a broader slow down in China, I mean the Chinese economy was slowing like economic growth, I should say, was slowing well before the coronavirus, probably due to the tariffs and such, but is that not a concern for you on the broader scheme of things?AC: Oh! I think it’s going to slow even more because of the coronavirus, but it’s going to be mostly temporary because the rest of China and the rest of the emerging markets, they have been like providing massive [indiscernible] to the economy and as long as the U.S. consumer remains healthy, I think that you have to assume that the most likely scenario is that economic growth is going to pick up in China not going back to previous years, but it’s going to at least avoid the recession and remain growing like something like 5% or so, which is quite – even be better for some specific sectors. Chances are that China is going to rotate towards most consumer services through an economy, not so much exports as a main growth engine inside China, I mean. So, that could be, you know, really bullish for some Chinese stocks.NB: Interesting. Any in particular?AC: Well, I have a position in Alibaba (BABA). I think it’s a massively growing company and its relative – I mean if you can see that the growth in [indiscernible] the stock is earning like a $0.20, I mean $0.25 earnings for next year for a company that’s growing at 30% or so. You know it has been hurt by the trade war and now the coronavirus, that’s where you get the opportunities when you have a fundamental in some companies with spectacular growth opportunities and it’s been affected by temporary problems.NB: Very interesting. What is something that scares you about the markets or about your portfolio right now?AC: Well, I think that over the middle term everybody is starting to catch up to the idea that as long as the Fed is there to provide liquidity, you need to buy the dip. So, that can potentially kind of generate some problems.If people start losing sight of the risk because, you know, it’s one thing to say that the fundamental environmental stocks remain healthy, but sentiment can get too extended so even if the fundamentals remains solid, prices can go way high of those fundamentals, that’s a major risk that I have been watching and also I think that negative interest rates in Europe that’s like a major of theme that needs to be monitored because a lot of people, you know, who can be buying those bonds that yield and add even to these rates, mostly it’s those who don’t have a choice.I mean insurance companies and institutional investors who have to buy those bonds. I notice there’s probably enough speculative activity there. People say, okay, yes, the yield is negative but the bonds are rising, so I keep putting money into that. When that trend reverses, it can be quite damaging, so I think that the two key variables that give me encourage are market sentiment, which can get too extended, and also, in negative interest rates.NB: To the point of negative interest rates, I saw a chart just the other day that showed Greek sovereign bonds and the spread between those and the German bonds was something like a couple of percent down from what, you know, double digit percent in 2012 and 2013, which just goes to show that how this whole appetite for these securities – I mean if Greek bonds are priced as safe securities then it kind of raises the question of what isn’t safe, but how do you think that this could play out, you know, with the negative interest rates other than what we’ve already seen?AC: Well, I think you have to keep in mind that we can get a sharp reversal there and it could be really problematic because that will probably be the worst scenario like a sharp reversal in which maybe investors start realizing that Greek bonds are not very safe or at least not safe as they probably thought. You know if interest rates are going to increase, that’s going to put some pressure on, you know, doing the bank stocks. Maybe you do this sector in the U.S., it has been moving, but this is mostly because interest rates are very low in Europe, so that’s puts downside pressure on interest rates in the U.S. and stocks are helping, you know, consumer staples and utilities in the U.S. and it also could have an impact on U.S. growth stocks because when interest rates decline, you know, when you try to adjust cash flows of growth stocks, then the value of the business depends on the cash flow that the company is going to generate over the long term because its high growth business, so a big share of the cash flows are coming over a long period of time.When you raise the interest rates, the price of a growth stock is particularly sensitive to the interest rate, that’s what I mean. If you’re probably [indiscernible] value stock, the short term cash flows are more important. In the growth stocks, the long terms cash flows are more important. So, when you change interest rates, that can effect high growth stocks and if we get synergic on the adjustment in the overall level of interest rates, that’s going to maybe probably put some pressure on some sectors of the U.S. markets, probably those sensitive – they’re actually sensitive to interest rates such as utilities and consumer staples and maybe too in growth stocks.NB: How realistic is it for us to be concerned about an adjustment in interest rates, especially in the US from the Fed at this point?AC: No, I don’t mean from the Fed.NB: Okay.AC: I think the Fed – as long as interest rates remain low, I mean as long as inflation remains low, the Fed has no rush to rising those rates. And also, [indiscernible] growth, it has been picking up lately, but it’s not like overheating. So, I’m not worried about the Fed rising rates right now. I mean, if interest rates remain sharply in Europe that could put some upside pressure on long term interest rates in the U.S. It’s not what – I don’t see them really getting much higher, but they could probably get much more volatile in the short term, so that’s one risk factor to watch.NB: Interesting. Okay, Andres, what is something that gives you confidence in your approach, your portfolio or investing otherwise?AC: Oh! I think that having strategies have proven to work over long periods of time, that’s really reassuring for me because I have some strategies that are, well, 100% quantitative. I only follow the rules and I have seen – I have kind of looked at the performance over the past several decades and it gives me, you know, a past history does not guarantee future results, but it provides a really good estimate about what is reasonable to expect. So, when you know what is reasonable to expect for your investments that kind of provides more certainty. You know how the portfolio would have performed in a year like 2008, have you have generated a bear market such as – or even a bubble, a stock market bubble such as the dot-com bubble, so you can get an idea about how your performance should fluctuate in stock market bubbles or in big depressions and that provides a lot of certainty, you know what can be expected.NB: Okay, okay. What’s the favorite idea you have? Let’s talk about that now.AC: Amazon (AMZN) is arguably one of my best ideas right now. I think investors for a long time they have wrongly believed that the best is in the past for the company because if you look at [indiscernible] and the companies worth [about 1 trillion], so everybody is thus saying, oh! Okay. It’s over. It’s just too big, but it is not only growing very well in terms of topline growth, but I think Amazon is going to have expanding profit margins in the middle term because Amazon web services is going to be a largest part of the overall equation and it has not even yet started the international expansion. I think for a company like Amazon, you have to think about the operating cash flows and it has always been trading, you know, between 20 times and 30 times operating cash flows and it’s still within that range.So, it’s not over powered at all by my opinion. I think Amazon is going to keep surprising investors; it’s going to produce very solid returns going forward. Another big cap that I really like is Alibaba. Again, it’s trading like at 25 times earnings expectation and its growing [indiscernible] at 38% and the business model is very, very profitable. It has been making some investments, so sometimes when you look at the quarterly reported earnings, you have fluctuations, but over the long-term it is the [little on] e-commerce and earnings in digital payments and cloud computing in China. So, when you look at the risk and reward in Alibaba, it has enough room to consumer [indiscernible].NB: Amazon is trading right near its 52-week as we record this. [21, 71] on February 19, is that still a good entry point you think for people?AC: Oh! Yes. Over the long term, absolutely. I mean, I won’t rush into within their whole position right now. You probably should take it slowly and win it over a time, and if you’re looking to add the stock over the next five years, I think you want to get some really good returns.NB: Okay. And then, Baba has also done very well and there is always a – somewhat of a sell-off due to the coronavirus in late January from the looks of it, but it has since rebounded not quite at 52-week highs, but not that far away either. Is this about as good as an entry as you would get you think? Or there too is it worth waiting?AC: No, I think that if you are on to holding it over the long term, you want to start buying now. Maybe again, not to hold position when the stock is at all-time highs. You – it’s better to buy slowly, but if you have a long term horizon, this is like right time to start buying Alibaba in my opinion.NB: Very cool. Alright, so you mentioned – we mentioned Uber at the top, AliBaba and Amazon, anything else that you are particularly bullish on right now?AC: Oh! Yes. I think the software sector is going to produce massive winners in the U.S. market. I have a position in Alteryx (AYX), The Trade Desk (TTD), Salesforce (CRM), they are multiple companies, which I think the market is underestimating the resiliency of these businesses because they are not -- they have not seen the software sector operating under a recession, so everybody thinks okay, technology, high growth; they’re going to be volatile, they’re going to face declines in revenue during the recession, but when you really turn [indiscernible] business, they are like key paths for the clients.I don’t think any client is going to move away from companies such as Alteryx or Salesforce because they have less money to spend. On the contrary, software is critical for a business right now, so they are going to produce consistent revenue growth and they are going to produce expanding profit margins in the future. Some of these stocks are relatively expensive, so you need to be careful about [indiscernible] and take it slowly, but again, I think the software sector is probably going to generate massive gains for investors in the years ahead.NB: Alteryx, AYX is that symbol. I’d admit I have not heard much about this one recently. What can you tell me about that company?AC: It’s a great company. It’s in the business of trading to make data analysis available to non-experts. You know the company is trying to enter into the science under the research, but it can be complicated if you need sophisticated learning and lot of implementation there. So, I think it’s basically making easy to almost everyone to do data analysis under the science. So, demand has been moving, the company is growing at 60% and it has – when you read what the customers say about Alteryx, they just love it and it’s really easy.If you’re Alteryx and you’re selling your service to a customer, it’s really easy for the customer to see where the value-add is because you can improve some processes and you can save money. You can provide insights into customer behavior and you can accelerate sales. So, kind of the services they pay for themselves, and I think it’s going to be like a huge opportunity over the long-term. In this case, Alteryx is a bit [hurt] in the short-term, so you have to be especially careful when buying, do not rush into the whole position. But again, over the long term and if you buy in this I think you’re [indiscernible] to do the right.NB: Yes, Alteryx, again, AYX I just pulled up here your article on this from December and you say here in the summary bullets, data is the new gold and Alteryx is a major beneficiary from the data analytics boom, which I think is kind of a nice way of summing it up, so interesting idea there.Okay, Andres Cardenal, thank you very much. Lastly, disclosures, I, Nathaniel Baker, I do have a position – very old one, but I do have to disclose it, in Amazon, AMZN, long position and no positions in any of the other securities mentioned on today’s podcast. Andres, what about you?AC: Well, I have a position in Amazon, Alibaba, Alteryx, Salesforce, The Trade Desk.NB: Okay, wonderful. Well, that wraps up today's show. Thank you all for listening and we look forward to speaking to you again next time."
4313006,102764,2019-12-17T17:42:26-05:00,"Data is the new gold, and Alteryx is a major beneficiary from the data analytics boom.Customers love the company's solutions.The company is growing at full speed and outperforming expectations.Alteryx has plenty of room for sustained growth and increasing profit margins going forward.Alteryx is an investment proposition with above-average risk levels, but the stock could more than compensate for those risks with the attractive potential for gains over the long term.","Data is the new gold, and Alteryx (AYX) is a leading beneficiary from the data analytics revolution. The company is growing at full speed while also outperforming Wall Street expectations, and it has plenty of potential for sustained growth and expanded profitability in the years ahead.Make no mistake, Alteryx is a volatile stock operating in a competitive landscape that is prone to disruption. However, as long as the business fundamentals remain intact and management keeps executing well, the stock is well positioned for attractive returns going forward.Data analytics is one of the most critical priorities for all kinds of businesses nowadays. Data-driven decisions are crucial in terms of leading the business in the right strategic direction and increasing efficiency across the board. Staying behind the competition in data analytics can be a fatal error in times when everyone is aggressively leveraging on the power of hard data to outperform the competition.Alteryx provides software to make this data analysis process simpler, easier, and more efficient. The company calculates that its total addressable market is worth nearly $28 billion and over the coming years the size of such a market opportunity is expected to reach as much as $49 billion.Alteryx has over 5,600 active customers, including 34% of the Global 2000. The net expansion rate was 132% last quarter, as customers continue to invest in the company's solutions. This speaks well about Alteryx and its ability to generate value for customers.The company was recognized as a Gartner Peer Insights Customer Choice in 2019, which is a recognition of vendors by verified end-user professionals. The reviews from users are clearly impressive.Source: AlteryxSpruce Point Capital Management recently published some quotes from their conversations with Alteryx users and industry experts. Based on these testimonies below, the company is truly outstanding in terms of the quality of its services and customer satisfaction.Source: Spruce Point Capital ManagementSource: Spruce Point Capital ManagementAlteryx is benefitting from multiple growth engines in the years ahead. IDC calculated there would be $2 trillion spent on digital transformation in 2019 alone. Last year, the World Economic Forum found that 29% of all work is performed by machines, and this is expected to grow to 42% by the end of 2022.By automating both simple and complex analytic tasks with the Alteryx platform, the company can significantly increase the productivity for all categories of data workers across the enterprise. Alteryx is agnostic to the shape, size, and location of data, as well as agnostic to how the data is consumed. This puts the company in a strong position to profit from the increasing demand for automation.Another key trend is the convergence of analytic personas. Business professionals with no coding abilities are venturing into data analysis and working side by side with professionally trained data scientists. Alteryx is focused on addressing the requirements of users with a variety of skills, coding abilities, and comfort with advanced analytic capabilities.Alteryx is growing at full speed, while also consistently outperforming Wall Street expectations. The financial reports for the third quarter of 2019 confirm that the company is firing on all cylinders across the board.Revenue during the quarter amounted to $103.4 million, an increase of 64% year-over-year and representing a net expansion rate of 132%. Adjusted earnings per share amounted to $0.24, surpassing analysts' expectations by $0.15 per share.Source: AlteryxLooking at the evolution of profit margins, it is important to note that Alteryx retains 90% of revenue as gross profit. Even when considering research and development and general and administrative expenses, the business is still widely profitable after including these items. The lion's share of expenses is sales and marketing, which currently accounts for 51% of revenue and keeps overall profit margins under pressure.Source: AlteryxOver the long term, management is planning to take the operating margin from 1% of revenue to 35%-40%. The main drivers behind this expected increase in profitability are scale, efficiencies, and a reduced impact from sales and marketing on a growing revenue base.When you look at the valuation in terms of ratios such as price to earnings, Alteryx would seem irrationally expensive, with a forward PE ratio around 115. However, we need to consider that current earnings are not truly reflecting the company's true underlying earnings power because sales and marketing expenses represent 50% of revenue right now.Sales and marketing is money invested for further growth. In fact, Nike (NKE) refers to sales and marketing as ""demand creation"" in its financial statements. If the company is correctly assessing the profitability of those marketing investments, this money should come back to the business - and then some more - in the form of increased revenue in the years ahead.When you think about it, Alteryx is making a gross margin of around 90% on revenue, and the company has enormous opportunities for growth. From this perspective, management is doing the right thing by prioritizing long-term growth above current profit margins.Since current earnings are clearly not the right measure to evaluate Alteryx and other high-growth software stocks, we can take a look at the price to sales ratio and its expected evolution going forward. The table below shows revenue estimates, growth rates, and the implied forward price to sales ratios based on these assumptions.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialBased on these growth expectations, Alteryx is not cheap at all, but it is still priced in line with other high growth companies in the software sector. Looking at how the price to sales ratio has evolved for Alteryx, valuation has retraced substantially in recent months, mostly because high growth software stocks, in general, have pulled back.Data by YChartsImportantly, forward-looking valuation ratios are based on a particular set of expectations about the business. When the company outperforms those expectations, the stock price tends to increase. Alteryx has an impeccable track record in this area, and the company has delivered both earnings and sales numbers above Wall Street estimates in each and every quarter since its IPO in March of 2017.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialWall Street analysts are consistently running from behind and raising their revenue estimates for Alteryx. As long as this trend remains in place, better than expected performance and rising expectations for future performance would mean that Alteryx stock is ultimately cheaper than what current expectations are implying.Data by YChartsIt is interesting to note that Salesforce (CRM) disclosed some filings with the SEC after the Tableau (DATA) acquisition, and the fillings showed that internal financial forecasts for Tableau are materially ahead of Wall Street estimates at the time of the acquisition. I wouldn't be too surprised to learn that Alteryx also has more ambitious targets than what Wall Street is currently expecting from the company.Managing expectations is of the utmost importance for high growth stocks in the software business, and management tends under-promise and over-deliver in comparison to market expectations. The fact that Alteryx has consistently crushed expectations since being a public company supports this idea.Alteryx operates in an emerging industry with enormous potential for growth, but success attracts the competition, and investors need to keep a close eye on the competitive landscape going forward.Many analysts seem to believe that a larger player such as Microsoft (MSFT) could be a major competitive threat for Alteryx. However, it can be difficult for a tech giant to compete with the same flexibility and focus as a specialized player in a particular segment. Instead, chances are that a bigger player such as Microsoft may want to buy Alteryx, which would require a purchase price considerably above current market prices for the stock.As long as Alteryx keeps delighting its customers with superior solutions, the company should be more than fine from a competitive point of view. But the industry is still prone to disruption, so this is a key factor to monitor when assessing a position in Alteryx.Valuation is always a major concern for high growth companies in the software sector. The stock is not too expensive in comparison to peers, and valuation is not excessive at all based on the company's track record. As a reference, the average price target among the analysts following Alteryx is $126, which implies a healthy upside potential of over 30% from current levels.But still, when growth expectations are high and valuation ratios are elevated, the stock can be vulnerable to the downside in case of any disappointment. Even in the absence of any company-specific factors, these kinds of stocks can be quite volatile.That said, volatility and risk can be very different things for investors. If the business fundamentals remain strong and management continues executing well, price corrections in Alteryx should be considered an opportunity to buy an exceptional growth business at a more convenient price and with a long-term investment horizon."
4316758,105372,2020-01-14T12:07:06-05:00,Advanced analytics capabilities are now table stakes for achieving competitiveness in many industries.Increasing volumes of data as well as increasing variety in the types and sources of data is driving the need for intuitive data analytic software.Alteryx should continue to benefit as companies move from traditional tools like spreadsheets to specialized self-service analytic software.,"In recent years the volume of data being generated and stored globally has exploded and as companies with advanced analytic capabilities tend to outperform their peers across a broad range of metrics, analytics is now a required competency. Firms must improve their analytic capabilities and access to advanced tools to remain competitive, which is leading to rapid growth in areas like database, search and analytic software.Figure 1: Analytic Capabilities and Performance(source: Bain)The amount and diversity of data (type, format, and source location) are rapidly increasing and this is driving the need for efficient tools to create and maintain data pipelines which convert raw data into monetizable insights. While there are now a wide range of opensource tools available, like Python and R, which have powerful and flexible analytic capabilities they require some knowledge of programming and are more commonly used by people with a background in computer science or data science. Alteryx offers easy to use and intuitive self-service analytic software, which is targeted at business analysts not data scientists and primarily aims to replace tools like spreadsheets, not specialized data science software. While there may be some trade offs in capabilities like flexibility this is more than made up for by its ease of use by non-specialists, allowing access to data insights to be democratized.Traditional tools have a number of weaknesses for use as self-service analytics tools by business analysts, including:Figure 2: Percentage of Organizations Using Data Analysis Tools(source: HBR)Self-service data preparation using spreadsheet software remains common today with approximately 8% of employees using spreadsheets for self-service analytics. There are an estimated 21 million advanced spreadsheet users worldwide, who on average spend 26 hours per week working on spreadsheets. These spreadsheets were not designed for modern big data requirements and as a result are inefficient, causing an estimated $60 billion of lost productivity in the U.S. every year by advanced spreadsheet users.Table 1: Estimated Cost of Inefficient Use of Spreadsheets(source: Created by author using data from Alteryx)The global market for big data and analytics software is large and growing rapidly. IDC estimated the market size to be $49 billion in 2016 and projected it to grow at a rate of 10.5% annually through 2021. Within the big data and analytics software market Alteryx's software addresses the business intelligence and analytic tools, analytic data integration and spatial information analysis markets, which collectively represented approximately $19 billion in 2016 and were projected to grow at a rate of approximately 8.8% through 2021. Alteryx also estimates that there is an additional $10 billion opportunity their platform can address by replacing spreadsheets for advanced data preparation and analytics.Alteryx (AYX) offers self-service data analytics software which is designed to improve the productivity of business analysts by bringing a fragmented data analytic pipeline into one service. The functionality of Alteryx's platform includes accessing various data sources, cleaning and preparing data, and performing a variety of analyses. The software aims to replace traditional tools by offering ease of use, speed, sophistication of analysis and an intuitive user interface with a visual workflow. Alteryx's ultimate goal is to make their platform as ubiquitous in the workplace as spreadsheets are today.Alteryx promotes the following virtues of their platform:The software can be licensed for use on a desktop or server, or it can be delivered through a hosted model. Subscription periods for the platform generally range from one to three years with fees typically billed annually in advance and revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Revenue is also generated from professional services, including training and consulting.Alteryx's platform includes:Alteryx continues to achieve high revenue growth through increased customer numbers and expansion of revenue per customer. This revenue growth is yet to show significant signs of decline, indicating Alteryx still has significant room to grow before reaching market saturation. Alteryx's revenue growth rate is broadly in line with other SaaS companies which offer software related to data.Figure 3: Alteryx Revenue(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Figure 4: Alteryx Revenue Growth(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Alteryx is pursuing a number of growth strategies including:Figure 5: Alteryx Customers(source: Created by author using data from Alteryx)Alteryx employs a ""land and expand"" business model which aims to increase revenue per customer over time. Customers are often offered a free trial which is then followed by an initial subscription to the platform. Alteryx then try to increase use of the platform across departments, divisions, and geographies of the organization as the benefits of the platform are realized. This can be seen in the customer cohort data where revenue for each cohort expands significantly over time.Figure 6: Annualized Subscription Revenue by Customer Cohort(source: Alteryx)Figure 7: Alteryx Net Expansion Rate(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Figure 8: Alteryx Revenue per Customer(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Alteryx's gross profit margin is high, even by the standards of enterprise software companies and this is likely to lead to high operating profit margins as Alteryx continues to scale. Alteryx's ability to achieve and maintain such high gross margins is indicative of a strong competitive position in the market.Figure 9: Alteryx Gross Profit Margin(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Alteryx has exhibited significant operating leverage in the past and are likely to achieve consistently positive operating profits going forward. Based on Alteryx's gross profit margin typical operating expenses for enterprise software companies Alteryx is likely to eventually achieve an operating profit margin of above 30% which along with Alteryx's high growth rate support current valuation multiples.Figure 10: Alteryx Operating Profit Margin(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Most of Alteryx's operating leverage is being achieved through reduced sales and marketing expenses relative to revenue. This trend is likely to continue as Alteryx continues to grow and build a stable base of subscription customers. As a subscription software provider Alteryx's sales and marketing expenses should be expected to be a large burden as the company establishes a market presence, particularly while the company is growing rapidly.Figure 11: Alteryx Operating Expenses(source: Created by author using data from company reports)Not only is Alteryx likely to achieve a high level of profitability as the business scales, it is also likely to generate significant free cash flow. Alteryx's business has relatively low capital expenditure requirements and in recent years Alteryx has exhibited the ability to consistently generate free cash flow despite their current high growth rate.Figure 12: Alteryx Free Cash Flow(source: Created by author using data from Alteryx)Alteryx faces competition from a range of companies including incumbents offering traditional tools, specialized self-service data analytics software providers, open source software and cloud storage providers who will look to continue expanding their offerings to provide customers with holistic solutions.Alteryx has been assessed by Gartner in the Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms Magic Quadrant, although there is overlap with the Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms Magic Quadrant. Leaders in business intelligence include Microsoft (MSFT), Tableau (CRM) and Qlik whilst leaders in machine learning include KNIME, RapidMiner and TIBCO.Figure 13: Gartner Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms(source: Sisense)Gartner rates Alteryx relatively low on completeness of vision as they are not a standout vendor in terms of automation, deep learning or the Internet of Things and they do not appeal to expert data scientists. This is a reflection of Alteryx's niche strategy, offering an intuitive and easy to use platform for non-experts. While reduced functionality may limit adoption amongst data scientists, Alteryx's strategy has the potential to help them reach a much broader base of users who place greater value on ease of use.Figure 14: Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms(source: Alteryx)The Forrester Wave assessment of the business intelligence and machine learning software markets is broadly similar to the Gartner assessment. Alteryx was not included in the Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning Solutions assessment as it is a data blending tool with the ability to run R scripts and does not have native machine learning capability.Traditional ToolsTraditional tools like spreadsheets are likely to remain common for more basic applications but as software requirements increase specialized tools are likely to be more widely adopted.Self-Service Data AnalyticsThere are a wide range of self-service data analytics tools available which are designed for different applications. Visualization tools like Tableau and Spotfire are designed primarily to allow users to visually explore datasets. Specialized self-service data analytics software like SAS are designed to allow powerful and flexible quantitative and visual analysis of data sets but tend to be less intuitive and have a steeper learning curve.Open Source SoftwareThere are a wide range of open source tools available for data analytics including R, Python, Pytorch and TensorFlow. These tools are less intuitive and require a basic knowledge of programming which limits their widespread adoption. It is possible that these tools will be made easier to use over time increasing their adoption by general business analysts. It is also likely that a basic level of programming knowledge will become more common amongst knowledge workers leading to more widespread adoption.Cloud ComputingThe major cloud computing providers already offer an assortment of business intelligence and data analytics services and I expect these offerings to be expanded and more closely integrated with their cloud offerings in the future as these companies seek to offer customers holistic solutions. I believe Microsoft and Amazon (AMZN) are likely to be the most competitive in this area. Google (GOOG) is also likely to have a strong service offering but their weak enterprise DNA may continue to hold them back even if they have technically superior solutions.For Alteryx to be successful as a specialized provider of self-service data analytic software it must offer customers a compelling value proposition where the ease of use and efficiency of the software justify the higher cost relative to traditional tools. Alteryx must also ensure that their software offers customers sufficient benefit to justify the cost and complexity of having an additional service provider when they could use a cloud computing vendor as a one stop provider of all services.Despite Alteryx's high EV/S ratio I believe the company is significantly undervalued due to its strong prospects going forward. Both revenue and profit margins are likely to continue improving significantly in coming years which I believe will result in an increase in the share price despite the inevitable multiple contraction as growth slows. Based on a discounted cash flow I estimate an intrinsic value of $195 per share."
4310582,104952,2019-12-04T15:30:35-05:00,"Alteryx is a market-leading BI (Business Intelligence) platform that rates highly across capabilities and user support.Alteryx’s ability to land enterprise deals remained exceptional as of Q3, given the 92% growth in the number of client expansions greater than $250,000 ARR.Alteryx will likely break the $500 million revenue barrier by the end of 2020, where we expect to see a ~15% upside with a price target of ~$130 per share.","Alteryx (AYX) will continue to benefit from the strong fundamentals and macro trends in data analytics going forward. The Q3 sees a 65% YoY revenue growth and 30% YoY customer growth. Ultimately, we maintain our bullish view on the company, which we believe has developed a market-leading BI (Business Intelligence) platform that rates highly across capabilities and user support. We believe that the strong demand for the product indicates a high chance of guidance beat continuation in Q4 despite the raised outlook that sees the full-year revenue guidance at $389 million - $392 million with EPS of $0.57 - $0.6.Among all the other things, we believe that Alteryx's strong product ecosystem has been the key growth driver that allows it to become a market-leading platform. Through its highly-rated products, Designer, Connect, Server, and Promote, Alteryx covers the entire data analytics life cycle that ranges from data discovery, preparation, processing, and modeling.(source: g2crowd)Based on 121 reviews in G2Crowd, Alteryx scores at 4.4/5, which is relatively high compared to other competitors such as Microsoft Power BI (MSFT), Tableau (CRM), and Domo (DOMO). The product also has stronger ratings across support quality, onboarding, usability, and product roadmap where it scores at the highest end of the range on each category. The 87% confidence rating in the product direction category is in line with the management's overall long-term growth thesis, which we believe is indeed promising.Going forward, the company will grow the company around three key pillars, which would be automation, convergence, and community. In short, we see how each of the growth pillars corresponds with the overall improvements across product roadmap, user experience, and business development/use case scenarios. In Q3 in particular, we saw how the automation element has kicked in to enable Alteryx to land large enterprise clients with data-related challenges across various functions and sectors such as pharmaceutical and manufacturing. As per the management's comment, the solution has delivered substantial values to the users so far:Looking at how much time and cost is saved with the platform, we have huge confidence that the company is in the best position to replicate such use cases and navigate complex enterprise deals further in the next few quarters. In Q3 alone, Alteryx's ability to land enterprise deals remained exceptional, given the 92% growth in the number of client expansions greater than $250,000 ARR that drove the company's overall 132% net expansion.Considering the growing challenges enterprises face in data-driven decision-making processes across sectors and functions, there is no doubt that Alteryx is sitting at a fast-growing market with interesting upside potentials. However, the competition will quickly become the key risk factor that can gradually erode any player's product-driven value proposition going forward. In the space, Alteryx competes with BI players of various sizes such as Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP (SAP), and others. With that in mind, we view Alteryx's proven excellence in product usability, customer support, and use case implementation as a long-term value driver and margin of safety for the stakeholders.Driven by the solid ~82% TTM growth rate, ~90% gross margin, and operating cash flow profitability over the last two years, Alteryx will expect to break the $500 million annual revenue barrier by the end of FY 2020. With the strong fundamentals and consecutive guidance beat in the last few quarters, we are of the opinion that Alteryx can maintain its current ~18 P/S going forward as long as it continues its outperformance. The midpoint of forward P/S of 14.23 and current P/S of ~18, unchanged share count of ~64 million, and $519 million forward revenue further drive our estimated price target of ~$130 per share by the end of FY 2020. Consequently, the figure will also put the company at ~$8.4 billion market cap, which is ~46% lower than the past Tableau acquisition by Salesforce earlier in June 2019."
4339138,105539,2020-04-22T12:30:54-04:00,"Alteryx is a hyper-growth business that is undervalued for its combination of growth and efficiency.Because it lacks comparables, Alteryx valuation is skewed incorrectly lower due to market ""clumping""There is still room to buy due to the recent pull back, although larger deals may take longer to close now.","Alteryx (AYX) is a hyper-growth enterprise SaaS company that is undervalued based on fundamentals. Looking at the chart below, we see a lack of equivalently growing companies, combined with the business trading below the trend line.I have highlighted Alteryx with a circle to show that it is trading below the trend line of ~100 SaaS businesses on an EV/2020 basis compared with efficiency. Efficiency is measured as revenue growth + LTM free cash flow.Given an R-squared of 0.40, 40% of the variation in the Y-axis (multiple) is explained by the efficiency. This is a fairly high number for any distribution in a stock pattern given the number of variables that can affect the multiple and valuation.Source: Public CompsBecause of a lack of equivalent comparables and the recent sell-off, the market has not yet fully priced in the growth that Alteryx offers. The nearby comparables on a growth basis include CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Zoom (ZM), which both have traded well above their fair value and are benefiting from work from home trends. Alteryx is yet to experience such a publicly stated spike in usage, but its valuation has not yet reached fair value based on this trend line. My thesis is because Alteryx does not immediately benefit from the new work from the home trend, its valuation has not come in line where it should be. This is a good time to start a position in the name for a long-term investment.Source: BrandsAlteryx improves how companies make decisions by allowing them to use their data more effectively and easily. From their recent 10-K:To give a sense of customer scale, Alteryx primarily drives revenue from large customers (Global 2000). Per the 10-K:Given this large-scale adoption combined with their strategy of land-and-expand, the company has built a customer moat that allows them to scale in big brands and grow ARR.In addition to this customer moat, customers drive more value from the platform the more they use it. The platform becomes more embedded and institutional knowledge builds around it. This business model design shows up in the company's key indicators like renewal rates and upsell.Alteryx has divided their platform into open and modular cores to make it easy to expand the product. This makes upselling a natural process where the customer feels pain and can easily upgrade. Per 10-K:Alteryx leverages value-add resellers and partners to sell their software, which allows them to keep control on sales and marketing costs. Further, it has built strategic integrations with large players to give them the motivation to show Alteryx to customers. These integrations include:The company considers its competition as ""Dataiku Inc., MicroStrategy Incorporated, Paxata, Inc., Talend S.A., Tableau Software, Inc., TIBCO Software, Inc., and Trifacta, Inc."" per the 10-K.Digging in a bit deeper, many of these are legacy players who Alteryx is actually disrupting with new technology like JSON and REST APIs.For a long-term investment like this, I consider the customer moat and technology advantage as a durable edge over these legacy players.Alteryx grew to $417 million in top-line revenue in 2019, a growth rate of 64% YoY. Combined with disciplined spending and a positive EBIT of $6 million, it is operating in the rarefied air of companies like Zoom.This combination of revenue growth and profitability deserves the premium multiple the company trades at, but the key is relative valuation in a stratosphere like this. We can see from the trend line above that it has not fully been backed in.Source: 10-KBuilding on the trend line analysis above and relative valuation, I dove deeper into the comparable valuation on a number of metrics. We can see from the analysis below that Alteryx, currently, trading well below its fair value. Even if we remove ZM as an outlier, we still see 20%+ upside on a comparable basis to hyper-growth peers. I conducted analysis across a number of relevant tests, as you can see below.Source: Public 10-K dataAlteryx is a high growth business that showed signs of profitability last year. Because it does not directly benefit from work from home, its valuation has not run in line with other equivalently growing businesses like Zoom, CrowdStrike, and Adyen. Looking at a number of relative value metrics as well as the internal valuation, I come to a fair value that is 20%+ above its current price. This is a good time to start a long-term position in this name."
4302256,103480,2019-11-04T13:33:15-05:00,"Alteryx posted strong Q3 results that beat on both the top and bottom line, contributing to a mild recovery in Alteryx shares.Alteryx's stock has been under pressure since early October, when a Workday announcement on growth deceleration sent the software sector into a tailspin.Growth concerns are hardly an issue for Alteryx, however, whose revenue growth actually accelerated to 65% y/y in Q3.Still ~35% below all-time highs, investors have a chance to nab Alteryx at more reasonable prices.","Swept alongside the massive software sector correction that began in early October with Workday's (WDAY) announcement of a growth decline, investors in Alteryx (AYX) have felt plenty of pain over the past several weeks, as this beloved Wall Street favorite fell from highs near $150 to below $100. Many investors observed (correctly) that Alteryx was getting a long-overdue correction as one of the then-most expensive stocks in the software sector.While we can't argue that Alteryx remains an expensive stock trading at double-digit forward revenue multiples, we also can't deny that its fundamentals are among the best in the industry. The entire software sector fell off in October on concerns that growth was slowing down across the board - yet this appears to be a company-specific issue that's plaguing only certain names, like Workday. Alteryx, to the contrary, is growing faster than ever. Strong Q3 results from Alteryx prompted a minor recovery in shares, up ~8% since releasing the earnings print:Data by YChartsThe question for investors now is: does Alteryx's recovery rally have steam, or is the company in a permanent correction that won't see a return to >$100 share prices for a long time?In my view, Alteryx is one of the only software stocks that merits its huge valuation premium. The bullish case on this stock rests on the following drivers:Great product, great execution - the only pitfall in Alteryx is a rich valuation, which last month's correction has partially resolved. At present share prices around $100, Alteryx trades at a market cap of $6.23 billion. After netting out the $987 million of cash and $624 million of convertible debt on Alteryx's balance sheet, we are left with an enterprise value of $5.87 billion. For the following fiscal year, Wall Street analysts are expecting an average of $497.9 million in revenues, per Yahoo Finance. This represents just 28% y/y growth over the midpoint of Alteryx's latest FY19 revenue guidance of $389-$392 million - which, considering Alteryx just grew Q3 revenues at a 65% y/y pace, seems quite conservative. (Alteryx's Q4 guidance fo $128-$131 million, by the way, represents +44-46% y/y growth over 4Q18 revenues of $89.2 million; a beat over Wall Street expectations of $126.2 million or +42% y/y).Figure 1. Alteryx guidance updateSource: Alteryx Q3 earnings releaseGiven that Alteryx almost invariably tends to blast past its own guidance (this quarter, revenue exceeded guidance by more than 10%), let's instead assume that Alteryx can manage to maintain a 35% y/y growth pace next year. Applying that growth rate to the high end of Alteryx's current-year revenue estimate, we arrive at an FY20 revenue projection of $529.2 million.This implies that Alteryx is trading at a current valuation of 11.1x EV/FY20 estimated revenues - which, though expensive, is a discount to Alteryx's previous valuation in the high teens, and considering Alteryx's rapid growth pace alongside rich margins and free cash flow profile, is a great entry point into the stock.To further examine just how strong Alteryx's fundamentals are, look no further than the company's most recent quarterly results:Figure 2. Alteryx 3Q19 resultsSource: Alteryx Q3 earnings releaseRevenues grew 65% y/y to $103.4 million, one of the fastest growth rates for a company at a >$400 million annualized revenue scale. The company even accelerated growth by six points relative to last quarter's 59% y/y growth pace. In addition, Alteryx beat its own guidance for $88-$91 million (41-45% y/y growth) and Wall Street's expectations of $90.4 million (+44% y/y growth) by nearly twenty points, showing us that we shouldn't take Alteryx's conservative projections too seriously.One of the key drivers facilitating Alteryx's huge growth rate is its net expansion rate. Alteryx continues to succeed in its ""land and expand"" business model, in which it first sells into an enterprise in smaller volume, then grows deployments over time. Alteryx notched a sky-high 132% net retention rate in Q3, indicating that Alteryx's average customer purchased 32% more than the prior year. It's also helpful to see that net expansion rates have been in a rough uptrend since last year:Figure 3. Alteryx net expansion rate trendsSource: Alteryx Q3 earnings releaseAlteryx's CEO, Dean Stoecker, went on to mention that the company notched 92% y/y growth in the number of expansion deals in excess of $250,000. Since expansion and renewal deals are cheaper to attain than new business, which requires a higher-touch sales process, Alteryx's success in renewals also bodes very well for margins.Kevin Rubin, Alteryx's CFO, also offered some helpful qualitative commentary to explain the huge revenue beat:What investors should realize by now is that Alteryx's trend of massively beating expectations is not a one-off incident. Last quarter, Alteryx's 59% y/y growth outpaced expectations for 48% y/y growth; the quarter before that, Alteryx's 51% y/y growth beat expectations for 42% y/y growth. Not only has Alteryx accelerated growth rates in each of the past two quarters (which is incredibly difficult to do at such high growth rates), it has always managed to beat expectations by at least a ~10 point margin.Alteryx's top-line strength also translated well into profits. As previously mentioned, Alteryx already has one of the highest gross margins in the software sector - which held flat at 91% year-over-year. Meanwhile, pro forma operating income rose 53% y/y to $22.0 millions, while pro forma EPS of $0.04 smashed Wall Street's expectations for a loss of -$0.07.Free cash flow continues to be another highlight that separates Alteryx from the rest of its growth software peers, many of whom are burning through cash (an unattractive situation in a market that has demanded more profitability ever since WeWork's public flameout).Figure 4. Alteryx cash flow trendsSource: Alteryx Q3 earnings releaseYear to date, Alteryx's free cash flow of $7.3 million (representing a 2.7% FCF margin) has grown 28% y/y, with plenty of room for further expansion.Despite the fact that Alteryx's fundamentals have only shown upward progression, the stock remains stuck at ~35% below all-time highs. Though part of this correction was necessary to reduce Alteryx's previously bloated valuation, I continue to believe that Alteryx's fundamentals support a continued rally. After all, few companies can manage multiple quarters of acceleration at a ~60% y/y growth pace while beating consensus expectations by double-digit point spreads. Buy Alteryx while it's still down."
4308947,105426,2019-11-25T07:48:19-05:00,"Alteryx's stock price fell despite having perfect fundamentals.Alteryx specializes in data science and machine learning, and therefore, not in competition with Business Intelligence companies.I am going long on AYX, though with tight stops to play out any remaining momentum.","After soaring 147% to reach an all-time high of $147 per share, Alteryx’s stock price has been on a freefall and is currently trading around $98. Alteryx (AYX) fell victim to the cloud sell-off, which happened as the result of nose bleed valuations popping due to heightened recession fears. Other SAAS companies like Slack, Zoom Video, and Twilio have been declining as well, and so far with no end in sight.What’s interesting is that the Alteryx stock price declined even as the company did everything right. In other words, when a growth company in a hyper growth sector has elevated valuations, it’s typically priced to perfection. On November 1, the company released its quarterly earnings that historically have exceeded the consensus expectation for perfection.Revenue came in at $103.4 million, which was up by 65.2% YoY same-quarter while GAAP EPS came in at $0.24. The EPS was $0.15 higher than the consensus estimates. The company also raised its outlook. It expects revenue to be between $389 million to $392 million. This represents an annual growth rate of between 53% 55%. This guidance was higher than the previously guided range of between $370 million and $375 million. It also raised non-GAAP operating income.To make it more interesting, what we know about Alteryx is that they tend to be conservative on guidance, so a raise of this level should’ve at minimum instilled new buying pressure. Yet, the AYX stock price fell the day of the announcement, and has been treading water ever since. The price action in Alteryx stock price is a lesson in the power of sentiment, and once it shifts, no amount of countervailing news seems to change its course.A retrace for growth stocks producing triple digit returns is healthy and inevitable. The ultimate question is due to recession fears. In a recession, obviously, the expected growth trajectory for AYX and other cloud based companies will be interrupted, pushing prices down much lower. Sentiment can shift irrationally, and right now the emotional trend is down.However, one factor I’ve noticed that has led to undue pressure for AYX is that it appears that the market does not have a good understanding of what Alteryx does, which has allowed for price dislocations. I think it’s crucial to understand the space it operates in as well as the advantages it has over competitors, so that when the trend does change, you can hold it with confidence.Alteryx is a company that offers data science and machine learning services. Their particular niche in the tech ecosystem involves providing the best tools and data to companies that specialize in business intelligence and other related services. In short, their services are complementary to those businesses, not their competition.Despite this, investors compare AYX with companies that are either not its peers or are not in direct competition with. Most Alteryx stock analysts have compared Alteryx to companies like Tableau, which was recently acquired by Salesforce. In fact, Alteryx’s stock price declined when Tableau announced its new product, Tableau Prep, which signals how much the consensus misunderstands AYX.I believe this is a mistake because, as I’ve mentioned already, Alteryx specializes in data science, machine learning and analytics, whereas Tableau is primarily a business intelligence company that also handles data visualization. In reality, Alteryx does not compete with Tableau. In fact, the two companies are partners. You can see this on the Gartner’s magic quadrant for Business Intelligence solutions here. The company is not there, and this is because Altryx is not in the business of using data to provide visualization purposes.Contrary to what many people believe, there is a key difference between data science and Cloud Business Intelligence (BI). A good Alteryx stock analysis needs to differentiate between data science and BI. BI is simply a process of analysing past data. Data Science, on the other hand, uses multiple sciences and sources of data to help make future predictions. In short, data science will help automate most of BI tasks in future.A good example of data science at work was what the New York Times (NYT) reported in 2012. A Target customer went to complain that the company was sending baby and mother care coupons to his home. He later found out that his daughter was pregnant. This is the kind of problem that data science can handle but BI cannot.Alteryx is more than a business intelligence platform. It is a data science and machine learning platform that provides more useful results to its companies. This is evident on the Gartner quadrant that is shown below, which shows companies that the company competes with.Source: AlteryxAlteryx provides companies with information that is more useful than what is provided by other data platforms like Tableau. In short, its capabilities are more in depth and powerful than other options in this field. Designer helps companies profile, prepare, blend, and analyse products and create visual workflows. Server helps to schedule, share, and run analytic processes and applications in a web-based environment. Meanwhile, Connect helps customers discover information assets and share recommendations in companies while Promote helps data scientists build and deploy predictive models in real time. This suite of products helps companies automate and converge various fields of data science.The cost savings and the usefulness of Alteryx is the main reason why its products cost more and companies are willing to pay for them. The cost per employee for Alteryx suite of products is $5,200 per year or $4,000 per year when on a 3-year contract. Tableau’s Data Prep on the other hand costs $840 per year. This is a significant premium and companies are prepared to pay for it. According to Alteryx, more than 5,600 global companies are using its products.Therefore, while Alteryx is not a cheap company, the reality is that it is very misunderstood, especially in its role as the true leader in data science and machine learning. This is evident in its ongoing growth. This means that the Alteryx share price would more than likely appreciate if the consensus truly understood the capabilities of the company vs. its true competition as well as the massive runway in front of it.Technical OutlookJust because I believe the company is mispriced based on current understanding and future growth, doesn’t mean it cannot make lower lows. Sentiment is a powerful force, and arguably the tide that drives movement in the market. It is obvious that the sentiment has shifted in AYX as well as most cloud stock (Microsoft excluded).My primary Elliott Wave count has AYX completing a clear 5-waves up in an extended uptrend. It’s possible that it can recover and extend further, but the weight of evidence is suggesting more downside. In a longer timeframe, I have AYX completing its primary wave 1, shown in the circled red number, and now in the middle of its primary wave-2.What we know about 2nd waves is that they are typically harsh, and reverse sentiment by retracing to the 50% – 61.8% retrace levels. This is based on averages, so it’s simply a guidepost. I’m not expecting a company as strong as AYX to retrace to these levels, and my own models have it as a long-term buy in the upper region of the green box on the chart, which coincides with q confluence of Fibonacci price clusters.AYX has completed a sharp move down, touched the 23.6% retrace level and is now in a corrective retracement, which appears to be the B wave in the larger degree wave-2. The evidence for this is that the structure of this retrace up is overlapping, which is not typical of a 5-wave trend change and strongly suggests corrective.Furthermore, I anchored a volume weighted average price (VWAP) to the all-time high, and this is highlighted in dark blue. This moving average, which factors in the average price along with the amount of shares purchased at each price point, offers a precise understanding of who is in control of the current trend.As of the writing of this post, the price is trading right at the VWAP, with the RSI in overbought territory. Furthermore, we have a classic negative reversal pattern unfolding in the RSI, where the RSI is making higher highs while the price is making lower highs. I expect this resistance to be difficult for AYX to break, especially in overbought territory, and this could signal the beginning of the final C-wave in the larger degree wave-2.Any sharp reverse down will confirm that we are in a C-wave correction, and my target zone is in the green box. It’s a confluence of Fibonacci extensions based on the length of the initial A-wave down, and retrace levels based on the length of the larger degree wave 1. I will likely begin layering in buys as it hits this target zone.I will look to invalidate my current thesis if AYX can: first, break the current VWAP, with the RSI resetting in a bullish posture – i.e., bottoming above the 50 line and heading back up. Secondly, develop an impulsive 5-wave move up as it moves back the $138 price zone with elevated volume. At this point I will look to go long AYX with tight stops to play out any remaining momentum in this stock before the larger degree wave-2 begins."

4319281,35181,2020-01-27T12:47:54-05:00,"Revenue growth of 65%+ for the last few years with no signs of slowing down.Company fundamentals remain strong and Rule of 40% is met.On the surface, this company appears overvalued, but not with gross margin factored in.Despite the recent bullish stock price, Alteryx is still one of my best stock picks.","In my last article on Alteryx, Inc. (AYX) back in September entitled ""Alteryx: Don't Look A Gift Horse In The Mouth,"" I gave the company a very bullish rating.It turns out that I was premature with my pronouncement as this company still had a long way to drop before bottoming out. Happily, the stock turned bullish in late December and is now up 16% since the article was published, as compared to the S&P 500 which is up 10%.My basic thesis hasn't changed. Company fundamentals are strong and Alteryx still meets the Rule of 40. Examination of the stock's valuation based on forward sales multiple suggests that Alteryx is quite overvalued. However, another perspective based on gross profit margin minimizes such concern. Based on the exceptional 65%+ revenue growth and relative valuation, I am retaining my very bullish rating for Alteryx.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.Alteryx's annual sales growth rate is a whopping 72.7%, up from the 3-year growth rate of 67.6%.(Source: Portfolio123)Alteryx's free cash flow margin TTM is a decent 6%. The free cash flow has been positive since late 2017.(Source: Portfolio123)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40 - some analysts use EBITDA and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the software company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In Alteryx's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 72.7% + 6% = 78.7%The calculation comes out substantially higher than 40%, indicating that Alteryx has a healthy balance between growth and profits.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated Y-o-Y sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated Y-o-Y sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Alteryx is positioned substantially higher than the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is very overvalued relative to its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate.But not so fast...Alteryx has a ""best-in-class"" gross profit margin of 91.5%.(Source: Portfolio123)Another way to look at relative valuation is to substitute forward gross profits estimate for forward sales estimate in the Y-Axis of the scatter plot (shown above).(Source: Portfolio123/private software)With this new scatter plot, Alteryx is much closer to the typical stock in my 152 stock digital transformation universe. Based on this second plot, I have to say that Alteryx is mildly overvalued, but not so overvalued as to ignore this stock as an investment.In my opinion, the measure of a superior product is in how sticky the product is. Alteryx doesn't publish customer retention but does provide its net expansion rate. Existing customers are not only retained but also spend substantially more on the product each year. Alteryx's dollar-based net expansion rate is 132%, much higher than almost all other software companies.Alteryx is focused on the top companies in the world, known as the Global 2000. Sales to larger enterprises are often ""lumpy"" and sometimes take longer to close. This translates to high volatility in the share price.Even a slight miss on guidance or a drop in billings can result in a drastic share price revaluation.While software stock valuations have come down in recent months, they are still high on a historical basis. Uncertainties, such as the rising tension in the Middle East, trade disputes, and President Trump's impeachment, could cause a market downturn. Software stocks tend to get hit hard during any market turbulence.Approximately 10% of Alteryx's business comes from the UK and more from the EU. So far, Alteryx's business has not been affected by Brexit and the sluggish economic environment in Europe but still a risk.Alteryx is one of the best companies out there if you consider the 65+% revenue growth, positive free cash flow, and 91% gross profit margin. The stock has bottomed from the pullback in stock price last year and is on a new bullish trajectory.I see no slowdown in revenue growth and no competition that can impede growth in the near future. The company fulfills the Rule of 40% by a wide margin. Therefore, I am retaining my very bullish rating for Alteryx."

4297519,21815,2019-10-21T03:25:26-04:00,"A sector-wide SaaS business software platform, sparked by concerns of slowing corporate IT spending, has taken the shares of Alteryx already 35% off their top.There is no reason the company will be affected all that much given the secular tailwinds provided by Big Data and the move to the cloud.While the shares are still expensive and could fall further, we think investors could start to nibble here, either directly or by selling put options.In any case, we also offer an alternative in the same SaaS space that has no valuation issues. In fact, it's downright cheap already.","Ever since we argued that there was a good buy moment in the shares of Alteryx (AYX) on May 21 last year, when the stock price was just $30.85, we have regretted not executing on our own advice, and with good reason:However, the shares are now off 35% from their 52-week high, which was just two months ago. There is clearly a massive correction going on, and a serious one, as the volume is also pretty high.What's more, Alteryx isn't the only high-growth, high-valuation SaaS business software stock that's being slaughtered these days:Data by YChartsThis is some serious damage. Take, for instance, a company that we did buy for the SHU portfolio, Trade Desk (TTD), which is also off 30% from its 52-week high (but as we bought at $55 that's not too bad, at least so far).What you also see is that a company like Atlassian (TEAM) has been hit milder despite actually producing some disappointing 2020 guidance just last week.We argued at the end of July 2018 that Atlassian was priced for perfection, but it was just $71 then and has simply kept on rising since:But it now seems that beating quarterly figures but providing 2020 guidance that ""just"" matches expectations is reason enough for the shares to tank (on absolutely massive volume), even after they had already tanked quite a bit before this.And what's more, it has provided a reason for the whole sector to tank further, which it did with some gusto. Alteryx was down 7% on Friday, for instance.Well, there are two reasons these high-valued SaaS business software companies are finding some considerable headwinds in the markets in the last two months:It would be logical to consider the second as the trigger of the first, and there is indeed quite a lot to be said for this, even if the timing is a few weeks off. The starting sign seems to have been given by the Cisco's (CSCO) Q4CC. Here is Barron's:The problem was not its Q4 results, but the company's outlook for its present Q1 quarter, for which revenue growth was guided as flat to +2%, where analysts had expected a growth of +7%. Moreover, the reason management cited for this reduced growth outlook was the trade war. From Barron's:You could argue that this still doesn't warrant a general selloff in SaaS business software stocks, as many of them have little to no China exposure. However, the rot from the trade war is spreading into a general economic slowdown to which business technology spending is strongly related.Bulls might not be too impressed with this either. Many of these SaaS business software companies are class-leading solutions and secular growth stories. Twilio (TWLO), for instance, is the obvious leader in a massive shift towards cloud communication platforms.Alteryx is the obvious leader in data analytics platform, Five9 (FIVN) the leader in cloud contact centers, and all of these are providing real value to customers and benefiting from a massive shift to the cloud. We are also not aware of Alteryx having any Chinese exposure.So, how serious is the reduction in IT corporate spending? Here is Barron's:However, the same article also cites Forrester analyst Andrew Bartels, who argues that software and cloud solutions continue to take market share from legacy on-premise hardware and consulting services, at least in terms of corporate budget priorities.What does this mean for Alteryx?In the light of this the 35% haircut seems overdone, but there is another way of looking at this.One could argue that the SaaS business software stocks were experiencing a bit of a bubble. One has to be precise here as to what that means, as companies like Alteryx and many of the other big SaaS cloud names are experiencing unprecedented growth, and some (like Alteryx) are already producing considerable cash flow or are even profitable already.We also argued, for instance, in the linked article where we flagged a buying opportunity for Alteryx above, that the SaaS platform model is simply one of the best around, as it creates so many opportunities for new revenue streams and positive feedback that a high valuation is fully justified.But the question simply is how high - and there is no good answer to that.Data by YChartsValuations run from a relatively cheap 10x sales in the case of Five9, a stock we happen to like, to 24x sales in the case of Slack (WORK). Alteryx is at the high end, despite that 35% plunge at nearly 19x sales.The picture changes somewhat on a forward basis (apparently YCharts doesn't have enough 2020 revenue estimates for Tufin Software Technologies (TUFN) and Slack, so these have disappeared from view):Data by YChartsAlteryx's valuation declines to a still steep 16x sales. One thing to keep in mind is that these valuations can be higher still if one bases them on the fully diluted share count.We know that share prices look ahead, but there aren't any signs that anything has changed for Alteryx. Revenue growth is maintained at 50%+:Data by YChartsAnd the company is generating positive cash flow:Data by YChartsAlteryx is already profitable, even in GAAP:Data by YChartsAlthough the earnings multiple is a frightening 200, we argue that a company that is generating nearly 90% gross margin and growing revenues at 50%+ should be able to generate considerable operational leverage sooner rather than later.While growth seems to continue unabated and the company is already well into the green, a potential worry is the emergence of competition. SA contributor Value Kicker has argued that:Basically the ""Excel spreadsheet ETL"" (extract, transform and load) market is going to be upended by the likes of Salesforce (CRM) and Microsoft (and Value Kicker also points to the emergence of open source alternatives like KNIME), cutting out the middleman, which is Alteryx, which automates ETL data into forms that can be interpreted by analytics packages like Tableau (DATA).There are a couple of objections one could pose:SA contributor Niki Schranz has argued that Alteryx's competitive position is really misunderstood - it's not operative in BI (business intelligence) but in data science and machine learning; witness the completely different price points.The biggest competitor here is SAS, a big, privately held company, but there are signs that Alteryx is winning market share from the former.We are with Schranz on Alteryx's market position, and so is the market. Yes, the shares have sold off 35%, but they are still up 60% this year, and the selloff is sector-related, not company-specific.So, we don't think there are compelling fundamental reasons for the selloff. Yes, corporate IT spending is slowing a bit, but there are no signs this is affecting the growth outlook for Alteryx, and the 35% haircut is pricing in a good deal of this already if it does happen.Are there technical reasons to buy? Well:This depends crucially on Monday - the stock crashed through its support line as well as its 200-day moving average on Friday, and on high volume. If the price recovers on Monday, we can still claim these levels held. If not, the stock could go down quite a bit more.Here is the frustrating thing; it's nearly impossible to argue for a convincing entry point, even provided the fundamental picture isn't changed all that much, if at all:The essence is that the market could ascribe a wide margin in multiples to what is a basically unchanged fundamental position, and it looks like big market players decided two months ago that the multiples had gotten out of hand.This is exactly the reason why we wrung our hands from the sidelines, lamenting not having executed on the clear entry point last year, as these clear entry points are very scarce.Stocks that trade on 20x sales multiples are subject to sudden changes in sentiment, and falls can be steep, as 10x sales is still a pretty hefty multiple, and the market can simply revert to the latter even if there is little or no change in the company's fundamental outlook.It's another ball game if the outlook does change though, and investors are all aware that even small changes can have large repricing effects. This is the reason that the stock is down 35% from its highs two months ago on the possibility that Alteryx can be affected by the reduced corporate IT spending.That remains to be seen. We actually think most of any decrease in the company's outlook is already priced in, and while it's near impossible to point to a bottom, we think investors could establish a first position in the stock at these levels.Even if the bottom isn't in, it's difficult to imagine a much deeper and more permanent fall, because we can't imagine the company's growth slowing a lot.For people who think this is still too risky and valuations still too high, we have an alternative that is already part of the SHU portfolio: Tufin Software. Shares are down even more, but it is also a category-leading company growing at 30%, while enjoying 80%+ gross margins and plenty of cash to keep on for years, as it is still investing heavily in growth.Tufin spouts revenues at $108 million (midpoint of guidance) with a market cap of $526 million and an enterprise value of $395 million, which results in a 2019 EV/S multiple under 4. That is downright cheap, in our view.What goes up must come down is the saying, and one can argue that quite a number of the SaaS stocks were flying just a little too close to the sun, with absolutely massive valuations.What has happened is that the prospect of less exuberant corporate IT spending has been the spark to ignite a pretty hefty rotation out of the sector, and although there are as of yet no signs that Alteryx's outlook has changed for the worse, it has gone down in sympathy.Given that the correction has been driven by high volume and valuations are still high, it is entirely possible that the correction isn't over. It's also possible Alteryx will feel some impact from lower growth in corporate IT spending.The problem is that market sentiment can knock valuation multiples around in a wide latitude, even if there are little problems with the business development on a fundamental level. But given the market position and fundamental growth story, as well as the company's sound financials, we think that investors could start to nibble here or sell out-of-the-money puts.The chance is you might be early and the stock keeps on correcting, in which case you can add because the fundamental position of the company is unaltered and its growth opportunity might be dimmed a bit, but we can't see growth declining by a lot given that it is driven by secular tailwinds (cloud, Big Data, etc.).So the company is likely to grow into its valuation over time in case you have nibbled too early when the shares were too expensive still. In any case, we have an alternative in the form of Tufin Software, whose shares are already cheap."
4296781,102101,2019-10-16T09:47:39-04:00,"Alteryx has what it takes to keep gaining market share.The current valuation multiples, while lofty, don't capture the growth that will be witnessed in the coming years.Alteryx is a BUY based on a combination of sustainable growth and improving margins which will propel cash flow acceleration.I have a price target of $124.","Alteryx (AYX) hasn't scratched the surface of how big it can become. I believe there are still ample opportunities to grow revenue from the rapidly evolving data analytics market. The company has a lot of opportunities to grow outside the United States. This, coupled with the initiatives to improve margins, will continue to sustain valuation in the coming quarters. I rate Alteryx a BUY with a price target of $124.The data science market is valued at $49 billion. Alteryx estimates its total addressable market at 9 million potential enterprise users. At a market cap of $6.8 billion, Alteryx has less than 1% market share, and the company has been around for over 20 years. This is a testament to how big the data analytics market has expanded. Alteryx is after the 9 million data analytics and the thousands of data scientists and statisticians that are graduating globally into the corporate world with the dream of earning a living by transforming data into actionable insights for better decision making. There is no doubt Alteryx is already skating where the puck will be, and I see a strong case for it to grow revenue with its solid line of data analytics technologies.The bullish case for Alteryx is that it will grow to be as popular as Microsoft (MSFT) Word or Tableau (NYSE:DATA) as a go-to data science tool for small and large enterprises. The best way to picture this is to imagine Microsoft excel 2.0. A popular data analysis tool used by businesses across the globe. Better still, picture it as the Oracle (ORCL) database for enterprises. The key selling point is that Alteryx is an all-encompassing tool for data analysis. I've been privileged to work on some interesting data science projects in the EMEA region across the FinTech and tourism sector. The only reason we didn't use Alteryx is that we didn't have a sales rep or marketing team from Alteryx convincing senior leaders on the need to give the tool a try. Brands like Tableau came knocking, and they were given a chance. Over the years, I've watched the proliferation of Tableau across enterprises in the EMEA region, and I don't see the reason why Alteryx can't keep expanding as there remains a strong demand for best of breed data analytics tools.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)I couldn't lay my hands on the latest ARR figures. However, the dollar-based expansion rate of 133% is a sign that customers see a true value in Alteryx's products. Going forward, gross and operating margin will continue to improve as customer acquisition cost drops. This will propel free cash flow, which is at 7.6% of revenue. Unlike a lot of unprofitable SaaS plays, Alteryx's FCF benefits from positive contribution from net income. This makes the FCF growth story more believable. However, Alteryx has to maintain its rapid growth story for the FCF growth narrative to be plausible. CAPEX has been moderate. Alteryx isn't totally debt free, though it has a net positive cash position. Aside from the debt issuance in 2018, there is no reason to worry about liabilities. Its quick and current ratio stand at 1.4 and 1.5, respectively, demonstrating Alteryx's ability to meet its short-term obligations. Also, the debt to equity ratio is moderate at 64%.Overall, the health of Alteryx's financials has improved over the years.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha, figures in $millions)Alteryx has a NEUTRAL quant rating. It has negative quant factor grades for value and profitability. It has an average analyst price target of $139 and a 2020E revenue growth of 33%, down from 83% in 2019.It's no longer a secret that data is the new oil. As a result, Alteryx has attracted a lot of investors who have collectively valued it at $7 billion. This implies an EV/Sales of 21 and EV/EBITDA of 288, which appears expensive. However, I think this valuation is still conservative, given the recent explosion of data we've had in the past five years. There remains a shortage of data science talent to help businesses drive more value from the vast volume of data that has been generated in the past five years. As these gaps get filled by enterprises, there will be a rapid backfill of these data analysis gaps, which will drive demand for data science tools like Alteryx. Just like the explosion of KYC accounts drove the need for scalable CRMs, birthing Salesforce (CRM), Alteryx has the potential to be the Salesforce of data analytics.Source: Author (Using Data from Seeking Alpha)These favorable trends in data analytics are the tailwinds driving my revenue and cash flow forecast. I'm assuming a double-digit revenue growth, which will only decelerate into the mid-teens by 2024. This is conservative as it means Alteryx won't hit the $1 billion in annual revenue mark until 2023.Salesforce recently acquired Tableau for $15.7 billion. While the data visualization market is replete with a lot of free and freemium visualization tools, the fact that Tableau was able to command a $15 billion valuation means there is value when you build a great product. I've used a lot of data visualization tools from Power BI, Google (GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Data Studio to Google Analytics, Tableau arguably stands out. I view Alteryx in the same light as Tableau. The speed at which data analysis will be required in the future means analysts have to be ready to upgrade from Excel to advanced data analytics tools. Alteryx will be on top of the list of data analysis tools to pick from when the time is right to upgrade. The thousands of Alteryx customers who have already upgraded can testify to this. The biggest competitor to a brilliant enterprise tool for data analysis is a custom-built tool for internal data analysis by an enterprise. Given the speed of data analysis that will be performed in the future, I don't see companies paying junior data analysts hefty salaries to develop data analytics tools and models from scratch when there is an accessible tool like Alteryx to the rescue.Source: Seeking AlphaAlteryx has enjoyed rapid double-digit revenue growth in recent quarters. Gleaning into the future, I expect this trend to continue. I also expect management to continue to succeed in its goal of improving operating margins and FCF. These developments are going to drive valuation in the coming quarters.Therefore, I will be initiating a BUY rating with a price target of $124."
4286885,105095,2019-08-20T14:16:29-04:00,"Alteryx has done well lately with it's stock nearly doubling and revenue up 59% YoY.However, the company's long-term competitive sustainability is in question as database companies provide BI tools directly.The presence of other free open source solutions is another competitive threat to take into consideration.","Big data is all the rage these days and the market for self-service data analytics solutions is new and rapidly evolving. Alteryx (AYX) is one such company that has taken advantage of the excitement in this space as the stock is up almost double its price YTD. And by all metrics, the company is doing well with second-quarter revenue up 59% YoY at $82.0 Million and net expansion rates of over 130%. It is in my view that the company will continue its rapid growth in the near future as more companies move away from traditional spreadsheets (and traditional business intelligence providers such as IBM and Oracle) play catch up. However, as a fundamental investor, I view companies on a 5- 10-year time horizon. In the case of Alteryx, competition is heating up and its place in the Business Intelligence landscape is precarious.Alteryx primarily works as an “ETL” (Extract, Transform and Load) tool. I’m simplifying this a bit but basically, it gets data, often from multiple sources, does the necessary calculations and formats it in such a way to be useful. So in the past, you would have a database, pull the data using Alteryx and load the data in a visualization tool such as Tableau (DATA). You need a tool such as Alteryx as usually the data extracts from the databases are not formatted well and need additional calculations. Visualization tools typically need data that is well-arranged; in other words, all the data must be in columns and no blank spaces. This is why historically Alteryx and Tableau are complimentary, I say historically as the Salesforce (CRM) acquisition materially changes the landscape. Source: ETL visual Source: Tableaupro.org In the past, a lot of the aggregation and manipulation of data was done manually in Excel spreadsheets. For example, you could have accounting data in one system such as SAP and customer data in another system such as Salesforce. In order to do analytics then (such as a basic customer segmentation report), an analyst would manually download the separate reports into an Excel file then copy and paste from the two separate reports into a new Excel sheet. From the consolidated Excel sheet, an analyst then would do his calculations and visualizations. This takes a lot of man-hours and is error-prone.Source: Alteryx Investor PresentationAlteryx has an advantage over traditional spreadsheets because it is very easy to understand by dragging and dropping processing tools to build a processing history called “workflow” by connecting multiple tools and pressing the play button to execute the processing. This allows for the automation of repetitive tasks and complex workflows eliminating the need for multiple linked Excel sheets and macros. Alteryx has some advanced statistic and data science tools, however, in my opinion, the majority of business users will not be using the statistical tools heavily. In my experience working in corporate finance, in most cases, the advanced features of Excel (such as statistics) are rarely used in a corporate setting. It takes a lot of training in order to correctly interpret data science calculations and the people with that sort of training are already familiar with programs such as R or Python. Therefore I am viewing Alteryx as a “pure” Excel spreadsheet replacement tool.Based on its place in the business intelligence workflow, Alteryx works as a sort of “middleman” (between a database and a visualization tool) and the best way to improve a process is to cut out the middleman. This is why in my view the Salesforce acquisition of Tableau is game-changing. Salesforce has a wealth of data and typically these needed to be extracted and manipulated into a format that will work for Tableau. However, once the systems are integrated, there will no longer be need for software like Alteryx. Microsoft (MSFT) already does something similar with its business intelligence offering. Microsoft has the database and offers for free its business intelligence tool, PowerBI which has both ETL capabilities, via Power Query, and visualization in one software. SAP (SAP) has an analytics cloud-based software that offers an end to end (meaning database to visualization) solution as well that would bypass the need for a tool like Alteryx.Compounding the difficulties Alteryx might face in the future is the availability of open-source alternatives. There are a few currently in the market but the one I’d like to focus upon is KNIME analytics. KNIME is basically an open-source version of Alteryx. Being open-source, KNIME has one huge advantage over Alteryx, in that it’s free.I’ve used both and from a business perspective, KNIME is a good enough replacement performance-wise. Now there could be other analytics embedded into Alteryx that I may not have used but as discussed earlier, it is my view that most business users will only use the most basic features of the software.Source: Alteryx workflowSource: KNIME workflow Looking at Gartner, a well-respected research and advisory firm providing information on information technology among other things, Alteryx and KNIME score reasonably close in terms of performance in both peer insights and in Gartner’s magic quadrant. And even if you can make the case that Alteryx performs better, it’s hard to argue against free. Source: Gartner peer insights Source: Gartner November 2018 Magic Quadrant per Alteryx Currently, Alteryx has the advantage in terms of name recognition and marketing however given the availability of alternatives and as people become more knowledgeable in business intelligence it will only be a matter of time before competitive pressures affect the company. In order to remain relevant, Alteryx could strengthen its product offering to include better visualization tools in order to capture more of the workflow. However, the need for an ETL tool decreases as database companies start integrating visualization directly to their software. I believe Alteryx will continue to do well in the near future as corporations move out of spreadsheets into other business intelligence tools. However, given the company’s sky-high valuation (currently at 276 forward P/E) and pending competitive threats, it is difficult to justify a buy at this price point."
4281937,105265,2019-08-06T05:14:31-04:00,"Alteryx is a leading data analysis software vendor. Its product targets a key trend in IT spend.Its accelerating growth and revenue retention proves the demand for the product. Alteryx combines these with very attractive unit economics.The valuation is rich, but if Alteryx can achieve growth estimates and its target profit margins, it would be worth significantly more.Competitive environment, however, has changed with Salesforce and Alphabet entering the space with acquisitions. Although Alteryx Management doesn't view this as an issue, we do.We're neutral on Alteryx despite our affection for almost every aspect of the company. We think that the estimates and the valuation doesn't factor in rising competition.","Alteryx (AYX) is a leading provider of data analysis software. Its easy to use product allows businesses to analyze data more efficiently and quickly. The focus of enterprises on being more agile and efficient will garner a growing portion of IT spend on products like those of Alteryx. Alteryx's growth profile and revenue retention reflects the market opportunity. The Company also boasts some of the best financials among peers of its size, and claims extremely high at scale profitability. Unfortunately, competition is strong with two of the most established data companies entering the space recently. We think that growth estimates don't factor in the rising competition and hence are neutral rated for an otherwise wonderful company.The big bottleneck in the data analysis process is wrangling with data in the preparation phase. The analysis itself is of course by far the most important and value-added phase of the process, but sometimes takes less time than the data preparation. Data wrangling causes unnecessary inefficiencies for easy to do, dull tasks.Alteryx is the leader in self-service data preparation and blending. Alteryx's software product helps companies overcome the issue in an easy to use way. Regular employees can use its software as opposed to just data scientists unlike with most data analytics tools. The software enables its customers to move through piles of data quickly and efficiently to get to insights as fast as possible.Alteryx benefits from the trend of enterprises and more specifically CIOs and CDOs focus on increasing business agility and use of data. The Company claims a massive core addressable market of $28 bn of business intelligence and analytics tools, analytic data integration, and spatial information analysis markets. This addressable market should grow going forward with it capturing a higher share of IT spend.Alteryx has done and is continuing to do the most important feat of a young SaaS company: accelerating revenues. This trend is expected to continue with the consensus estimating a revenue forecast resembling a ramp.Source: Seeking AlphaAlteryx combines this rapid growth with profitability. It has a whopping 90% gross margins. And even at this early stage it is profitable with 6% operating, 10% net and 12% operating cash flow margins.The business model is structurally more profitable than peers. The Company claims long-term target margins of 90-92% gross, 35-50% operating (up from 20-22% at the time of the IPO), and 30-35% free cash flow. These numbers are pretty much unmatched in its space, and will make Alteryx one of the most profitable operations in public markets.Alteryx demonstrates the stickiness of its product with its revenue retention. The Company reports consistently above 130% (lowest ever was 129% for 2 quarters in early FY18) dollar net expansion rates. This is one of the highest in the SaaS space.Alteryx's recent earnings report and the accompanying call highlighted the demand growth for its software. The Company reported an accelerating revenue growth of 59% up from 51% in the first quarter along with a billings growth number of 53%. Net expansion rate came in at 133%. This number has never dipped under 129% nor above 134%. Alteryx also raised its FY19 revenue guidance range to $370-375 mn vs. consensus estimates of $362 mn.The report was good below the usual suspects as well. The Company reported more than double in deals greater than $1 mn in value, and more than 50% increase in deals greater than $250 k in value YoY. This fits in with the Company strategy of focusing on larger customers.Alteryx reported a solid quarter by impressing across the board. In our view, this reflects the increasing demand for the Company's software.This quarter was no surprise with the Company's perfect track record beating estimates in every single quarter.Source: Seeking AlphaWe are using the P/S multiple to assess Alteryx's valuation as the company isn't at scale yet, and the multiple is rich at 22x forward P/S.However, we're not deterred by the valuation as we think that it's warranted. We have a very unique model here which combines accelerating growth with profitability. As stated above, Alteryx readily beat consensus every quarter. It is reasonable to assume the continuation of this trend. The Consensus paints a picture of exponentially faster growth. If Alteryx manages to beat these estimates and achieve its long-term profitability targets, the $8 bn market cap will be peanuts for what the operation will be worth.Competitive environment is what cools us off of Alteryx. The attractiveness of the space has pulled in competition. Salesforce's (CRM) acquisition of Tableau and Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) acquisition of Looker signals the interest of mega-cap names in the field. These companies are among the best in the world in data analytics and have some of the largest enterprise relationships. Their financial firepower crushes that of Alteryx. They are perfectly suited to succeed in Alteryx's niche.The Alteryx Management praised the consolidation in the space in the recent call and presented the recent M&A activity in the space as a positive. We disagree. Despite the massive addressable market and the need for the software, we think that the entry of these giants muddies the outlook for Alteryx. Alteryx isn't priced for what it is today but for what it will be in the future. If Salesforce and Alphabet decide to be aggressive in their efforts, and there's no reason for them not to be, we expect that they will steal significant growth numbers from Alteryx.Despite our attraction to almost every aspect of Alteryx's operations including valuation, financials, product, market, and expectation management, we view the competitive environment enough of a threat to be neutral rated. We think that the consensus estimates and Alteryx's valuation doesn't reflect the rising competition in its space."
4291901,35181,2019-09-16T17:00:36-04:00,"Alteryx stock has pulled back by 22% in September.Revenue growth of 50%+ for the last few years with no signs of slowing down.Company fundamentals remain strong, Rule of 40% is met, and this presents an opportunity to acquire shares.This is a golden opportunity to acquire shares. Conservative investors may consider scaling into a position.","Alteryx, Inc. (AYX) has been punished so far in September with its share price down from a high of $143 to a recent $112. The price drop does not appear to have anything to do with company fundamentals or forward guidance but appears to be the result of large fund rotation out of high-growth software stocks. Other high-flying SaaS stocks that have been hit hard this summer are Okta, Inc. (OKTA), Zscaler, Inc. (ZS), and Slack Technologies, Inc. (WORK).In the case of Alteryx, I cannot find anything wrong with the company's most recent quarterly report or with guidance. Therefore, I believe that the bearishness is simply the result of the repositioning of funds by some unknown major players. Therefore, the 22% price drop is an opportunity to get into this best of breed software company.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)Alteryx's stock price is now close to the lower trendline of an ascending channel as shown in the stock chart above. Given that the company is growing revenue at a pace of 55% per annum and has positive free cash flow, I am reiterating my very bullish rating from almost three months ago. I see this as an opportunity to load up on the best software stock investment there is.I must warn conservative investors that the short term could be a little rough, but I expect this investment will be a winner for the long term. You may want to consider scaling into a position. Incidentally, the stock price is overvalued as I will explain later in this article, but not nearly as much as it was two weeks ago, and you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.My writing is often criticized for not going into enough detail about a company's prospects, competition, TAM, etc. In general, I believe that the study of a company's revenue growth timeline along with a free cash flow margin is superior to speculation over potential opportunities, competition, and addressable market. If a company's fundamentals are degrading, then there is a problem, otherwise, be a happy investor.In any case, there really is no competition for Alteryx as a data preparation platform. The nearest competitor is SAS, but SAS does not have the simplicity of use that the Alteryx platform has. In general, SAS targets highly educated data scientists that require coding skills, whereas Alteryx does not. And apparently, once you have active projects on the Alteryx platform, it is difficult to leave. It is a very sticky application.In my opinion, the measure of a superior product is in how sticky the product is. Alteryx doesn't publish customer retention but does provide its net expansion rate. Existing customers are not only retained but also spend substantially more on the product each year. Alteryx's dollar-based net expansion rate is 133%. If you only look at Global 2000 customers, the dollar-based net expansion rate is an astounding 141%.(Source: Alteryx)I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 93 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Alteryx is sitting above the trend line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is higher than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Alteryx is overvalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.Alteryx is overvalued, but there is a good reason. The company has consistently grown revenue by more than 50% annually for several years. The company also has positive free cash flow and has ""best of breed"" gross margin of 91%.Alteryx margin profile(Source: Alteryx)The stock is overpriced but you may find it difficult to get in later on. Consider this to be a fortunate opportunity to invest in the best company around, at least the best software company.High-growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40%,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40% is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40% is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus profit adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40%:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40% calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available, (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition, and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin, others use operational cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor's perspective.Given Alteryx's recent adoption of ASC 606, calculation of TTM revenue growth is not possible. The 2018 annual revenue growth, compensating for the accounting change, was 55%. 2019 Q2 YoY revenue growth was 59%. I will use the figure 55% for the Rule of 40% calculation.Alteryx's free cash flow margin TTM is 6.3% for the most recent 12-month period and has been consistently positive since late 2017.Alteryx historical chart of free cash flow margin(Source: Portfolio123)Alteryx's YoY organic revenue growth was 55%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 6.3%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 55% + 6.3% = 61.3%Since the Rule of 40% calculation comes out higher than 40%, I conclude that the company is financially healthy.Alteryx is focused on the top companies in the world, known as the Global 2000. Sales to larger enterprises are often ""lumpy"" and sometimes take longer to close. This translates to high volatility in the share price.Even a slight miss on guidance or drop in billings can result in a drastic share price revaluation.The market has been bearish with regards to SaaS stocks recently and Alteryx specifically. The attack on the share price may not be finished yet.There are many digital transformation stocks with extreme valuations, and it is possible that we could have further SaaS market revaluation in the future. In this case, I would expect to see Alteryx's stock price fall along with the rest of the market.The trade dispute between President Trump and China is ongoing and has the potential to cause market turbulence or even drive the United States into a recession.Approximately 10% of Alteryx's business comes from the UK and more from the EU. So far, Alteryx's business has not been affected by the coming Brexit, but it remains a risk.Alteryx is one of the best companies out there if you consider the 55% revenue growth, positive free cash flow, and 91% gross profit margin. The recent pullback in stock price leaves an opportunity for investors to get in on this wonderful investment at a better price than would otherwise be possible.I see no slowdown in revenue growth and no competition that can impede growth in the near future. The company fulfills the Rule of 40% by a wide margin. I am giving Alteryx a very bullish rating, the second time in three months."

Investors may wish to scale into a position.As with all stock investments, holding a long position in Alteryx comes with significant risks.","Alteryx (AYX) is at the heart of the digital transformation movement, offering a subscription-based data science and analytics platform that touches almost every aspect of an enterprise’s operations.In general, software companies with recurring revenues, either subscription-based or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), such as Alteryx have been outperforming the stock market by a significant margin for some time. Alteryx has been firing on all cylinders with 82% YoY change in revenues. By all accounts, it has an extremely bright future. Compared to other high-growth companies, Alteryx stock appears to be more reasonably priced, and I rate this company as a Buy. Given the lofty valuations for software companies in gfeneral, Alteryx included, some investors may want to scale into a long position with the intent of buying more on a price dip. This allows the investor to participate in the stock’s bull run with the hope of adding to the position at a lower price.Alteryx believes that today’s analytic tools are processes are insufficient. Quoting some statistics from its latest investor presentation:The company’s data science and analytics solutions enable its customers, regardless of technical acumen, to discover, view, prepare and analyze data from various sources data into actionable insights and provide improved data-driven business outcomes. The platform provides intuitive and highly repeatable visual workflows intended to eliminate mundane analysts’ data tasks, thereby providing time for more productive work undertakings.(Source: Investor Presentation Analyst Day)As management likes to point out:While one would expect data science analytics would be used primarily by scientists and engineers, this could not be further from the truth. Alteryx’s platform is being employed by many different departments in a typical enterprise, including finance, sales, manufacturing and human resources.(Source: Investor Presentation Analyst Day)The platform includes the following applications:As I explained in my last article on Okta (OKTA), high-growth companies generally don't measure up based on traditional value metrics. In fact, they often confound analysts with the result being a lost investment opportunity. In place of traditional value factors, I generally focus on other measures, such as revenue growth, the software company ""Rule of 40,"" and my favorite: company performance relative to analyst estimates.Alteryx had a stunning year with trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 82%. The company's three-year annual growth rate of 67% is also quite good. Management has guided to an increase in revenues of 40-42% for the full year of 2019, but I expect it will overachieve as it has done in the past (more on that later).(Source: Portfolio123.com)Alteryx's free cash flow margin TTM has been positive since November 2017 and is currently at 8% of revenues.(Source: portfolio123.com)Having positive free cash flow and hyper growth makes this an interesting investment opportunity. Another good sign is the company's steadily increasing gross margin, which has reached 92% - an enviable position for any software company.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Examining how a company performs versus analysts' estimates gives me a feel for how conservative the management is and how well they communicate with the investment community. This is a good predictor of what to expect in future quarterly results. With that said, Alteryx has an extremely good record of beating analysts' estimates. The company has exceeded estimates for the last five quarters for both sales and EPS. This leads me to believe that the 2019 YoY revenue guidance of 40-42% is conservative and may actually end up at approximately 50%.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Analysts are challenged when it comes to valuing software companies. While these companies tend to generate high revenue growth rates, they also tend to be unprofitable due to large investments in research & development and sales and marketing. Discounting future cash flows requires many assumptions that are typically unreliable and difficult to support.One industry metric that is often used for early- to mid-stage software companies is the ""Rule of 40."" It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as the figure is useful in a later part of my analysis.Some analysts interpret the Rule of 40 as follows: as long as a company's growth rate is at least 40 percentage points higher than its free cash flow margin, a high-growth SaaS company can burn cash in order to drive growth.Alteryx is burning cash. S&GA expenses are 82% of revenues, higher than what would be expected from a more mature software company that would typically have a figure around 50-60%.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative and R&D.On the other hand, Alteryx’s SG&A expense is more reasonable than some other stocks that I have analyzed recently, such as Okta, which has more than 100% SG&A as a percentage of revenues.According to the Rule of 40, the cash burn is OK so long as revenue growth plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more.Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 82% + 8% = 90%In the case of Alteryx, the cash burn appears to be ""acceptable.""Revenue growth plus FCF margin is sometimes referred to as the ""Efficiency Score."" It has been determined that a company's Efficiency Score has a greater than 70 percent correlation to a public SaaS company's revenue multiple, which is a company's valuation divided by its revenue.In order to demonstrate this, I have plotted the EV/Sales multiple versus the Efficiency Score in MS Excel for 48 software stocks from my Digital Transformation stock list. A linear trend line is plotted through the scatter plot that represents the best-fit valuation multiple for a given Efficiency Score.(Source: Portfolio123.com/MS Excel)As can be seen from the above graph, the Alteryx valuation (EV/Sales) is below the best-fit line through the data points.The rest of this analysis is somewhat controversial. For me at least, it seems logical to assume higher valuation for higher-growth companies, and I use the best-fit line to gauge a company's valuation relative to the rest of the stocks in the custom universe. This is a relative valuation, not absolute as one would attempt to get using a DCF calculation.Based on the above chart, I conclude that Alteryx stock price is undervalued relative to the rest of the digital transformation stocks in my custom universe. However, I expect that Alteryx will have a lower Efficiency Score at the end of 2019 if revenue growth is lower. My wet-finger estimate is for 50% revenue growth, 10% FCF margin and an Efficiency Score of 60.(Source: Portfolio123.com/MS Excel)The above graph assumes that all stocks in my custom universe remain static except for Alteryx’s Efficiency Score. This, of course, won’t be the case, as most high-growth stocks will lose some of their luster. I would expect that the best-fit line would have a higher slope in a year’s time, and although Alteryx may be relatively overvalued, it won’t be by that much.Therefore, I conclude that the company’s valuation is reasonable given its performance over the past 12 months and future potential. I assign a Buy rating for this stock.An investment in Alteryx comes with several risks. For starters, the stock market bull market is long in the tooth, and we could enter a bear market in the not-too-distant future based on a slowing economy or a resurgence in trade tensions between USA and China.In addition, SaaS stocks are on a tear, and many of them are reaching all-time highs. Some analysts believe that we are in for a second ""dot-com"" crash due to lofty valuation levels.Also, if the market for analytics products and services fails to grow as the company expects, or if businesses fail to adopt the platform, then Alteryx’s business could be adversely affected.Revenue growth and ability to sustain profitability depends on being able to expand the skilled talent base and increase their productivity, particularly with respect to the company’s direct sales force and software engineers.Alteryx offers a subscription-based data science and analytics platform that has YoY revenue growth of 82% and is likely to achieve significant growth for several years. SG&A expenses are expected to grow commensurately. The company scores quite well on the Rule of 40, a rule of thumb that estimates a software company's health. I believe it is fairly valued relative to other software stocks, and I assign a Buy rating to Alteryx.This investment comes with significant risks, however. All digital transformation-enabling stocks have lofty values, Alteryx included. At some point in time, these companies may come down to earth. But I believe that Alteryx may be the best of the bunch and investors should not miss this opportunity. Investors may want to scale into a position instead of jumping in head first if they believe that there may be a correction in the near future.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"
4271077,102764,2019-06-19T13:08:20-04:00,"Alteryx is a top player in data analytics, a much promising industry with plenty of potential for growth.The company is delivering vigorous growth and expanding profit margins.Fundamental momentum is a powerful driver for the stock price.Alteryx's stock is priced for aggressive growth expectations, but not necessarily overvalued if the company keeps growing at full speed and outperforming expectations.","Alteryx (AYX) is clearly on fire, the company is delivering outstanding revenue growth and expanding profitability levels. The stock is priced for aggressive growth expectations at current levels, but not necessarily overvalued if management keeps executing well and outperforming expectations.Data is the new oil, and companies all over the world are increasingly capitalizing on the value of their data to make better decisions and optimize processes in areas such as finance, marketing, customer analytics, logistics, human resources, and business processes. Alteryx is focused on making this data analysis process simpler, easier, and more efficient.According to management, searching for data and preparing such data consumes over 40% of workers' time and approximately 16 hours per week per worker is wasted on unsuccessful data initiatives. Alteryx provides solutions to transform this waste into productive time by automating routine processes within the company's drag and drop, click and run, code-free environment.The company calculates that its total addressable market is worth nearly $23.5 billion, and over the coming years, the size of such a market opportunity is expected to reach as much as $47 billion.Alteryx is doing a great job in terms of capitalizing on its growth opportunities and generating both vigorous revenue growth and expanding profit margins for shareholders. Revenue is growing rapidly and the company is retaining a larger share of revenue as profits, so this provides a double boost to earnings.Data by YChartsThe most recent earnings report from Alteryx confirms that the business keeps firing on all cylinders as of the first quarter of 2019. The company added 277 net new customers during the period, ending the quarter with nearly 5,000 customers, which includes 28% of the Global 2000.Some of the notable companies that subscribed Alteryx last quarter include names such as Autodesk (ADSK), eBay (EBAY), Luxottica Group (OTCPK:LUXGF), Netflix (NFLX), Twitter (TWTR), and WeWork (VWORK). The fact that Alteryx is making inroads into these kinds of widely successful and technologically sophisticated companies speaks volumes about the quality of its services.Revenue during the first quarter of 2019 reached $76 million, an increase of 51% versus the first quarter of 2018. The dollar-based net expansion rate was an impressive 134% during the quarter, and Alteryx produced $16 million in operating cash flow during the period.Moving forward, management is expecting a sustained expansion in profitability, with operating margin reaching 35%-40% and free cash flow representing 30%-35% of revenue over the long term.Source: Alteryx Investors RelationsMany high-growth companies tend to generate losses due to elevated reinvestment needs. But Alteryx is already moving beyond the inflection point, generating positive cash flows and expanding profit margins.Trading at a price to sales ratio around 22.8, Alteryx is priced for demanding growth expectations, that is beyond discussion. However, the stock is not necessarily overvalued if management keeps executing above expectations.In order to put this valuation in perspective, we can compare Alteryx versus some of the most successful companies in the software sector. These companies operate in different segments, so the comparison is not very straightforward, but it helps to get an idea about the main parameters for valuation and growth among the top players in software as a service.The table shows the price to sales ratio, market capitalization, expected sales growth and expected earnings growth for Alteryx, Twillo (TWLO), The Trade Desk (TTD), and Paycom Software (PAYC).All of these companies have a price to sales ratios well above 20, but Alteryx is much smaller in terms of market capitalization. All else the same, smaller companies have the ability to sustain rapid growth for longer periods of time, so this is a positive for Alteryx from a comparative perspective. In terms of expected growth in both sales and earnings, Alteryx also looks comparatively strong, only Twillo is ahead of Alteryx in terms of growth expectations.It is important to note that Alteryx has delivered revenue numbers above Wall Street expectations in every quarter since its IPO. This kind of consistency in fundamental momentum is quite exceptional among high growth companies, and it speaks volumes about Alteryx and its ability to outperform expectations.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialIf the company consistently outperforms expectations, this tends to push forward-looking expectations higher as Wall Street analysts adjust their projections. In order for the valuation to remain stable, higher sales expectations should drive the stock price higher too.The chart below shows how the stock price has evolved in comparison to revenue estimates in both the current year and next fiscal year. It's easy to see how fundamental momentum has been a powerful return driver for Alteryx in recent years.Data by YChartsA rising bar is hard to beat, and it takes a high-quality business to continue outperforming expectations over the long term. But companies that generally deliver above expectations tend to continue doing so more often than not, and Alteryx has both a rock-solid track record in that area and abundant opportunities for growth in the years ahead.Valuation needs to be analyzed in its due context. A company with strong financial performance and accelerating momentum obviously deserves a higher valuation than a business producing mediocre financial performance and languishing momentum.But sometimes it can be challenging to incorporate the multiple factors into the analysis in order to see the complete picture from a quantitative perspective. The PowerFactors system is a quantitative system that ranks companies in a particular universe according to a combination of factors, such as financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength.In simple terms, the PowerFactors system is looking to buy good businesses (quality) for a reasonable price (valuation) when the company is doing well (fundamental momentum) and the stock is outperforming (relative strength).Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123The backtested performance numbers show that companies with high PowerFactors rankings tend to deliver superior returns over the long term, and this bodes well for investors in Alteryx going forward. The company has a PowerFactors ranking of 98 as of the time of this writing, meaning that Alteryx is in the top 2% of companies in the US stock market based on financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength combined.The ranking for valuation is not particularly high at 57, but the company excels in terms of quality (98), fundamental momentum (89) and relative strength (99).Alteryx is not a cheap stock by any means, but it's not unreasonably expensive by industry standards either. If the company continues growing at full speed and outperforming Wall Street expectations as it has done in recent years, current valuation levels could ultimately be justified.Alteryx is a risky proposition, no doubts about that. The company operates in a rapidly evolving landscape, and it could face increasing competitive pressure from larger tech corporations in the years ahead. Besides, current valuation levels don't provide much of a buffer in case there is any disappointment down the road.On the other hand, the company is a fairly exceptional growth business with plenty of potential for expansion and being fueled by vigorous momentum. If management continues leading the company on the right track, it has plenty of upside potential over the middle and long term.I wouldn't jump into a big position in Alteryx at current prices, but partially building a position over time could make sense for growth-oriented investors who are willing to pay premium prices for a such a unique growth business."
4263324,70365,2019-05-12T21:32:05-04:00,"Alteryx is a fast-growing data analytics software company.Last year, the company broke even and is net operating cash flow positive from 2017.Historical relative valuation suggests the company’s shares are expensive but can be justified by Alteryx’s growth.","Shares of Alteryx (AYX), a data analytics company, have skyrocketed over the last few months, and are very likely to sustain their uptrend momentum as the company broke even last year and reached a positive net operating cash flow a year earlier. The company is still relatively unknown and therefore could significantly appreciate after its story gets noticed by a broader investment audience.Alteryx (AYX) is a data analytics company providing a subscription-based platform. The company’s solutions enable its customers to discover, view, prepare and analyze data from various sources and benefit from synthetized data-driven decisions. The company aims at eliminating mundane analysts’ data tasks and saving up time for more sensible work undertakings. The company’s capabilities allow customers activities such as editing R and Python codes without requiring prior coding experience. Last year, the company had 800 full-time employees and customers in more than 70 countries, including over a quarter of Global 2000 companies. Over the last three years, the company’s customer base has expanded from roughly 1400 customers to 4700 customers.During the latest quarterly earnings call, the management of the company reiterated especially the key benefits of its solutions and a non-negligible portion of unrealized potential. Based on the company’s internal estimates, Alteryx’s solutions can free up to 16 hours every week due to automatization of mundane data tasks. The company projects the core total addressable market to be of approximately $23B and full TAM to be around $47B. In the first quarter, the company added 277 new customers, including large global enterprise from Global 2000 list such as Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Luxottica Group, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and WeWork (VWORK).Having a closer look at the company’s financial statements, Alteryx has strong liquidity position (current ratio of 3.6) and sustainable level of long-term debt financing (37 percent long-term debt to capital) which enhances the company’s key profitability measure (~ttm ROE 12 percent). The development in the company’s net operating cash flow in the last two years and a breakeven last year suggest that Alteryx has gotten on a positive business development trajectory and better years could be ahead.Source: Quotes WSJIn the light of revenue variation of popular Peter Lynch's earnings line for the projection of possible per share values of the company, I see Alteryx's as an attractive long-term opportunity. Based on my model assuming 60 percent constant annual revenue growth, 63 million shares outstanding diluting at 3 percent annual rate and an average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 20x (currently 20.6x), the company's share price by the end of 2022 is forecasted to reach $467. If the company’s shares get bought at 20x price-to-sales ratio and remain in that range, the company’s long-run annualized return potential could be as much as 50 percent. Should the price-to-sales ratio stand at 20x and over the course of the next four years fall to 10x, the company's shares' annualized upside return potential could be as much as 27 percent.Perhaps the greatest question here is whether the current price-to-sales ratio level is sustainable. Over the last few years, the share price and price-to-sales ratio have been heavily correlated and have risen to unprecedented highs.To sum up, Alteryx is seemingly an exceptional information technology and service company with a great room for further growth. Obviously, the company is at an early stage of development and financial statements suggest the company has started gaining considerable momentum. The company has solidly expanding asset base and the current headcount provides a solid opportunity for strong networking effects facilitating new growth.This is a complimentary research article.

4295397,104905,2019-10-07T11:26:36-04:00,"Alteryx, a company providing analytics software, is operating in a very complex and dynamic market. It's difficult to identify its real competition which has led to persistent misconceptions among investors.Alteryx should not be compared with Business Intelligence tool providers like Tableau or Looker but rather Data Science providers like SAS.Success in the market is not only a technology/product question but also a question of marketing and sales vision and execution.Alteryx's market vision, scale, and sales execution put them in a unique position to profit from a huge secular growth trend towards big data and advanced data analytics.After the recent sector-wide pull-back, shares of Alteryx look like a good investment opportunity.","The article was also shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more about PRO+ here.Last year, Bert Hochfeld hit the nail on the head when he wrote that Alteryx (AYX) might not be overvalued but under-understood. Since this article was published, shares have more than tripled. The market has clearly caught up with some of its misconceptions. But still, there seems to be, to this day, a persistent misunderstanding regarding Alteryx's competitive field - at least among the SA-community.In a recent SA article, a fellow contributor argued that he was not interested in investing in Alteryx because of competition: The recent acquisitions of Tableau (DATA) by Salesforce (CRM) and Looker by Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) would signal the interest of mega-cap names in the field, which would not bode well for Alteryx'.Not much later, another article appeared lamenting that Alteryx moat is quickly evaporating since database companies would increasingly provide BI tools directly and free open-source solutions would also pose competitive problems. According to the article, an example of a competing open-source solution would be KNIME, a company that does the same as Alteryx, just cheaper.There are many reasons why investors don't have a clear picture of the competitive environment Alteryx is operating in: First, it's providing advanced analytics software which is difficult to fully understand technologically. Also, since ""data is the new oil"", but is in reality much more complex to monetize than oil, there is a universe of companies competing in the analytics space - again, as an industry outsider (I would argue even as an insider) it is very difficult to break down this sector. Furthermore, as investors should be very aware of, in business not always ""the best"" product (from a technological standpoint) wins but the product that can serve customers needs the best at the exact right point of time. Marketing and timing play a critical role in a product's and company's success.If you google ""Alteryx competition"" you will find a vast universe of alternatives to Alteryx: Tableau, Looker, IBM Cognos, Microsoft Power BI, Oracle Analytics Cloud, SAP Crystal, Qlik, Charito, Board, Datameer, TIBCO Software, GoodData, Trifacta, the list goes on and on...Look at this graph. It is Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms from February 2019:Source: Gartner.As you can see there are a lot of the names on this graph from my google-search above. Alteryx ain't one of them.Does this mean that Alteryx has a competitive problem? They didn't even make it on the Gartner graph! Of course not. It simply means that Alteryx is not really competing in the field of Business Intelligence (BI) - a fact that seems to be consistently ignored by retail investors. Here is the right Gartner graph for Alteryx:Source: Gartner.This is Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms, and you can see that Alteryx resides on the very top of the graph.The first takeaway for understanding the competitive landscape of Alteryx, thus, is that there is a difference between Business Intelligence and Data Science and Machine Learning.Here linked is a blog post that goes more into the details of that difference. To quote the blog, ""in nutshell, while BI helps interpret past data, Data Science can analyze the past data (trends or patterns) to make future predictions. BI is mainly used for reporting or Descriptive Analytics; whereas Data Science is more used for Predictive Analytics or Prescriptive Analytics... The major point of difference between Data Science vs. Business Intelligence is that while BI is designed to handle static and highly structured data, Data Science can handle high-speed, high-volume, and complex, multi-structured data from a wide variety of data sources. Whereas BI can only understand data ""preformatted"" in certain formats, advanced Data Science technologies like Big Data, IoT, and Cloud can together collect, clean, prepare, analyze, and report many types of free-form data gathered from widely distributed operational touch points.""From this description, it becomes clear why an Alteryx-seat costs from around $5,000 (Alteryx Designer) all the way up to 58,500 (Alteryx Server) per year, while a Tableau-seat costs $70 per month and Microsoft Power BI offers a free version and a maximum subscription price of $10 per month. These services simply offer completely different solutions and value points. Simply speaking, making visualizations of simpler data-sets (that still have to be interpreted by someone) doesn't compare to software that spits out the answer to your complex big-data problems immediately in real-time.Dean Stoecker, CEO of Alteryx, often speaks about a future in which data visualization tools like the ones offered by Tableau could lose their value entirely. That's the result of thinking Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence solutions to their logical conclusion. He also mentioned in an earnings conference call (I think it was Q2 2018) that he sees no competition to Alteryx in the market and this viewpoint hasn't really changed in subsequent quarters.Of course, that is a rather daring thesis. Machines and algorithms are not going to take over the world entirely for many years to come and also the notion that there is no competition for Alteryx should be understood more as the opinion of a biased and passionate CEO than objective truth. As in every field of business, and especially in the data analytics space, there is lots of competition and, after all, Alteryx didn't spend almost 60% of revenue on sales & marketing just for fun in the past.In fact, according to Gartner the market for expert data scientists, citizen data scientists, and application development is a dynamic market that is evolving rapidly.Gartner points out that the market features a diverse range of vendors: Users simply have very different requirements and preferences for user interfaces and available tools. ""Expert data scientists prefer to code data science models in Python or R, or to build and run data models in notebooks. Other users are most comfortable building models by using a point-and-click UI to create visual pipelines. Many members of emerging citizen data science communities favor a much more augmented approach that uses ML techniques ""behind the scenes"" to guide these less expert data scientists through the model building and operationalization process. Over time, expert data scientists may also come to prefer an augmented approach, which would enable them to navigate the model-building and operationalization process more efficiently. Tool and use case diversity is more important than ever.""Dynamic and rapidly evolving markets tend to be hard to understand and very competitive. As a retail investor and industry outsider, I cannot claim to have deep insights into the ins and outs of the data analytics market. Luckily, analyzing competition is not entirely a question of technology comparisons but also (and probably to a larger extent) a business question.Let's return to KNIME for a second. KNIME looks like a potential competitive threat to Alteryx since they offer an open-source solution (i.e. much cheaper than Alteryx) and it also looks like one of the leading companies in the space according to the Gartner MQ. However, if you read the Gartner report carefully, you will discover that KNIME has a team of fewer than 60 full-time equivalents (Alteryx had more than 1,000 employees at the end of the last quarter). Also, according to Gartner KNIME has a ""conservative marketing strategy and passive go-to-market approach"" and also ""received one of the lowest overall scores"" from customers regarding performance and scalability. It is hard to get a reliable revenue number for KNIME since it is a small privately held company, but it probably has less than $10 million in annual revenue.RapidMiner, another company featuring favorably on the Gartner MQ above, is estimated to have around $20 million in revenue, 120 employees, and Gartner noted that RapidMiner's customers ""have been facing complicated pricing schemes and difficult-to-navigate pricing conditions"".My point is, as already noted in my introduction, businesses don't succeed because they have the ""best"" or ""most advanced"" product - they also have to sell the damn thing. In short, while KNIME and RapidMiner (and many others for that matter) might have great products, they lack both the scale and sales & marketing execution to match Alteryx's market success.If you are looking for a company with great analytics products, scale, and sales & marketing prowess you should look no further than a company named SAS. SAS, a privately held company (not to be confused with the business model SaaS), is the worldwide leader in analytics. They made $3.27 billion in revenue in 2018, employ 14,000 people around the globe and call 92 of the top 100 companies on the 2018 Fortune Global 1000 list their customers. The company has a 40-year history of excellence and seems to cover all the nooks and crannies of the analytics market.Even Dean Stoecker (when he is not raving about his company having no competition) admits - for example, last time at the Citi 2019 Global Technology Conference - that SAS is their biggest competitor. However, he also noted that Alteryx and SAS are currently competing without going to battle and that he clearly sees a dollar shift from SAS to Alteryx.This view seems to be confirmed by Gartner who noted that SAS' ""Ability to Execute is hampered by high sometimes unpredictable costs, which cause existing and prospective customers to explore other options."" While SAS profits from a trusted brand (which stands for quality, stability, and reliability) and an unmatched worldwide support infrastructure, its product offerings are also perceived as pricey, complex and often confusing. Thus, SAS is suffering from the classic challenge of a mature product-rich company getting attacked from all sides by competitors. Alteryx seems to be one of the companies having success against them.Another company that Stoecker frequently mentions when talking about competition is Microsoft (MSFT), in particular, Microsoft Excel. Microsoft is obviously a data analytics powerhouse and Excel is still the standard software for almost every office job around the world. Even though, again, Alteryx is not really competing directly with Microsoft, Stoecker rarely fails to mention Alteryx' total addressable market of approximately 47 million ""disenfranchised spreadsheet users"" (called data citizens, not data scientists) that need to be empowered to perform up-to-date analytics - a clear stab at the limitations of Excel.In my view, this leads us to the core of understanding Alteryx's market positioning and competitive environment: While Alteryx competes on a product and capabilities basis with companies like SAS, KNIME, and RapidMiner, they are targeting a different (and much larger) customer base. In other words, Alteryx sells capabilities usually used by sophisticated statisticians and data analytics Ph.D.'s (i.e. data scientists traditionally served by SAS) to a crowd of spreadsheet users predominantly doing their work in Microsoft Excel and other BI tools (the data citizens).This unique market positioning is Alteryx's Secret Sauce (and investing thesis) in a nutshell. It also explains why Stoecker doesn't really see much direct competition at the moment.Alteryx saves data workers and their companies time and money, makes them refocus on the fun part of their job, and, most importantly, vastly increases their predictive capabilities. Alteryx is probably best positioned to capture the large market of spreadsheet users becauseNowhere is Alteryx's success more visible than in their financials: They have been able to more than triple their customer count from 1,587 to 5,278 in a bit more than 3 years since 2016 while achieving a dollar-based net retention rate above 130% for the last 11 quarters. This means that on average customers who spent $1 dollar in year one, spent $1.30 in year two, $1.69 in year three and so on... According to the company, its top 25 customers have spent approximately 33 times the sum in cumulative spending from their initial buy. Furthermore, in their most recent quarter, Alteryx posted the highest quarterly revenue growth (59.22%) since Q4 2016 (when they grew 61.3%), even though back then it was much easier to achieve that growth rate as their TTM revenue amounted to only $85.8 million. Last quarter their TTM revenue was more than three times larger at $309.8 million which makes the feat even more impressive.Of course, as any investment, Alteryx is not without risk. For many reasons, Alteryx is actually in an above-average risk category.First of all, while I tried to shine a light on the competitive landscape, it has to be repeated that I'm not a data analytics expert. This space is very complex, difficult to analyze, and as Gartner noted very dynamic and rapidly evolving. It would be foolish to disregard competition entirely. At the same time, for the reasons noted above, I think it is very plausible that Alteryx has a unique approach in the space and doesn't see a lot of direct competition at the moment.Alteryx's management is also doing a good job of communicating their virtues not only to customers but also to the investing community. But in all honesty, no one really knows how many of the reported 47 million data citizens really need Alteryx and how many of those will actually buy it. Therefore, the reported TAM number cannot be taken as gospel.Furthermore, there is the risk, which has been expressed by analysts many times, of data shifting more and more to the cloud. Since Alteryx is an ""on-prem"" software, some investors fear that Alteryx might be left behind in this move to the cloud. Alteryx currently believes that on-prem or hybrid structures will persist for many years to come and customers currently are not asking for a pure cloud-analytics-solution yet - still this is a potential risk to consider for the long-term.Another business risk to consider is that Alteryx recently issued a total of $800 million of convertible senior notes due in 2024 and 2026. The reason for taking on so much debt is quite simple: According to CEO Stoecker, there are many data analytics companies with great technology and functionality that, however, lack a customer base and go-to-market strategy. Therefore, Stoecker expects a good amount of consolidation in the industry which is why it is important for Alteryx to have the dry powder necessary to take advantage of strategic acquisitions. (For example, as I'm writing this, Alteryx announced to acquire Feature Labs, a data science software company launched out of MIT that automates feature engineering for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.)Although Alteryx currently has negative earnings and cash flows and ""only"" $310 million in TTM revenue, you should not worry about this convertible debt increasing the risk of bankruptcy because Alteryx can settle the notes in shares or cash or a combination thereof.However, investors should consider potential dilution from the offering: The conversion rate for the 2024 and 2026 notes will initially be 5.2809 shares of Alteryx Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $189.36 per share of Alteryx Class A common stock). This means that if the stock price upon conversion is $189.36 or higher and, thus, the bond investors will exercise all their share options, Alteryx will have to issue 4,224,720 shares or 6% of current shares outstanding.Since Alteryx entered into a capped call transaction the risk of additional dilution if the share price is lower than $189.36 upon conversion is limited, as well as the exposure to upside price movements of the stock (capped at $315.60 per share). Thus, the share dilution will not deviate significantly from the 6% mentioned above.But not everything is as bad as it might look after reading these last paragraphs. On the contrary, I would argue that the positives for Alteryx's investment case far outweigh its negatives.Alteryx has tremendous business economics, which is evidenced by consistent gross margins of more than 90%. The company is targeting free cash flow margins between 30%-35% in three to five years, which, considering their gross margins, seems realistic. As already mentioned, Alteryx is growing like a weed (accelerating to 59% in the last quarter) despite the increasing scale and their subscription model with a dollar-based net expansion rate above 130% gives them a lot of visibility and security in their revenue base. It is also hard to deny that Alteryx is, in fact, riding a secular growth trend towards big-data and advanced analytics and that customers love their products.As such it makes sense that Alteryx has traditionally traded at an elevated EV/S ratio. However, Alteryx is hardly an outlier among similar high-growth, high-margin, subscription-based companies:Source: Author's table; earnings reports from companies Investor Relation sites.Data by YChartsIf you look at this YCharts graph (and don't fixate on the numbers, they are not 100% accurate), the current sector rotation out of high-growth stocks gives investors a reasonable look at high-quality growth companies again. Alteryx is one of the high-growth companies that has impressed the most with their recent business performance (in my opinion, the share price increase from $82 in early June to $147 in early September was mostly the result of the anticipation and achievement of exceptional quarterly results reported in July).Currently, with shares around $107 and a forward EV/S around 14 (based on FY 2020 revenue estimates of approximately $530 million), you can buy Alteryx at a valuation last seen before their terrific Q2 results and close to valuation levels last seen in late 2018. If we were to assume the company could achieve its free cash flow-margin targets eventually, they would currently trade around 40-46 times their potential next year free cash flow. At the current growth rate of almost 60%, this seems like a reasonable valuation to me.Is Alteryx's stock a bargain? Hardly. But considering its margin- and growth-profile, recurring revenue business model, industry tailwinds and competitive positioning it is also a unique company that should trade at an elevated multiple. I think it's a buy."

Alteryx is a data analytics tool provider that is providing the pick-axes for the big data boom. After several years of strong gains Alteryx’s stock price has joined the momentum sell-off of September 2019 falling by more than 25%. But how much is AYX worth? Is the high revenue growth and recent profit inflection point a strong sign of things to come, or just a head fake? Has a buy price been reached?Alteryx’s business is providing data analytics tools via a variety of methods. The world is producing ever more data in a variety of formats and sources, but combining that data is nothing like the movies or your favorite version of CSI. Data analysis often involves up to a dozen hours working with a spreadsheet to prepare the data ready for processing. AYX’s workbench combines 250+ tools that simplifies the whole process to give the option of code-free drag and drop data analysis. However, if you are more technical, Alteryx’s platform is also flexible enough to allow code from R, Python, Apache Spark & Hadoop to provide as much power as you need.Alteryx has one of those multi-year revenue growth curves that investors love. Revenue growth has averaged a compound rate at better than 68% p.a. since 2015. Whether growth is accelerating or declining is not yet clear with 2018 achieving 92% growth over 2017. That’s a big jump over the still impressive 53% growth in 2017. Company forecasts at the end of Q2 for the full year 2019 are for 46-48% p.a. growth. This seems in line with trend performance, but based on historical performance it is quite possible it may yet be beaten.Source: Alteryx Q2 2019 Investor PresentationGrowth is from both new and existing customers.Alteryx’s revenue growth is from a combination of new and existing clients. This combination is an excellent sign as it shows that existing clients are using the product in more areas of their business, yet there are still many more companies finding their way to Alteryx's data preparation tools.Customer Growth Source: Alteryx Q2 2019 Investor PresentationStock Price Growth – Also ExceptionalData by YChartsAlteryx is relatively new to profits having reached the profit inflection point just in the last 4 quarters. There is some seasonality with 4th quarters being particularly strong from a revenue and net profit perspective, so some pull-back in Q1 and Q2 is quite typical.Source: Caterer Goodman from Alteryx filing data.No, profit wasn't a once-off event.If you are a suspicious investor (and all investors should be), you'll want to understand whether the bounce to profit in 2018 is a one-off aberration or part of a wider trend. The good news is that there is nothing exceptional like a business unit sale or change in cost/revenue recognition that created the bounce. Further if you re-work the profit/loss numbers as a percentage of revenue, you can see a clear trend at work.Source: Caterer Goodman Partners from Alteryx filing data.What's a reasonable margin to expect in the medium term?A common feature of successful software firms is strong scalability. Essentially, costs grow quite slowly with size, which means that once revenue passes the cost threshold, net profit and the associated margin expands quickly. We believe Alteryx has just crossed this threshold and provided cost containment isn't abandoned, it should be able to achieve its forecasts in the following table at some point in the next few years.Image: Alteryx Q2 2019 Investor Presentation2019 Forecast: Increased spending on investment.It is notable that the operating margin forecasts for 2019 are 1% instead of 19% for 2018 due to a forecast spending increase, particularly focussed on sales and marketing expenses, but also increases in R&D and also G&A outgoings. Investors should take this forecast seriously because spending is mostly under the control of management. It will be interesting to see how this increased sales and marketing spend impacts on revenue growth.Several players in data analytics.Alteryx competes with several players in what is variously called data analytics, data visualization or business intelligence (BI).Who is the competition?Alteryx's main competitors in data analytics include Looker (a recent Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) purchase) and Tableau (now part of Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)). It is important to note that competitors aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive. Analysts often use more than one tool and Alteryx itself estimates that the average analytical process uses 4-7 tools. A quick summary of a couple of these closer competitors is as follows.Looker's strength: Real-time analyticsLooker has a strength in real-time data analysis but suffers from a proprietary language (LookML) that steepens the learning curve for new users. Being integrated into Google’s platform will give it great access to Google’s customer base and a direct feed into Google’s cloud platform data feeds.Tableau screenshotSource: Softpedia.comTableau's strength: Data visualizationTableau’s - Helping people understand their data visually with beautiful dashboards. Alteryx lists Tableau as a partner on its website and sees their strengths as complementary. Other Data Visualization tools include Infogram, ChartBlocks, Datawrapper, Plotly, Visual.lyAlteryx's Strength: Blending and Preparing DataAlteryx – The strength of the platform is that it's easy to use to discover, prep, blend, enrich, and analyze data from various sources. This can integrate nicely with other services, like the data visualization of Tableau. Alteryx also lists Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN) as partners with integrations with SQL server, Microsoft Power BI and Redshift amongst others. The weakness of AYX that is mentioned online is pricing. For smaller businesses it can be prohibitive at $5,000+ per year, minimum. The medium and large business space is clearly a focus for AYX.Alteryx ScreenshotSource: Softpedia.comAlteryx is strong in the data blend preparation space, for now.There is a niche for an independent data preparation/blending tool that sits in the middle and links to cloud providers and their tools on one end, and visualization tools on the other. The world is drowning in data, but that doesn't mean it all comfortably works together, so Alteryx provides the links. We believe that the above-average sales growth AYX has seen so far, shows that it is providing a quality easy to use solution and solving a problem for those who find existing tools too hard to use without training.Alteryx is a leader, but the race isn't finished.To use a baseball analogy, we are still in an early innings (say the 3rd?) of the big data industry expansion with much left to play for. The cloud, Internet of Things, industrial data collection and AI are all strong trends producing data. Alteryx is in a good position now but it remains a smaller although growing player, with Google, Salesforce, AWS and Microsoft amongst others are devoting significant resources to BI and data analytics. Alteryx may yet be bought by Microsoft, AWS or even IBM (NYSE:IBM). From where we sit, AYX seems to be in the lead in their niche and growing rapidly, but much can still change over the coming years.The total addressable market for Alteryx is growing every year although growth has slowed to 11.7% in 2018, down from 15.3% growth in 2017. The growth of Alteryx at around 50%+ p.a. then is a clear sign that it is taking market share from others.Exceptional growth supports the thesis above that AYX's product and solution is easier to use than other competing products and is attractive to data analysts (as opposed to trained statistical data scientists). Still with $375 M projected in sales in 2019 Alteryx has slightly more than 1% of the business intelligence market based on this estimate. There is still plenty of upside.The market is $60 billion if you include spreadsheet processing.Another way of looking at the potential market size is the time wasted in humble excel spreadsheets, processing data by hand. This time and investment isn't captured by business intelligence market estimates, but it is an opportunity and a problem to be solved nonetheless. According to IDC, 6 billion hours are spent in spreadsheets annually. This amounts to estimates of some $60 billion in wasted time doing repetitive manual spreadsheet data processing work. Replacing this wasted work is also part of Alteryx's goal which does separate it from other companies focussed more on data science specialists.Capital ManagementAt the end of Q2 2019 Alteryx had $332 M in cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet which is more than sufficient for the next few years given current cash flow trends. Despite this Alteryx raised, net of offering costs $781 M USD from a private offering of two convertible notes in early August 2019. The details are here on Alteryx's website but a summary is as follows:Source: AlteryxSupport from institutions for investment in growthThe debt offering shows a couple of things. That there is strong support amongst institutions for Alteryx given the offering size was increased by $50 M per note from an initial $350 M and the coupon rate is low for a company with a limited history of profits. It also shows that Alteryx management is fully committed to a brisk rate of growth through both investment in organic growth and M&A. Speaking of M&A...Alteryx buys Feature LabsOn October 4, Alteryx announced the purchase of Feature Labs, a startup from MIT's Computer Science and AI Lab. According to the press release, Feature Labs ""developed an innovative set of algorithms to optimize the manual, time-consuming and error-prone process required to build machine learning models.""Buying technology and talent, but not customersThis fits a pattern of buying small technology companies that have features that can be added into and extending Alteryx's feature offering. Alteryx has completed 5 acquisitions and only Alteryx ANZ (a master distributor of Alteryx in Sydney) could be called a purchase of a customer base. Acquired companies tend to be privately owned, small and usually early stage but with attractive technology.Acquisitions to date:Data Source: Alteryx Press Releases *Date announced.Customer focus: Large companies with few data scientistsLooking through the haze of data points such as public statements and M&A actions it is clear that Alteryx has a focus on companies it calls the Global 2,000 companies. It does not have a pricing strategy for small businesses. This helps keep prices from sliding and helps sales and R&D teams focus, but does run the risk of competitors building market share in the easy-to-use end for small businesses.The second part of the vision is to build an easy-to-use tool that average business analysts can use without a background in coding and/or advanced statistics. Yet powerful enough that data scientists won't feel constrained. Where acquisitions make sense and help buttress this vision, they are made.Revenue multiple or forecast earnings?Alteryx is a tricky company to value. It is clearly growing very fast in a fascinating sector and has proven that it can make money, when it tries. However, the current historical level of profit doesn't represent the earnings power of the future. However, we aren't a fan of using revenue multiples to value companies on a relative to similar company basis. We believe such a methodology is self-reinforcing and helps blow speculative bubbles whilst also distracting attention from a question of profits and profitability.How much could Alteryx earn in 2022?We think given the current trajectory and management's focus on increasing growth that a fair assumption is that AYX can continue growing at 50% this year and 2020/2021 and slow to 40% growth in 2022. If we assume that aggressive investment in growth starts to fall in late 2020 as international office hiring starts to slow, then based on trends an operating margin of 30% should be very achievable. It would still be below the margin goal of 40%.Based on these assumptions then Alteryx in 2022 could produce earnings of $359 M on revenue of $1.2 B. Based on a current market capitalization of around $6.75 B that would be 18.7 times earnings. Still, that's 4 years in the future and much can happen between now and then.Do you believe in growth?The question then becomes one of belief. If you believe, as we do, that AYX can continue strong growth for at least 3.5 more years, then the current sell-off is a good entry point. If not, then Alteryx is too expensive for you. We do recall however, waiting on the sidelines for many years until Amazon became definitively cheap. We missed out on years of gains before finally leaping at $400 per share. Alteryx too has always been expensive but we think a $6 B big data company could yet become a $12 B or even $20 B company since the market is big and growing fast.A takeover target in a consolidating industry?Alteryx could also be a takeover target itself, as Salesforce buying Tableau for $15 B and Google buying Looker demonstrates. But this competition also shows that the path to massive success isn't completely clear with so many giants playing the field. Risks do exist and for most investors Alteryx is still too expensive at around 18 times forecast revenue for this year.Alteryx's valuation tests your bravery but the growth trajectory is clear in an exciting sector. If you are a patient investor an entry point at ~$110 after the recent sell-off could be a very rewarding investment."
4260663,21815,2019-05-06T18:01:36-04:00,"A little less than a year ago we argued that the shares offered a good entry point at $30 and change.
        Despite that advice, we failed to include the shares in the SHU portfolio, one of our biggest mistakes as the shares have more than tripled.
        The story is still as magnificent as it was a year ago, but rather than jump in, we would sell below market price put options.
        Below market price puts let you either earn income or get cheaper shares than today, its a useful way to deal with the high share price.","One of the biggest mistakes we made in the past 12 months was not taking a position in Alteryx (AYX) when according to our own analysis a perfect buying opportunity had arrived at $30 and change a year ago. The rest, as they say, is history:So the stock more than tripled in less than a year from that ""good entry point"" as we called it back then. It's difficult for something like that to happen without some improvement in basic metrics, and indeed:But share prices are forward looking so investors are clearly expecting much bigger things from the company, given the rather exorbitant valuation of the shares with a sales multiple well over 20x. The company's products offer a great value proposition to customers (Q1CC):There are of course certain barriers to expansion:On the latter (Q1CC):Parts of Alteryx' solutions cater to the 'citizen scientist' as they are code free or code friendly drag and drop solutions.We tackled the companies growth avenues in an earlier article, so we're going to remain brief here, but the amount of avenues is dizzying with an estimated $47B TAM:The company is focusing on corporate customers and had a notable acceleration in that segment nearly doubling from last year (+82% from global 2000 customers). This isn't a surprise, given the fact that (Q1CC):This realization leads to big companies taking data management more seriously and often appoint a CDO, chief data officer that Alteryx can then engage with directly in a top-down approach, speeding things up and improving the sales productivity of Alteryx.What also plays a role is the higher visibility of Alteryx, boosted by the success of the business and the IPO. Potential customers are aware there must be something of value here and management argues that they are now ""finally gotten the attention we deserve.""The company is gathering such scale that it starts to build some expand use cases. Indeed, the company (Q1CC):Government and healthcare were the first verticals in which the company invested resources. This is now followed by tax and audit cases, which is a horizontal opportunity (as it's a feature of basically every industry) as well as a vertical ones (with the strategic partnership with Thomson Reuters and accounting firms). And there are other opportunities (Q1CC):Also specializing in verticals brings it more into contact with competitors which are more geared towards point solutions for certain verticals.The company also grows through acquisitions, recently (April 4) it completed the acquisition of ClearStory Data for $20M which gives it compelling IP and additional capabilities to harnass large scale unstructured data sets. It also provides the company with a long sought after beachhead into Silicon Valley. For the merits of this acquisition see the article from SA contributor Donovan Jones.International growth was 54% with revenue at $23M. But at just 30% of revenue there is an obviously substantial opportunity here.From the earnings PR:Non-GAAP margins are slightly better with gross margin at 90.5% (down from 91.2% a year ago). Mix is a main factor here with greater demand for Connect and Promote taking gross margin down a notch, but at 90% there is no worry for us here.Management argued that it front-loaded some of the hiring for the year, which led to a significant increase of operating cost, rising from $38.7M in Q1 2018 to $67.3M in Q1 2019 producing a non-GAAP operating margin of 2% (still an improvement from the $1.3M non-GAAP operating loss last year).The company is expanding internationally and this of course eats resources but even though there is a great deal of operational leverage. The company is already generating meaningful amounts of cash for a couple of years, but with the tremendous growth it's no surprise that share based compensation is also increasing rapidly (although this is pretty modest in relation to revenue, well under 10%):Incentive pay does tick up the share count still. Their cash position keeps improving, now with cash, equivalents and short-term investments at $461.3M up from $426.2M at the end of last year. The company's convertible senior notes became convertible and is now classified as a short-term liability at $176.3M.Valuation metrics are in the stratosphere, which is really no surprise. On a forward basis it's a more bearable 16x sales, but that's still pretty hefty.Alteryx is one of those unique companies offering capabilities to enterprise which really brings them big benefits and for which there are the most obvious solution.Since we're only in the first innings of extracting value from big data, the company still has a very large runway ahead of it. What investors need to do is check the story from time to time, see whether the competition is increasing, whether there are pricing pressures or whether growth is tapering off or whether there are any management mistakes. If these boxes can all be ticked, which we think is the case (at least so far), the one thing left is to wait for a good entry point. We think today's $98 (although as we write futures are down heavily on renewed trade trouble) is not one of those (our $30 a year ago certainly qualified, even if we failed to execute on that).There is of course no guarantee that the stock will come down in any meaningful way, and one way to deal with that could be to sell put options, and keep selling these until they hit (providing there is no fundamental change in the company's prospects)."

4246224,104905,2019-03-04T14:40:26-05:00,"Alteryx finished 2018 on a high note with a great Q4 earnings report, growing revenue 56.7%, maintaining a strong dollar-based net revenue retention rate of 129%, and achieving 90% gross margin.
        The company changed its accounting standard from ASC 605 to ASC 606 retrospectively for 2018 which leads to higher up-front revenue recognition.
        This article tries to dig deeper into the accounting change and will show some of the hidden value in the SaaS business model.
        The company also issued 2019 guidance which, as always, was probably a bit conservative at a projected revenue growth rate of 38%.
        With the new ASC 606 accounting standard and the conservative 2019 revenue guidance from management, the forward EV/S is 13.5. I think shares are a buy.","Alteryx (AYX), the company revolutionizing business through data science and analytics, just reported another great earnings report in Q4 2018.Since the company no longer qualified as an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2018, it had to adopt the accounting standard ASC 606 instead of ASC 605.Since this accounting change will skew the comparables, and staying on top of growth trends is paramount for growth investors, it is important to take note of these changes to be able to make apple to apple comparisons in the future.I will, therefore, try to dig deeper into the accounting change, first representing the ASC 605 numbers for the last quarter of 2018 for the sake of direct yoy comparison, and then will discuss the new ASC 606 standard to give investors a base to make future comparisons. While doing that we will also discover some of the virtues of the SaaS business model and look into next year's guidance.As most Alteryx investors probably know, we already had a peek into headline numbers from Q4 preliminary results in January because of a change in Alteryx' accounting firm, with Deloitte replacing PwC. Looking at the just-released quarterly report with the seemingly complicated change from the accounting standard ASC 605 to ASC 606, I cannot blame PWC for leaving the ship. Obviously, I'm kidding. PWC left because they use Alteryx' products so much that they saw a conflict of interest if they continued auditing them. Basically, PWC chose to continue using their software rather than collect their fees, a very bullish sign in my view. Alteryx exceeded its preliminary results by achieving revenue of $60.5 million in Q4, an increase of 56.7% yoy, beating their guidance by $3 million or 5.2%. Their international business was again very strong, growing 92% in Q4 and 96% on a full-year basis, and now accounts for 29% of total revenue.The company ended 2018 with 4,696 customers, a 38% increase from the fourth quarter of 2017, adding 381 net new customers in Q4 2018, compared to 338 net new customers in Q4 2017. They now count 534 of the Global 2000 as their customers. In the conference call, Alteryx' management shared that customers with more than $1 million ARR (annual recurring revenue) more than doubled and transactions with greater than $500,000 in annual contract value tripled in 2018. Their dollar-based net revenue retention rate came in at 129%, which was down a bit both yoy and sequentially but still a very healthy number. Non-GAAP gross profits came in at $54.5 million which means the company again achieved a top-in-class 90% non-GAAP gross margin, up almost 5 percentage points from the prior year quarter and basically flat from the previous two quarters.The company slipped back into loss territory, with a non-GAAP operating loss of $1 million (in-line with guidance) and a non-GAAP net loss of $0.5 million. With around break-even margins in Q4, they have considerably decreased their margins sequentially from the 9%-10% level, respectively. But taking full-year comparisons, the company is seeing operating leverage and a clear trend towards profitability: For example, their Non-GAAP operating margin has improved from -23% in 2016 to -5.5% in 2017 and -1% in 2018.Alteryx managed to be cash flow positive with operating cash flow reaching $14.4 million in a typically strong seasonal Q4, yielding an operating cash flow margin of 23.8%. That's slightly down from the year-ago 32.4% operating cash flow margin in Q4 2017, and also the full-year operating cash flow margin has decreased slightly to 12.8% in 2018 from 14.4% in 2017. Still, the company ended 2018 with a much larger cash position of $426 million, compared to $194 million in 2017. Even though the company is clearly putting most of their resources into growth, they are already printing a healthy amount of cash.Summing it up, I think investors can put a big fat green check under Alteryx' ASC 605 numbers and turn the page to a new chapter.First of all, it is important to note that Alteryx did not and will not change the way they do business or the way they structure deals. The change from ASC 605 to ASC 606 is purely an accounting change. Alteryx has published a presentation about the change to ASC 606 on their Investor Relations homepage. Here is a key slide from the presentation:Source: Alteryx Investor Relations.To understand these changes you have to dig a little deeper into Alteryx' typical subscription deal structure and the general relationship between revenue, deferred revenue, billings, and bookings:Alteryx' subscription contract duration varies between one and three years with an average contract duration of two years. They typically bill their customers annually in advance which means that, for example, a customer signing a three-year contract worth $300k pays one year worth of subscription fees in advance at the beginning of every year. Billings are what your customers already paid you even if you haven’t provided your services yet ($100k), while bookings are basically the total contract value (TCV) for the subscription contract ($300k). Accounting rules state that billings can only be recognized as revenue when the service is actually provided, until then they are accounted as deferred revenue. That also means that the difference between bookings and billings ($200k in this example) shows up neither in the profit and loss statement nor in the balance sheet.ASC 605 (old standard):Now, as we see in the slide above, the question when the service is actually provided is a matter of interpretation which can vary according to the used accounting standard. Under ASC 605 (old standard) Alteryx was accounting their revenues ""ratably over the life of the contract"". So, when they got their $100k upfront payment for one year at the beginning of a quarter, they were only allowed to account three months worth of that payment as revenue ($25k), the other nine months ($75k) went to deferred revenue and were subsequently recognized as revenue in the following quarters. Let's go back to my hypothetical example where Alteryx signed a three-year contract worth $300k at the beginning of the year. In this case they have:This is my understanding of accounting under ASC 605 in a simplified manner:Source: Author's table.ASC 606 (new standard):The big change coming with ASC 606 is that the company will recognize 35%-40% of the TCV upfront upon signing as revenue, plus the remaining 60%-65% of the TCV ratably over the lifetime of the contract. Thus, the revenue recognized at the signing of the contract will be much larger than under ASC 605.Let's take the example from above and assume a revenue recognition of 35% of the TCV upfront and 65% recognized over the lifetime of the contract. The company will account:This is my understanding of accounting under ASC 606 in a simplified manner:Source: Author's table.If we compare the two examples above over the duration of the contract lifetime we see the following revenue recognition:Source: Author's table.As you can see, the difference between the two accounting standards is that under the new ASC 606-standard revenue will be recognized more up-front and the subsequent recognition in the remaining quarters will be significantly lower (in this case 35% lower because, of course, 35% of the TCV was already accounted upfront). Also, deferred revenue will be much lower under the new accounting standard going forward.In the following graph you can see the way revenue, billings (invoicing), and deferred revenues will develop over the contract lifetime under ASC 606 (although this example is a bit different than mine since Alteryx assumes the contract signing in the middle of the year which makes it a bit more complicated in my view):Source: Alteryx Investor Relations.Also worth mentioning is that under ASC 606 the company's expense model will closely track the new revenue recognition model, which should lead to no material changes in gross margins from my understanding. However, the company actually reported 92% non-GAAP gross margins under ASC 606 as opposed to 90% non-GAAP gross margins under ASC 605 for the full-year 2018. I won't complain about that.Furthermore, Alteryx will report dollar-based net expansion rate (a metric based on annual contract value or ACV) instead of their previously reported dollar base net revenue retention rate (based on GAAP revenue) going forward. For Q4 2018 the dollar-based net expansion rate was 132%.I know this last part was a bit long-winded and technical. I don't blame you if you switched off for a bit. But here comes a very important point that should make you rethink how you look at the valuation of SaaS businesses in general:Alteryx 2018 revenue just went up to $254 million from $204 million and their GAAP EPS went from $-0.29 to $0.43 because of a mere accounting change. If you like to value them, like most investors do, according to an EV/S multiple, their TTM valuation just dropped from 22.9 to 18.4.But the thing is, nothing changed from a business perspective. These numbers represent the same customers, the same contracts, the same cash flows. The takeaway here is that while accounting numbers are the basis for every investor decision they don't always accurately show the economic value created by a business. It pays off to look beyond the surface of accounting numbers.I think the new accounting standard, ASC 606, is painting a more accurate picture of the revenues generated going forward but still, the example above shows that not all of the economic value created in a SaaS business is shown in the financial statements immediately because of prevailing accounting rules.If you add to that fact that Alteryx' subscription software is extremely sticky, will very likely be continually renewed, and customers spend around 30% more with them every year on average while new customers continue flocking in at a fast pace, I hope you start to understand the underlying value of this business that is not entirely visible at first glance.The company published their historic ASC 606 financials for Q1 to Q4 of 2018 which should be used going forward to have an apple to apple comparison with 2019 numbers:Source: Alteryx Investor Relations.More important, though, is a look into the future. Alteryx released the following guidance for Q1 2019 and the full-year 2019: Since the table above only includes GAAP numbers, investors will most likely have to wait for the actual 2019 quarterly reports to get a Non-GAAP comparison on expense and profit metrics. While profitability is obviously the most important aspect of an investment in the long-term, in Alteryx' case, it should not be the primary focus of investors (other than recognizing that their business model lends itself to great operating leverage in the future).If you want to take a closer look at the profitability outlook, though, I would greatly recommend this excellent article from WCM Equity Research. Spoiler alert: Alteryx has great business economics with the value per customer surpassing the cost of the customer by a wide margin (and this margin will increase over time). Their high profitability outlook is currently still masked by high marketing spending which is necessary to increase the customer base as quickly as possible and maximize long-term absolute dollar profitability.But back to revenue guidance: Alteryx, like so many of its high-growth SaaS-peers, has a track record of giving conservative guidance and consistently beating and raising their own estimations, both on a quarterly and a yearly basis:Source: Author's tables. Data (based on ASC 605) from Alteryx' Earnings Press Releases.Although past performance is never a guarantee of future results, I think shareholders can be reasonably confident that Alteryx will continue to play the beat and raise game going forward – until proven otherwise. I think it's possible that the company will beat their Q1 guidance by about 5% which should put them slightly above a 50% growth rate again. Using an average rate of full-year guidance raises of 2%, the company would get to $380 million revenue in 2019 for 49.6% yoy-growth.Apart from their past beat & raise performance, the recent earnings conference call should also reassure investors that Alteryx is still early on in its journey and has many years of high growth in front of it. CEO Dean Stoecker maintained that the company is not seeing much direct competition to their end-to-end data analytics platform. The standard programme in use for citizen data scientists remains Microsoft Excel (MSFT) and the standard for trained statisticians remains SAS. While Alteryx does compete directly with Excel in some cases, they are mostly complementary to them. From my understanding, the company is really creating a market that hasn't been there before. Stoecker believes that although at the moment some sectors front-run on advanced data analytics in terms of adoption, at the end of the day, the whole world will have to adopt advanced data analytics. Alteryx, which is already a recognized brand in the field, is poised to take advantage of that.As already mentioned, due to Alteryx' accounting change Alteryx' TTM EV/S ratio dropped a bit recently. Nevertheless, shares are still expensive on a trailing basis and on the upper part of their (short) historic valuation range:However, there are two reasons this rather high valuation should not scare you away from buying their shares: Firstly, as I already tried to argue, the value created by a SaaS business is not shown entirely in its financial statements. Secondly, this is a 4.9 billion market cap company with $254 million TTM revenue that claims to have a TAM of more than $49 billion (and expanding).Source: Alteryx Investor Presentation Q3 2018In other words, there is still a ton of growth for this company ahead and by being the first-mover and industry leader in its niche, Alteryx is in pole-position to grow for a long time towards their TAM. At a 50% growth rate, it's not unreasonable to expect the company to grow into its valuation quickly. On a forward basis (using 67 million shares outstanding as of guidance and the current share price of $74) the EV/S ratio already drops to 13.5 using the company's conservative $350 million revenue guidance. If we use a more bullish estimation of $380 million in 2019 revenue, the forward EV/S is 12.5 which is not that much for a company with this growth profile in my opinion.It's understandable to be uneasy about investing in a bearly profitable high valuation multiple company at what could be the end of the market cycle. But you have to look below the surface here. Alteryx' revenue comes almost entirely from subscriptions which are usually locked in for one to three years in advance. Even in a recession, their customers will have to continue using Alteryx because they solve their most complex and important data problems while bringing them tangible time and cost savings. Due to the new accounting standard ASC 606, which paints a more accurate picture of Alteryx' business, they are already profitable on a GAAP-basis in 2018, but much of their profitability potential is still camouflaged by very aggressive sales and marketing spending. At gross margins above 90% (!) and with customer lifetime values that greatly exceed the costs to acquire and maintain customers over time, this business has the potential to become a money printing machine. They have been cash flow positive since 2017, have $426 million in cash on their balance sheet, and their only debt is $200 million of convertible senior notes due in 2023. I feel confident that Alteryx' business will thrive in any economic environment.At the same time, you have to be aware that this is not a buy-and-forget investment. This company is still very small and could become subject to competitive pressures at any time which could change the investment thesis. Also, the stock, while I argued that it is not too overvalued, is still valued on the expectation of exceptional business performance. It will be punished by the market for any small misstep. Lastly, as the saying goes ""growth covers a lot of sins"", so you can not ignore the possibility that there could be problems within the company that investors (and even management) are not aware of at the moment.Having said that, from today's perspective Alteryx business is firing on all cylinders and has only surprised investors positively since their IPO. While you could argue that today is not the best opportunity – timing wise – to buy shares, with high-growth companies like Alteryx buying today is usually a better strategy than waiting on a price drop tomorrow. I rate them as a buy.If you like what you just read, consider following me so you get notified when my new articles come out and you can read them before they hit the paywall.

4228688,104163,2018-12-17T08:53:03-05:00,"Alteryx is growing their customer base and average customer spending at a rapid pace, driving accelerating revenue growth.Consensus 2019 revenue growth estimates appear to be too low, and I expect the pattern of beating and raising revenue estimates will continue into next year.An analysis of Alteryx's business economics suggests that the company will begin to be able to leverage economies to scale to accelerate user acquisitions.2019 could be the first year of sustained quarterly operating profits for Alteryx.","Alteryx (AYX) is a rapidly growing data analytics firm with rapid share price appreciation and revenue growth. Since its market debut, the stock has appreciated an astounding 257%, easily outpacing market returns and the returns of many of its peers. This is in large part due to its strong revenue and user growth, along with best-in-class revenue retention rates that continue to defy skeptics of the company. Despite a rich valuation, I believe Alteryx is a company to own as they continue to penetrate the massive data analytics market and become a leader in their field.Alteryx offers a suite of data analytics software with applications in finance, healthcare, real estate, e-commerce, retail, and most other major sectors of the economy. The software suite can also be used across nearly every department within a business, such as marketing, sales, finance, and customer management. The insights drawn from data analysis are extremely valuable, which is evidenced by their ability to up-sell existing customers and add new ones at a rapid pace.(Alteryx Investor Presentation - Platform Overview)Businesses who are accustomed to relying on spreadsheets typically need to hire experienced data scientists with advanced coding skills to interpret and use data in a productive manner. The expenses involved with hiring a chief data scientist and employing a staff beneath them prevent smaller and mid-sized firms from attempting to use data to improve the operational success of their business. This is the problem that Alteryx is looking to solve.Their goal is to simplify data analytics and allow what they call ""data citizens"" (non-data scientists) to analyze data using a simple drag and drop interface. The software can analyze data from standard Excel (MSFT) spreadsheets, Tableau (DATA), and countless other sources. While the software is easy to use for non-data scientists, seasoned coders can leverage Alteryx's software to generate more advanced insights and make their jobs easier by automating simpler time-wasting tasks.The company estimates that $60 billion worth of work hours are wasted doing repetitive tasks on spreadsheets, time and money that can be saved by Alteryx. This is the single most important statistic that will determine the success of this platform. It doesn't matter how great any particular software suite is, if it can't produce cost savings or improve productivity in an economical way for a firm, there won't be a market for it in the long run.(Alteryx Investor Presentation - Partnered/Compatible Platforms)While the data analytics field may seem crowded, Alteryx has done an excellent job positioning themselves for success here. They have partnerships with almost all other major data analytics services, allowing products to be used synergistically. Not only does Alteryx lack direct competition, but they also benefit indirectly from the growth of their peers.I could spend a lot more time diving into the use cases of their software suite, and perhaps that will be the subject of a follow-up article, but here I'm going to address the business economics which has allowed Alteryx to achieve such remarkable growth. The fundamental cost savings and utility of this software made me excited to research the company, and the operational efficiency is what drove me to make an investment.(10-Q Filings, compiled in Excel)Simply put, Alteryx has been a story of incredible operating efficiency and marketing expertise leading to best-in-class revenue, user, and growth. Over the past year, revenue growth remained in the range of 50-59% y/y, with international revenue growing at an even faster 99% y/y. Though the company has yet to prove that it is sustainably profitable, the business at its core is very streamlined. The lack of a profitability does not highlight a flaw in Alteryx's strategy and cost structure, but rather a basic principle of business economics. The company is at a point of its growth cycle where customers are still incredibly cheap to acquire relative to the revenue they generate (more on this later), and they're, therefore, incentivized to reinvest every incremental dollar they make on their top line into sales and marketing. Now that they've reached a point of breaking even on the bottom line, they can leverage almost all of their top line growth to acquire new users as they continue to benefit from economies of scale.(10-Q filings compiled in Excel, ARPU figures in thousands of dollars)When looking to Alteryx's average revenue per user (ARPU) and user growth stats, it's clear that their product is in extremely high demand by not only new customers but also by customers they've already acquired. Alteryx has class-leading revenue retention rates of 131%, driven by an extremely effective two-pronged marketing strategy. Like most software businesses, the company spends aggressively to build out its customer base. What sets Alteryx apart, however, is its ability to up-sell to existing customers.The prevalence of data analysis in business is growing rapidly, and for good reason. Customers of Alteryx can leverage insights from this analysis to make informed business decisions that can improve operational efficiency and produce cost savings. Once Alteryx acquires a customer, they provide resources to expand their use of the software in new departments and business segments. On their website, they offer educational resources for using analytics software across different business departments from finance, sales, marketing, operations, and customer analytics. When a business starts small with 1 or 2 seats (the software is sold by the seat) in, for example, their finance department, they may soon find themselves exploring how they can leverage data analytics to improve their sales and marketing division. Judging by the strong ARPU growth over the last several quarters, their ""land and expand"" strategy is succeeding with flying colors.(10-Q filings compiled in Excel, figures in thousands of dollars)In 2018, the company paid approximately $78,000 to acquire each incremental customer. This figure is derived by taking the TTM average sales and marketing spending per user added on a quarterly basis. The reason for using a trailing twelve-month figure for marketing costs/user acquired is due to the fact that marketing efforts and spending in a single quarter may not result in a sale in the same quarter. This also does a better job of showing the overall trend in user acquisition costs. This doesn't account for the fact that some of this spending is aimed at expanding the spending of their existing customer base. However, due to the hands-off nature of the ""expand"" portion of their marketing strategy, it's safe to assume the bulk of this category is used to acquire new customers.After Alteryx acquires a customer, they're inexpensive to maintain, as is evidenced by low average fixed costs per user (G&A + COGS + R&D), which are just $6,700 per year. With ARPU just above $50,200 per year, and growing, it becomes clear just how much cash flow Alteryx will be capable of generating when they reach a sufficient level of economies of scale. Alteryx could slow down the pace of their marketing efforts to make a quarterly profit, but they have no incentive to do so.The one negative aspect I uncovered during this analysis is the fact that Alteryx's customer acquisition costs have risen from $62,000 per year in late 2016 to $78,000 today, and will more than likely continue to rise. Logically, as the company works through the ""easier"" portion of their targeted market (those that are most likely to benefit from the software) they're going to have to spend more money to acquire each incremental customer. However, it's also necessary to take into account the fact that ARPU grew 17% over the same period where customer acquisition costs grew 26%. This lends credibility to the thesis that some of this added spending is being directed towards marketing efforts for existing customers, which may have a lower ROI.(WCM Equity Research Estimates) Regardless of how you break it down, the average $78,000 investment made to acquire a customer is more than worth it for Alteryx. In fact, assuming just 3% ARPU growth over the course of 10 years for the average paying customer, each customer acquired is worth a present value of $177,360. This means that customer acquisition costs can continue to rise up until a point where the present value of such an investment is zero, which is quite a bit of wiggle room for Alteryx to adjust its spending.When looking forward to 2019's consensus revenue growth estimates of 35%, these figures seem to be underestimating the ability of Alteryx to leverage revenue growth to acquire new customers. This underestimation of revenue growth serves as an important catalyst for the stock, as I believe they will continue on their trajectory of beating and raising earnings estimates.For Q4 of 2018, Alteryx provided guidance of $56.5-57.5 million, implying 46-49% y/y growth. By no means would these numbers be disappointing, but when breaking down the per-user costs something just doesn't add up. Last quarter, Alteryx added 375 new customers and quarterly ARPU jumped from $11,900 to $12,600.(Quarterly estimates, thousands of dollars)Assuming ARPU stays flat, which is unlikely given the company's recent track record, the company is assuming just 175 new users on the low end, and 250 for the high end of these estimates. For reference, the average per-quarter user growth over the last 12 months has been 314, so it's clear that these numbers are likely underestimated. In Q4, I model a slowdown in user acquisition back to the twelve month average of 314 users, and an incremental jump in customer acquisition costs to $86,000. The increase from $78,000 - 86,000 is reflective of an increased spend on current customers, and higher user acquisition costs as the firm earn a lower return with a scaled marketing budget. Quarterly ARPU is modestly higher at $12,700 leading to projected revenue for the quarter of $58.9 million. This puts revenue growth right back at the middle of the recent range, at 53% y/y.(User cost estimates, thousands of dollars)Alteryx is currently at an inflection point, they've been hovering around a break-even point for the past year or so. Under the assumption that 2019 is just an average year for customer acquisitions, 314 per quarter, and user acquisition costs continue to rise from $78,000 this quarter to $92,000 in Q4 of 2019, the company should be more than able to turn a profit. I also project average fixed costs per user declining to $5,700 over this period where Alteryx is benefiting from economies of scale.Operating profits net of marketing spend provide even more evidence that Alteryx is benefiting substantially from economies of scale. Their marketing budget will continue to grow significantly while being able to operate at a break-even point. With a cash position of $328 million, Alteryx can even afford to operate in the red to leverage a larger marketing effort. The case can be made for sustained 50%+ growth, or even accelerating growth as the company can dedicate more resources to grow its user base.(Revenue & Operating Loss Projections, thousands of dollars)(Alteryx Expense Projections, thousands of dollars)It's important to note that I'm not necessarily predicting a quarterly profit in 2019, as the company may significantly boost R&D (though I've already modeled for a 24% increase here) or G&A expenditure, however, the business economics and growth trajectory would suggest a profit being a very real possibility.The previously described scenario is your typical ""run of the mill"" year, as revenues slow incrementally, user growth rates remain flat, and the company begins to post a growing operating profit. However, with a growing marketing budget, it should logically follow that, even with modestly higher user acquisition costs, Alteryx could actually begin to accelerate user acquisition by re-allocating resources to marketing.(""Blue Skies"" Revenue & Operating Profit Projections)(""Blue Skies"" Expense Projections)In my ""blue skies"" scenario, Alteryx significantly boosts their marketing spending to the point at which they operate at a small, but manageable loss. In doing this, they're able to grow quarterly customer acquisitions to 500/q by the end of 2019, even with customer acquisition costs rising another 31% from Q3 2018.Under these assumptions, FY19 revenue will increase by 48% y/y to $301 million and will finish the year at a $341 million run-rate.Although I would ideally like to value any company using a discounted cash flow method, it's nearly impossible to attempt to predict Alteryx's cash flow and revenue growth more than one or two years out, and margins would mostly be guesswork. Therefore, I begrudgingly default to a price/TTM sales method of valuing the company. To determine an appropriate range within which to value Alteryx, I default to both multiples the market seems to be comfortable valuing the company at and notable peers. AYX PS Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts Over the past year, the Alteryx has traded in a range of 11x sales all the way up to >22x sales at its peak. The closest comparable data analytics firm is Tableau, which is growing at a considerably slower pace of 35% and is valued at a 10x price to sales multiple. Considering these factors, I've decided on a range of 10-14x sales for the purposes of this analysis. This appears to be the market's ""comfortable"" trading range, as the stock has had a difficult time maintaining a multiple above this range until recently.(Sensitivity Analysis, Alteryx)(""Blue Skies"" Sensitivity Analysis, Alteryx)Based on this rudimentary valuation technique, I believe that a fair 12-month price target for the stock falls in the range of $76-100, and in my ""blue skies"" case, $83-109. However, I wouldn't use this valuation method as a reason to buy or sell the stock. Price to sales ratio on a TTM basis is a better proxy for market sentiment both relative to itself and market peers in the high-growth software sector. The bottom line is, Alteryx will either begin to see de-acceleration of revenue growth and the stock will topple over and crash, or the company will grow to a point where it is generating several billion dollars in revenue per year and is worth multiples of what it is today. In this sense, the investment is quite binary, which is a risk some investors may not wish to take. 10-14x sales are not a sustainable multiple in the long run, and as an investor, it's important to understand that the stock is pricing in very high expectations.(Alteryx Market Estimates, projected 2018-2022)Alteryx is in a unique position where they have no real competitors in a rapidly expanding global data analytics market. When summing the total potential cost savings incurred by using Alteryx software, as well as data analytics and analytical tools spending, the total addressable market is a massive $128 billion per year. This market is expected to grow 12% on a compounded basis until 2022, and Alteryx is in a fantastic position to take a sizable sum of this market. There's plenty of room in this market for multiple dominant companies, and it's easy to see Alteryx being a prominent player in this market looking 5-10 years down the road.My strategy for investing in Alteryx is to buy opportunistically, and to slowly build a position over time. As we've seen in 2018, the market is indecisive as to how the company should be valued. Any evidence of accelerating growth in a given quarter will be met with enthusiastic buying, however, if revenue growth appears to be losing its steam the stock could be met with a harsh market reaction. This is far from a risk-free investment at its current valuation, but I believe that patience and appropriate position sizing could make Alteryx a very successful long-term investment."
4223573,103480,2018-11-20T11:40:37-05:00,"Alteryx continued to defy gravity in its Q3 results, toppling estimates on the top and bottom line yet again.Revenue growth continued an unstoppable pace of acceleration, up now to 59% y/y (versus 54% in Q2 and 50% in Q1).Underpinning Alteryx's tremendous growth trajectory is increased traction overseas. International revenues have doubled since the year-ago quarter.Alteryx also essentially hit GAAP breakeven this quarter, a huge accomplishment for a stock that is still growing its top line by ~60% y/y.","If there was a chill in the market for tech stocks, Alteryx (AYX) wouldn't know it. The high-flying data preparation startup quickly shook off an October pullback that briefly dropped the stock to the mid-$40s, thanks to an enormous Q3 print. As Alteryx gets larger, its revenue growth keeps accelerating faster. That's extremely atypical for a high-growth tech stock - or really, for any company at all. Alteryx seems to find no shortage of opportunities to grow, both domestically and abroad, as it consistently executes above plan and dazzles investors quarter after quarter. Precious few SaaS companies have exhibited such consistency as Alteryx, which has demolished Wall Street's expectations in every earnings quarter since its IPO in early 2017. Shares have risen about 4x since then, but in my view, the stock still has far further to go.AYX data by YChartsWhen it comes to Alteryx, its premium valuation has to be put off to one side - as you can see in the chart above, Alteryx has been able to consistently expand its revenue multiple. A 17-18x forward revenue multiple is the kind of valuation that SaaS companies get acquired at (Mulesoft (MULE), Adaptive Insights (ADIN), and Qualtrics (XM) all got bought out by Salesforce (CRM), Workday (WDAY), and SAP (SAP) at similarly high valuation multiples). When a company is growing its revenues at a breakneck ~50-60% pace while continually accelerating quarter after quarter, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact valuation multiple that captures this company's true performance. That's why I believe Alteryx is in a class of its own: it's difficult to compare Alteryx's valuation against a peer set in the SaaS space because there are so few companies with its stellar financial profile. In addition to its rapid growth, Alteryx has also hit breakeven profits - something that even the aforementioned acquisition targets were unable to achieve, despite their high takeout multiples. It stands to reason, then, that a well-managed company with this bottom-line profile despite its high growth rate might be worth substantially more.The need for data (perhaps obsession is a better word) is permeating every industry. CEOs are under immense pressure to make use of every available ounce of proprietary corporate data they have access to; ""data-driven decision-making"" has become the new trend in the C-suite. While there are plenty of tools to analyze this data - analysts have a buffet menu of choices, from Tableau (DATA) to Microsoft PowerBI (MSFT) to Qlik - but very few companies are actually focused on preparing these data streams for rapid analysis, as Alteryx does. Per Alteryx's marketing materials, its technology allows for business users to gain insights from their data within hours of data prep, not weeks.For this reason, it wouldn't be unreasonable to see Alteryx deployed in a majority of the Fortune 500 (many SaaS companies report their penetration rate within the Fortune 500 or the Global 2000; Alteryx does not, but we have to imagine that the figure today is already substantial). Its market opportunity is wide, and it's expanding rapidly internationally - amid strong domestic growth, overseas revenues also doubled this quarter.This is a stock with a long growth trajectory and plenty of upside left. Though Alteryx stock may not double over the next year as it did in 2018, it's still highly likely to outperform the markets if it continues its consistent trend of quarterly beat-and-raises.Here's a look at Alteryx's most recent quarterly results:Figure 1. Alteryx 3Q18 resultsSource: Alteryx investor relationsRevenues grew 59% y/y to $54.2 million, absolutely demolishing Wall Street's target of $49.8 million (+46% y/y) by a huge thirteen-point margin. In an earnings season where revenue beats have been far less frequent than usual in the tech sector, Alteryx's healthy beat spread was welcome news to investors. In addition, this is Alteryx's second consecutive quarter of growth - last quarter's growth rate was 54% y/y, and the quarter before that, growth clocked in at 50% y/y. At a $200 million annual run rate, Alteryx is no longer a tiny company, so to be able to achieve this level of acceleration and push growth close to the 60% mark is truly incredible.The company reported a customer base of 4,315 as of the end of the quarter, up 41% y/y with a net add of 375 customers in the quarter. Even better, the company reported a 131% net retention rate - indicating that last year's cohort of customers tacked on an additional 31% in additional subscription value. Alteryx has always championed a ""land-and-expand"" model in which it grows with its client base over time, and its elevated net retention rates are a testament to that model's success.Alteryx's CEO, Dean Stoecker, attributed a large part of this quarter's success to the company's buildout of verticalized sales teams - as in, sales executives who target companies within a certain industry only. Most successful large-cap software companies, such as Salesforce (CRM) and Workday (WDAY), have developed a verticalized sales approach, with tailored products for requirements-heavy industries such as financial services or healthcare. The fact that Alteryx is following this footprint is an additional indicator that its growth trajectory is promising. Here's some further qualitative comments from Stoecker's prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call:It's important to note that Alteryx's strength isn't just restricted to the top line. Whereas many high-growth tech stocks often choose a balancing point between growth and profitability, Alteryx seems to score high on both fronts. This quarter, its already sky-high pro gross margins gained another five points to clock in at 91% in Q3:Figure 2. Alteryx gross marginsSource: Alteryx investor relationsThis bump in gross margins was able to absorb an accelerated pace of sales spending, which grew 69% y/y to $26.3 million. In spite of that jump, Alteryx still improved its pro forma operating margins to 8%, up five points from 3% in the year-ago quarter.Equally notable is the fact that Alteryx shrunk its GAAP net loss of -$3.3 million to essentially breakeven this quarter, likely becoming one of the only companies to hit breakeven GAAP profits while still growing the top line at ~60% y/y. Alteryx's pro forma EPS of $0.08 also smashed Wall Street's consensus of -$0.05. Alteryx also improved its operating cash flows by more than 7x this quarter to $5.3 million, bringing its year-to-date operating cash flow growth to nearly 2x:Figure 3. Alteryx cash flowsSource: Alteryx investor relationsAlteryx has shown, time and again, that its success is multidimensional. Alteryx has exceeded expectations on virtually every metric of note: revenue growth, gross margins, operating margins, international growth, retention rates, and cash flow. Needless to say, Alteryx is an uncommon asset among SaaS stocks, and its relentless outperformance justifies the fact that its valuation trades in a sphere of its own.The biggest risk to Alteryx, of course, is deceleration of its top line - which will undoubtedly happen, as no company can continue growing at >50% y/y forever. Investors have gotten so accustomed to Alteryx's successive beat-and-raise quarters that the stock might tumble on any whiff of a slowdown. However, with Alteryx's recent buildout of a verticalized sales strategy, plus its momentous public sector wins, it isn't likely to see a meaningful slowdown in the near term. Investors should hold Alteryx for the long term as it continues to assert itself as a critical piece of the IT landscape. Few stocks have had as impressive a run as Alteryx, and fewer still have had fundamental justification for it."
4287149,103480,2019-08-21T13:55:34-04:00,"Amid turbulence in the software sector, Alteryx alone has stood out as impervious to weakening macro conditions and sales execution issues.
        The company continues to grow revenues in the high 50% y/y range, faster than just about any other software company at its scale.
        Shares have rocketed to new all-time highs post-earnings.
        Despite being one of the most expensive stocks in the sector, Alteryx's performance and its critical positioning in big data prep make it a long-term hold.","Trouble is brewing across the tech sector, but you couldn't tell by looking at Alteryx (AYX). The software vendor, best known for providing a data prep tool that helps IT leaders stitch together data from disparate sources and consolidate actionable insights within a single platform, continues to be one of the fastest-growing services in the SaaS sector. In early August, Alteryx reported strong Q2 results, sending shares rocketing up to new all-time highs - in a time when many longtime investor favorites, such as New Relic (NEWR), have fallen sharply out of favor.Is Alteryx expensive? Certainly. It's difficult to fathom a revenue valuation multiple of >20x forward revenues when many software stocks have corrected to <10x forward revenues, especially in light of the latest trade-driven market jitters. But while valuation is one of the top metrics I consider when investing in software stocks, I'll concede that it's much less useful of a concept when considering Alteryx. After all, when Alteryx's revenues are growing near 60% y/y, near-term revenue multiples are a poor indicator of Alteryx's ultimate growth potential. The key message here: stay long on Alteryx and continue riding the wave up; history has shown that Alteryx bounces back quickly from dips and enjoys a long track record of beat-and-raise quarters that consistently outperform Wall Street's expectations. It's no secret that many software companies are reporting sales execution issues on a number of fronts, citing a litany of factors ranging from macro headwinds in Europe, trade noise in China causing companies to delay IT investments, slower-than-planned sales hiring, and poor renewal performance. None of these factors seem to be affecting Alteryx in a meaningful way, suggesting that Alteryx's market is so large that it has room for growth despite macro headwinds. It estimates its market opportunity at $49 billion per its most recent investor deck; if we take this number to be true, then Alteryx has barely scratched 1% of its total TAM.Alteryx's performance on renewals, in particular, has stood out among the crowd. Whereas many software companies of Alteryx's size are typically reporting net revenue retention rates around ~110%, Alteryx's retention rates have increased from last year and this quarter notched 133%.Figure 1. Alteryx net retention trendsSource: Alteryx 2Q19 earnings releaseThis means that on average, Alteryx's customer cohorts are purchasing 33% more in any given period relative to the prior year. A large portion of Alteryx's growth is coming from the existing installed base, which has huge tailwind implications on margin - as it costs far less in sales dollars to boost sales to an existing client than to win over new business. Macro headwinds and trade noise aren't impacting Alteryx at all - its customer continue to add more and more seats.Also unique to Alteryx: typically, companies producing this level of growth are also burning gobs of cash. Alteryx, by contrast, has positive pro forma operating margins and positive free cash flow. It's also got a comfortable net cash position of $247 million ($426 million of cash, less $179 million of convertible debt) - which, alongside positive FCF, gives it plenty of flexibility to chase growth and pursue acquisitions.All in all, Alteryx remains a fantastic long-term investment that is well poised to capitalize on secular shifts toward a big data-driven business environment. Its tools have become integral in the process of blending together disparate data streams, and its strong performance in a time of relative macro instability even suggests that Alteryx may be somewhat recession-proof. Alteryx's valuation premium is justified by stellar performance; stay long here and ride the wave upward.Let's now dive into the results of Alteryx's second quarter:Figure 2. Alteryx 2Q19 resultsSource: Alteryx 2Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew a stunning 59% y/y to $82.0 million, far surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $76.6 million (+48% y/y) by a huge eleven-point margin. Even more impressive is the fact that Alteryx's revenue growth accelerated eight points relative to just 51% y/y growth in Q1 - a feat that very few software companies can pull off, especially with tepid conditions in the global economy. It's not just a customer renewal story either, though >130% retention rates certainly helps. Alteryx has been adding new customers at a breathtaking pace, ending Q2 at just under 5,300 total customers (a net add of 305 customers in the quarter) - up 34% y/y. Big wins this quarter include General Dynamics, IKEA, Raytheon, and fellow SaaS company Salesforce.com (CRM). As these customers ramp up their usage of Alteryx and begin to add seats, Alteryx's ""land and expand"" model will allow for plenty of additional renewal-based growth. Figure 3. Alteryx customer trendsSource: Alteryx 2Q19 earnings releaseDuring his prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call, CEO Dean Stoecker also noted that Alteryx saw an uptick in the number of mega-deals:Additionally, his comments on strong international performance suggest that Alteryx isn't running into the same headwinds that many of its SaaS counterparts are. For a company with a sizable amount of international exposure, we'd expect some Europe or China-based weakness, but this doesn't seem to be true:Alteryx also expects its top-line strength to flow forward. Its full-year revenue guidance now calls for $370-$375 million in revenues, representing 46-48% y/y growth and far ahead of Wall Street's consensus of $362 million. Considering that first-half revenues have grown at a 55% y/y pace, however, even hitting the high end of Alteryx's guidance would imply steep deceleration in the back half of FY19 - when in fact, Alteryx has been on an accelerating cadence. The company has also maintained strong profitability as well. Pro forma gross margins held flat at a sky-high 91% (implying that nearly every dollar of incremental revenues flows to the bottom line), while operating margins took a slight dip to 1%, down from 2% in the year-ago quarter - due primarily to continued investments in sales and marketing. Still, Alteryx turned a positive pro forma net income of $0.9 million, translating to pro forma EPS of $0.01 - seven cents better than Wall Street's expectations of a loss of -$0.06.Don't let go of your Alteryx shares. This data prep leader has proven that it's cyclically immune to many of the factors plaguing the rest of the software industry, and its hyper-growth and ability to consistently raise its guidance targets more than justifies its premium valuation."
4191888,104556,2018-07-30T09:40:22-04:00,"Alteryx, provider of self-serve data analytics, has executed wonderfully since its IPO over a year ago.The company has a big market, high customer satisfaction, and great financials.Watch out for this company in the future. It could become the ""new Excel.""","Alteryx (AYX), provider of data analytics software, is one of my favorite companies because of its huge market, incredible customer satisfaction, and first-class financial picture.AYX data by YChartsThe company offers a full product suite to allow data citizens, people without data science or coding experience, to make sense of the overflow of data these days. The way the world is going, the amount of data will double every two years. This means that in the next two years, the same amount of data will be created as in the history of the world. It's clear. Big Data is here to stay.Rather than pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay the salary of a data scientist, what if you had a platform that enabled Shawn from marketing to make comparable insights from the vast sea of customer data? Alteryx seems to be doing just that.Its software is practically an all-in-one data analytics tool, giving you everything from accessing and cleaning data to blending it to running analysis and predictive models. The company notes that the market for Business Intelligence tools is around $19 billion. On top of this, an extra $10 billion could be added to the market as there are still 20 million spreadsheets users.Source: Investor PresentationOne of the company's goals is to displace all spreadsheets. I'd say that is rather ambitious, considering how entrenched Excel is. But Alteryx's platform is essentially Microsoft (MSFT) Excel on steroids. Rather than import data on clunky spreadsheets, what if there was a way to create workflows with a drag and drop interface? It sounds too good to be true and customers say the same.Source: Investor PresentationIf you take the time to read through Alteryx's case studies, you begin to think, are all case studies this glowing? I always try to take case studies provided by the actual company with a grain of salt, but time and time again, people gush over how much time Alteryx saves them.For instance, here is a quote from a user:Another user claimed that what used to take her 5 months now can be updated in 5 minutes. I can't quite comprehend that, but it is clear that customers are happy.There is one project on Alteryx's community site that includes the case study where an employee in the public sector showed a map of his Alteryx workflow. It was pretty mind-boggling how many data sources it involved, yet here was testimony saying that Alteryx was indeed a life-saver, well, at least a time-saver. And the financials sure are evidence of this customer satisfaction.Revenue in the latest quarter grew 50% to almost $43 million. Gross margins ticked up to an astounding 90%. The reason this number is so high is twofold. First, the software is mostly self-serve, meaning you can easily buy it online as a customer. Rather than engaging a high-paid enterprise sales force to wine and dine IT execs, a simple buy-now is all the company needs. 95% of sales are from subscriptions. Secondly, this software doesn't come cheap. Trailing twelve months sales were about $146 million. In total, the company has about 3,700 customers. This means that the average yearly price for an Alteryx package is almost $39,500. It is crazy to think that organizations will gladly spend this amount of money in a low-touch manner. But that is not the whole story.This strategy works because Alteryx lands and then expands. In the last 13 quarters, the revenue expansion rate has been over 120% and most recently investors have been spoiled by rates above 130%. Since the software is bought on a per-seat basis, companies realize its power and then buy it more employees as well as buy other products like Promote or Connect for deeper analytics.Source: Investor PresentationSo, the initial self-serve amount that Alteryx charges is not indicative of its average yearly selling price. Customers likely don't spend almost $40,000 over the internet. But this is why Alteryx has such high gross margins.This has allowed the company to show serious improvement in operating leverage as well. In the past three years, on a non-GAAP basis, net losses went from -25% of sales to -5% and in the most recent year, -1%. Most of this can be attributed to the decrease in sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue, which decreased from 80% to 51% last year. At the same time, free cash flow margins went from negative to 25% of sales in the latest quarter.All in all, the financial picture of Alteryx is a thing of beauty; great revenue growth and everything else trending in the right direction for profitability.TTM sales are $146 million and management forecasts 40% revenue growth for the next year. This ends up to be about $204 million in forward sales. Enterprise value is about $2.3 billion, meaning 11x forward sales. Of course, not cheap, but not ridiculous either for this quality of a company. Especially, if free cash flow stays high, the market will likely continue to assign a premium valuation.Just like any other company, this one is not without risks. There have been some volatility when other companies in the general space announced new products. For instance, Tableau (NYSE:DATA) announced a data prep product a couple months back and Alteryx's stock languished for a few weeks. Tableau and other data visualization companies do not quite provide the full suite of capabilities that Alteryx does. However, these companies are larger and have sufficient resources to try to squash Alteryx. If money was all it took, the bigger companies would win every time though. And we know that's just not how the cookie always crumbles.Alteryx is a full-service data analytics software provider that has been executing superbly since its IPO just over a year ago. At a market cap of sub-$2.5 billion, it's not too late to jump on this train. Compared to its market potential, this name has a long way to run.Author's Note: Please scroll up and hit the big, orange ""Follow"" button so you can get these articles before they hit the paywall.

4176510,98236,2018-05-23T12:59:00-04:00,"Alteryx shares have been under some pressure lately and are 19% below recent highs.This share price evolution has come despite a very strong quarter that featured a substantial beat in terms of both revenues and EPS when compared to prior guidance.Some observers have mistakenly evaluated Tableau Prep as a product that competes with Alteryx.Some observers, perhaps mesmerized by company forecasts that are unduly conservative, don't realize the relatively attractive valuation of the shares.Some observers mistakenly believe that the recent convertible offering will lead to dilution.","Alteryx (AYX) announced the results of its first fiscal quarter of 2018 a bit less than two weeks ago. As most readers know by this point in time, the company beat its prior forecasts for revenue, margins, and EPS that had been embodied in the First Call consensus by a substantial amount. In addition, the company increased its forward guidance noticeably, although almost certainly by an amount that will be beaten when it next reports its results in August. And yet the shares have significantly underperformed since that time as they had underperformed in prior weeks. Since the earnings release, through this writing, AYX shares have lost about 11% of their value, while the IGV index has decreased by a bit more than 1%. In fact, the shares have declined by 19% since they made a high since the company's IPO in early March. That kind of share price performance is not consistent with that of most other recent tech IPOs and certainly not consistent with the performance of IT vendors that are reporting growth at 50% or more.I think that this pullback has afforded investors an excellent opportunity to either add to current positions or to establish new ones. Alteryx is simply the leader in providing what are called ""civilian data scientists,"" tools that allow them to analyze the flood of data now available, and to use predictive, statistical and geo-spatial tools to provide enterprises with answers that are far more likely to be ""right"" and are available quickly and with less effort than what could be done before. Alteryx really doesn't compete with Tableau (DATA) - and the introduction of Tableau Prep was a non-event in the real world in terms of competition - although obviously not in the stock market. On careful inspection, the recent offering of convertible debt will prove to be accretive for Alteryx - the imagined dilution is most surely a chimera.Alteryx is a small company. Even at its current growth rate, revenues this year are forecast by company management to be around $184 million and its float of 22.6 million shares means that it can see lots of share price volatility that can scare some readers and investors. And despite its pullback, if one looks backward and not ahead, its valuation may be thought to be extended - although I would take the opposite side of that argument. And I really do not know if there are 30 million civilian data scientists that the company talks about who could use the Alteryx tool - that number wouldn't include this writer for sure without lots of patient training. But it is the various misrepresentations and flawed analysis that have provided investors with an attractive entry price. I think the one year potential for this name is substantial and will afford investors a substantial level of positive alpha.Some observers have said that Alteryx shares are overvalued. Others are now concerned by the threat of nascent competition from Tableau and its new data prep offering. And then there have been concerns expressed about the dilution potential from the company's offering of convertible debt that closed last week. In fact, none of these issues is really relevant to current business trends at Alteryx, outside the minds of investors. But I suppose the minds of investors may count for more than reality at a certain moment in time. Perception, regardless of its validity, is far more important than reality.I last wrote about this company for SA back in February, when the shares were rising and the company had reported a blow-out quarter. It seems worthwhile to revisit the outlook for the company and its shares again, given just how weak its shares have performed in the last couple of months. Alteryx has been public now for a bit more than a year, and it has experienced strong share price performance over that time, rising by more than 100%. But the fact is that the company has shown improved operational performance consistently over that span, with five consecutive quarters of beat and raise results.Alteryx shares started to turn down in the wake of an announcement by Tableau that it was finally introducing a product based on its Project Maestro that offers data preparation as part of a combined visualization solution for its users. This was really not new news. Tableau had been announcing the coming of Project Maestro for a couple of years now and it had been in beta test a long time. This was perceived by some as a substantial threat to the current business of Alteryx, or at least as a threat to the company's growth rate.Yes, both Alteryx and Tableau deal with data analytics - and they have done so essentially since the start of their lives. No, they have not, do not and are very unlikely to compete with each other in the data prep market or any other part of the analytics space in any meaningful fashion. The misunderstanding regarding competition arises because Alteryx does provide its users with data preparation solutions… and sometimes, the two companies have partnered in supporting a use case that uses Alteryx data prep and Tableau's data visualization technology. How much business might that represent? Not much, because that's not an optimal use of the Alteryx technology and never has been. On this last call, and on other occasions, the CEO said that only 15% from Alteryx goes into any visualization product. And of Alteryx users who send the results of their work to visualization products, 50% of their output goes into something other than visualization. And self evidently, Tableau is hardly the only visualization product on the market. And the fact is, at the moment, the Tableau prep product is what is called ""light-weight."" It simply lacks the sophistication to do what the Alteryx product does and has never been designed to do so. It certainly enhances the overall Tableau user experience and it provides differentiation of Tableau compared to its real competitors such as Qlik (NASDAQ:QLIK), and particularly, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Power BI.The basic cost per seat for the Alteryx product is about $4,000/year on a three-year term and $5,200/year for a one-year subscription. The product that Tableau offers that includes its version of data prep functionality costs $840/year on a one-year contract. Needless to say, volume discounts are available, although perhaps less so for Tableau than Alteryx. But the point is clearly what Tableau is offering is not designed to address the same market that Alteryx is serving. No one would pay $4,000 for something that could be gotten elsewhere for $840. And they don't.Alteryx is a set of tools that ultimately is designed to support applications that revolve around predictive analytics. No matter how many charts and graphs a user creates using Tableau, or any other data visualization tool, they will never get an answer involving a business decision. An exercise that I commend to investors is to take a little time and go to the Alteryx community site where readers can easily find use cases. For those who do not want to undertake that exercise, of all the use cases described, one of these, a T-Mobile (TMUS) use case involves Alteryx to Tableau functionality. Would that use case be at risk? It is hard to say given the very nascent status of the Tableau offering.In another use case, Alteryx technology had to be used to provide maintenance for a particular Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) Tableau application. That's functionality most probably not in the initial release of Tableau prep. In all, there are literally scores of use cases that are on the community web site and two of these involve Tableau, and the other 98% do not, and are strictly about predictive and geo-spatial analytics and just how much time and how many right answers Alteryx solution are delivering to its customers.At the risk of reprising the Alteryx commercial which I have linked for the convenience of readers, people use Alteryx because it requires no coding, it can be used by non-full time data scientists, it has repeatable workflows and it integrates data from all kind of sources and is able to perform predictive, statistical, predictive and spatial analytics within the same workflow. Tableau can integrate data from multiple sources and send it to its engine where a visual representation can be made. It doesn't do and isn't designed to do the other things that Alteryx does. That is not a knock on Tableau. The fact that a VW (OTCPK:VLKAY) can't deal with the same volume of freight when compared to a Mack Truck doesn't mean that the VW isn't ""good"" but it doesn't work to haul heavy volumes of freight.For readers interested in reviews from outside the Alteryx community, the GetApp site which is current as of April 20 provides current reviews of the product from real users, although just a sample size of five. Again, these people use the product for predictive analytics in combination with data prep. That is really the unique part of what Alteryx is all about prep plus predictive analytics in a no-code/low code environment. And that's very far from what the new Tableau offering does, or is designed to do or is likely to be able to do anytime in the near future.When asked about Tableau on the latest conference call, CEO Dean Stocker said, ""our teams (teams of Tableau and Alteryx sales reps) are still talking and doing deals together and working on bigger, more interesting accounts together. So, I think they did the right thing for themselves and validated our actions many years ago."" That is a lot closer to the real world than some of the fear-mongering that has informed the share price in recent weeks.Alteryx really did report a strong upside compared to guidance. And yes, despite the upside, there were some commentators on this site who felt that the report was less than optimal and that the company's growth rate was de-celerating. While it is certainly true that the 50% growth reported for the quarter is lower than the 53% top-line growth reported in Q4, it is probably more than good enough. The company added 281 customers in the quarter, a 19% increase from adds the prior year, and it ended the quarter with 3,673 customers, up by 43% year-over-year. As is typical for IT vendors, new name accounts decreased seasonally from 338 net new in Q4.Some of the new wins included 3M, Intel, (INTC) Merck, (MRK) Waste Management (WM) and Under Armor (UA). At this point, given the success the company has had with its installed base, it is in a position to focus more on larger deals and larger new customers and I expect to see that as a trend for the balance of this year. Most impressive, at least to me, was the 132% dollar based net retention rate in the quarter. This is the sixth consecutive quarter with a dollar-based net retention rate of above 130% and is one reason why this company has consistently over-attained its forecast by such a considerable percentage.The company has expanded its offerings with the introduction of both Connect and Promote. Connect is a solution that facilitates what is called the ""first mile"" of analytics. Connect might be thought of as a very sophisticated way of aggregating and sharing data that is far more complex and offers more user benefits than the rather simplified forms of data prep available. Ironically, Connect has actually been a tool sold to new Alteryx users despite the fears of some that data collection demand might be subsumed by Tableau prep. While the TAM estimates for an enterprise like Alteryx can get wild, and are not really such that should be taken seriously, the opportunity set engendered by Connect is clearly additive to the overall potential market for this company and the early returns from its sales have apparently exceeded initial expectations.Promote is a so-called ""last mile"" analytic solution. It is capability that has expanded the overall scalability of the Alteryx solution Obviously, because of the nature of Promote, it is a solution that will be sold to users wanting to deploy the most far-ranging possible analytic capabilities and it will probably take somewhat longer to start to contribute noticeably to revenue growth, but it is likely to be a factor in both differentiating Alteryx's offering and buoying percentage growth numbers in the second half of this year.I have focused on these two product introductions because they are likely one of the reasons that Alteryx will be able to sustain very high net dollar based renewal rates for some time into the future, and in turn this is part of the reason to expect that the company will continue to exceed its revenue targets.Within total revenues, international business expanded by 92% and US sales grew by 39%. In the prior quarter, international revenues grew by 81% and US revenues grew by 48%. There is probably a bit of seasonal influence in the level of percentage growth seen in the US, although despite seasonal factors, US revenues still grew by 7% sequentially, a strong Q4 to Q1 progression for most companies in the IT space. The level of international growth is extraordinary even though it is from a very small base.I think US revenue growth will accelerate in Q2 for several reasons, including seasonal factors, the completion of the annual sales force cull and particularly because of the major product releases discussed earlier which are likely to drive noticeable revenues in the current quarter. I think that reworking the permitted use of the company's offering of demographic data, which costs $34,000/user/year, and is only available in the US and in Canada, probably had some impact on US revenue growth, unrelated to actual product demand.The company achieved a rather significant increase in its gross margin which improved by 500 basis points year on year. Essentially, the company was able to improve the productivity of its own professional services organization by using its own technology. In addition, in the wake of its data breach about which much was written last fall, and the company's remediation and its subsequent restriction on passing through data, it had smaller fees that were paid to third-party data providers, which had the effect of improving gross margins. I have linked here for an article about that particular episode. Overall, the company was able to reduce the cost of revenue line by 20% sequentially, which is quite remarkable.Management suggested that the costs of Connect and Promote service and installation will increase the cost of services, although exactly how that will play out in the numbers is harder to understand given the pricing and go-to-market strategies of these products. (Alteryx Connect costs $39,000/year and Alteryx Promote costs quite a bit more - and to use either, customers have to buy Alteryx Server which costs $58,500/year. I imagine at that level of price, there will be no problem in sustaining gross margins.)The company did improve its operating expense ratio slightly, mainly because of a decline in general and administrative cost ratios which went from 27% of revenue to 23% of revenue. Overall, GAAP operating expenses only fell from 103% of revenues to 102% of revenues, mainly because of a 78% year-on-year increase in GAAP general and administrative expense.The CFO pointed out that there will be both seasonal and one time events impacting Q2 expenses. The company is still trying to play catch-up in terms of its sales and marketing headcount and it will hold its Inspire Conference next month which does generate rather substantial sales and marketing expense for a company of this size.The company generated $12 million of operating cash this quarter, of which 31% came from stock based comp. This compares to $5 million of operating cash flow in the prior year's quarter, when almost 40% of cash flow came from stock based comp. Most of the increase in cash flow came from a sharp reduction in accounts receivable in the current quarter, when compared to year earlier levels. DSO fell very sharply compared to the end of 2017, although why that happened was not discussed by management. The company saw a small decline in its deferred revenue balance in Q1. This is not unusual and represents the impact of annual billings which typically lead to a massive build in deferred revenue in Q4, which is in part amortized into recorded revenue over the course of the year. The company offers both one-year and three-year subscriptions and the average contract term also is likely to influence quarterly changes in deferred revenue.In the wake of a quarter in which guidance was dramatically exceeded, it seems fair to ask what the likely revenue progression might be going forward. It seems clear, at least to this writer, that the sequential increase in revenues that Alteryx has forecast, which at the high point is just 3%, is highly unlikely. In fact, given that Alteryx books deals all through any given quarter, presumably, it has already surpassed the revenue run rate it forecast for Q2. Again, at the least, the Inspire show will see a flurry of some large deal activity announced, and some of those transactions will already have taken place. And given the prices of the company's newest products now in GA, I would expect that at least on a sequential basis to see some impact from transactions involving those solutions. So, no, I do not think it reasonable to base a valuation analysis on the specifics of management's guidance - in fact the exact opposite is the case.It is certainly possible to put together a forecast for conservative quarterly revenue progression for Alteryx, both for this coming quarter and the full year, but it is a guesstimate - and not much more than that. I think it is reasonable to expect at least 12% sequential growth this quarter, a touch above the growth in Q1 to reflect some of tailwinds I have commented on above. That suggests a revenue expectation of about $48 million for this quarter, and using somewhat comparable methodology, produces a revenue target of $202 million to $205 million for the full year, and perhaps close $290 million in 2019. That later number is more than 21% above the currently published First Call consensus, and it might suggest why a rational price target can be so much higher than the current average price target depicted on First Call.Management's forecast, to the extent it is a forecast, can be similarly modified for expected growth in non-GAAP expenses. While at this point Alteryx is not likely to produce earnings or a high enough level of free cash flow to be valued on those metrics, it is reasonable to assume that the company will indeed see the leverage at scale that is inherent in the company's land and expand sales model, where the heavy lifting in terms of costs is up-front, and where renewals and expansions are highly profitable.Management's forecast for earnings this year implies operating expense of about $180 million. Non-GAAP operating expense was a bit under $40 million in Q1. How the company could manage to reach $180 million of operating expense for the full year requires very aggressive assumptions in terms of hiring. That would not seem to match the company's revenue forecasts. It would simply be difficult, in today's constrained tech hiring environment, for this company to be able to grow its research and development spend at the rate it did last quarter (28% sequentially). Qualified people do not exist than can be readily hired by a smaller company at such a cadence. And the growth in sales and marketing expense, while to some degree a function of the strong level of investment internationally, probably cannot be sustained at Q1 levels in the balance of the year. This past quarter, the company, despite the sharp growth in operating expenses, still beat its own forecast for EPS quite dramatically ($0.01 loss vs. $0.06 projected), and it seems reasonable to assume a similar pattern for the balance of this year.One often hears that Alteryx shares are overvalued. Of course, the same might be said about almost all hyper-growth IT businesses at this point. The difference in this situation is that Alteryx shares have seen a noticeable pullback. It's mainly a question of forward growth rate assumptions. I think those are unreasonably low and will be noticeably exceeded as detailed above.At the moment, Alteryx has an enterprise value of $1.8 billion. My forward 12-month revenue forecast is around $220 million. So, the shares are selling at an EV/S of around 8X. This is actually a discount from the average EV/S ratio calculated by CS which was most recently 9.4X for companies in its cohort of 30%-plus revenue growth. That may be a surprise to some readers and commentators, and therein lies the opportunity.As it happens, because of its very high gross margin levels, this company is noticeably more profitable (or it makes lower losses) than its peers in the CS high growth cohort. And it has generated a bit of operating cash flow the last two quarters, far better than burning cash.Big data analytics and AI are trends that are happening now and will continue to happen over the coming quarters. Alteryx is, at the least, one of the leaders, if not the absolute leader in terms of both its vision and its ability to execute. Its latest product offerings, Connect and Promote, are quite differentiated when compared to capabilities available from other vendors in this space.The misperception that Tableau is a competitor is one that in time will abate. Most lately, some analysts and commentators have focused on the so-called dilution from the recent convertible debt offering. The fact is that acquiring what is close to free money is a positive and not a negative. I've shared that analysis with my Ticker Target investment community in some detail, but most likely the result of the convertible offering will be to accelerate growth and improve profitability such that the net result will be accretion and not dilution.On the call, management talked about some further undefined surprises to be unveiled at its Inspire user conference. I have no idea what those might be. But it does seem that Inspire may produce a tradeable event. I think there's notable positive alpha to be had in taking a position or expanding holdings in the shares of this company at this time."
4172146,103480,2018-05-10T08:30:41-04:00,"Alteryx's shares retreated after the company posted Q1 earnings, despite beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines.Revenue growth decelerated somewhat in the quarter, but no company can be expected to keep growing at a >50% rate forever.Alteryx is one of the smallest-cap companies to achieve free cash flow positive status.With shares now off about 15% from all-time highs, it's a good time to revisit the bullish thesis for Alteryx.","Ever since its IPO last March at a mere $14 per share, data preparation company Alteryx (AYX) has been one of the crown jewels of the SaaS software sector, seemingly rallying without end and finding new ways to impress investors. Having returned more than 2x from its IPO price, Alteryx has become the model for which other SaaS IPOs are benchmarked against.This quarter was the first time that Alteryx has dipped after releasing earnings. Stranger still, Alteryx still beat analysts' expectations by a fairly wide margin in the quarter. Growth decelerated somewhat, but that was to be expected - what kind of company can keep growing in excess of 50% forever? Alteryx also raised its guidance and showed strength on the profit side.Shares aren't off too much, dropping a few percentage points in after-hours trading. To be fair, many other tech names have also dropped after good earnings this quarter as investors cooled off on the sector and rotated into energy. Still, the fact that this is Alteryx's first post-earnings drop is significant:AYX data by YChartsOne thing's for sure: Alteryx is certainly not a cheap stock. After having risen about 30% in the year-to-date alone, adding to ~2x gains from the IPO date, Alteryx now sports a hefty valuation.Let's review where the company's valuation is now - at Alteryx's post-earnings close near $34, the company has a market cap of $2.0 billion. After netting out the $207.7 million of cash on Alteryx's balance sheet, the company is left with an enterprise value of $1.79 billion. Against the company's refreshed FY18 guidance range of $183-186 million (+40% y/y), this represents an EV/FY18 revenue multiple of 9.7x.This isn't the most expensive multiple in the software sector, but it's certainly close. Names like Atlassian (TEAM) and Adobe (ADBE) have perennially traded around these levels. The question for investors is: does Alteryx deserve to be part of this rarefied club, and can its valuation hold?I assert that the answer is yes. While I'd ordinarily shy away from buying a company that's trading at 10x forward revenues, Alteryx is a different animal altogether. It's difficult to conventionally value a company that's currently growing at 50% y/y and call it expensive at 10x revenues. The growth alone is worth the premium. On top of that, Alteryx is one of the smallest companies to reach free cash flow positive status so early in its lifetime - some SaaS companies don't hit FCF profitability until they hit $500 million or more in revenues; Alteryx has become FCF positive much earlier. This means that its operations are self-sufficient, and as margins continue to improve, the company has plenty of FCF upside alongside growth.The other bullish driver for Alteryx is that its product is a truly unique asset. True, it's not the only data-prep player in the market, but due to its niche focus on data preparation and blending, it has become one of the names synonymous with its space. The SaaS sector has seen renewed interest in infrastructure/data plays this year, as names like MuleSoft (MULE) get nabbed for extremely rich valuations. Alteryx essentially checks all the boxes that justify its premium and make it an attractive acquisition target: high growth, superior cash flow margins, unique and well-reputed product.The bottom line for investors: the pullback is a good opportunity to pick up Alteryx shares for a discount. The company has seen pressure since the broad market April selloff, and it's now trading about 15% below all-time highs. Alteryx's string of strong quarterly performances will allow it to get over this hurdle fairly quickly as the stock resumes its ascent.Let's review the company's Q1 results:Source: Alteryx investor relationsRevenues grew 50% y/y to $42.8 million in the quarter, surpassing analyst expectations of $398.8 million (+39% y/y) by 11 points. That's a stunning result. From the magnitude of this beat, as well as the associated raise in guidance tied to this quarter's outperformance, it's unclear why Alteryx shares pulled back unless investors were just taking profits from the stock's massive year-to-date run (buy the rumor, sell the news has been a common theme throughout the quarter).Growth decelerated somewhat from the 53% y/y growth Alteryx saw in Q4, but that's not abnormal - for a company growing this quickly, it will eventually become a victim to its own scale. No company can grow in excess of 50% forever. Looking forward to the rest of the year, however, Alteryx's outlook calling for 40% growth seems a bit conservative. Given that the company's deceleration only comes a few points at a time, it's more likely that the company can finish out the year at a growth rate in the mid-40s.Here's the other kicker in the quarter - the company's GAAP gross profits soared to $37.8 million, boosting gross margins to a stunning 88%. This is, no doubt, a ""best-in-class"" performance in the SaaS sector, for whom margins in the 70s to low 80s are more normal. Alteryx showed 5 points of improvement from a gross margin of 83% in 1Q17. At this high of a gross margin level, it's already difficult to drive even one point of improvement; Alteryx gave us five. In essence, nearly every dollar of incremental revenues flows through to the bottom line - and given that Alteryx's business is almost purely subscription-based, this company has powerful profit potential as it continues to scale.Through additional improvements in operating leverage, Alteryx's operating loss of -$5.8 million in the quarter represented a GAAP operating margin of just -17.8%, 190bps better than -19.7% in 1Q17. Many of Alteryx's peers with a similar scale and growth rate, like Okta (OKTA), are running at operating margins in the -30% to -40% range - so the fact that Alteryx is zooming toward breakeven quicker than other software peers is truly amazing. Pro forma EPS of -$0.01 was essentially breakeven, and it also smashed analyst consensus of -$0.07.Where Alteryx also continues to impress is on the cash flow side. As previously mentioned, Alteryx is one of the smallest companies to attain FCF-positive status in the software industry. Even a company like Zendesk (ZEN), which has been public for years and has attained a revenue run rate well in excess of $500 million, is still showing negative FCF. Alteryx's ability to generate free cash flow is a strong signal of its management's cost discipline:Figure 2. Alteryx cash flow resultsSource: Alteryx investor relationsOperating cash flows in the quarter grew roughly 2.5x to $12.1 million; netting out $1.4 million of capex, the company generated $10.7 million of free cash flow. This is up more than 2x than last year's FCF of $4.5 million, and also represents a robust FCF margin of 25%. This rivals the 28% FCF margin of Dropbox (DBX), which is touted for its massive cash flows. Dropbox, though, is at a revenue run rate well in excess of $1 billion - it's more than 6x larger than Alteryx, so the cash flow margin there is more or less expected.Relatively speaking, Alteryx is still a small company. Imagine how much greater the free cash flow margins can be as the company continues to grow in the mid-40s atop gross margins near 90%. Nearly all of this growth is accretive to the bottom line and to free cash flow.While I and many other investors are extremely sensitive to valuation, Alteryx is one of the names for whom conventional valuation multiples can be misleading. The company's sheer tendencies toward hyper-growth, as well as its market-leading metrics on the gross margin and free cash flow side, make its premium multiple worth paying many times over.Pullbacks in Alteryx shares are rare. Take advantage of it to build up a position."
4173663,104028,2018-05-14T09:18:31-04:00,Alteryx is a momentum stock and when revenue momentum slows valuation comes in.Revenue growth decelerated to 50% Y-O-Y due to a slower domestic sales pace and deferred revenues declined.Tableau Prep being offered for free in the new Creator package is a new concern for momentum investors.Waiting for a more opportunistic valuation entry level.,"Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) put up a good but not a great quarter considering its valuation of more than 10X on an EV/Fwd Revenue basis. We like the addressable market growth and the company's full life-cycle, collaborative, governed, analytics workbench solution for data scientists, citizen data scientists and potentially line of business users. However, competition is keen and valuation prevents us from having a buy opinion at this price level.The 50% Y-O-Y total revenue growth (we projected an above consensus growth rate of 45%) was strong but 39.9% domestic growth represents a step-down from the 44% to 48% rates produced in 2017. International did have good results though, with an 88% increase Y-O-Y. Net revenue retention was down a percentage point compared to the year ago figure of 133%. We note that deferred revenue on a current and non-current basis declined sequentially by 2% though the first quarter is seasonally slower than fourth quarter performances.Gross profit margins improved to 88% versus 83% last year which does speak to pricing power strength. The company missed our GAAP earnings per share estimate by $0.02. It was mainly due to research and development as well as sales and marketing expenses growing more rapidly than we projected. We were looking for operating expenses as a percent of revenues of 93% versus the 102% posted. Part of the increase was due to on-boarding of new hires Q1 and Q4. Investment in the sales force and developers will continue as it expands its geographic footprint and markets Promote which allows users to operationalize or put analytic models into production and monitor their efficacy.Operating cash flow margins keep improving and EBITDA margins came in at -7% versus -17% last year. Cash flow from operations was $12 million versus $5 million in the year ago quarter though the result reflects higher collections realized from Q4 sales. This improving cash generation does highlight the favorable economics of Alteryx's business model.Tableau prep (project Maestro) launched in April is being bundled with the Creator offering and is a shot across the bow of Alteryx and other data prep and BI vendors. At this juncture Alteryx has deeper blending/prep functionality but the market may worry for a few quarters about how fast Tableau will expand prep functionality and thus represent a headwind to Alteryx marketing efforts. Right now only 15% of Alteryx's platform outputs go to visualization products and of those about 50% go to non-Tableau visualization products. We are monitoring these developments closely.We are a bit surprised to see the CEO selling so many shares recently (from March 14th to April 27th). And of course it raises the question: if the outlook on the company's fundamentals and stock are bright, why is the chairman and chief executive officer selling 160,000 shares worth $5.478 million at prices ranging from $30.71 to $36.81. It may be for tax reasons and we didn't ask the company, but it is noteworthy.Alteryx is an attractive analytics pure play. We suspect the market may be projecting an uplift in revenue growth from the new Promote offering but management noted several times on the conference call that it is still too early and that a material change may not surface for ""6 to 8 to 10 quarters"". We see modest upside potential with shares trading at 10.4x EV/2018 Projected Revenues and a deceleration surfacing in domestic revenue growth as well as new competitive and pricing concerns emerging from Tableau Prep."
4175767,21815,2018-05-21T05:17:38-04:00,"The company is marching ahead, growing at a 50% pace leaving a trail of happy customers in its wake.The shares are off significantly from the highs due to the issue of senior notes, but we think this offers an opportunity.The shares are expensive, but this is hardly surprising given the opportunities that face the company and the happy customers.","Self-service data analytics provider Alteryx (AYX) has come off its recent highs (which, arguably, were pretty high) so we are wondering whether a good entry point is opening up.Part of the recent price fall is the offering of $200m of 0.5% senior notes at a conversion price of $44.33, which constitutes a 7% dilution. It is somewhat disconcerting that only a year after the IPO the company feels it has to go back to the market already.On the other hand, the company handily beat Q1 expectations, growing revenues at 50%, much higher than the mid-point guided 38%.Business software platform service modelWe have a little analytical framework for this sort of business software platforms, as these kinds of platforms offer multiple models to improve value for shareholders.Not all of these steps are equally relevant for all companies with similar business models. We'll briefly discuss the most relevant ones for Alteryx below.Alteryx started out offering business analytics through Alteryx Designer and Altyrix Server, the two main analytics platforms which companies download to their own servers.These applications allow even relatively untrained personnel (that is non-data scientist and/or people without coding capabilities) to turn data into predictive analytics leading to better business decisions.And as a couple of excellent SA articles from Bert Hochfeld (who is more qualified than us on assessing the functionality of business software) have shown (here and here), this stuff works and here is a link with all the different solutions the company provides.There are numerous case studies of success stories on the website and in the CC, the main selling point seems to be that the platform is much easier to use than anything out there and even saves professional data analyst lots of work.There are two ways the company achieves its really impressive Q1 132% net dollar-based retention rate:There is no data to separate the two but given that the new apps haven't been around, it's likely that most comes from seat expansion, at least for now. There is some anecdotal evidence for this like this about a customer, Quest Diagnostics (Q1CC):The Alteryx platform really simplifies data gathering and therefore taps into a large universe of '30M of disenfranchised analysts who hate their jobs,' according to management, having to struggle with legacy apps and Excel.What the company wants to do is to ""create the citizen data scientists,"" which both empowers professional data analysts and move data analytics beyond the realm of traditional data analysts.They're doing this with their code light platform and machine learning algorithms generating higher order analytic outcomes in minutes, rather than months.Again, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence from the Q1CC:With new offices in Singapore and Tokyo, and acquiring its distributor in Sydney, Australia, this increasingly is a global company. They have a host of foreign companies as client already, like Cathay Pacific, BNP Paribas and KDDI Corporation.They do have a service business (as well as relying on outside consultants, see below). This expanded less rapidly compared to overall revenue, which was one of the reasons for the gross margin expansion.But with Connect and Promote being more service intensive, this margin expansion is unlikely to last and they might even contract a bit.The natural ecosystem for the company is data visualization companies like Tableau (DATA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Qlik as these are mostly complementary products.We discuss Tableau a bit more below under competition. However, only 15% of the outbound traffic from Alteryx goes into any visualization product.Partners are responsible for 20% of revenues according to management, mostly coming from SI or analytics consultants helping clients to get the most out of the platform. So this is a pretty important item. The company has a certification program for these consultants.A three-year seat of Alteryx Designer costs $4,000 and most of the revenues are recurring. A part of these are ploughed back into R&D and S&M:AYX Research and Development Expense (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsThe company has added to their core applications. New ones include:Alteryx Promote is now attached to Designer and management expects an uptake in the coming quarters. When asked about adoption potential, here is what management argued (Q1CC):And they're not done, there are substantial opportunities in machine learning with things like auto modeling and smart predictive capabilities, natural language processing and natural language generation, whether for acquisition or in-house development.We're still at the very early innings of this space and this is also the point where new uses are discovered:We have no data to what extent (if any) this is already happening but if management sees the possibilities we're sure some users are already tinkering with the platform.This company might be unique in some ways, as they are adding a new item to our business model list. Alteryx is using its own technology to arrive at better decisions and it seems to be working. Here is management (Q1CC):The Q1 results were such that the company raised its guidance for the rest of the year (Q1CC):(Note: The $70M upper limit of non-GAAP operating loss should be $17M).Tableau is a partner (the companies even sponsor one-another's user conferences) but it remains to be seen to what extent they can stay away from each other's turf.Tableau's Maestro remains elusive, but they now have Tableau Prep, a lightweight data preparation solution as a free component which entails at least some encroachment on Alteryx's turf. Here is what management argued during the Q1CC:But we can't exclude this becoming a little more problematic in the future, but then again, there are few markets without significant competition.On the other hand, the company is itself expanding its footprint with new areas like Connect and Promote, leading at least some companies to unwind their legacy BI applications.AYX Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsAbove you see the GAAP gross margin is an already rather phenomenal 88% and rising. The non-GAAP version reached 90%, up from 84% in Q1 2017.There is a good deal of leverage here (Q1CC):Bert Hochfeld wrote after the previous quarter results (Q4 2017) when the company reported 84% of gross margin that:He pointed to the customer support for the newer products (Connect and Promote) as the reason for that here we are with the 90% of Q1, which is extraordinary.Also on the operating level this exists as well, although perhaps not in GAAP. Non-GAAP operating margin improved markedly from minus 13% in Q1 2017 to just minus 3% in Q1 2018, despite escalating investments in S&M and overseas.Operating margins were negatively affected by a big ramp in S&M (from $15.6M in Q1 2017 to $23.1M in Q1 2018) but this should not be a cause for concern as the company has many growth opportunities and pursuing these is one of the main imperatives at this stage.AYX Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThe company already generates quite a bit of cash. In fact, analyst Michael Turitis from Raymond James argued that it (Q1CC):Management did downplay these results quite a bit though (Q1CC):Half the free cash flow is due to stock-based compensation although there has been little dilution in the first year since the IPO (in March 2017), there is more (7%) of that to come because of the notes that have just been issued.AYX Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsAnother metric to keep an eye on is:AYX Non-Current Deferred Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsThat's a pretty hefty jump in deferred revenue, which are pre-payments and hence a liability. But they also indicate the cash-generating abilities of the company, especially for the enterprise market.AYX EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsYes, the shares are expensive but this is a backward-looking figure and with revenue growing at a 50% rate, time is on the side of investors here, if the company can keep that up.We're not too worried about the lack of earnings at this stage. It's early innings and stellar figures like the 90% gross margin and 132% net-dollar expansion rate suggest these are likely to come.While we're not data scientists, not even citizen ones, but we still believe there are a lot of metrics that point to lots of happy customers. Apparently, this company has something fairly unique to offer, data analytics made simple.The shares are expensive, but that's par for the course. They are actually off 20% from their 52-week highs so we think picking a few up here is a strategy with a good risk/reward profile.The reason for the recent weakness is the $200M in convertible notes, but we think once these are in the rear-view mirror, the share price has a good chance of recovery."
4153960,20521,2018-03-06T19:43:59-05:00,"The SaaS market is a healthy, robust, exciting cauldron of innovation.There's a pool of hyperactive bootstrapped or seed-funded startups that could be diamonds in the making.Which of them can Alteryx invest in or acquire? What other partnerships can it form?","According to IDC, the worldwide market for big data and analytics software reached approximately $49.1 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow at a five-year CAGR of 10.6%. Within the broader business analytics software market, Billion-Dollar Unicorn Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) addresses the business intelligence and analytic tools, analytic data integration and spatial information analysis markets that accounted for $18 billion in 2015 and are expected to grow to approximately $27 billion in 2020.Alteryx's JourneyIrvine, California-based Alteryx was founded in 2010 by CEO Dean Stoecker, CCO Olivia Duane Adams, and CTO Ned Harding. They had originally registered the company as SRC LLC in 1997 with a vision to build tools that would allow customers to engage in strategic applications and conduct tactical execution against those strategies. They started out as system integrators offering cloud-based analytics applications. It was in January 2006 that they rolled out the first version of the Alteryx product. It grew out of the need to create one single tool with many capabilities that could manage various technologies with fewer resources.Today, Alteryx is a leading provider of self-service data analytics software. Its subscription-based, end-to-end analytics platform allows organizations to easily prepare, blend, and analyze data from disparate sources and come up with data-driven decisions. This is done through visual workflows and an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that can eliminate the need to write code and reduce time-consuming tasks to a few mouse-clicks. It aims to make the platform as ubiquitous in the workplace as spreadsheets.Alteryx was bootstrapped initially with a little help from family funds. In 2011, the company raised $6 million in funding from SAP Ventures. Since then, it has raised $163 million from investors including Insight Venture Partners, Iconiq Capital, Meritech Capital Partners, Sapphire Ventures, and Toba Capital. It raised $85 million in its latest round in October 2015 at a valuation approaching $1 billion. The company went public in March last year at a valuation of about $840 million.For the fourth quarter, Alteryx reported revenue of $38.6 million, up 55%. GAAP net loss $(1.5) million, an improvement compared to $(8.1) million a year ago. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $1.4 million or $0.02 per diluted share. Analysts expected loss of $(0.03) per share on revenue of $35.89 million.For full year 2017, revenue grew 53% to $131.6 million. GAAP net loss was $(19.5) million, compared to $(30.7) million for 2016. Non-GAAP net loss per share was $(0.11).Alteryx ended the year with 3,392 customers, up 46%. It added 338 net new customers in Q4 and achieved a dollar-based net revenue retention rate of 131%.For the first quarter of 2018, revenue is expected to be in the range of $39 million to $40 million. Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in the range of $(0.06) to $(0.07).For full year 2018, revenue is expected to be in the range of $176 million to $179 million. Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in the range of $(0.24) to $(0.29).As of December 31, 2017, Alteryx had cash, cash equivalents, and short- and long-term investments of $194.1 million, compared with $182.6 million as of September 30, 2017.Alteryx currently has partnerships with Tableau (NYSE:DATA), Qlik (NASDAQ:QLIK), Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services. But as I said in a recent post, there's an unprecedented opportunity for SaaS companies. The SaaS market is a healthy, robust, exciting cauldron of innovation. There's a pool of hyperactive bootstrapped or seed-funded startups that could be diamonds in the making. Which of them can Alteryx invest in or acquire? What other partnerships can it form?Following the strong results, its stock is trading at a 52-week high of $36.63 with a market cap of $2.17 billion. Its 52-week low is $14.61, its list price when it went public nearly a year ago."
4196907,103480,2018-08-09T03:38:09-04:00,"Alteryx shares rocketed upward after posting Q2 results that smashed analyst expectations on the top line.Revenue growth accelerated to 54% y/y, four points higher than 50% y/y in Q1.Recall that Alteryx pulled back slightly in Q1 after growth decelerated. The pickup in growth reassures investors that Alteryx's growth trajectory is still strong.The company also made respectable progress on the bottom-line front.","Never have any doubt in Alteryx (AYX). The big data preparation software company, after a small pullback last quarter due to decelerating revenue growth (despite still beating analyst targets), has rebounded sharply after Q2 earnings and is now chasing new all-time highs. It appears that last quarter's slowdown in growth was just a fluke - Alteryx's top line is expanding faster than ever, thanks to tremendous success in retaining and upsetting to its growing installed base. There's no doubt that shares of Alteryx are expensive. Alteryx is what most investors call a multi-bagger: in the ~1.5 years since its IPO, shares have returned nearly 4x the original IPO price of $14. The company's post-Q2 earnings reaction, adding another 10% to a strong year-to-date rally that was barely interrupted by the Q1 pullback, has taken Alteryx to new all-time highs in the low $50s:AYX data by YChartsOrdinarily, I would not recommend staying long on a company that is trading at such a rich 14x forward revenue multiple. Valuation is one of my top investment criteria, and a SaaS stock trading anywhere above a 10x forward revenue multiple screams expensive.There are good reasons, however, why I believe Alteryx to be one of the few permanent long positions there are. First and foremost is an incredible growth trajectory. Alteryx has managed to sustain >50% revenue growth ever since it went public - which is an incredible feat, especially as it continues to get larger and larger. This demonstrates just how mission-critical its services are in a data-hungry IT environment. Alteryx's drag-and-drop interface for data blending and preparation is a necessary tool in a big data ecosystem that is increasingly trying to ingest and analyze large datasets from multiple disconnected sources. Demand for Alteryx's solution (which, by the way, also faces limited competition from large-cap software companies, which is another important point of the Alteryx bullish thesis) is unlikely to slow down anytime soon. Then there's also the fact that, relative to other high-growth SaaS companies, Alteryx is one of the few that is nearly breaking even on a GAAP basis, as well as posting positive free cash flow. Most high-growth companies have to dump tremendous amounts of cash into sales and marketing in order to achieve growth - this tradeoff of growth in favor of margin is one that most SaaS companies choose to make. Alteryx, however, seems to have the best of both worlds with a >50% growth rate yet a slim -13% net margin, on top of a small but growing FCF margin profile. In my view, near-term valuation multiples make little sense in evaluating Alteryx, especially when its revenue guidance ranges almost invariably fall short of its actual revenue achievements. This rally still has plenty of steam left to run.Here's a look at Alteryx's Q2 results:Figure 1. Alteryx Q2 earnings Source: Alteryx investor relationsRevenues grew 54% y/y to $46.8 million, completely smashing Wall Street's expectations of $43.7 million (+44% y/y) by a wide, ten-point margin. Note that last quarter, Alteryx had grown just 50% y/y, so revenue growth accelerated by four points sequentially - which is tremendously difficult to do. Wall Street was clearly expecting Alteryx to continue following the decelerating revenue growth trend that it initiated last quarter, but clearly, the company has resisted the slowdown.One of the key reasons driving this outperformance was what CEO Dean Stoecker called a ""best-in-class"" net revenue retention rate, clocking in at 131% for the quarter. Note that for most SaaS companies, this metric stands at 100-110% (which indicates 0-10% upsells within the installed base, net of churn). For Alteryx to achieve 131% revenue retention means that on average, the company is succeeding at getting its clients to purchase one-third more of their original billings - a true ""land and expand"" story. In keeping with these high retention rates, Alteryx also noted that it crossed the milestone of >$200 million in annual recurring revenue. Note that Alteryx's revenue guidance for the current fiscal year, at $191-$193 million (+46% y/y) is already less than the company's total recurring revenue base. This means that, in the following fiscal year, any new business (whether from new clients or from upsells) that Alteryx lands will be purely incremental - it has already contractually locked down $200 million in revenues. This gives Alteryx a powerful base from which to continue growing - especially adding in the fact that its international business, per Alteryx's CEO, has doubled this quarter. Still, with international revenue streams representing just 28% of the total revenue base, there's plenty of room for further expansion. It's also worth noting that Alteryx landed some large blue-chip names to its client roster in the quarter, further accelerating its recurring revenue growth with a stable, low-churn clientele. Notable wins included Samsung, Dropbox (DBX), Tim Hortons, and Union Pacific Railroad (UNP).Equally key to note is that despite Alteryx's outperformance on the growth front, it didn't have to burn profitability in order to achieve it. It's not difficult for companies to achieve higher growth if they sacrifice profitability and adopt a mode of ""growth at all costs"" - but for Alteryx, this is not the case. On a pro forma basis (net of stock comp), Alteryx's already-high gross margin of 85% expanded six points to 90%, while pro forma operating losses were sliced in half to -9%, a nine-point improvement from -18% in the year-ago quarter. Alteryx's pro forma EPS of -$0.09 also edged out over analyst consensus of -$0.10.The one slightly disappointing result from the quarter was the fact that Alteryx's operating cash flows (one of the key drivers of the Alteryx bullish thesis) turned negative after having been slightly positive in 2017.Figure 2. Alteryx cash flowsSource: Alteryx investor relationsIf we drill down into the drivers of cash flow, however, we note that the bulk of the differential between this year and last year stemmed not from higher losses (net loss actually improved by $1.7 million year-over-year), but due to a much greater increase in accounts receivable compared to the prior year. This may be a short-lived collections timing issue that will reverse itself next quarter. Note also that, despite the small headwind this quarter, operating cash flows in the first half of FY18 still grew 12% y/y to $6.4 million.Despite an already-generous valuation multiple, Alteryx's top-tier quarterly results more than justify the company's tremendous year-to-date rally and premium valuation relative to the broader software sector. Alteryx's growth narrative is very rare, even within the SaaS space - few companies can achieve sequential acceleration at Alteryx's scale, let alone do it without sacrificing profitability. Stay bullish on this name for the long haul."

What it also has is a dizzying array of growth opportunities and excellent execution on many.A 90% gross margin and 131% dollar retention rate testify to the inherent profitability of the business model, so the lack of profitability should not worry anyone.The shares are expensive, but that's what you pay in this market.","Three months ago (on May 21 of this year) we argued (here) that a good entry point in the shares of Alteryx (AYX) had emerged. Indeed, the shares were at $30 and quite a bit has happened since and the shares are up some 80% since:We only regret (to put it mildly, we're actually kicking ourselves) not having bought the shares for our SHU portfolio when we should have done so according to our own analysis, a bit of a lapse in judgement as we had done all the hard work.Anyway, the company produced yet another blow-out quarter and the number of growth avenues in front of it is dazzling.And of course the quarterly numbers were good, very good. A little perspective:AYX Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThe company is growing revenues at 50%+ pace (54% in Q2) and while it's not yet profitable, operational metrics are improving. In any case, profitability isn't the issue right now as the company has so many growth opportunities ahead of it that it is investing heavily, and rightfully so.Here are some of these growth opportunities:Basically, the company is faced with a $10B TAM with data citizens (that is, people with no formal training in data analytics), which is where the company started. And the winner of that space (Q2CC):These are to a considerable extent complementary as the data citizens free up time in the data gathering and preparation process for advanced analytics and predictive modeling.And given the fact that the company is raking in ever bigger clients (the likes of Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) in Q2) in ever bigger deals, its six figure+ deals doubled in the quarter.Replacing legacy products is still ongoing (Q2CC):The company is very good at land and expand, which is another terrific source of revenue growth for the company (Q2CC):This is amazing, and it crystallizes in the phenomenal 131% dollar retention rate which has been consistently above 130% for numerous quarters.Adding new products extends the life of land and expand. The company already has some 250 distinct tools and SDK for integrating unlimited amounts of third-party solutions, but it still keeps adding modules, like:These are rather sophisticated and expensive products (tens of thousands of dollars a year), clearly beyond the data citizen level. The amount of service and installation and general hand-holding involved might dent gross margins a tad, but these are rather robust at 90%, so we wouldn't worry too much about that.The company also has an extensive community which is still rapidly growing (Q2CC):In the community, users share their unique solutions as they have deep local knowledge that Alteryx installers and service workers lack, so they expand the boundaries of what can be done with the platform and share the knowledge. It's no surprise therefore that the community takes an important place in growing the company (Q2CC):People in the community often come up with unique applications and can even open up whole new fields, this has happened with finance, supply chain management, tax and fraud, and even legal analysis.Supporting the community is the online Alteryx Academy, where community members have consumed 140,000 interactive lessons and obtained 3200 product certifications.The company also has an extensive ecosystem of partners, consisting of system integrators analytic consulting practices, and global audit and advisory firms. How does this help Alteryx sell stuff? Well (Q2CC):So the company does not only sell directly to them, they also bring new customers and it has a similar function as the community, expanding the frontiers of what can be done with the Alteryx platform.International revenue grew by a whopping 100% but are still just 28% of revenues and the company is making a major effort here to keep expanding its presence in more territories.The company increased the international headcount by 97% and it is already present in 70 different countries.There was some discussion on the CC whether all this would not inevitably move to the cloud, but this is a slow movement as most companies still have most of their data on premise, and it's unlikely they want all their data in a single place in the cloud so this is likely to become a hybrid solution.AYX Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsNon-GAAP gross margin was even a tad better at 90%, a 600 basis point improvement over last year (Q2CC):Gross margin is likely to decline a bit as recently introduced more service-intensive products gain more traction, but at 90% this isn't exactly a disaster.Operating margins are still quite negative, but this is no surprise given the rise in headcount as the company is still in a land-grab and will be for some time to come. Operating expenses increased from $30.8M to $46.5M y/y although they are a little inflated in Q2 by the Inspire community conference.AYX Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThe company isn't bleeding cash, although quarter-to-quarter it can vary quite a bit. In any case, with the recent senior notes offering they have more than enough cash ($405.2M) even for some acquisitions.AYX Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsShare-based compensation is 7.6% of revenues, not unsubstantial but not unusual either. The IPO is not that long ago, so we have little to go on in terms of dilution.After yet another beat the company issues yet another raise in guidance:AYX EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YChartsWhile the company keeps doing beat and raise, its valuation multiples keep expanding. For 2018 the company guides revenues between $191M and $193M, with the market cap at $3.32B and $230M in notes that gives an EV/S multiple of 17.7. Yes this is a lot.We have little doubt that Alteryx is doing something that no other company is doing, and doing it very well. We also have little doubt that the company has multiple growth avenues in front of it that will keep delivering a lot of growth.This is a special company, if you're not convinced of that consider these two metrics which are simply outstanding:And these are not freak one-quarter results, these metrics are structurally very high, even if they can vary a bit quarter-to-quarter.Whether you want to invest into a company that isn't (yet) profitable and is valued at over 17x sales, we understand it is a bit much for some, but what you get is pure quality.At the minimum, investors should buy any dip that will appear from time to time, like we should have done when we had done all the hard work. But we don't think investors will regret buying even at these lofty valuation levels."
4134488,104014,2017-12-29T16:26:10-05:00,"The AI software market is expected to grow 28x between 2016 and 2025.The high cost and low supply of AI programmers will create huge demand for AI driven software and web services in the years to come.Alteryx, Inc. and Wix.com are both well positioned to grow within this sector of the AI Revolution.","This series has already investigated GPU chip designers and a data storage manufacturer as direct play on the AI Revolution. This article will take a leap downstream of the market and check out two small to medium-cap players in the software and web design sectors poised for big growth ahead.AI as a software is expected to grow from $3.2B in 2016 to $89.8B by 2025, according to research firm Tractica. This represents a 28x increase from last year and provides a peek at the potential opportunity ahead of us as investors. A recent article from NYTimes paints the picture clear:The supply-demand for AI programmers is disproportionately skewed. 10,000 AI experts is only 1 per 755,000 people in the world for an industry that forecast to add 1.7% to global GDP by 2035. Competition for these programmers is so fierce that companies are willing to pay incentives well above their $500k salaries. This means that small and medium sized businesses are unable to afford an AI programmer on their staff to keep up with larger competition. Enter AI software.AI as a software offers the benefits of Deep Learning at a fraction of the development costs. Software developers absorb the exceedingly high costs of AI programmers and amortize those costs out by selling subscription packages for the AI software. Meanwhile, the small and medium sized businesses owners reap the benefit of having AI capabilities at their fingertips.Based on a recent study from Alteryx presented in their investor presentation, 94% of organizations use multiple data resources with 60%+ managing five or more different sources. This translates into hours lost manually manipulated and combing through data. Extensive data sets must be access, prepared, and cleansed before being integrated to allow for analytical coding. Expensive software and labor are usually required to create the app for output. This is where AYX makes its value proposition: delivering machine learning/AI capability to the common business user.The nice thing about AYX is that its platform is scalable and can pull in additional data sources to learn from, like census, credit scores, traffic and maps, etc. Being an all-encompassing SAS provider, any average Joe like myself can run analytics without needing coding or advanced analytical skills. This means I can harness the power of deep learning to spot trends and opportunities with my business that would have otherwise been nearly impossible.What’s so impressive about AYX is that it has a very diverse blue-chip customer base with household names like P&G, GE, Ford, HP, Microsoft, Home Depot, McDonald’s Coke. This not only establishes a broad foundation of revenue streams, but reinforces AYX’s calculated TAM of $19B from 2016. Add in the additional $10B opportunity from the 21 million advanced data prep spreadsheet users worldwide, and AYX has a huge opportunity ahead of it.Since 2014, AYX has seen 50% CAGR revenues and 52% y/y revenue growth this year alone. Meanwhile, cost of goods sold and operating expenses only grew 31% and 35% y/y, significantly outpaced by revenues. While the company is not forecast to be earning positive before 2019, its free cash flows (FCF) have entered positive territory at $6.4M over the trailing twelve months. This is a positive sign for future valuation of the stock and opens the door for more analyst coverage as the stock becomes easier to value.Image Source: Excel Spreadsheet using Income Statement dataManagement also expects both its gross margins and operating margins to increase over time, eventually allowing the company to start reporting positive earnings.Most of AYX’s operating costs are employee related. It also sports a very clean and easy to follow income statement. 95% of its revenues originate from its subscription revenue model, translating into a highly visible business model. AYX also sports a 133% net revenue retention and has no unusual expenses to report. All in all, this company should be an easy one to monitor and follow as an investment.AYX sits on a very comfortable cash position of $95M with no long-term debt, which makes me comfortable as an investor. With current year forecast revenues at $129M and a P/S ratio of 11, AYX is just beginning to scratch the surface on its potential opportunity.But buyer beware. At $1.5B market cap, this is a small cap stock sitting 25% above its Morningstar fair value after rocketing 67% this year. This makes it a prime target for short seller attacks near term. For those with patience and a longer runway however, this stock appears to have the legs and room to run.The nearest comparable company to Wix.com would be GoDaddy.com if GoDaddy were to grow an artificially intelligent brain and develop its own eye for design. WIX originally laid its foundation as a web site developer, but has sense blasted away all competition by introducing the world’s first web development package run by artificial intelligence.New subscribers to WIX are asked a few simple questions about the user’s business before the AI algorithms comb through billions of website designs to find the perfect customized match. This process only takes a couple of minutes and even gathers content from around the web and social media to strengthen the user’s website.Subscription are inexpensive, ranging from $5 to $40. This business model appears to be working as customer retention is extremely high and revenues continue to accelerate. WIX has essentially created a self-sustaining revenue model where each year brings addiitonal revenues to its recurring subscription base. As of this last quarter, revenues accelerated 46% y/y, faster than the 43% growth in each of the prior two yearsImage Source: Company Overview November - December 2017However, like AYX, WIX also reports earnings in the red. But it appears that they are managing spending exceedingly well as OPEX continues to fall as a percent of revenues. This is a great sign for investors and puts them on pace for positive earnings of $0.52 per share in 2018. FCF’s are already positive for WIX and grew an impressive 91% y/y to $70M on a TTM basis. This is a good sign for those looking for some certainty in the value of the stock, as fair value analysis using DCF is much more reliable when FCF is historically positive.With a heavy 53% of its employees devoted to R&D and already strong history of innovation, it appears WIX should continue to lead the market in innovation and gain market share. Below are results from WIX’s search traffic from Google Trends, showing an increase in interest relative to its competition. With an absence of market share information, this is a decent gauge on whether a service provider is gaining in popularity or not.Finally, WIX’s sticky subscription model appears to incentive users to roll their agreements into an annual subscription, as shown below in the subscription breakdown. Most small to medium sized business owners would prefer to deal with the day to day of operations and avoid losing focus in the weeds of website development. This is where I see WIX differentiating itself in that its AI algorithms do all of the thinking and designing for you. Having a superior AI manage your website at an low cost is significantly more attractive than spending the hours yourself and forking up the cash for a professional developer.I like WIX at its current price, which is a hair north of its Morningstar fair value of $59 per share and only 6.9 P/S ratio with a history of 40%+ annual revenues growth.Based on this high level analysis, WIX appears to be the more attractive buy based on today's share prices. Longer term, AYX may be better positioned to grow as it sells a more diverse product line to deep pocketed customers within a larger market. As mentioned in previous articles, I will wait to see which way the wind blows into the New Year and look to buy both should the market (and these AI related stocks) correct."
4151612,98236,2018-02-28T08:12:12-05:00,"Alteryx announced very strong quarterly results and raised guidance for both Q1 and the full year last week.While the shares appreciated, they have not gotten quite stratospheric in that regard.The company's guidance seems likely to be substantially exceeded based on both quantitative and qualitative comments of the management.As good as the headline numbers were, both cash flow and bookings performance was better still.The company continues to provide its clients with solutions that produce great ROI and in turn have lead to a dollar-based net retention rate of above 130% for the past 5 quarters.","A few days ago, Alteryx (AYX) announced the results of its Q4. I have written enough encomiums this quarter for companies reporting exceptional results to last a lifetime. Just last evening, one of my prior picks, PEGA (NASDAQ:PEGA) reported very strong numbers. I really do not keep track of how many blow-outs there have been this past quarter, but it seems to me that it must be some kind of a record. There are many reasons for that to be sure and it is not out of place to remind readers of some of them. Obviously, the improvement of the global economy is leading to a significant upturn in overall capex. And capex itself is coming from a very constrained level stretching back a number of years which means percentage increases can be quite large. There are, to be sure, more specific factors that are animating the impressive performance of IT sales. Amongst those factors is quite simply current iterations of IT offerings are affording users better ROI than has been available in the recent past.And along those lines, we come to Alteryx. Why is Alteryx showing growth re-acceleration and very strong dollar based net retention rates? It is basically that the Alteryx set of solutions, which couples data prep and blending along with advanced analytics that can be implemented either with a code-free platform as well as more sophisticated and complex solutions used by trained data scientists, provides users with highly successful outcomes. Users of the Alteryx platform actually can develop predictive analytics that drive better decisions for their enterprises and they can do so with far less effort than most anything else on the market. Simply put, Alteryx produces highly visible and valuable results for its users and as an initial deployment lands within an enterprise and shows the power and ease of use of the platform, it often goes viral. There really isn't a much better way to sell than having your customers do the selling for you. And that is what is happening here and why the growth re-acceleration and the greater percentage growth forecast. I have linked here to the Alteryx Community site where readers can see what Alteryx customers are doing with their deployments. While it is not appropriate to get carried away, in some regards Alteryx has developed a platform that is likely to be on millions of desktops over the years and to noticeably improve decision making along the way. How much might that be worth? It is hard to value something quite as unique and game changing as that which Alteryx offers. Like Shopify (SHOP) in its category, there really isn't an alternative that quite encompasses the functionality that Alteryx offers. And thus, like Shopify, it is very hard to precisely value this shooting star. But in the balance of this article, I will make some effort to sort through the Alteryx playbook and take a look at the business in more detail.Investors frequently say, not just about this company, but about many other tech businesses that while the company is admirable, the valuation is too rich. And it is a bit trite to say ""you get what you pay for."" One reader commented about a recent article I wrote about Wix that because of valuation, ""I am staying away from virtual storefronts."" The issue for Wix, as it is for this company is the sustainability of hyper growth. Of course Alteryx shares are not ""cheap."" Based on a current enterprise value of a bit over $1.8 billion, and a more realistic revenue expectation for this year than that imparted through company guidance, the forward EV/S is 9X or thereabouts. But a couple of years of 40%-50% growth can solve many valuation issues decisively. That is what I expect will be the case here and why I hold the shares and expect to do so for some time to come. And that is why I think, despite the strong price appreciation the shares have achieved since the company went public a bit less than a year ago, they are still worth buying. Alteryx is likely to be a significant business at some point, or perhaps equally likely it will get bought.As for the title of this article, the song Everything's Coming Up Roses dates back to the musical production of Gypsy, which was written and composed by Stephen Sondheim and Julie Styne. It was originally sung by Ethel Merman. It was one of her ""signature"" songs and it is said to be a Broadway anthem. I think it is pretty straightforward to suggest that everything came up roses and then some for Alteryx this last quarter.There are two ways to approach thinking about Alteryx in terms of an investment thesis. Both have a certain amount of validity. One line of inquiry is to review the solutions the company is offering and plans to introduce and to evaluate how its users have gotten benefit from its set of solutions. The other is looking at the numbers in detail. Alteryx is still quite a small business but some insight can be gained in looking at the current state of the numbers and the guidance the company has provided.Last quarter the company the company again beat its prior guidance and raised its forecast above the prior consensus. Revenues reached $38.6 million which was a beat of more than 7% compared to prior expectations. This is the second quarter in a row in which AYX has posted significant revenue upside. The upside was driven by a significant over attainment in the number of new customers who were ""landed"" in the quarter. Overall, the company closed 338 net new customers last quarter, ending the year at almost 3400 users. That 338 additions metric compares to just 231 net new customers the prior quarter. As this is a subscription revenue company, the addition of new customers in a particular quarter doesn't have a huge impact on revenues in that quarter, but the magnitude of the over attainment was great enough to move the needle a bit. The company is accelerating the number of new customers it can ""land"" in a given quarter by sustained investments in sales and marketing spend, and it is starting to see the customers it does land start with a larger initial commitment than has been the case in the recent past.In addition, the company continues to see a dollar based net retention rate greater than it has planned or has been willing to include in guidance. Last quarter, for the 5th quarter in a row, the dollar based net retention rate exceeded 130%. That is an extraordinary achievement for this company Management continues to suggest that this kind of metric may not be sustainable indefinitely. It is not terribly surprising that the company is reluctant to forecast the level of expansion it has been achieving as something that will continue indefinitely but at this point, the feedback that the company has had from its installed base customers is driving their expansion at rates that are leading to re-accelerating revenue growth. This link is to an Alteryx commercial, but that doesn't necessarily detract from its validity. There are many other stories of successful Alteryx projects available.Why is this happening, and can it be sustained? I think the answer, and the reason I own the shares and recommend them to clients is that these kind of results are likely to continue for some time to come and specifically, while the guidance provided by Alteryx was a noticeable increase, the level it is forecasting remains below any reasonable extrapolation of trends in the past couple of quarters, and the potential results that might be expected from the company's massive planned investment in both sales and marketing and research and development.Obviously, no one can forecast the future with any certainty, and that is especially true when it comes to a solution such as the one offered by Alteryx that has never been offered before by anyone, at least with the attributes that Alteryx can offer. I have linked to a couple of user reviews that come from Gartner's Peer Insights compendium that are on point and suggest why the company is achieving the kind of success it has enjoyed. Basically, the Alteryx products provide users with experiences that substantially enhance their productivity and lead to much better decision making without the kind of effort that other deep analytic projects most often entail. According to some, there is just so much wasted effort trying to amalgamate data and then devise queries using highly specialized query tools. Alteryx is much easier to use-both for those citizen data scientists that are the company's target market but also because of data analytic professionals are able to use the light-code version of the product to improve their productivity. I have no way of trying to identify some kind of statistics regarding user experiences using Alteryx, but from what I can see, the reasons the company's growth rate is so strong is that user satisfaction is higher for them than it is for many other alternatives in the space. User satisfaction which is built on high productivity for users is about the best way there can be to secure that very high dollar based net retention rate which is helping to drive the upsides the company has seen. I have every reason to believe that the company will be able to sustain that metric, and thus significantly exceed the current level of revenue guidance that was provided on the conference call.For the last two quarters, Alteryx has produced positive non-GAAP earnings compared to prior company guidance for non-GAAP losses. Part of this was obviously the result of the revenue upside in both quarters. Another component of the upside has been gross margins which reached 84% on a GAAP basis last quarter, compared to 83% in the same quarter the prior year. This level of gross margins is probably the apogee of what should reasonably be expected; the company has two newer products called Connect and Promote that are likely to require additional support services in order to be successfully deployed. But looked at overall, main driver of the upside last quarter had to do with opex spending which apparently lagged the level the company wanted to spend. Overall, in this just reported quarter, Alteryx opex rose by less than 10% on a GAAP basis sequentially, while revenues rose by 13%. Management is attempting to maximize growth, and to do so is going to require a more rapid cadence of increases in both development spend and sales and marketing. Sales and marketing costs did show a more significant increase in the past quarter, primarily reflecting the accelerated rate of new customer acquisition coupled with the very high dollar based net expansion rate. Most commissions are going to be paid on bookings more than on recognized revenues and are also a function of commission accelerators which likely impacted a substantial component of the sales force last quarter.The company increased its hiring globally last quarter, and many of these individuals started on the Alteryx payroll as of January 1st. So far this year, the company has added more than 60 individuals on a base of 555 employees at the end of last year. The company increased its headcount by 40 individuals in total in Q4, so it is likely that the cadence of expense growth is going to quicken this quarter, and perhaps beyond that. That said, however, unless the 60 people that have been hired are extreme outliers in terms of their compensation, it will be difficult to see a scenario in which these additions will add $5 million to op ex in this current quarter, the increase implied in the company's guidance..Will Alteryx actually revert to non-GAAP losses as it has forecast? It is really a function of sequential growth. The company is forecasting that it will grow non-GAAP expenses by about $5 million. That is going to be difficult to do, based on what we know of hiring so far and the rate of sequential quarter spending increase last quarter.The company has forecast sequential revenue growth of about 4%. That kind of forecast is difficult to square with the extremely rapid rate of customer acquisition last quarter. Much of the revenue impact from that cohort of customers will be seen in Q1 during which the company will bill these new customers for a full 90 days of usage. In addition, the tempo of ""expand"" may itself be weighted toward further expansion. Much of expand for this company, at least at this point, is basically all about users contracting for additional seats. The company doesn't discuss the addition of additional seats on a quarterly basis or in any other fashion, but some anecdotal evidence suggests a very rapid cadence of ""expand"" for many users.While many company's present conservative guidance and do so consistently, given the current valuation of Alteryx, it is important to properly calculate valuation metrics that are at least somewhat close to reality. The investment case for this company rests on achieving hyper-growth-above 40%-for several years to come. The use of company guidance, which forecasts a revenue growth cadence far below that level, simply leads to what appear to be inaccurate conclusions regarding the outlook for the shares.I have written about this fairly recent IPO once before on these pages. Much of that article was focused on trying to evaluate the market and this company's competitive positioning. Although that was 5 months ago, not much has changed, except additional and different commentaries on the TAM for what this company sells. During the latest conference call, the company talked about there being 30 million data analysts worldwide who are potential users of the Alteryx code-free platform. In addition, there are some substantial number of data scientists who solve ""mission-critical challenges of enterprises (using) the Alteryx code-friendly platform."" Whatever the precise number is-and this quarter's commentary regarding the target market was said to be greater than the number referenced the prior quarter-scarcely matters given the size of this company, its pricing, and its competitive positioning.While Gartner had suggested that Alteryx was a challenger in its MQ analysis, it most recently ranked the company as a leader. Alteryx has also won the Gold designation in Gartner's first ever Peer Insights Customer Choice award. I think it is likely to see that the next Gartner MQ analysis which is typically released in February, will show the company with a leader quadrant ranking.One thing that investors might note is that the Alteryx approach is multi-pronged. By that I mean that the company offers several different sets of solutions within the analytics paradigm. For example, users are able to access, cleanse, blend and then analyze business data without much or any coding. What is really a benefit for those citizen data scientists is that they do not need to learn how to use two solutions, one to blend data and the other to analyze it. There are solution sets that probably do an equivalent job when it comes to data blending. But the power of Alteryx is that it combines blending with analytics and does so in a potentially code-free environment. That is really why its users seem to give the company accolades and to develop successful projects in a timely fashion using the technology. I have linked here to a page that describes what users can do with different flavors of Alteryx. I think just these descriptions will resonate with many users as illustrating the kinds of functionality that modern enterprises are eager to buy. That is really why the dollar-based retention rate is so high, and why it is likely to stay high for the foreseeable future.Another thing to notice here is that this company is a partner with the data visualization vendors such as Tableau (DATA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Qlik. Much has been written about the potential coming of Tableau's Maestro and how it might compete with Alteryx. One analyst hung a downgrade on Alteryx because of the expected imminent availability of Maestro. I am not going to try to review a product that has yet to be announced and which is several years late. Tableau does have a number of data preparation solutions and those can compete at some level with Alteryx, but if a user wants deep analytics, beyond visualization, currently, and perhaps for the foreseeable future, DATA will not offer a complete solution. I have linked here to the ways most users work with Data and Alteryx, so readers can look at how Tableau and Alteryx are linked. They are complementary products and likely to remain so.Alteryx has announced two new products in recent months. One of these is Alteryx Connect which the CEO called out as a noticeable demand driver, even though it has been in general availability for just 6 months. Connect is a platform that facilitates how analysts discover, prioritize and analyze the information that already exists in an organization. It is a way of improving the productivity of analysts substantially and as such it is apparently resonating within the Alteryx user base. Again, one of the reasons that Alteryx is seeing such a high dollar-based expansion rate relates to it selling Connect into its current installed base.In the next few weeks, Alteryx is going to make a product it calls Promote available. Promote is a tool that will allow analysts to deploy their models within a variety of applications. There are a variety of other tools offered by companies such Microsoft (Azure Machine Learning), and the combination of Datameer and Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) that have similar functionality. While Promote is said to be simple to use, it will probably take a few quarters for Alteryx to sell it into its mainstream base.Currently, using the projected weighted average shares for the year of 61 million, Alteryx has a market capitalization of about $2.1 billion. With cash on the balance sheet of $193 million (including long-term investments), the enterprise value is a bit over $1.9 billion. Given my view as to the most likely revenue forecast for this year, I think the EV/S is around 9X or a bit more. I really think the current forecast/consensus is not grounded on any substantive forecast or a particular scenario that would compress growth below 30% by the end of this year.Of course, 9X EV/S, is a high metric, although not quite an outlier using other valuations of hyper-growth companies. But again, the kind of growth that Alteryx is likely to have, has a way of really cutting into that metric in a meaningful fashion in a short time.Based on company guidance, the consensus outlook for Alteryx EPS this year is a loss. I think the actual EPS will trend toward a small profit based on an extra $20 million + of revenue with a gross margin of 85%. But no one is buying Alteryx shares because of their expectation that the company is going to report substantial earnings in the next couple of years. Investing in the infrastructure of a company that can generate so many new customers and such a high dollar-based retention rate makes sense. It is a virtuous cycle and one that I expect will be exploited by this company over the coming years.The company generated at least a noticeable level of positive cashflow in 2017, although again, not of a magnitude that would serve to justify the valuation. In Q4, cash flow from operations (CFFO) reached $12.5 million, far above levels of the prior year and of the prior quarter. Most of the increase in CFFO related to the growth in the deferred revenue increase which went from $5.5 million to $31.7 million sequentially. While there is some element of seasonality in that performance related to annual year-end billings, the result was nonetheless suggestive of the potentially strong cash flow generation potential of the company's model.The company forecast that it will remain cash flow positive next year. Given the strong trajectory of the company's deferred revenue growth, I think that cash flow will continue to substantially exceed reported earnings. As this company becomes more of a standard, for more and larger enterprises, it will most likely enter into long-term enterprise procurement agreements with multi-year commitments that generate up-front cash. As can be seen from some of the nameplates the company talks about, it is already on the way to becoming a standard at some very large enterprises that have chosen to deploy Alteryx across the enterprise, despite the relatively higher level of seat cost of Alteryx solutions.Stock based compensation is not a major component in CFFO at this point. Last quarter, stock-based comp was 19% of CFFO. Given the level of hiring the company is undertaking, I imagine that stock-based comp will increase noticeably in the next couple of quarters, but at this point, it is far from being an outlier.Overall, I think Alteryx might generate in excess of $50 million of CFFO and free cash flow this year. That said, a free cash flow yield of 2.6% is not likely going to be a factor in many investment decisions. So, overall, the recommendation comes down to expectations of growth far exceeding guidance and the published First Call consensus. The company's results the last couple of quarters certainly support that thesis and I have tried to make the case on qualitative grounds that the company will more likely than not continue to grow at rates of 50% or more for at least the next few quarters.I am often asked, not just about this name, but many other hyper-growth names, if there will be a better entry point. The shares, after all, have appreciated by 22% in the last quarter, and self-evidently they cannot continue to appreciate at that cadence indefinitely. Sure, Alteryx shares will pullback at some point, but I have no idea what level it will be when that happens. AYX shares certainly didn't escape the correction at the start of February. I have no particular expertise to say when and to what degree the next correction may arrive. But for longer term investors, I think owning these shares at this price is a reasonable strategy for generating positive alpha. I will close by commenting that the merger potential for this company is substantial. What they have is something that most of the stack vendors such as SAP and Oracle need badly. And while the valuation is high, the absolute dollars of a transaction are not huge. It is something to consider, but nothing on which to rely."
4149320,103480,2018-02-22T07:56:41-05:00,"Alteryx continued its succession of quarterly earnings beats, with a beat to the top and bottom line in Q4.The company has never missed a quarter since it went public last spring.Revenues accelerated to 55% y/y growth, up from 52% y/y in Q3.For a company of its small scale, its ability to generate expanding free cash flows is extremely significant.Shares aren't cheap at ~9x forward revenues, but the company's momentum shows no signs of slowing down.","Alteryx (NYSE:AYX), the big data preparation company, has continued its incredible track record of big earnings beats in Q4. Since its IPO last spring, the company has delivered quarter after quarter of big earnings beats. After a small correction to the mid/low $20s in February, Alteryx's stock has roared back in response to yet another strong quarter, and is up more than 2x over its IPO price of $14.A lot of software companies went public last year at around the same time as Alteryx - this group even includes investor favorites like MuleSoft (NYSE:MULE) and Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), yet Alteryx's performance has eclipsed them all. See the chart below:AYX data by YChartsDespite Alteryx racing ahead to a high valuation multiple (at $30/share, where the company landed in postmarket trading after announcing Q4 earnings, it carries a hefty EV/FY18 revenue multiple of 9.0x, based on its new FY18 guidance), it's difficult to be downbeat on the company. There are plenty of overvalued tech stocks that look to be at dangerous boiling points (among these, I think, are Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and BlackLine (NASDAQ:BL)), but Alteryx's strong performance absolves it of any valuation concerns.For one, the company is one of the most efficiently managed software companies in Silicon Valley. Despite its rather diminutive scale (next year's revenues are expected below $200 million), it has achieved a ~10% free cash flow margin - stack that up against the likes of Okta, which despite its high growth is still burning massive holes through investors' pockets. Alteryx's early-onset FCF profitability suggests that the company can be a massive cash cow in its maturity, like Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) or Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). For that reason, its high valuation multiple is more in line with those latter two peers rather than the average software stock around 6-7x revenues - investors are betting that Alteryx can succeed in their vein.And thematically, there are major tailwinds behind Alteryx's big data narrative as well. Big data, as the term itself may suggest, involves large and unruly data sets - without a tool like Alteryx to stitch it all together, big data may well be unusable. With all eyes turned toward data-driven decision making across all levels of the enterprise, Alteryx is poised to continue its robust growth trajectory.While the stock isn't likely to double again in 2018, it's more than likely to outperform by a generous margin again. Long with a price target of $36, representing 11x forward revenues.Here's a snapshot of Alteryx's Q4 results:Figure 1. Alteryx Q4 resultsSource: Alteryx investor relationsAlteryx generated revenues of $38.6 million in the quarter, up 55% y/y. This won out over analyst expectations of $35.9 million, or 44% y/y, by a substantial 11-point margin. Note also that this represents an acceleration over 52% y/y growth in Q2.Also important to note is that the company increased deferred revenue balances in the quarter by $31.6 million (sequentially), putting its billings count for the quarter at $70.2 million (billings is the sum of sequential deferred revenue growth plus revenue in the quarter). It's easy for any company to show high revenue growth if it's recognizing backlog revenue without replacing it - but in Alteryx's case, it's closing deals and adding to its pipeline faster than the rate at which it's recognizing deferred revenues.All the while, the company has also been making strides in improving efficiencies across all layers of its operational expenses, with R&D, sales and marketing, and general overhead costs all growing at a slower rate than revenue growth. As a result, GAAP operating losses have shrunk to -$1.9 million, a -6% margin, versus -$5.6 million (a -22% margin) in 4Q16.The company also broke even on a pro forma EPS basis, with PF EPS of $0.02 beating analyst expectations of -$0.03.That's also not to mention Alteryx's free cash flow results, which is one of the major drivers behind its valuation explosion:Figure 2. Alteryx cash flow resultsSource: Alteryx investor relationsOCF in Q4 was $12.5 million, up more than 4x from 4Q16, and netting out capex of -$1.4 million, the company also generated free cash flow of $11.1 million. This represents a huge 34% cash flow margin - and although this margin is slightly skewed by the fact that Q4 is generally the best-billing quarter for any IT software company, the main takeaway still stands: Alteryx, despite its small scale, is able to produce an FCF margin that towers over that of its peers. Even looking at the company's full-year FCF of $15.3 million and smoothing out the seasonality, Alteryx is still at an FCF margin of 12% for the full year - again, a margin that even seasoned and large-cap software companies strive for.For FY18, Alteryx is guiding to $176-179 million in revenues, indicating 35% y/y growth at the midpoint. There's more than enough reason to believe that this guidance is uber-conservative - without so much as a hint of revenue deceleration in Q4, as well as the billings strength to support continued quarterly revenue growth, it wouldn't be completely unfair to estimate that Alteryx can land at 45% y/y revenue growth in FY18, or $191 million in revenues.Using Alteryx's ""more realistic"" growth estimates for the following year has a fairly significant impact on its valuation multiple. Assuming the 35% growth Alteryx is currently guiding to, its $30 share price indicates a 9x forward multiple; assuming 45% growth instead (which is more in line to its current trends), this multiple compresses down to 8.2x.With a spotless track record of ""beat-and-raise"" quarters, as well as the secular tailwinds behind big data and software in general (Gartner, the leading industry analyst, is expecting investments in software by IT buyers to accelerate modestly in 2018), Alteryx is still one of the best long bets in the small-cap tech space. As much as investors may kick themselves for not buying more Alteryx in the low $20s during its correction (myself included), by this time next year, they'll be kicking themselves for not buying at $30. This is a company whose growth is backed by more than hype, but by tremendous growth and cash flows as well to support it."
4123404,103480,2017-11-10T13:35:07-05:00,"Alteryx, the small-cap data blending software company, reported a record $34.2 million in Q3 revenues, up 52% y/y and beating consensus of $32.1 million.Revenues showed no deceleration from Q2's 52% growth rate and was also accompanied with positive operating cash flow.The company generated $0.7 million of positive OCF, versus a $5.2 million loss last year. The company is also on track to hit its first-ever full year of positive FCF.Alteryx remains one of the highest-growing names in small cap software, and with its business model tilting toward breakeven profits, is ripe for a rally.It easily passes the ""Rule of 40"" litmus test, the quality measure that assesses a software company's growth versus its margin.","As the Q3 reporting season continues for the software sector, there's a theme playing out this time that's different from past quarters: investors are caring more about profits. Case in point: Twilio (NASDAQ: TWLO), which reported the day before Alteryx, smashed consensus revenue estimates (with a growth rate of 41% beating analyst estimates for 29%) but was only in-line on EPS, due to slight margin contraction. Investors basically ignored the huge revenue upside and sent Twilio plunging 7% post-earnings.With Alteryx's (NASDAQ: AYX) Q3 release, however, it's clear that this small-cap big data company has the best of both worlds: growth plus margin. Alteryx's 52% growth held perfectly stable from Q2's growth rate, showing no deceleration despite its rapid growth clip. Furthermore, the company is beginning to generate positive operating and free cash flow - despite relatively much larger losses in the prior year.3Q16 posted an OCF loss of $5.2 million on $22.5 million of revenues - or a -23% OCF margin. This quarter, however, Alteryx posted $0.7 million of OCF on revenue of $34.2 million, or a positive 2% margin. It's still a small margin (and has plenty of room to expand in the near future), but the 25-point reversal from loss to gain in the space of one year is truly impressive. It's the hallmark of a conservatively run, sustainable business model that can balance growth and profitability. This theme is jiving well with investors this quarter, for whom pure top-line growth is no longer enough. Traders bid up Alteryx 4% immediately after its earnings release.Year to date, Alteryx has already seen strong returns since its March 2017 IPO at $14. Recall that the lockup expiration happened in late September, so with that out of the way, Alteryx's shares are free to run higher.AYX data by YChartsAssuming Alteryx's growth decelerates to ~42% in the next twelve months (a ten-point deceleration from this quarter), the company trades at roughly ~6.8x EV/FTM revenues. This certainly isn't cheap - and I'm inclined toward cheaper stocks like Twilio (at 4.5x) and Cloudera (NASDAQ: CLDR) (at 3.8x) for their bargain-basement valuations, but sometimes buying on momentum is a profit-making trade. And at the moment, Alteryx has got the wind at its back. 6.8x certainly isn't too demanding, especially for a company growing north of 50%.With the company's profit margins expanding and its sales force maturing and hitting higher productivity metrics, Alteryx's growth trajectory - for both revenue as well as cash flow - is secure.Let's take a closer look at Alteryx's results for the quarter:Figure 1. Alteryx Q3 resultsSource: Alteryx earnings press releaseRevenue grew 52% y/y to $34.2 million, outpacing analyst consensus of $32.1 million (+43% y/y) by nine points. Remarkably, even at Alteryx's high growth, it showed no deceleration from Q2's 52% y/y growth.Alteryx's gross margin also showed substantial improvement from an already-high base. Margins ticked up to 84%, up from 82% in 3Q16. Usually in the software sector, when margins are already so high, the movement of margins across quarters is almost an afterthought for investors. But as the NASDAQ approaches another market top and profitability becomes a bigger concern, it seems that tech investors are paying attention to even slight gross margin trends - as previously mentioned, Twilio got pummeled post-earnings despite its huge top-line beat, largely in part due to a slight contraction in gross margins. Alteryx's margin, however - at 84% and nearly pure profit - is truly best-in-class.Alteryx also significantly improved its operating margin, as shown in the chart below:Source: author-created chart; data from public filingsBoth research and development and general corporate spend took an uptick as a percentage of revenues (probably a function of the company becoming public and building out headcount), but both were eclipsed by the increased efficiencies in sales and marketing. Sales spending as a percentage of revenue dropped 15 points, slicing Alteryx's operating loss margin in half. Breakeven operating profits are within sight.Accordingly, the company's pro forma net profit (adjusting for stock-based comp) of $0.02 smashed analyst consensus by $0.10 - Wall Street had been expecting a loss of -$0.08.Alteryx's cash flow results were equally impressive.Figure 2. Alteryx cash flow resultsThe company turned a -$5.2 million OCF loss in 3Q16 into a $0.7 million gain - and year to date through Q3, it's generated $6.4 million in positive OCF, up from -$9.1 million in the prior year to date period. Netting out $2.3 million in capex, Alteryx has generated $4.1 million in FCF year to date - a 4.4% FCF margin. And note that this result will likely improve with Q4 results, as Q4 is generally the biggest and most profitable quarter of the year for enterprise software companies due to IT purchasing patterns leaning heavily into the year-end.With the recent focus on profitability as well as growth, Wall Street commentators as well as investors have revived interest in the concept of the ""Rule of 40.""What is it, exactly? It's more or less a convention in the technology investing sphere, explained by Bloomberg in an article published in the middle of last year popularizing a concept most investors had already known: that a software company should strive to find a balance between growth and profitability, because investing in one necessarily impacts the other. The so-called ""Rule"" is a simple calculation that adds up a company's revenue growth rate to its free cash flow margin, and the resulting number should be greater than 40. The higher this result, the higher a company's valuation (on an EV/FTM revenues basis) should be.Well, take Alteryx's 52% growth rate and add its 4% free cash flow margin, and you get 56. That's already better than some of the best companies on Bloomberg's chart:Figure 3. Bloomberg ""Rule of 40"" chartAs seen from the chart above, the median company in the middle-third of all software companies have a number that's somewhere between 20 and 30 - that is, most companies fail the arbitrarily set benchmark of 40. Alteryx, however, passes with flying colors - meriting its high premium.At its current market cap and assuming ~42% revenue growth in the next twelve months, Alteryx trades at only a 6.8x EV/FTM revenue multiple. The ""Rule of 40"" suggests that Alteryx's high quality business - growth plus profits - merits a much larger premium. I'd keep an eye on Alteryx reaching 9x (implying a $31 price target), putting it roughly on par with Workday (NYSE: WDAY), whose ""Rule"" scoring is also in the low 60s.Stay bullish on this fantastic name. With its small market cap, and addressing the red-hot big data sector with few direct competitors (there are many data software companies, but few addressing Alteryx's exact data-blending use case), Alteryx is well poised to run much higher."
4110983,98236,2017-10-02T07:29:00-04:00,Alteryx is a relatively recent IPO with about 6 months of public company history.It is attempting to build an new category - a platform that combines both data integration and high end analytics and which is targeted at the emerging category of citizen data analysts.The company maintains that the TAM for this new space is in the range of $10 billion.The company is cash flow positive at this point  and its loss levels are far less than some other well-known vendors in the data analytics space.The company's valuation - at least in comparison to other hyper-growth vendors - is moderate at less than 6X EV/S.,"Alteryx (AYX) is a somewhat unique company that offers what is called a self-service, data analytics platform. It packs lots of functionality into a single set of tools and because of that it is hard to make close comparisons between this company and other companies in this space. I believe that the company has a very large potential opportunity and it has unique positioning that should allow it to enjoy several years of high growth. It has, I believe, better opportunities to achieve substantial profitability than other companies that are said to be peers. Alteryx is a long way from proving itself with shares that are certainly not cheap. The shares have most recently been under some pressure because of the expiration of the option lock-up. It is, I believe, worthwhile to at least establish a starter position in the name.The company went public just a bit more than 6 months ago and it is trading about 33% above where it initially opened. Both of the quarterly earnings that have been released were beats of some modest proportion and guidance is higher now than it was when the company started trading. As mentioned, the shares have been under some recent pressure this past month and this has afforded investors with a reasonable entry point into the name.Many investors in the IT space have wanted to find an investment opportunity that actually specializes in providing the tools to facilitate big data analytics solutions for potentially millions of what are called “citizen data scientists.” A few years ago, investors flocked first to Qlik and then to Tableau Software (DATA) in the view that these would be such companies. While there is element of validity in that belief, these companies, for a variety of reasons have not been able to develop profitable business models because their value add is simply not great enough to command high prices. In reality, these are companies that specialize in data visualization and not in data analytics, a significant distinction when it comes to the value of their offerings. While Tableau’s share price has recovered significantly from the depths it plumbed when it hit its initial speed bump 20 months ago, its actual growth rate has never really recovered and it has yet to achieve a visible path to sustainable, GAAP profitable growth. Qlik of course went private at a relatively pedestrian valuation, albeit better than its nadir share price.I think it is hard to suggest that there is not a large market for tools and algorithms that actually empower citizen data scientists to solve business problems using the newer technologies in this area that have become available. Most enterprises today either have, or are creating roles for Chief Data Officers and these individuals are charged with developing workflows using data and citizen data scientists to improve enterprise decision making. While all of that may seem self-evident, it hasn’t been easy to figure out a set of workflows that are basically self-service and which allow the citizen data scientists to perform their tasks in an efficient and timely fashion.While the companies with tools at the top of the stack including Qlik, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Power BI and Tableau (DATA) have developed solutions that are very easy to use-even this writer has been able to pretend some knowledge of both Tableau and Qlik products-getting the data to the point where it can be addressed by these applications is no mean feat. There are a variety of different companies that work to store data in a form that makes it possible to build complex queries. Then there are another set of companies that provide solutions to integrate and cleanse data which almost inevitably is coming from multiple sources and which can contain data entry errors as well as be stored in different formats. Finally, there are companies who specialize in developing what used to be called advanced analytic solutions-although that terminology is now considered obsolete.Alteryx was originally formed 20 years ago to provide the Census Bureau with geo-spatial analysis of the data that was collected. Its current solutions are about a decade old and it changed its name to reflect its mainline business in 2010. It is headquartered in Irvine, CA although its development headquarters is located outside of Denver. A couple of years ago it entered into a formal relationship with Microsoft to enable Power BI with a set of analytical capabilities beyond those offered in that tool.Its solutions are not intended to be data visualization tools of the kinds sold by Microsoft (MSFT), Qlik Data and many others. In point of fact, there is often co-option between Alteryx and the data visualization vendors. There are some questions as to just how large the market is for self-service tools that citizen data scientists will be able to use. Cutting to the first investment issue is the question of what the real TAM is for this space. In a discussion, I had recently with the IR Director of Alteryx I was told that their internal analysis counted a target of 21 million citizen data scientists who could use their tools and they believed that they could average $500/per seat in mass deployments. Obviously that is a TAM of $10 billion and would provide a hyper-growth runway for Alteryx for many years to come.Is that the right number? I think at this point it is simply too early for a 3rd party observer like this writer to make a credible case for a specific number. All I think that it is reasonable to say at this point, is that the number of potential users for the Alteryx solution is very large and is growing far faster than other data analytic markets. Further, the value add for a self-service platform that allows data scientists/data analysts access to multiple data streams and to the most advanced set of algorithms that allow users to create models that span both predictive and prescriptive analytics is likely to be far greater than data visualization platforms. The ability that users have to simulate alternatives, predict outcomes and discover strategic, tactical and operational efficiencies with optimization analysis is really what analytics is about and is a way of creating measurable value.The Alteryx solution is one that particularly lends itself to a land and expand sales strategy and that has already proven to be quite successful for this company. Most of its initial deployments are small and are sold by inside sales reps. This is not a company that has long sales cycles for initial deployments with interminable reviews by various layers within an organization. A single seat of the Alteryx solution has an annual cost of $3995 based on a 3 year commitment. There are few organizations that won’t try something like this for that kind of cost.Alteryx currently has several thousand customers (2,823 were reported on the last call) and it continues to add several hundred users each quarter-258 in the latest quarter. Some notable wins identified on the call included Mercedes-Benz USA, BNP Paribas and the State Department Federal Credit Union. The companies expand strategy has already exhibited some visible level of success. It has already reached some level of scale within several household names. I have linked to the company’s investor presentation for those who wish to look at the company’s reported customer base. Some notable current users include Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Coca-Cola (KO), BP (BP) and Ford (F). The company reported that its dollar based net revenue retention was 134%, a rather strong number compared to many other companies with comparable sales strategies.That said, at least in the data presented by Gartner, some users are concerned about the pricing of large deployments and many of Gartner’s survey respondents were using less than 50 seats of Alteryx. Obviously there is some level of disconnect between the $500 seat price that Alteryx expects at maturity and the concerns of users that the solution will be too expensive. The Alteryx Designer is expensive and I doubt if anyone anticipates that this company will have deployments with 1000’s of seats of the Designer tool. The company offers a $1500/seat shared analytics product. There are already users of Alteryx with thousands of seats within an enterprise and over time, I imagine the pricing concerns of many larger customers will be dealt with through flexible consumption solutions.Alteryx, given its scale, appears to be potentially far more profitable than other companies in this space because of its relatively low spend on sales and marketing and signs that there is significant leverage in the model. Last quarter, GAAP sales and marketing spend was 58% of revenues compared to 77% of revenues in the prior year. By comparison, Tableau’s Q2 actually still showed that sales and marketing expense was 58% of revenues on a GAAP-and Tableau is more than 7X the revenues of this company. Sequentially, the sales and marketing expense ratio was a bit higher in Q2 than in Q1-management said on the call that it intends to develop a more significant sales presence in EMEA because of early signs of substantial demand for its solution. In fact, the company has just now released localized German and French versions of its product so it is likely to experience strong growth in international sales in the next few quartersThe AVX set of solutions often co-exists with Tableau and Qlik within large enterprises. It is far more expensive on a per seat basis than Tableau or Qlik and has a far smaller seat count in a typical installation. One major question for investors and this writer is the extent to which this co-existence persists or if the mainstream data visualization vendors decide they want to build their own integrated set of capabilities. Last year, Tableau announced that it was working on a set of solutions it called Project Maestro. As the name implies, this effort is designed to for higher end users compared to those who most typically use the core Tableau products. Little has been heard of Maestro since that time-it seems possible that it was a project that has seen its funding reduced in Tableau’s effort to become profitable. The potential risk to Alteryx of a product set such as Maestro is something that bears watching-although thus far it has not been a visible focus at Tableau.At the moment, despite the self-service capabilities of Alteryx, it has arrangements with Talend in which the two company’s offer a combined solution. Alteryx management strongly asserts that it is not in the well-known ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) space. That said, many product analysts do compare Alteryx to Talend and that is probably a situation not lost on the people who run Talend-and all of the other ETL vendors. The potential exists for someone in the ETL space to attempt to develop the kind of high-end analytic tools and integrate those with an existing self-service ETL solution. Again, something to watch-not something that currently exists.Overall, the basic strategy of this company is land and expand. The company’s cohort analysis suggests that it is working effectively. The citizen data users like what they can get from this technology and apparently their organizations find automating many tasks amongst their data analyst staff to be worthwhile. The improvement in sales and marketing spend ratios is obviously a function of the success of the strategy. Going forward, there is going to be some balancing required between spending on the expand component of the strategy and the goal of reaching profitability. But at this point, the strategy is working very well.I often write about how a company stacks up in the Gartner MQ analysis-mainly because it is by far the most accessible tool to evaluate multiple technologies in many different spaces. Most often I tend to like to write about companies that have strong ratings on Gartner. That is not the case for this company. I have linked to the two Magic Quadrant reports in which Alteryx appears.For whatever reason, Alteryx has not been effective in communicating its capabilities and differentiation to Gartner. It really has no business being in a chart that includes Qlik, Tableau and Microsoft in the leader’s quadrant. It moved from a visionary to a top rated nice player in the past year because it lacks a smart data discovery capability, it has limited vertical offerings, and it is thought to be high priced. The company is really not about vertical solutions-not should it be. It offers users reasonable prices at scale.I think that Gartner misses the Alteryx mission which is really to provide the most advanced analytics that can be used by citizen data scientists. Most recently the company has added simulation and optimization capabilities. That is the focus of the company’s product roadmap. I have a hard time in reconciling Gartner’s commentary that “Reference customers placed Alteryx almost at the top for overall customer satisfaction and delivery of business value” within the body of its MQ rating. I would have thought that being at the top in those two categories would lead Gartner to recommend the tool most often and would surely eventually lead to the company achieving successful sales outcomes on a disproportionate amount of sales cycles.It is difficult to find a company that is an exact analog, or really even a close analog of Alteryx. That is, perhaps, by design. There are many companies in the analytics space and putting together another data analytics vendor is probably not a business strategy that is going to resonate with either customers or investors-and it is not likely to produce decent financial results. There are loads of companies that are specialist in the ETL category. I have written about both Talend and MuleSoft, two of the newest ETL vendors. But delivering a platform that includes both self-service ETL and advanced analytics that can be delivered via a code-free platform is perhaps a unique set of capabilities.It is really not feasible for this writer to evaluate the qualities of modelling and analytics that Alteryx offers and try to compare these to other competitive tools. In a conversation I had with the IR Director, her point was that while there are many point solutions that might match the capabilities of Alteryx in a few areas, it was the platform approach that was unique.Some readers might question whether or not this is an adequate moat-but given the 134% net retention rate cited earlier, it appears that getting to the Land stage has a strong potential to reach the Expand stage.How many of the citizen data scientists are there and will there be. I have linked to a couple of articles on the subject previously and one article that trashes the concept. There are many millions of these folk who typically use Excel spreadsheets which will not be a strategy for developing actionable conclusions based on models. There is no specific answer that I have found that validates the 21 million market size forecast of Alteryx. What is obvious however, is that the market is quite large and growing very fast and leaves more than enough runway for this company to maintain hyper-growth rates for some years into the future.Needless to say, the shares of Alteryx are not outstandingly cheap and it would be surprising if they were. The shares are actually currently valued below some of the metrics seen by other smaller hyper-growth companies, possibly because Alteryx is neither well known or well understood by many investors at this point-and also because of the pressure on the share price from the expiration lock-up. Most recently, the company sold a follow-on public offering on September 7th. The company sold 8 million shares in the underwriting with an additional option for 1.2 million shares. The shares were sold by a typical mix of selling shareholder at $21.25.Currently, Alteryx has about 58 million shares outstanding and at the current market price, the market cap is about $1.16 billion. Cash on the balance sheet at the end of last quarter was $185 million which yields an enterprise value of just around $1 billion. That yields an EV/S of 5.9X the consensus revenue forecast for 2018.The IPO and the secondary was led by Goldman Sachs (GS) and JP Morgan (JPM) and despite the small size of the business, it has 7 covering analysts, all from high-profile brokerages. Big surprise-they almost universally rate it as an outperform although there is one outlier who rates the shares as a hold.Again, not terribly surprisingly, estimates have future growth rates compressing from current rates around 50% and full year growth guidance of 46%-47% to about 36% next year. Further, the First Call consensus forecast calls for no improvement in non-GAAP margins. While the IR Director obviously gave me no specific guidance as to the company’s view on the validity of these numbers (the company has provided no guidance for 2018), my read of her body language is that she believes that the current consensus estimates will prove to be overly conservative for 2018 with both higher growth and better margins compared to the current forecastAs is the case for many newly public companies, investors can reasonably expect a consistent pattern of beat and raise quarters if the company delivers on its internal objectives. I believe that the company’s growth objectives for 2018 are almost certainly above 36%. In addition, it seems almost certain that the company is balancing its investments in order to deliver both rapid sales growth along with some margin improvement. That would imply a significantly smaller loss next year than the current First Call consensus forecast.The company was cash flow positive in both of the first two quarters of this year and it forecasts that it will be cash flow positive going forward. It has swung to a positive cash flow because of an increase in stock based comp-about 7% of revenues, declining GAAP losses, and growth in the deferred revenues. Most users subscribe to Alteryx products on terms of one year or three years and pay at least one year in advance. This will tend to lead to substantial increases in deferred revenue over time.Last quarter, the company also enjoyed some modest benefits from its balance sheet that helped it deliver positive CFFO for the quarter. These positive items are not easy to forecast and may well not be repeated. In that case, it seems quite possible that the next two quarters will not see positive cash flow-but the company will still be cash flow positive for the year as a whole.This company, while hardly a model of deep value, has a far less stretched valuation than one most often sees in new hyper-growth tech businesses. Whether the addressable market for the company’s offering is 21 million seats or 15 million seats or some other number is unknowable at this point-other than to say it the number is large and growing rapidly. This company is surely a leader in making analytics available for a wide spectrum of potential users. And its ability to help users acquire and cleanse data from multiple sources in order to facilitate the use of that data in analytics seems a unique capability on a single platform with all of the company's analytic tools. I think it is a potentially very profitable investment with a reasonable set of risk and rewards."
4167424,104028,2018-04-30T04:33:41-04:00,"Alteryx, Inc. is well-positioned in the fast-growing big data preparation and predictive analytics market with its easy to use, self-service, full-life-cycle, collaborative and governed platform architecture.We see the company having significant growth opportunities with existing, new customers both domestically and overseas if they maintain a differentiation edge over Tableau, Microsoft and SAS Institute solutions, for e.g.Stock performance has been terrific since its March 2017 IPO at $14 per share, driven by financials that show strong gross margin expansion and the potential to grow fast without losing big money like some other software-as-a-service plays.Part of its premium valuation is stemming from a scarcity of pure plays on big data prep and analytics. Current options include Talend or microcap name Datawatch.Nonetheless, the rich EV/2018 revenue valuation at 10.4x prevents us from chasing the shares. We would wait for a more attractive valuation level to initiate positions.","AYX data by YChartsBusiness value derived from big data and predictive analytics is large, transformative, and highly visible. Big data warehouses, data lakes keep growing exponentially and descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analytics allow data scientists, citizen data scientists and guided business analyst users to extract previously invisible patterns, trends and generate insights that can significantly improve decision-making, operating efficiency and open new market opportunities. Predictive analytics techniques include statistical, data mining, ML and deep learning models that analyze data to predict unknown future events. Once data is extracted, organized and prepared, today's models can quickly make forecasts based on thousands of predictive variables measured over millions of data records. ML techniques, for example, are experts at pattern recognition and AI cognitive models (that use deep learning or neural network techniques) act as decision-making agents that can track, process and react faster than humans can.Analytics power use cases include pricing/risk analysis, cross-selling decision-making, fraud detection and customer analytics. So, for example, by using predictive analytics to better understand risks, financial institutions can make sharper product pricing decisions. Analytic insights can be derived based on customer behaviors which enable up-selling and cross-selling opportunities to be captured. With more accurate time-to-failure predictions of critical components, manufacturers and oil pipeline companies can lower maintenance expenses and risks of bigger ancillary component cost failures.According to Markets and Markets, the global predictive analytics market is expected to grow from $3.85 billion in 2016 to $12.41 billion by 2022 or a CAGR of 22.1%. Zion Market Research forecasts a similar growth rate. From a slightly different perspective, Forbes writes in its August Roundup Of Analytics, Big Data & BI Forecasts And Market Estimates 2016, that by 2020, predictive analytics will attract 40% of enterprises’ net new investment in business intelligence and analytics.Data scientists (DS) are important for vendors like Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) (See figure 1). These users are part programmer, part statistician, part mathematician, part business analyst and part data analyst and there is a growing shortage of these highly skilled professionals. Vendors in this market are trying to increase the productivity of DS, data analysts and increasingly trying to empower less formally trained “citizen data scientists” and even line of business analysts with self-service platforms. These solutions include intuitive drag n drop GUIs, low-code/no-code options and automated data preparation and analytics capabilities.Figure 1Alteryx faces a range of public and private competitors. According to Rexer Analytics, 2016 Data Science Survey of 1220 analytics professionals from 72 countries, the average analytics professional reports primary use of five tools – the leaders being, open source statistical programming language R (which is supported by Alteryx), IBM SPSS Statistics, the SAS programming language, Microsoft Excel Data Mining/SQL Server and Tableau (NYSE:DATA) which is frequently used with Alteryx. Freely available open source platform vendors (KNIME and Rapid Miner, e.g.) plus R (a statistical language), Python (a big data /data science language) and Scala (a hybrid language for big data) are also a force in the analytics space. Many data scientists emerge from higher education programs with skills in R, Python, SQL, IBM SPSS Statistics, for example. Collectively, open source tools represent a low-cost option for companies to refine their data science chops, experiment with leading-edge analytics techniques and represent a viable alternative to commercial packages.Big data analytics commercial software providers are pursuing disparate solution strategies. Some are building big data science workbenchs like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR); or offering customized analytics solutions like Teradata (NYSE:TDC), Fractal Analytics; or analytics API focused platforms such as AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN) and BigML; or offering narrower, easy-to-use, highly automated analytics tools like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and DataRobot (used with Alteryx) or offering analytics full lifecycle solutions. Alteryx is focused on latter strategy and has full-life-cycle competition from Datawatch’s (NASDAQ:DWCH) Angoss knowledge enterprise; Dataiku’s end-to-end data science platform; IBM’s (NYSE:IBM) SPSS modeler and data science experience (DSX); Microsoft SQL Server and Excel with data mining and other plug-ins as well as the Cortana Intelligence Suite and ML Studio; Oracle’s (NYSE:ORCL) Advanced Analytics and Analytics Cloud; Salesforce’s Einstein and Beyond Core; SAP (NYSE:SAP) Predictive Analytics Suite; SAS Institute’s Enterprise Miner, Visual Analytics Studio, Viya and Py and Tibco’s Statistica, Spotfire Analyst, Enterprise Runtime for R and Streambase.Aside from the full-life-cycle paradigm, commercial vendors are further differentiating offerings based on personas. Alteryx supports data scientists, citizen data scientists, and potentially, business analysts. Oracle and SAP support data scientists and business analysts while Datawatch supports the data scientist, business analyst and the business user. IBM, SAS and Tibco target the data scientist, business analyst and application developers.Looking more closely at the big players in the space. SAS, IBM have long histories in this market. SAS has a reputation as a thought leader, has significant breadth and depth in its offerings, with particular strength on the automation, deployment, neural networks and streaming analytics fronts. It has the full lifecycle approach within one application, Visual Analytics Suite (VAS) and also offers Enterprise Miner (EM) for data scientists. Knocks against SAS are premium prices (this is also a criticism of Alteryx’s solutions), a steeper learning curve on VAS, the amount of SQL knowledge required to become productive, deployment and instability issues.IBM has strength in its SPSS Modeler, SPSS Statistics, DSX (for data scientists who code) and Watson Analytics offerings, its commitment to open source solutions, support for very large data sets and unstructured data, its breadth of models and automatic model re-tuning. Some weaknesses are the less than modern Modeler and Statistics solutions, the number of offerings and customers having difficulty discerning investment priorities among its products, its bureaucracy and a bias toward bringing in the Global Business Services team for engagements.SAP is important from the perspective of pushing the envelope on simplifying and automating the creation, use and deployment of highly scalable data science models for business analysts. It is out front in areas such as automated data preparation/management discovery, model building, model application and scheduling. It’s also worth noting that there are a number of smaller private vendors building innovative solutions (Paxata, Trifacta) and that mega tech vendors like Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) can reshape competitive dynamics given their huge bets on big data, ML and AI.Figure 2We believe companies are choosing the Alteryx solution because it provides flexibility to DSs, citizen data scientists and potentially business analysts who need to discover, prep, blend disparate data sources, perform descriptive/ diagnostic/predictive/prescriptive analytics, perform optimizations and “productionize” models in a single workflow that is collaborative and governed. The solution receives especially positive reviews for its ease of use, compact learning curve, fast deployment, no-code and low-code options. Customers are realizing significant improvements in efficiency, automating processes to free up employees to focus on more complex tasks. For example, customers are realizing 80% increases in productivity as they prepare and analyze data in hours, instead of weeks. It can quickly transpose data sets that contain 200 million records in some cases. Cloud-connected analytics is becoming more important and Alteryx has both on-premise and cloud-supported offerings. Because its platform is open, full-life-cycle, extensible it can reduce the number of packages an organization could use for big data prep and analytics. The Alteryx solution is further differentiated as it allows users to enrich their data with 3rd party packaged data offerings from Experian, TomTom, D&B, U.S. and Canadian census data; it has strong text parsing tools and importantly, geospatial tools. Increasingly, companies are looking to extract value from geospatial data and Alteryx has been a leader in this area for a number of years.Figure 3It is true that Alteryx has a reputation as being a strong big data blending, transformation company; however, we believe that is starting to change. Because of its combination of data munging, analytics, AI/ML and now its new model deployment functionality in Promote (being rolled out in Q1), the platform potentially offers more value to customers. It can help organizations increase analytics adoption by allowing users to more easily perform and consume more sophisticated predictive, prescriptive analytics, ML and deep neural network modeling and extract greater business value by putting analytics models into production and monitoring them for effectiveness. Evidence for this viewpoint is surfacing in expanding use cases for the solution, existing customers adopting designer and server tools and landing projects getting larger in size. Having said this though, management is not baking in larger average deal sizes in its forward guidance.To be balanced, we note that Alteryx does not yet support real-time streaming analytics, an important area of growing demand, especially from an IOT perspective. It doesn’t have native ML functionality, rather it allows users to plug into automated ML functionality through DataRobot. It also doesn’t have support for hybrid cloud environments yet. It is weaker in the visualization area but it plugs n plays with Tableau, Microsoft Power BI and Qlickview and it could be improving in-line visualytics by integrating more open source functionality via its partnership with Plotly.Tableau, while it is a partner currently, is deepening its capabilities in the data prep and blending area with Tableau Prep which can potentially reduce the need for Alteryx data blending for current or prospective Tableau+Alteryx users. Tableau Prep is being offered free for two years for existing desktop users and is bundled with Tableau Creator for power users. Our initial take on Prep is that it offers a similar intuitive visual interface, drag n drop, data connect, blending features but we did not see collaborative features, data certification/governance, geo-spatial features that Alteryx has. Scalability or secure it is yet. Along the same lines, Microsoft could extend data prep functionality on existing products and lower pricing the way it has done in the business intelligence platform segment and investors need to be mindful of open-source tool vendors that have proven to be good innovators as well.The company’s success is being reflected in its operating performance. It has a diverse portfolio of blue-chip customers such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), PWC, BCG and Accenture (NYSE:ACN). The new customer count expanded by 338 with total customers now at 3,392. Its net revenue retention rate is high, running at 131% in the fourth quarter, which represented the fifth consecutive quarter above 130%. Ninety-five percent of revenues are being derived from recurring (1-3 year) subscription licenses.Revenue growth topped 52% each quarter in 2017 on a year-over-year basis. Gross margins are the second-highest in the peer group at 83.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus Tableau’s 87% and expanded 210 basis points in 2017 versus 2016. Operating losses declined from $23.022 mil in 2016 to $18.199 mil in 2017. And, cash flow from operations turned up sharply from a loss of $6.031 mil in 2016 to $18.943 mil in 2017. Also, the balance sheet is strong with $174 mil in cash and short-term investments and zero debt.What separates Alteryx from some other Saas vendors is that the economic model is potentially pointing to positive cash flows in the next few years. Its customer acquisition strategy is proving to be particularly efficient as sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenues are declining from 80.3% in 2015 to 67.1% in 2016 to 50.5% in 2017.Figure 4It is easy to see how investors can get excited about Alteryx as a pure play on self-service big data prep, blending and advanced analytics that include ML and deep learning. It has the highest gross margins in its peer group and is growing at a 50%-plus clip. At the same time, at $30, the shares are trading at a blistering EV/2018 revenue multiple of 9.7x, while its closest comparables, Talend (NASDAQ:TLND) trades at 7.2x and Tableau trades at 6.1x.We ran sensitivities using our 2-stage discounted cash flow model. All our assumptions are laid out in Figures 5 and 6 below where we use a 5-year extraordinary growth window, add debt for operating leases (which are financial expenses), estimate beta to be 1.21, use a 21% marginal tax rate, a long-term economic growth rate of 3%, a long-term cash operating expense load of 65% (1-EBITDA/Revenues), a 7-year risk-free treasury rate of 2.81%, a market risk premium per Damodaran of 5%, cost of debt estimate of 6.5% among other parameter estimates.When we used the current IBES consensus revenue and operating expense projections from 2018-2021, where the company reaches profitability on an EBIT basis in 2021, the fair value equates to $25 per share.Figure 5Going a step further, we tried to gauge market expectations for revenue growth and operating expenses keeping all other assumptions constant with the above scenario, just tweaking the revenue and operating costs assumptions. To equate to a fair value of $31 per share one would have to assume an aggressive revenue profile of something close to 50% Y/Y growth in 2018, 45% in 2019, 40% in 2020, 35% in 2021 and 30% in 2022. Over the same period, cash operating expenses (1-EBITDA/Revenues) would have to decline from 106% in 2018 down to 85% in 2022.Figure 6As we noted above, the company has a compelling value proposition, plenty of room to grow geographically and further penetrate its existing customer base but there are many competitors around Alteryx, some with very deep pockets and much higher R&D budgets. Our discounted cash flow scenario analysis shows that investors are banking on well above consensus revenue growth for the next several years, consistently high gross margins and a cash flow profitability crossover in two years and we are late in the stages of the economic cycle. We are mindful that these are not the only scenarios that will produce the results we found. However, they give us a feel for the difference between what the market outlook might be compared to the known consensus outlook. We would be buyers at better risk-reward levels assuming no degradation in fundamentals."

Shares tumbled 9% after the offering announcement, leaving them 8% under the offering price.The offering is non-dilutive as no new shares are being issued (barring exercise of the green shoe option), and represents only 14% of the company's market cap.The CEO is selling only 600k of his 9.7 million shares, roughly 6% of his holdings - reflecting his continued faith in the business.Alteryx's fundamentals remain excellent, and shares should rebound quickly to where it traded post-announce ($23) once the market realizes its overreaction.","Alteryx (NASDAQ: AYX), once the software sector's infallible darling, has seen a precipitous 9% decline from recent highs due to the announcement of its follow-on offering of 8 million shares (a small fraction of 58 million shares outstanding) at $21.25, 8% above where the stock closed after the announcement.This steep fall capstones a month of losses for Alteryx, which has shed 14% of its value this month:AYX data by YChartsPrior to this decline, I would have been wary about investing in Alteryx, which previously traded as high as 8.5x forward revenues. However, following the recent (and misguided) sell-off, Alteryx stands poised to recover, offering fairly safe short-term gains to the brave trader. Fundamentals, after all, have never been stronger - the company reported a strong beat-and-raise quarter in early August and shares rocketed to $23. A non-dilutive, small secondary offering shouldn't cause any fundamental reason for taking away those gains.This article will first update the reader on the state of Alteryx's business (growing steadily on the top line and marching toward profitability) to add comfort about investing in Alteryx should the holding period be longer than expected, then examine the structure of the deal and the selling shareholders involved.The key takeaway for investors: as either a long-term hold position supported by a leading big data software vendor or a short-term flip supported by irrational stock declines, Alteryx's recent price actions open up a rare window for investors to nab some gains while the moment is ripe.For the unfamiliar, Alteryx is a leading vendor of big data integration software. It's a self-service tool for combining different datasets (which may have varying data structures) and preparing them for clean analysis.The Alteryx tool is intended for business users - that is, line-of-business executives who need quick access to data for decision making, without taking the extra step of consulting with IT. Traditional methods of data blending involved a lot of manual processes and porting in data streams that didn't always work well together, a time-consuming task handled primarily by IT. According to a Harvard Business Review study cited by Alteryx, 64% of organizations use five or more sources of data, creating integration challenges when business analysis requires them all.Figure 1. Alteryx workflow chartIDC estimates that the market for business intelligence and data analysis tools (a subset of the larger big data space) was $19 billion in 2016 and will grow to $29 billion by 2021. Alteryx also believes it can capture an additional $10 billion opportunity by converting the most manual of data processes - Excel-only workflows, which means using only copy-and-paste methods within spreadsheet rows to combine data. IDC estimates that there are 21 million spreadsheet-intensive users and that the time wasted on manually updating data tallies $60 billion per year.This illustrates an important point - while Alteryx does have a few competitors in the space (the French software company Talend (NASDAQ: TLND) being one), its primary competition is coming from spreadsheet super-users who are pushing Excel's limits in data analytics and wasting time by not migrating to Alteryx's modern processes.Alteryx's market is largely greenfield - it's not going head-to-head against comparable software tools; it largely exists in the market to displace legacy processes that have been proven inferior for high-volume, high-complexity workloads integrating a plethora of disparate datasets.Alteryx sells its solutions via SaaS subscriptions, priced per user per year. A standard subscription to Alteryx Designer, the core data blending tool, costs $5,195 per user per year, marking it as a fairly premium product in enterprise software (a ""typical"" price for a cloud application is $100/user/month).Alteryx's revenues have grown at a fast clip since going public.Figure 2: Alteryx income statementRevenues for the full year 2016 grew 61% to $69.8 million, and showed barely any deceleration in the first half of 2017, with 1H17 revenues growing 59% to $48.7 million. Alteryx is on track to deliver more than $100 million of revenue this year, indicating its increased path toward becoming a software vendor at scale. Yet it's relatively smaller revenue base indicates a company that still has plenty of room for growth ahead of it, and one whose prospect base (read: Excel users) is largely untapped.Alteryx, like many other cloud software companies employs a ""land-and-expand"" sales model - meaning it attempts to get in the door with a new customer with only a few deployments, and then encourage the customer to purchase more subscriptions over time. Thus far, the land-and-expand model has succeeded at Alteryx:Figure 3. Customer upsells chartThe chart above, from Altery'x S-1, shows that customers tend to increase their initial subscriptions by 1.7x-1.9x in Year 2, and 2.7x in Year 3. Once Alteryx proves its utility to a new client, it is highly successful in adding more users to its paid subscription base.Accordingly, a large portion of Alteryx's revenues derives from existing customers, but Alteryx isn't shy in adding new customers as well - as of June 2017, the company counted 2,800+ clients, a stunning 54% growth from the prior year period. And with customers continually purchasing more subscriptions (dollar-based retention rate, which is upsells minus churn, has held above 120% in each of the past ten quarters), each new customer adds a fountain of future revenue streams.Figure 4. Alteryx customer countNor is Alteryx catering the majority of its efforts to small and mid-market clients, either - who are much more volatile in their spending habits and exponentially more likely to churn. Marquee clients of Alteryx include such giants as Ford (NYSE: F), Unilever (NYSE: UN), Home Depot (NYSE: HD), and even big data peer Tableau (NYSE: DATA), which provides data visualization tools but is lacking in data preparation - which is why it deploys Alteryx.Revenue and customer growth aside, Alteryx's margins have also shown vast improvement. The common-sized income statement below offers an easier view into Alteryx's path to profitability:Figure 5. Alteryx marginsIn 1H17, Alteryx delivered 12% of operating margin improvement, with losses slimming to a mere 23.4% of revenues (highly unusual for a company still growing at ~60%). In particular, Alteryx is beginning to capture on sales efficiency, with its sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of dropping 20 points - indicating that Alteryx's headcount investments in account execs and business development reps are beginning to ramp to full productivity and make dents in the market.Alteryx has also swung to profitability on an OCF basis in 1H17:Figure 6. Alteryx OCFFor the first time, Alteryx generated positive $5.7 million in cash flow in 1H17, up from -$4 million in the prior first half. It's still a small number to be sure, but compared to the vast majority of its software peers that are still burning cash at alarming rates, Alteryx's quick path to positive cash flow - despite its relatively smaller revenue scale - is a reassuring sign of a maturing company.Alteryx is tendering an 8 million block of existing shares at $21.25 - meaning no new shares will be created unless the underwriters' greenshoe is executed (the greenshoe or ""over-allotment"" option, common to equity offerings, allows the underwriting investment banks to stabilize the offering with more shares should demand exceeds expectations). In the case that the greenshoe is executed, 1.2 million shares would be created (15% of the offering size, the standard amount for greenshoe options). This offering coincides with the expiration of Alteryx's lockup period on September 20th.The 8 million shares tendered represent a minor 14% of Alteryx's total market cap of 58.3 million shares (the 1.2 million green shoe represents 2% of Alteryx's cap). Investors reacted to the offering news as if it were a dilutive offering, sending shares down 9% - when in reality, the only possible dilution would be the unconfirmed execution of the greenshoe, comprising only 2% of the available market cap.Investors shouldn't be concerned about the sellers, either. The table below shows the identity of the major selling shareholders:Figure 7. Secondary offering sellersThe major selling shareholder is Sapphire Ventures (listed twice in the table, as its lead partner on the Alteryx investment is Jayendra Das, also a director), who is selling 5.1 million of its total 6.2 million shares after a successful run. Sapphire Ventures led Alteryx's Series A in 2013 and has likely made ~10x on its initial investment. Sapphire's sale is a natural exit for a VC who has already made a healthy return for its limited partners, not a sign of pending trouble - and Das is also remaining on Alteryx's board.Thomson Reuters, which owns 13% of the company, is selling 2 million shares - only a third of its holdings, indicating its continued faith in the company's execution.The remaining 900k shares are coming from inside execs, each of whom is selling a very small portion of their total holdings. Dean Stoecker, Alteryx's CEO, is selling only 600k (6%) of his 9.7 million shares, netting him $12.7 million. This small insider transaction is not a red flag - it's more likely to indicate that the CEO is buying a new house than it is to indicate business trouble.Olivia Adams and Edward Harding, the Chief Customer Officer and Chief Technology Officer, respectively, are tendering 150k shares each - also a small proportion (~8%) of their ~2 million shares each.Investors have treated the secondary offering as if the execs are jumping ship, while in reality, they are selling only a small slice of their holdings. The fact that they are retaining the bulk of their ownership in Alteryx even as the lockup period expires is a signal of strength in the business, not weakness.For the first time, Alteryx's offering-induced sell-off has rendered the stock at a cheaper revenue multiple than the peer average for the software IPO class of 2017:Figure 8. Alteryx trading compsWhile several peers have shot up this month - Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA) and Appian (NASDAQ: APPN) are each trading at a precipitous 10x forward revenues - Alteryx is finally trading at a digestible multiple of 7x, two turns below its own historical averages.As discussed in this article, Alteryx's fundamentals remain in check: it's competing in a greenfield space and quickly adding high-loyalty customers to its client list, it's growing revenues at a fast clip and incurring slimmer losses relative to its peers. These strong fundamentals merit a premium for Alteryx, not a discount to peers.The misguided sell-off creates a unique opportunity to buy Alteryx at a discount. The offering only has the potential to become 2% dilutive, and key executives are only selling a minor portion of their holdings. The market should quickly correct Alteryx's recent price movements and return the stock to the $22-$23 level (~8.5x forward revenues), implying a 10-15% return in the short term. In the long term, Alteryx's continued growth and a firm foothold in the rapidly accelerating big data sector could imply much higher returns."

Shares priced at $14, the high end of its initial price range of $12 to $14, then jumped 10% on its first day of trading. Since then, the stock price has continued to move up. Currently, shares are up approximately 57% from the IPO price and are currently trading at approximately $22. (9.7.17)The 180-day lock-up period which restricted insiders ability to trade shares will expire on September 20, 2017. At this point, the company's pre-IPO insiders will be able to sell their 40M shares for the first time since Alteryx went public. This represents 68% of the total shares outstanding (see below). If even some of these shareholders decide to sell, it could have a significant downward impact on the stock. Our firms research on price movement around lockup expiration can be found here.(S-1/A)These firms and individual investors will likely be motivated to sell their positions in order to free up capital for other investments as well as cash in on gains. Company insiders include thirteen executive officers and seven outside investors including several notable VC investors (see below). We predict these VC investors will be particularly eager to recognize their large win from the investment and move capital into other projects.(S-1/A)Alteryx provides a self-service data analytics software platform that enables companies to improve the productivity of their business analysts thus enhancing business outcomes. It offers:The company serves clients in hospitality, travel, technology, retail, healthcare, consumer goods, and business and financial services across approximately 50 countries. The company has close to 500 employees and was founded in 1997.

Highlights from earnings include:Shares jumped 10% on the positive earnings news.Dean A. Stoecker co-founded the company in 1997 and now serves as CEO and Chairman. His previous experience comes from senior positions at Enterprise Solutions for Integration Technologies, Strategic Mapping, and Dun & Bradstreet. Mr. Stoecker holds BS degree in International Business from the University of Colorado in 1979 and Master of Business Administration from Pepperdine University in 1984.CFO Kevin Rubin has been in his position since April 2016.

Mr. Rubin holds a BA in Business Economics with an emphasis in accounting from the University of California, Santa Barbara and is a Certified Public Accountant in California.After Alteryx’s tremendous market performance, we expect the stock could be poised for a dip. With 68% of shares currently restricted if any of its company insiders choose to sell around the lock-up expiration date, it could overwhelm the market and send Alteryx’s share price spiraling downward. Our firm has studied price movement around lock-up expiration and expect Alteryx shares to fall between 2% to 3% around the lockup expiration date, in line with past movement. We recommend investors who are long the stock, consider selling their position and event driven investors consider shorting the stock before the September 20 date."
4057967,25120,2017-03-26T18:55:43-04:00,"Alteryx offers a data analytics platform which allows better, quicker and cheaper data analytical services.The company is growing very rapidly, with accelerating topline sales growth accompanied by narrowing losses.While traditional investors shun the company for the losses and stiff competition, opportunistic investors might like the growth in relation to its sales multiple.","Alteryx (AYX) has seen healthy demand for its shares in its IPO. Shares priced at the higher end of the preliminary offering range and saw a modest pop higher on their opening day. Investors appear to like the rapid topline sales growth, narrowing operating losses (on a relative basis), and reasonable sales multiples.I think that the current valuation looks relatively appealing if we look at the topline sales growth in relation to the actual sales multiples. Given the losses and stiff competition, shares might only provide an opportunity for those opportunistic investors with a high tolerance for risk.What Is Alteryx?Alteryx provides so called self-service data analytics software, allowing business analysts to be more productive. The platform developed by Alteryx allows for the easy and quick blending of data from different sources in an intuitive setting. This data is consequently analyzed and presented in a friendly user-interface.The company aims to differentiate itself by the fact that it can integrate data from multiple sources, thereby creating greater insight driven by the effective communication of that data. Traditional data solutions require data preparation, blending, analytics and output creation, and often involve multiple people. These solutions are therefore quite time-intensive while it relatively easy for errors to slip in as well.The YouTube demos of the Alteryx platform look quite intuitive and appealing, I must say. That is the reason why over 2,300 customers have adopted the software, including high-fliers such as Ford (NYSE:F), Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) among others. Consulting businesses like Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Bain and BCG leverage the platform as well.The company has been around for a relatively long time, having originally been founded back in 1997. The predecessor was converted into Alteryx in 2011 which started to commercialize the current platform under a subscription-based business model.The Offering & ValuationAlteryx sold 9 million shares at $14 apiece, the high end of the preliminary offering range of $12-$14 per share. That means that the company raised $126 million in gross proceeds to fund current losses and further growth.With 56 million shares outstanding, which have risen to $15.50 per share on their opening day, the market value has risen to $868 million. As the company operated with $53 million in cash ahead of the offering, and convertible stock is preferred into common stock, Alteryx operates with a net cash position of roughly $165 million. That suggests that the business is valued at $700 million, ex-cash.So what kind of actual business can support this valuation? Alteryx shows meaningful growth, but unfortunately this is accompanied by losses. The company reported a 41% increase in sales for the year of 2015, with sales reaching $53.8 million. Operating losses increased by a million to $21.1 million, as relative losses are coming down rapidly.Growth continued in 2016, and actually accelerated rather meaningfully. Sales were up by 59% to $85.8 million, accompanied by gross margins of 81%. Operating losses increased slightly in absolute terms to $23 million last year, and relative losses were coming down rather quickly again. Based on the $700 million operating valuation, the company trades at little over 8 times annual sales.It should be said that forward sales multiples are much lower as operating momentum continues to accelerate. Fourth quarter sales were up by more than 61% to $25.0 million, running at an annualized rate of a hundred million. Ending the year with 2,328 customers, average revenues per customer run at roughly $43k per customer. It should be said that the revenue variation between these customers is rather large.Risky Proposition, But Potential Rewards As WellThe good news is that the IPO has provided the company with sufficient funds to finance current losses. While the product looks good, growth is very strong and is actually accelerating, the company faces stiff competition from numerous players. In particular, Alteryx cites MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and TIBCO as competitors. MicroStrategy trades around 3 times sales ex-cash and is very profitable, but sales are flat. TIBCO was of course acquired back in 2014 in a $4 billion-plus deal.Bigger risks include the potential entrance of larger competitors such as Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tableau (NYSE:DATA) among others. That being said, the sales multiples for a subscription-based player remains reasonable. Based on the current run rate in terms of revenues, operating assets trade at just 7 times sales, as forward sales multiples are much lower with topline sales growing by 60%.This, therefore, is really a play for those investors with a higher risk tolerance. The sales multiple look reasonable given the topline growth compared to some other players."

Alteryx reports that, as of Dec. 31, 2016, it had more than 2,300 customers in 50 countries, including Ford Motor Co., Tableau Software, Nike, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. and Southwest Airlines, Inc., among others.We have previously written on AYX here, as well as a preview of the IPO quiet period expiration on our IPO Insights platform.Executive Management HighlightsAlteryx co-founder Dean A. Stoecker has also served as the company's chairman of the board and chief executive officer since the company was founded in 1997. Previously, Stoecker held multiple positions at Donnelly Marketing Information Services, served as the vice president of sales at Strategic Mapping, Inc. and was the director of enterprise solutions at Integration Technologies, Inc.

AYX is now priced >19% above its opening price at $16.63. (market close 4.6.2017).(Edgar Pro)Financial HighlightsFor the year that ended on Dec. 31, 2016, Alteryx reported net losses of $24,258,000, gross profits of $69,764,000 and total revenues of $85,790,000. By comparison, for the year that ended on Dec. 31, 2015, Alteryx reported net losses of $21,272,000, gross profits of $43,300,000 and total revenues of $53,821,000.Alteryx acknowledges that the company changed its business model in 2010, resulting in a limited operating history that could be considered a risk factor. In addition, the company has an accumulated deficit of $86 million, which it attributes to its initiatives to expand, as well as a history of losses.The company faces stiff competition from a number of companies, including Microsoft, International Business Machines Corporation and Oracle Corporation, among many others. According to Alteryx, the competitive environment is intense and increasing.Conclusion: Buying OpportunityDue to the somewhat surprising pop in its IPO, we recommend that investors take another look at AYX at this point. Alteryx operates in an exciting industry, and has shown solid revenue growth. Its IPO was led by heavy-hitter Goldman Sachs. Six other underwriters, including J.P. Morgan, could be ready to release detailed positive initial Buy recommendations on this successful public company.Our firm has studied the event in detail and found positive returns surrounding the quiet period expiration.Don Dion's IPO Insights provides up-to-date information and analysis on the major IPOs each week, along with additional opportunities to invest and short these stocks at their quiet period and lockup period expirations, respectively.

4056993,66213,2017-03-22T00:19:33-04:00,"Alteryx is set to go public Friday, which could raise up to $144.9 million in proceeds.Alteryx is a pretty stereotypical software IPO - high growth, net losses, competitive market, risky, etc.At the $12-14 per share offering, this is a fair-priced IPO that will likely face strong short-term volatility.","Self-service data analytics software company Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) is set to go public this Friday, the 24th. The purpose of their platform is to help organizations enhance their business analysis and, therefore, improve business decisions and outcomes. Their competitors include heavy hitters, such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), etc., as well as smaller companies that offer more niche data preparation option, such as MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) and TIBCO Software.They Have Strong GrowthIt's not surprising that Alteryx is experiencing strong growth. If they weren't, then this IPO would be dead on arrival. For 2016, revenue was approximately $86 million, up from $38 million for 2014. This represents a CAGR of 50%. There is no question that their focus is going to be on growing their top line in the upcoming years, but this will likely not be cheap. Customer acquisition is not cheap and probably the primary strategy of growth for Alteryx. For 2016, sales and marketing accounted for more than 67% of total revenue. The company also plans to expand within their existing customer base and increase their value proposition. This can also become pricey as it would likely indicate more investing in research and development as well as strategic acquisitions. One of these acquisitions took place in January of this year to enhance their governance capabilities.Source: Alteryx's S-1There Is a Lot of RiskThis is an emerging growth company with limited operating history in a competitive industry. Alteryx has been licensing their platform only since 2013, which makes it very difficult to evaluate their business model. Since the company is still young and top-line focused, they are expected to invest heavily in their future growth, and their ability to grow and manage that growth is not easily predictable. The industry is also very competitive and new standards from innovation from competitors can be unpredictable and have a significant impact on Alteryx's business. Alteryx has also never shown profitability and these losses over the long term can cause the company to become heavily leveraged and hinder their operations.Below is their balance sheet, which is pretty much what one would expect from this type of company coming to market. They have some decent cash on hand in comparison to their current liabilities. Considering their current liquidity situation, the IPO proceeds, and future ability to add leverage if needed, I think that they would be well positioned to fund R&D, acquisitions, sales and marketing, etc.Source: Alteryx's S-1It's A Little Pricey, But It Will Be SuccessfulThe $12-14 price range would place Alteryx's valuation between $676 and $788 million, with $732 million being the midpoint. That midpoint places them at a P/S ratio of 8.5. That's not a cheap price and about 60% higher than the software industry average, but it's also not an expensive price. So, considering the risk and valuation, why do I believe this will be successful? I think it's partially due to the AppDynamics (APPD) acquisition by Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Right before AppDynamics made it to the market, Cisco bought them for a 95% premium compared to their IPO pricing. The acquisition price was for $3.7 billion, which represents a P/S ratio of approximately 16; nearly double Alteryx's projected P/S ratio at the midpoint. This should still be very fresh in the minds of investors and may impact the way some view the Alteryx IPO.ConclusionI don't find this IPO to be particularly good or bad, but rather I just see it as being typical. It's almost exactly what you would expect from an emerging growth software company. I think the valuation at $12-14 per share is fair, but I have a feeling the stock will close around $19-21 on the opening day of trading, which is high. This IPO is not for everyone, but if you are not risk-averse and looking for a high growth enterprise software company, then Alteryx would fit your bill. However, use caution when pulling the trigger. I would expect some serious short-term volatility and withdraw interest at more than $18 per share."

CEO and co-founder Stoecker retains 20.4% of Class B shares, pre-IPO.Its most recent funding round was an $85 million Series C financing in October 2015 with a reported valuation 'approaching $1 billion'.TechnologyAlteryx has created a cloud-based software system that enables data analysts to obtain, manipulate, analyze and export data to improve their business operations.The software doesn't require any knowledge of programming, so it effectively allows enterprises to push data analysis further out to various departments where it can more quickly impact decision making.Below is a brief explainer overview video:(Source: Alteryx)For its single user version, Alteryx Designer, the software isn't cheap as it starts at $5,195 per year per user.An enterprise version, called Alteryx Server, runs $58,500 per year.Market and CompetitionIn a late 2016 report by IDC, it forecasts the worldwide market for 'big data and analytics technology and services' to exceed $203 billion by 2020, representing a CAGR of 11.7% from 2015.Service related spending will account for the strongest growth segment, with a five-year CAGR of 14.9%, reaching $60 billion in 2020. This $60 billion market is where Alteryx operates.Alteryx counts as competitors a number of companies in the traditional business intelligence space, such as:In addition, there are numerous data analytics software companies that provide either adjacent potential threats or partial competition.FinancialsAlteryx' recent financial results can be summarized as follows:Below are the company's operational results for the past three years (Audited GAAP):(Source: Alteryx S-1)RevenueGross MarginCash Flow from OperationsAs of December 31, 2016 Alteryx had $52.7 million in cash and short term investments, and $18.8 million in total liabilities not including deferred revenue. (Audited GAAP)IPO DetailsAlteryx intends to sell Class A common stock to raise $75 million in gross proceeds, but has not provided an expected share price range or proposed post-IPO market cap.Class B stock holds 10 votes per share whereas Class A shares will hold one vote per share.Management didn't provide any details on use of proceeds, other than standard boilerplate language, which means they'll use it for working capital unless they see an acquisition opportunity.There is no indication that existing shareholders intend to sell shares or buy additional shares, although that can change based on market conditions closer to the IPO. No projected date for the IPO has been set.Joint book-running managers are listed as Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan.CommentaryAlteryx is one of several software startups valued at or near a billion dollars in the 2015 late stage funding frenzy.We don't know management's proposed terms for the IPO yet, but it is safe to say that they will want to go public at or above that magic billion dollar valuation, to avoid triggering anti-dilution clauses that were common during that time period.From its financial performance, Alteryx is posting some extremely good numbers.Revenue growth is impressive and increasing, and appears to be on track to exceed $100 million in 2017.Gross margins are high, but probably won't increase that much more. The company is still using cash, but that is diminishing somewhat.The market that Alteryx is operating in is large and estimated to grow at double-digit rates over the next few years.Furthermore, Alteryx' position in the market is at the lower end, so the company is executing on a commonly successful approach of 'disrupting from below.'From my vantage point, Alteryx can either go up market and sell to large enterprises or go down market and sell to smaller firms, or just continue with its offering to expand geographically throughout the English-speaking world.I'll provide an update when we know more about deal terms, but I like Alteryx' growth trajectory and prospects.I write about technology IPOs, follow-ons, secondaries, and M&A deals.

Alteryx didn’t file an 8-K indicating a material change in financial condition, nor did it provide any change in financial guidance as a result of the deal, so it was likely not a material transaction and was for under $20 million.As of March 31, 2017, Alteryx indicated $164.5 million in cash and short-term investments and total liabilities excluding deferred revenue of $20.4 million, so appears to have ample financial capacity to complete the deal, assuming it was for the estimated amount.Both Alteryx and Yhat are in the ‘self-service’ data science tool space. Alteryx is acquiring Yhat for its technology that removes analytic model creation steps by allowing data scientists to deploy their models directly to a production environment upon manager approval.The benefit to organizations is that data science team members can iterate and analyze company operations at a much faster pace because they don’t have to go through ‘IT’ to deploy their models.As Alteryx’ CEO Dean Stoecker stated in the deal announcement,Alteryx went public in March 2017, and it certainly isn’t wasting any time putting its public market currency to use.With the Yhat deal, Alteryx is continuing to build out its self-service data science toolset as enterprises and middle market firms hire data scientists to optimize their operations.By removing the friction from the data analysis process using these types of tools and ‘pushing’ it down the organizational structure, companies stand to reap the benefits that rigorous data analysis can offer.AYX stock has done well since its IPO in March, rising from $15 per share to the current $20. With a growing valuation, I expect to see further opportunistic team and technology deals from Alteryx to accelerate its offering buildout.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

The dividend has been raised for 8 straight years and is growing at a double-digit rate.The dividend is very safe from the perspective of earnings and free cash flow.Leverage was a bit high but is trending down.The stock is overvalued at the moment.,"Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation (BAH) is arguably the market leader in U.S. government services contracting. The company is also an under-the-radar dividend growth stock. The dividend has been raised for 8 consecutive years. Since Booz has not yet made it to Dividend Contender status, most dividend growth investors are not tracking this stock yet. There is a lot to like here from the perspective of dividend safety, dividend growth, market leadership, and backlog. Granted, debt was elevated, but the leverage ratio is improving. The market has recognized the positives and the stock is arguably overvalued at this point. Further, the stock is trading near its 52-week high. Hence, I am largely neutral on Booz at the moment. Investors should wait for a better entry point.Source: BAHBooz Allen Hamilton traces its founding to 1914. The company was privately held until the IPO in late-2010. Booz is a leading provider of professional management and technology consulting services to the U.S government. Technology consulting services include information technology, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and engineering services. The company basically provides staffing to U.S. government clients. Booz has over 27,000 employees of which over 24,000 are consultants. About 96% of revenue was derived from contracts with the U.S. government. Revenue was 49% defense, 26% civil, 21% intelligence and 4% global commercial in Q3 FY 20 as seen in the chart below. The company had ~$7.5B in revenue in FY20.Source: Booz Allen Hamilton Q3 FY 2020 Investor PresentationBooz is a services company that derives its income from revenue by providing staffing to the U.S. government. Essentially, higher consulting headcount leads to higher revenue. From this perspective, Booz has been wildly successful, especially since the 2015 time period. The federal budget was relatively stagnant between 2009 and 2014. But since then, U.S. government spending has increased significantly. This is seemingly translated to higher spending on services by the U.S. government.Source: StatistaWe can see that revenue has increased from $5,274.8 million in FY 2020 to a high of $7,463.8 million in FY 2020. But the story at Booz is not all about the top line. Booz has also successfully raised operating margins and net profit margins since 2015. This demonstrates the company’s ability to control costs while raising revenue.Source: TIKR.comBooz has also been successful in winning recompetes and new contracts. The current total backlog is $20.7 billion. Of this, about $3.4 billion is funded, $4.5 billion in unfunded, and $12.8 billion is priced options. The total backlog has come down some since its peak in Q2 FY 2020. With that said, there is some cyclicality to the backlog as the company wins more contracts in second quarter compared to the other three quarters. The book-to-bill ratio at end of FY 2020 was 1.19X, which is down from 1.49X at end of FY 2019. But one can see that in FY 2019, Booz won a greater than normal number of contracts in the second quarter. One concern, though, is that book-to-bill ratio has been trending down for the past six quarters and is lower than in Q1 2018.Source: Booz Allen Hamilton FY 2020 Earnings PresentationBooz faces several risks to the top line. First, its revenue stream is not completely in its control. Changes in administration or control of the U.S. Congress can impact the federal budget. In turn, this could have an effect on U.S. government contractor revenue. Booz also faces increasing competition. Several product-based defense contractors are growing their services business units. For instance, General Dynamics (GD) has expanded its Technology Services business segment through the $9.7 billion acquisition of CRSA. Other defense contractors including Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) also have a growing presence in technology and engineering services.Booz initiated a dividend in 2011. The dividend has grown very rapidly since then. Currently, the regular quarterly cash dividend is $0.31 per share. The annual dividend is $1.24 per share. The annual yield is low at approximately 1.6%. This is much lower than the S&P 500’s average dividend yield of about 1.9%. The dividend has grown at a double-digit rate each year back to 2012.The dividend safety is rock solid based on both earnings and free cash flow. On an earnings basis, the payout ratio is roughly 35%. This is an excellent value and below my criterion of 65%. This is based on consensus forward earnings for FY 2021 of $3.59. In FY 2020, operating cash flow was $551.4 million. Capital expenditures were $128.1 million giving free cash flow of $423.3 million. The dividend required $146.6 million in cash. The dividend-to-FCF ratio was approximately 34.6%. This too is an excellent value and below my target threshold of 70%.The dividend is also seemingly safe from the perspective of debt. Debt was a little high for Booz, but rising EBITDA combined with higher cash on the balance sheet has lowered the leverage ratio to roughly 2.2X at end of FY 2020. Booz has about $742 million in cash on hand, offsetting $196.7 million in current long-term debt and $2,045.8 million in long-term debt. Interest coverage is about 7X. So, debt is not an issue from the perspective of the dividend.With a very secure a dividend and a high dividend growth rate, let’s take a look at valuation for Booz. The consensus FY 2021 earnings per share is now $3.59. At a stock price of $79.51, the earnings multiple is 22.7. This is higher than the trailing multiple since the IPO of about 17X.We will use 18.0 as the earnings multiple due to market leadership and operational execution to determine a fair value of $63.00. Applying a sensitivity analysis using P/E ratios between 17.0 and 19.0, I obtain a fair value range from $59.50 to $66.50. The current stock price is ~120% to ~134% of my estimated of fair value. The current stock price is ~$79.51, suggesting that the stock is very overvalued based on earnings.Estimated Current Valuation Based On P/E RatioSource: dividendpower.org CalculationsHow does this compare to other valuation models? Morningstar is known to use a fairly conservative discounted cash low model and provides a fair value of $70.67. We won’t use the Gordon Growth Model here since the extrapolated dividend growth rate is so high due to increases from a low base. An average of these two models is ~$66.84, suggesting that Booz is very overvalued at the current price.Booz is a reasonably safe stock. The U.S. government will probably always need to outsource for technical services and staffing. The stock is not that volatile with a trailing 5-year beta of ~0.95. Morningstar gives the stock a wide economic moat. Value Line gives the stock a safety score of ‘3’, financial strength rating of ‘B++’, a stock price stability of 80, and an earnings predictability of 70. Moody’s gives Booz a ‘Ba1’ and Standard & Poor’s gives Booz a ‘BB+’ credit rating. These are all decent scores but not top ranked.Booz is the market leader and continues to grow the top and bottom lines on the strength of U.S. government spending. This has translated to robust double-digit dividend growth since 2012. The stock is somewhat off the radar for dividend growth investors since it has only raised the dividend for 8 consecutive years and is not yet a Dividend Contender. But dividend growth investors should take a look at the stock. The divided is well covered by earnings and cash flow. Further, debt is reasonable. There is some risk to the top line if federal government spending slows or even declines due to an administration change. The main issue for the stock at the moment is high valuation. Hence, I am currently neutral on the stock.If you would like notifications as to when my new articles are published, please click the orange button at the top of the page to ""Follow"" me."

Investors typically do well focusing on companies with long streaks of dividend increases, in part because of the positive qualities a business needs in order to be able to continually afford what is ultimately a cash layout to shareholders. However, many of the companies known as ""Dividend Champions"" - those with 25 consecutive years (or more) of dividend growth - are mature companies. By identifying strong companies earlier in their lifecycle, we can benefit from strong total returns while these companies build their dividend growth reputation. We will be spotlighting numerous dividend up-and-comers to identify the best ""dividend growth stocks of tomorrow.""Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation (BAH) is a company that provides a host of services including consulting, engineering, analytics, software, and cybersecurity solutions to a variety of clients in the public, private, and non-profit sectors. Although Booz Allen Hamilton was founded in the early 1900s, it is a ""young"" stock - going public in 2010.Source: Booz Allen Hamilton Holding CorporationThe vast majority of Booz Allen Hamilton's customer base is related to the United States government with 47% of revenues generated from dealings with the Department of Defense. Another 27% is from business with non-military government branches such as the Treasury, Justice Department, and Homeland Security. An additional 23% is from the intelligence agencies of the United States. In all, the US government contributes to approximately 97% of revenues. A small portion of 3% is commercial and international-related.Source: Booz Allen Hamilton Holding CorporationThanks in part to the government's rising budget over the years and the very strong correlation that Booz Allen Hamilton has to it, the company has managed solid growth.Source: YchartsOver the past five years, revenues have grown at a CAGR of 4.12%. Net income has grown at a CAGR of 12.51% over the same time frame.To gain better insight into the strengths and weaknesses of Booz Allen Hamilton, we will use a number of key operating metrics. These will also tell us how the business is trending over time.We review operating margins to make sure the company is consistently profitable. We also want to invest in companies with strong cash flow streams, so we look at the conversion rate of revenue to free cash flow. Lastly, we want to see that management is effectively deploying the company's financial resources, so we review the cash rate of return on invested capital (CROCI). We will do all of these using three benchmarks:Source: YChartsWe see some mixed results in the operating metrics at Booz Allen Hamilton. While it's a positive that operating margin has gradually expanded over time, the company's conversion rate of revenue to FCF is disappointing. Even more so when you consider that Booz Allen Hamilton is already a very non-capital-intensive company - less than 2% of revenues are spent on CAPEX. This implies that the company comes under pricing pressure from the government as its primary customer.While Booz Allen Hamilton has a strong win rate (60% of new bids, and 83% retention on re-bids), the constant pressure from the government's cost controlling efforts makes it difficult to generate excessive cash flows. What is great to see, is that Booz Allen Hamilton is able to do well when it deploys its financial resources. The company generates a very healthy 18.86% cash rate of return on invested capital.The other major aspect of Booz Allen Hamilton's operations, is its balance sheet. It's important for any company to remain fiscally responsible. Too much debt can choke a company's cash flow, and expose investors to risk should the company see an unexpected downturn.Source: YChartsBooz Allen Hamilton maintains a stable balance sheet, but it's certainly not perfect. The company's leverage ratio of 2.67X EBITDA slightly exceeds our cautionary threshold of 2.5X. It helps that the company holds a strong cash position of $649 million, a debt to cash ratio of 3.3X. The government is a pretty stable revenue stream (when it isn't shutdown), and the non-capital-intensive nature of the company is another plus. While we wouldn't want to see a large acquisition or other major expenditure, the company's financial outlook is stable in our opinion.It didn't take long after going public for Booz Allen Hamilton to begin paying and growing its dividend payout. Investors have received some special dividends over the years, but the payout has been raised each of the past eight years. The dividend currently totals an annual sum of $0.92 per share, for a yield of 1.35%. This fails to meet basic income thresholds such as what 10-year US treasuries offer (1.85%), so Booz Allen Hamilton wouldn't be an ideal investment for investors that prioritize income.Source: YChartsDividend growth has been a bit more lively. The payout has expanded at a CAGR of 14.3% over the past five years. The payout ratio remains conservative at just 25% and buybacks have yet to become a core focus for management, so dividend growth is poised to continue at a double-digit rate as long as the company maintains its current operational trajectory.Source: YChartsAs we said above, buybacks haven't been a huge area of spending for Booz Allen Hamilton. After years of a bloating share float, the company has spent about $200-$240 million each of the past couple of years to begin reining that in. Investors will want to monitor the relationship of FCF spent between dividends and buybacks moving forward.Future growth at Booz Allen Hamilton begins and ends with the US government. As we mentioned earlier, more than 95% of the company's revenues are tied to relationships with various arms of the US government.Source: Booz Allen Hamilton Holding CorporationThis carries both pros and cons with it. Various branches of our government including our defense, intelligence agencies, and civil branches that uphold the fabric of American society - are all crucial areas of spending. While political risks can impact spending (more on that in a minute), only under apocalyptic scenarios is the US government a threat to go bankrupt, or not to pay its bills. Spending is also correlated to the economic performance of our country, so as GDP inflates over time, so will federal spending - which will partially end up in the coffers of companies such as Booz Allen Hamilton.Where it does get a bit sticky, is the potential volatility that we could see in the upcoming years. For example, the spending trends of the government can very easily be influenced by who happens to be president. Look at how much spending on the Department of Defense rose once Donald Trump became president.Source: YChartsWhich political parties happen to be in power, ongoing wars or conflicts, etc., can all have an impact on how the government spends money. Some say that there is always a war somewhere - and while there may be some truth in that, we can see that spending does in fact ebb and flow. Defense spending also happens to be Booz Allen Hamilton's largest business segment.This only gets more complicated as more attention is paid to mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare. It's no secret that our government operates at a budget deficit. Mandatory program spending is growing (and could explode if universal healthcare or other benefit programs come into play after 2020).Source: Congressional Budget OfficeAt some point, this will increase pressure on discretionary spending, which is what much of Booz Allen Hamilton's revenues depend on. This is ultimately the largest growth driver, and risk that the company faces. Investors will likely enjoy the long-term destination - but it could be a bumpy ride at times depending on political risks.Shares of Booz Allen Hamilton have cooled off some in recent months after a roaring first nine months of 2019. At just over $68 per share, the stock trades in the upper half of its 52-week range.Source: YChartsBased on full 2020 EPS estimates of $3.10 per share, the stock currently trades at an earnings multiple of 22.0X. Compared to the stock's 10-year median PE ratio of 17.34X, the current share price represents a 26% premium.If we look at valuation from a cash flow perspective, the current FCF yield of 4.91% is off of decade lows, but well below where we have seen it during recessionary environments from earlier in the decade.Source: YChartsBecause of the political risk factors inherent in the business, we wouldn't be inclined to justify the current valuation of shares. The political climate in the United States is becoming increasingly divided, meaning a break one way or the other that isn't friendly to Booz Allen Hamilton could be more extreme. For these reasons, we would want a margin of safety. If the stock traded at 16X earnings, shares would be priced at about $50 per share.Ultimately, these political risks in addition to the company's lack of FCF efficiency make a margin of safety necessary in an otherwise solid company. While Booz Allen Hamilton isn't our personal favorite, there is enough here that investors could consider an investment at the right valuation. While volatile at times, a company with strong government ties should succeed over the long term.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

Continued backlog growth (+7% YoY) points toward further top-line growth, with revenues set for ~11-12% YoY growth in FY20, driving ~12% EPS growth. Taking a medium-term view, I see a clear path toward strong EPS growth through FY21, slightly exceeding the company’s target. BAH’s consistently strong execution highlights not only the inherent quality investors are paying for, but also its willingness to invest for the long term, for instance, on technology, talent, and internal infrastructure. Though there are also various call-option investments that could drive upside surprises, the current above-par valuations have likely factored in much of the positives, and thus, I’d wait for a pullback before considering a position.Booz Allen delivered another beat-and-raise quarter, with double-digit organic revenue growth, margin expansion, and raised guidance to boot, for the second consecutive quarter. On an organic basis, revenue grew 11.2% YoY, driving a consensus-beating adjusted EBITDA result, though the 10.3% margin did represent a sight contraction (~50 bps YoY). Adjusted EPS stands at $0.80.Source: Investor PresentationWhile total and funded book-to-bill is down sequentially to 0.5X (1.2X and 1.0X on an LTM basis, respectively), this is in-line with typically lower seasonal bookings to start the government fiscal year. On a YoY basis, the 0.48X result has slightly increased from the 0.45X in 3Q19. YTD strength points to continued strength in the organic revenue trajectory, aided by having a budget in place for FY20.Source: Investor PresentationLooking ahead, FY20 Adj. EPS guidance was raised, along with FCF numbers at the midpoints, though tax rate and share count guidance remain unchanged. Revenue growth is now guided to land in the 10-11.5% range (vs. 9-11% prior). The upper end of guidance appears quite feasible considering the ~1,400 net employees added in FY19 (+5.8% increase in headcount), which generally provides a good baseline for top-line growth going forward.Source: Company FilingsOn the capital return front, BAH repurchased $22.5mn of stock for the quarter, ending the period with $697mn of cash on the balance sheet, in addition to a 17% off-cycle dividend increase to $0.27 per share. The total dividend increase over the last two quarters is now over 30%, well ahead of peers, and above the company's low-to-mid-teen trend of dividend increases over the past few years.Source: Company FilingsBy customer, BAH generates ~97% of its revenues from U.S. government agencies on over 4,700 contracts. YTD in FY20, Defense accounted for 49% of sales on solid growth (+14% YoY). Meanwhile, BAH’s civil business (26% of revenue) is also heavily levered to government budgets (e.g., Justice, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, etc.), with robust growth at ~15% YoY.Source: Company FilingsGoing forward, however, there is a clear path to continued growth for BAH as areas of the government outside of defense implement technological upgrades (e.g., machine learning techniques) for applications such as call centers. Through its broad mix of service offerings, BAH is well-positioned to bring proven solutions to new customers and drive innovation.Source: Investor PresentationThe 3Q20 adj. EBITDA margins of 10.3% continued a strong start to the year, despite the 17% increase in Cost Plus Mix (~57% of revenues vs. 54% in 3Q19). Adj. EBITDA margin guidance for FY20 in the low 10% range, does, however, imply a significant step down in Q4, though I’d point out this is consistent with the typical seasonality in the business. More moderate margins for Q4 are attributable to the onboarding of new employees, investments, and bonuses. In addition, billable expenses are expected to trend above the 29-31% range for the final quarter, weighing on margins.Source: Company Filings, AuthorBAH is also looking to differentiate itself through potential revenue streams from scalable technical solutions (defined as its “option value” programs), which forms the third part of its three-pronged investment thesis.Source: Investor PresentationThese option value programs (disclosed at the prior investor day event) are likely to see further updates over the next year, though there have already been some exciting developments on this front. The Modzy platform, for instance, allows the government to access commercially available AI algorithms with the confidence that the algorithms are overlaid with BAH cybersecurity from the training stage to the use stage. Meanwhile, the recreation.gov project, awarded in 2014, serves as the booking portal for reservations at facilities on Federal lands. Finally, BAH has also been leveraging quantum computing and AI on the $885M eMAPS contract awarded in July 2018 to drive more efficient data collection capabilities in the field.My price target for BAH lies at $68 based on an 18x multiple on an fwd CY21 EPS estimate of ~$4. While 18x earnings is admittedly at the upper end of historical valuations, I would argue this needs to be viewed in context – while BAH has traded at ~15x EPS in the past, this was largely on account of the market downturn following its IPO. In recent years, the stock has consistently traded above 15x earnings on the company's strong growth prospects.Data by YChartsOn an FCF basis, BAH also trades at a clear premium at an ~5% FCF yield (vs. ~6-8% yield for its peers) on account of its peer-leading revenue growth.Data by YChartsThus, I am on the sidelines for now, though I do acknowledge the potential from upside surprises longer term as BAH realizes further value from its option value initiatives."
4375623,105703,2020-09-22T02:22:59-04:00,"Booz Allen Hamilton is a leading consultancy firm with key, mission-critical engagements with the U.S. government.Its business has been largely unaffected by COVID-19, and continues to post strong growth.I see more upside for the shares from the current valuation.","It’s been more than three months since I last wrote about Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), and since then, the shares have done well. Since the publication date of June 6th, the shares have posted a total return (including dividends) of 8.3%, exceeding the 2.5% return of the S&P 500 over the same time period.While this run-up in share price has made the stock more expensive, I believe there is still some room for continued upside, and in this article, will show why.(Source: Bizjournals)Booz Allen Hamilton is a leading global consultancy firm with over 26,000 employees. It has a mix of both public and private sector clients operating in, among others, civil government, defense, intelligence, energy, financial services. Over its 100+ year history, Booz Allen Hamilton has consulted on high profile projects with clients including the Navy and NASA, and last year, the firm generated nearly $7.5B in total revenue. BAH has adjusted well to the current COVID-19 operating environment, as management noted that currently, 80% of its billable work is being done remotely.What I like about BAH is the mission-critical services that it renders for key governmental agencies. As seen below, 97% of its revenues in the last quarter were related to the Defense, Intelligence, and Civil sectors. Its low 3% exposure to global and commercial clients means that BAH is less susceptible to economic cycles, thereby making it a recession-resistant enterprise.(Source: August Investor Presentation)While having most of its business being tied to the federal government comes with advantages, it also comes with risks, as changes in federal appropriations can have a negative impact on BAH’s revenue streams. This risk, among others, was highlighted by management during the latest conference call:I’m encouraged, however, to see that management has enough confidence so far this fiscal year (started April 1st), to affirm its 2021 guidance for 8% revenue growth, and $3.50 EPS at the midpoint. This sits on top of a strong last quarter, which saw a 7.2% YoY revenue increase, and an even better 12% YoY growth in Adjusted EPS.(Source: Company Earnings Presentation)The company’s continued growth is supported by a number of promising projects, which includes a recent $1B re-compete win with the U.S. Army to expand the use of virtual reality and artificial intelligence tools in critical learning. In addition, it is currently working on a high-profile project to modernize the operations at the IRS, as noted by management during the last conference call:These projects contribute to BAH’s strong backlog. As seen below, the total backlog remains strong at $23B, which compares favorably to that of historical quarters.(Source: Company Earnings Presentation)Turning to the balance sheet, while Net Debt has trended upward in recent years, it appears to be manageable, as EBITDA has trended up at a faster rate. As seen below, Net Debt to EBITDA currently sits at 2.4x, which is down from 2.8x back in FY 2018. Over time, I would like to see this leverage ratio to go below 2.0x. However, I’m not too concerned, due to the stable and recurring nature of BAH’s revenue stream, with a strong backlog.(Source: Created by author based on company financials)In the meantime, the company continues its track record of capital returns to shareholders. As seen below, BAH repurchased nearly $254M worth of shares in the last 12 months. In addition, the dividend has grown at a solid 18% CAGR over the past five years, and remains safe, with a dividend-to-earnings payout ratio of just 34%.(Source: Company Earnings Presentation)Turning to earnings estimates, it appears that analysts expect continued double-digit earnings growth through FY 2023.Based on this information, I wanted to calculate what the PEG ratio is, with the following inputs:With the inputs above, I arrive at a PEG ratio of 1.85. Using a PEG ratio of 2 as a standard for fair value, the shares appear to be moderately undervalued, with a potential 8% upside from the current valuation (2/1.85 – 1 = 8%).Analysts seem to share a bullish opinion of the stock, with a 3.85 average rating (implying a Buy rating), and an average price target of $87.58, which sits slightly above where the shares are trading at today.Booz Allen Hamilton is a leading consultancy firm with key, mission-critical engagements with the U.S. government. It has a recession-resistant business model that is generally unaffected by economic cycles. The company continues to post strong growth, and currently has a sizeable backlog of projects.While net debt has increased in recent years, it appears that management has put the capital to good use, as the net debt to EBITDA ratio has trended downwards since FY 2018. In the meantime, the company continues its track record of capital returns to shareholders through both share repurchases and the well-covered dividend.As the valuation exercise demonstrated, I see the shares as being moderately undervalued, and expect the shares to perform at least in line with the market going forward, based on the forward earnings estimates. For this, and the reasons stated above, I have a favorable view of the stock at the current valuation."
4141006,104160,2018-01-29T14:36:26-05:00,"Booz Allen Hamilton derives nearly 58% of its cash flow and 70% of its contracts from the first two quarters of the fiscal year.Simple math of Booz Allen's FY 2018 FCF suggests $243 million, a 26% decline from 2017, indicating a per share value of $19.86.There is a significant discrepancy between Booz Allen's top-line revenue and operating income and its free cash flow.","Booz Allen’s (BAH) revenue and operating income are like staring at paint dry. It is range-bound, never too hot, never too cold, and makes the company look almost sedated as it floats through the bureaucracy of America searching for one government contract after another. Since 2011, Booz Allen has averaged $1.4 billion in revenue with a high of $1.58 billion (Q4 2017) or 12% off the average, and a low of $1.39 billion or 1% off the average. Since hitting a trough in the 2014/2015 fiscal years, when defense spending was on the decline, revenues have started to pick up leading into Q3 2018. Same for operating income - range-bound, steady, predictable, coming in every quarter at an average of 7.75% of revenue. **Derived from Booz Allen Hamilton's 10Qs since 2011.But this image, much like the rest of Booz Allen, is a delusion. The stable revenue and operating income belie the seasonal cyclicality of government contracting. Just as a retailer goes on neutral every year between the months of February to September, waiting for the Christmas season to put it back in the black, so too does Booz Allen wait until every September when something magical happens. Not magical in the sense that something useful is being done for the good of humanity or national security, mind you, but magical nonetheless.This is revealed in the company’s Free Cash Flow (CFO minus capex), that shows the reality of Booz Allen’s business. It is not the steady, predictable company suggested by its revenue and operating income. It is actually a business in a constant state of flux, pitching for new government contracts in an incessant push to secure government contracts in the increasingly competitive world of government service contracts. The graph below compares Booz Allen’s Free Cash Flow against the government dollars obligated revealed in the author’s analysis of government contract data from USAspending.gov.**Derived from Booz Allen Hamilton's 10Qs since 2011 and contract data from USAspending.govAnalysis of the data is quite revealing. Booz Allen’s Free Cash Flow and government contracts spike during the 2nd Quarter every year when the government goes through the annual dance of spending every dollar it has before the start of the new fiscal year in October. If these government agencies don’t spend the money, they typically lose it, or fear they will lose it because government minders in Congress will start asking a few simple questions and come to the conclusion that if a government agency can’t spend the money, then they likely don’t need the same amount in the next fiscal year. Let’s call this the “September effect” when US government agencies attempt to spend every dime in their coffers, lest they don’t receive the same amount, or an incremental increase, during the next fiscal year that starts in October. It’s a logical conclusion, which is why government agencies jump through any hoop and do whatever it takes to obligate the dollars. Booz Allen benefits handsomely from this fundamental flaw in the way taxpayer dollars are spent.Take a look at the chart below that averages Booz Allen’s Free Cash Flow quarter by quarter since 2011 against its total FCF produced for that particular FY. Q2, more specifically the month of September before the end of the government’s fiscal year, produces a whopping 45% of the company’s cash flow for the entire year and 47% of the contract dollars obligated. Now compare this to the breakdown of revenue and operating income by quarter. We’re back to the delusion of Booz Allen as a steady, stable, predictable producer. Paint…drying, right? Wrong. Similar to Booz Allen’s claim to be a “management consultant” when in fact it is a glorified HR firm, so too has it fooled Wall Street into thinking that the company’s stock should be viewed more like a Steady Eddie bond, throwing off cash to shareholders through a rich dividend and steadily increasing stock. The reality is far different. The company’s cash flows are extremely volatile and highly dependent on the “September effect” for government contracting. Without this, or even with a marginal decline in the contracts pouring in at the end of the fiscal year, the company would be in deep trouble.**Author's calculation based on Booz Allen Hamilton's financial statements (FCF defined as Cash Flow from Operations minus Capex Spending or spending on Property, Plant, and Equipment).According to Booz Allen’s 2017 10K, “Contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenue and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of the Company’s contracts, developing total revenue and cost at completion estimates requires the use of significant judgment.” Judgment indeed. My analysis suggests Booz Allen has likely “judged” that smoothing its earnings throughout the year presents a better image instead of showing the volatility inherent in government contracting.But the cash flow tells the real story and cash is king, so we should listen to the cash instead of grand proclamations from graduates of Susquehanna University (where is that exactly?) who lead Booz Allen’s military healthcare industry. Side note - take a few minutes to look at Booz Allen’s “expertise” and ask yourself a simple question - if these “experts” were let loose on the real commercial industry, not simply recycling contractor “butts” to fit in government “seats,” then how long would these individuals survive in their jobs? One indication of how this “expertise” would fit in the real world outside of government work is Booz Allen’s commercial consulting practice. When Carlyle Group acquired Booz Allen in 2008, it split the commercial business from government contracting and solidified the deal with a non-compete agreement through 2011. Once the non-compete ended, Booz Allen touted the potential of its commercial segment as a way to grow the company…BIGLY. Chairman of the Board Ralph Shrader asserted “one of the powerful things about commercial and international is not just what they do for our revenue generation or profits or financials, but also because things we learn there that are of value to our relevant clients in the same way that things that we learned in the government are of value to commercial clients.”This simply hasn’t materialized. In 2014, the company started to report its commercial segment in its earnings, accounting for 2.6% of revenue or $130.4 million. Come 2017, this was still 2.6% or $138.3 million. You would think a company with nearly $6 billion of “management consulting” services to the US government would have the ability to translate this into a solid commercial practice. But Booz Allen would soon discover that real commercial companies don’t necessarily appreciate another company coming along with the pitch that it provide its “butts” to fit into a commercial company’s “seats.” It just…doesn’t…work. REAL consulting companies come in, figure out ways to cut costs or growth revenue, not graft themselves to the existing bloating structure and hold on for dear life. Thus is the world of Booz Allen.The practical implications of the inherent volatility in Booz Allen’s government business become even more apparent when we look a little more closely at Booz Allen’s expenses. The expenses are tied to the company’s revenue and it recognizes costs as incurred based on when the contracts are performed:**Derived from Booz Allen Hamilton's 10Qs since 2011.In Booz Allen’s Q1 2012 earnings call, CFO Sam Strickland responded to a question regarding revenue growth by revealing an annual pattern in Q2 earnings influenced by a rise in expenses because Booz Allen is focused on bidding for all those contracts that come up right at the end of the government’s fiscal year. According to Strickland, In practical terms, this means Booz Allen’s unbillable time increases because it is not allowed to bill the government for marketing expenses and time spent by its employees to respond to a government Request for Proposal so it can win new contracts. Strickland was clear about this fact, pointing out that he “understands the confusion around unbilled, but what that represents is we are much like we did last year, building staff in anticipation of a surge and funding as of the end of the government’s fiscal year.”So not only are existing employees spending their time responding to new contract proposals, but Booz Allen is also hiring additional staff in anticipation of winning a certain amount of contracts. None of this can be billed to the government; it has to be eaten by the company as part of its doing business.Interestingly, this isn’t reflected in the company’s expenses. If the 2nd Quarter, specifically September, is the busiest time of the year, producing 47% of the company’s contract obligations and 45% of the company’s free cash flow, you would expect its expenses to increase concomitantly and margins to go down. They do not. They’re the same, quarter after quarter, year after year. Paint... drying. Something strange is happening.Combine this fact with the ongoing Department of Justice and SEC investigations, and we perhaps have a decent explanation for what’s actually happening. It appears as though Booz Allen is overbilling the government for those hours that its employees are working on responding to contracts or even billing the government for employees that are hired in anticipation of winning a contract that Booz Allen does not yet have. Strickland says as much when he points that some employees working on classified contracts are waiting on security clearances. In the Q1 2012 earnings call, Strickland points out “as you can imagine, with cyber, a lot of that work is classified. So when you hire staff of course you have to go through the process of either getting them cleared or getting their clearances transferred. And while that’s going on, its hard to get that billable.”If it is hard to get that billable and every 2nd Quarter, year after year, represents such a substantial chunk of the company’s FCF and contract dollars obligated, then we would expect billable hours to decline and total expenses to increase in parallel with the level of effort required to win nearly half of the company’s total windfall for the year. Makes sense, right? And the company admits that this should be happening, but it is clearly not. The chart below overlays billable expenses and total expenses as a % of revenue over time. In some years, billable expenses and total expenses do indeed act according to what we would expect - billable expenses decline as employees move off contracts that can be billed back to the government and work on proposals, and total expenses rise as Booz Allen is forced to pay for more expense out of its own pocket instead of billing this back to the government. But this is nowhere near what we would expect in terms of the dollar amounts and number of contracts that come as part of the “September effect.”**Derived from Booz Allen Hamilton's 10Qs since 2011.Even more interesting is Booz Allen’s Free Cash Flow margin by quarter, as reflected in the chart below. We already know that the 2nd Quarter of every year produces a substantial amount of cash, so it should be no surprise that the margins also noticeably increase due to the “September effect.” Overlaying this data with the Operating Income margin is quite enlightening, especially when we think about this with regards to the expenses incurred by quarter. It would make logical sense that if there is indeed more of the Booz Allen workforce going towards replying to what accounts to a significant percentage of its total contracts for the year then we should see a decline in profitability, but this just isn’t happening. Booz Allen is making the vast majority of its cash in this period and is not incurring a corresponding expense as suggested by the profitability. 1+1 does not equal 3, but Booz Allen’s delusional accounting suggests it should.**Author's Calculations based on information from Booz Allen's 10Q financial statements since 2011.The chart below shows the pure tonnage involved every September as the fiscal year ends. Look at the spike in total number of contracts and dollars obligated. As stated earlier, Booz Allen brings in 47% of its total contract dollars in the 2nd Quarter, with September alone accounting for an average of 26% of ALL contract dollars for the entire year. The September effect is real and absolutely critical to Booz Allen’s future growth and pure survival. You would suspect a corresponding spike in expenses associated with such a critical time, but this simply isn’t happening. What is likely happening is Booz Allen is figuring out a way to pass along these costs to the government and now the Department of Justice and SEC are catching wind of this through one of the annual audits from the Defense Contract Audit Agency. According to Booz Allen’s 2017 10K, “contract costs, including indirect expenses, are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or DCAA, and, accordingly, are subject to possible cost disallowances.” The question is how much of Booz Allen’s costs will be disallowed by the government.**Data derived from USASpending.gov.**Author's calculations based on data derived from USAspending.gov and Booz Allen Hamilton financial statements.This is a much more difficult question to answer and speculation isn’t good for anyone. What we can look at to get some sense of direction is Booz Allen’s breakdown of expenses by quarter going back to 2011. Total expenses over this time period have remained relatively consistent at 91% of revenue. Booz Allen’s costs and profits are fixed by the government, so this makes sense. What doesn’t make much sense is the changing nature of the expenses. Expenses for defense contractors are typically broken down into two components - direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are how much you pay your employees. The labor rates are dictated by the government, so Booz Allen simply takes government dollars and pays its employees to get its contractor “butts” into government “seats.” The indirect costs are how much it costs Booz Allen to keep the lights on. All defense contractors are incentivized to keep costs low so they can win more government work. If they’re priced too high, they lose work. Too low and they’ll likely be unable to fulfill the contract. This is why rates across the industry are typically the same across the board. There’s very little wiggle room in this respect. Booz Allen is unique among defense contractors in that it qualifies its costs even further. Instead of lumping in the direct and indirect costs of its employees into its cost of revenues, it segments it out even further into “cost of revenue” (i.e., labor costs for its employees), “billable expenses” (i.e., those indirect costs of keeping the lights on), and G&A. As mentioned in my earlier write-up on Booz Allen, by segmenting its costs in this way, Booz has made it look like its Gross Margins are higher than any other defense contractor, even though its total expenses are about the same as everyone else's.What’s curious about Booz Allen’s billable expenses is that they’ve been steadily increasing over the years. In 2011, billable expenses accounted for 29% of revenue; today they are up to 35%. Cost of revenues has gone down and G&A has remained steady. The increase in billable expenses isn’t trivial. We’re talking about an increase of $127 million over the course of 7 years. This is a dramatic increase and begs the question of why the breakdown in expenses is changing so much. There’s no logical explanation for this change and the company has yet to address the reason for the change in its financial statements or earnings calls. With the company now under investigation for how it bills indirect costs (i.e. those billable expenses that have increased so dramatically), the implications and potential consequences for Booz Allen could be substantial.**Based on Booz Allen Hamilton's 10Q financial statements since 2011.**Based on Booz Allen Hamilton's 10Q financial statements.Putting it all together - implications for Booz Allen’s Q3 2018 earnings and its future as a going concern. Now that we have a much more granular understanding of when Booz Allen makes its money, we can take some analytic leaps of judgment to predict what its earnings are going to look like. Using contract data from USAspending.gov, we can peer into the future to either confirm the veritable Emperor “Boozie” does indeed wear the richest, rarest silk in the world, or discover that the Emperor has no clothes at all. In the case of Booz, it seems to be the latter.The USAspending.gov database is an incredibly rich and comprehensive data set. Established in 2006 with the passage of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act, the database includes all federal contract, grant, loan, and other financial assistance awards of more than $25,000. The idea was to give the American public access to information on how their tax dollars are being spent. This is horrible for a company like Booz Allen, but terrific for us because it allows investors to peer underneath the covers to see what’s happening to the business.The USAspending.gov database is intended to be comprehensive, but there’s always a slight discrepancy between the aggregate amounts of contract dollars obligated from the database versus BAH revenue. Directionally, the trend is clear but there’s always a lag. Booz Allen’s revenue recognition policies may play a part in this discrepancy, but it is most likely due to Booz Allen’s classified work in its intelligence segment which accounted for 23% of its revenue in 2017, down from 26% in 2014. When we take this into account, we get pretty darn close to matching up the data from USAspending.gov with Booz Allen’s revenue.**Author's calculations based on data from Booz Allen Hamilton's 10Q financial statements and data from USAspending.govAs shown in the chart below, in any given year the USAspending.gov data accounts for 68% of Booz Allen’s revenue. This matches almost perfectly when we combine Booz Allen’s defense segment (47% of revenue) with the civil segment (28% of revenue). Together, this represents 75% of Booz Allen’s revenue versus the 68% accounted for in the database. Again, not exactly right but directionally these numbers are correct, so it provides us with a predictive tool to see how the business is doing.**Author's calculations based on data from Booz Allen Hamilton's 10Q financial statements and data from USAspending.govAs previously discussed, we know that by Q3 2018, Booz Allen has already made approximately 58% of its Free Cash Flow for the year and won 70% of its contracts. We also know that historically Booz Allen FCF margin as % of total revenue is approximately 5.11% going back to 2011. The Free Cash Flow margin for 2017 was a little higher than the historical average at 5.63%. To keep things simple, let’s just assume Booz Allen keeps its Free Cash Flow margin at 5.63%. Taking Booz Allen’s Free Cash Flow for the first two quarters of 2018 ($141M), we do some simple math and divide this by the 58% average dating back to 2011. This gives us the expected Free Cash Flow for Booz Allen’s 2018 - $243 million. This represents a 26% decline from its 2017 Free Cash Flow ($328 million). Again, we’re not taking a massive analytical leap here. We’re simply saying that data from Booz Allen’s financial statements since Q12011 suggest that it derives 58% of its TOTAL Free Cash Flow from the first two quarters of the year, that the vast majority (70%) of its contracts are secured during the same time period, and that this suggests a simple math equation to decipher the year-end Free Cash Flow of the company. There’s no indication that the government is going to buck its historic trend and somehow create more government budget dollars to go to defense contractors. It is just not going to happen.What this tells us, as reflected in the chart below, is that there’s significant downside ahead for Booz Allen’s stock. Booz Allen, as well as other defense contractors, trade off the fact that they are stable, predictable cash cows, almost like a bond. You take government money, filter it through a profit regime of a private company with margins dictated by the government, and flow it through to shareholders at a certain valuation. Right now, the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSEARCA:XAR), including 35 defense contractors, trades at 18.5 Enterprise Value to Free Cash Flow. This seems a bit more logical than using Booz Allen’s current valuation at 22.8x Free Cash Flow, especially considering the uncertainty regarding the ongoing Department of Justice and SEC investigation. But let’s get crazy for a second and say that the market keeps valuing the company at this multiple. Using the new Free Cash Flow number extrapolated from Booz Allen’s own financial statements, this suggests a valuation of $26.84 per share, or a 32% decline from its current stock price. Taking this one step further to say that Booz Allen should simply be valued alongside its defense contractor brethren, we have a per share value of $19.86, a more than 50% decline from current prices."

This punishes the stock's valuation.My DCF model suggests that BAH's fair value is $46.53, which implies a 24% potential downside.As a whole, BAH is a well-run company with promising prospects. However, the current price tag makes the shares a ""hold"" at this point.","Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE: BAH) is a consulting firm that works closely with the US government. Most of its contracts are tied to the defense sector. Over the past few quarters, the company has enjoyed the benefits of excellent execution, good contract volume, favorable pricing, and expanding margins. However, my DCF model on the company suggests that investors are currently ignoring the effect of the company’s debt on its valuation. Thus, BAH’s real value is likely below its current share price.Source: Booz Allen Hamilton.Booz Allen Hamilton recently reported its Q3 2019 earnings. In the call, management sounded happy to share good results with shareholders. There were two significant announcements: 1) they raised their guidance for fiscal 2019 by $0.10, and 2) they announced an increase in the quarterly dividend. The dividend now is $0.23/share, which implies an annual dividend yield of 1.50%.Furthermore, management commented on their 2020 vision. In their opinion, the growth strategy outlined there continues to yield positive results. Moreover, CEO Horacio Rozanski, also reminded investors that he anticipates that the next couple of years will be as good as 2018.From what I could gather, the company's growth strategy relies on the following pillars:Source: Seeking Alpha Essential. BAH has been consistently beating estimates the past few quarters. This is why the market is so upbeat about its prospects.Thus, it’s evident why investors are so optimistic about the stock. After all, BAH appears to have very competent management, a privileged market position, and a long track record (the company has been in business since 1914). On top of that, it pays a quarterly dividend. So I can imagine it ticks many investors' checkboxes, and makes the stock a comfortable long-term hold. Nevertheless, it’s essential to realize that BAH is benefiting from all the key variables going their way:As you can see, BAH’s business depends on the market cycle. If an economic slowdown was to occur, or government spending dried up, then this could severely impact the company’s financials. You see, new contracts would slow down, and lower demand would likely result in lower prices. Then, these two variables would push down BAH’s margins.Naturally, all businesses are tied to economic cycles. After all, it’s challenging to find stocks that are completely detached from the economy. However, I mention this because BAH seems to be priced to perfection, despite evidence that we’re late in the market cycle. I believe this factor by itself makes BAH a very risky proposition.Management acknowledged that the company's liquidity was an issue. Unsurprisingly, they remained optimistic about their abilities to deploy capital efficiently. Still, I feel it’s essential for investors to realize that BAH has a substantial amount of debt and liabilities. You see, the company has a total debt of nearly $1.8 billion. This figure is 1.37 times larger than the company's current assets. Also, BAH's total liabilities of $3.12 billion are practically equal to a company's assets of $3.80 billion. Another important leverage ratio is debt-to-equity. Here, the company’s D/E ratio stands at 2.63.Therefore, it is fair to say that BAH is highly leveraged. Every quarter its total liabilities keep piling up. In a way, this largely explains why the company is posting such impressive results. After all, leverage is great when things are working out, but it also exacerbates any potential downside.If we were to adjust the company's growth rate to its debt, then I think investors would look at the stock differently. Just as an example, BAH’s beta is 0.82, which at first sight implies that it's less volatile than the market. However, after we lever the beta with its D/E ratio, then the number jumps to a whopping 2.63. Thus, it’s evident that BAH’s leverage substantially increases the company’s risk profile. This is why I think BAH’s most significant problem is its liabilities.What's even more puzzling is that management decided to increase the dividend while raking up the company's debt consistently every quarter. Based on the latest dividend increase, BAH will pay a whopping $131.10 million in dividends this year. Also, the interest paid on its debt is roughly $76.52 million per year. So these two figures combined represent $207.62 million per year.In my view, BAH should have roughly $421.75 million in unlevered FCF for 2019. So it seems that the company has some room for maneuvering. However, in my view, it would be much more prudent to pay down the company's debt before increasing the dividend. This would leave the company in a much better position to weather any potential economic slowdown. Also, it would delever the company’s financials, which would make a much more attractive investment.BAH trades at a forward PE of 22.6. However, the company is guiding to a 6% to 8% revenue increase. Typically revenue growth is the best proxy for long term growth because it’s less susceptible to changes in cost structure or one-time items, to name a few. However, it’s worth mentioning that cash from operations and net income are likely to grow at a faster pace. As previously mentioned, this is mostly due to improving margins and favorable exogenous factors.As you can see, BAH appears to be overvalued by my DCF model. The main factor that reduces the company’s fair value is its debt. You see, the D/E ratio makes the BAH’s beta much higher, which results in a higher discount rate. After all, the CAPM has to account for the firm’s leverage (which inherently makes it riskier).I wouldn't necessarily have a problem with buying a company that has much debt. However, such companies have to make sense in terms of valuation. Unfortunately, I think BAH’s debt severely distorts the company’s real value. In my view, the market is currently pricing BAH as if it wasn’t significantly leveraged. Nevertheless, once this is accounted for, then the shares appear to be overvalued by roughly 24%.Source: Stock Charts, plus author’s annotations.I think the only way to justify BAH’s current valuation is if you expect margins to continue to improve indefinitely. However, it is essential to keep in mind that margins can only grow so much in a services company. After all, the company's main cost input is labor, which is tough to cheapen beyond a certain point. Not to mention that BAH’s prospects are tightly linked to economic cycles, so margins will inevitably deteriorate sometime. This is just part of doing business.Hence, I think investors shouldn’t chase the shares higher at these prices. After all, BAH has rallied over 35% since January 2019. In my view, at this point, the shares offer little upside. Nevertheless, please note that I’m not recommending selling or shorting either. BAH is an excellent company with promising business prospects for the long term, and its fair value and current stock price don’t diverge by a significant amount.Thus, if you’re already long, I would recommend just holding the shares. If not, wait for a pullback to $45 to start building a position.Thank you for reading, and good luck."

Click here to find out more »The once-storied Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is now sullied with one scandal after another. From the ignominious honor of having employed not only one, but two of the most damaging leakers in government history - National Security Agency (NSA) contractors working for Booz Allen Edward Snowden and Hal Martin - the company is now under civil and criminal investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and SEC for how the company allocates indirect costs, or costs that the government should not otherwise be responsible for reimbursing as part of a contract.Once described as the “world’s most profitable spy operation,” Booz Allen is a shell of what it once was. Saddled with legacy debt from its days under the thumb of the Carlyle Group and reeling from three massive security breaches that have compromised Booz Allen’s prized position with government customers, the day of reckoning for Booz is on the horizon. This stock has been lofty for far too long (up 122% since disclosing Edward Snowden was a Booz Allen employee) and is on its way to a more than 50% decline in the near term.My thesis is based on the following key investment factors:Booz Allen has moved far, far beyond its roots. Founded in 1914 by Edwin Booz, Booz Allen bills itself as a stable of “management consultant” gurus ready to save the US government from itself. Here’s how Booz Allen describes it’s business in its 2017 10k – “We are a leading provider of management and technology consulting, engineering, analytics, digital solutions, mission operations, and cyber expertise to U.S. and international governments, major corporations, and not-for-profit organizations.” Sounds great, right? A bunch of Mckinsey or Bain-like consultants running around the government providing high-level advice to senior policy-makers and executives running the largest federal government agencies in the world. Problem is it’s patently false.The vast majority of Booz Allen contracts are what people in the industry call “butts in seats.” Here’s how it works. Government agency A puts out a request for proposal for services X, Y, and Z, typically referring to a number of individuals (known as Full Time Equivalents) with a certain security clearance and skill set. The government dictates the billable rates (within a certain % of an equivalent government employee’s salary) as well as the profit margins associated with the business. The contractor submits a proposal to respond to the RFP, typically touting their past performance, the expertise of the individuals, and rates that correspond to the allowable rates dictated by the government. When submitting the rates, the contractor takes the employee salary and multiplies it by what is called a “wrap rate” that includes fringe, overhead, G&A, etc., basically everything that it takes to keep the lights on for the contractor and put the employee’s butt in the seat of the government agency.If the contractor has decent performance history with the government (i.e. has been around a long time) and has a competitive wrap rate, then they win. The contractor’s employees then proceed to go to work in the government agency’s office and day-to-day take orders from their government minders. At this point the contractor is pretty hands off; they pay the employees, do performance evals, check in with the government lead on the contract, but are basically done. The contractor employees have thus essentially become an appendage of the US government and are only non-government employees in name only. If you walked into a government agency to brief the “team”, it would be a porridge stew of contractors and government civilians (likely more contractors than “govvies” as they’re affectionately termed). The only way to tell the difference is the color of their badges.The nature of contracting is such that contract employees typically move from company to company, moving to whoever has the contract at any given time. You’re a Booz employee one day, then the next you become a CACI employee because a new company wins the contract. The contractors are body shops, so the more vetted employees they have on deck, the more they get paid. If they don’t have someone filling a position on a contract they’ve already won, then the company isn’t paid until they secure the “butt” in the “seat,” thus incentivizing them to find someone quickly, qualifications be damned.What Booz Allen does NOT do, however, is provide any kind of “consulting” type services. This is a myth. Booz Allen propagates this myth because it sounds better than saying they’re a glorified HR firm hunting for bodies on behalf of the government. In the parlance of government contracting, the majority of Booz Allen’s contracts are categorized under the product code R499 (“Support - Professional: Other”) or R425 (“Support - Professional: Engineering/Technical). In other words, Booz Allen is a body shop for the US government, typically finding former military or government civilians and renting them back to the government at a higher price. They don’t spend a dime on R&D (take a look at their financials; not a single dime on R&D since their founding), have no product other than their personnel, and simply stick Booz Allen “butts” in the government “seats.” That’s it; that’s all. Does this sound like your typical “management consultant”? Sound like a “leading provider of management and technology consulting”? Not exactly.The cognitive dissonance between the reality of Booz Allen’s business (i.e. glorified HR shop) versus the delusion presented to the world (i.e. technology/management consultants) distorts the implied valuation of the company. Quick thought experiment – how would you value a HR firm or low-level headhunter? Maybe 4x EBITDA? How about a innovative, cutting-edge tech consulting company? Maybe 15x EBITDA, if not more?The importance of this misclassification should not be overlooked. Booz Allen and Carlyle knew exactly what they were doing when they dressed up the firm as a “management consultant” instead of of a glorified HR firm. Classifying the firm as the former puts it in an entirely different category aptly named “professional services,” making you think along the likes of Deloitte, Accenture, McKinsey, Bain. The latter puts your head, and subsequent valuation, in an entirely different realm. This was done purposeful in order for Carlyle to maximize their investment after they completed a IPO of Booz Allen in 2010.In June 2017, Booz Allen disclosed that it was under both criminal and civil investigation by the Department of Justice for how it calculated costs billed to the US government. According to the CEO, ""we continue to believe that the DOJ's focus is on certain elements of the company's cost accounting and indirect cost charging practices with the U.S. government."" At the time, they said that they don’t believe their GAAP accounting or financial reporting practices were the focus, but this all changed within a few months.In November 2017, Booz Allen disclosed it was under investigation by the SEC. Specifics weren’t disclosed, aside from saying the SEC is “conducting an investigation that the Company believes relates to matters that are also the subject of the DOJ's investigation.” This tells us the case is expanding, not shrinking and certainly not going away any time soon.This is no trivial matter. Beyond the fact that Booz is potentially overcharging the US government, Booz Allen’s “billable” expenses amount to more than $1.75 billion, or 33% of all their operating expenses. This is now all in question and potentially subject to claw-back by the government in the form of penalties and exclusion from future government business.The economics of government contracting and billing the government is a little unique, so let’s take a moment to explain what exactly we mean by indirect costs. Contracting firms charge the government for both direct and indirect costs. The direct costs include a contractor’s salary and indirect costs include things like office space and other resources required to put the contractor “butt” in the government “seat.” The direct costs are typically the most substantial because they’re simply charging the government for a contractor’s salary plus a small fixed profit margin for the company. As explained above, contractors are incentivized to keep their total direct and indirect costs down in order to keep their wrap rate competitive.Booz Allen’s entire business is strictly regulated by a voluminous set of Federal Acquisition Regulations, known as the FAR. This dictates exactly what Booz can charge the government for various services and how they expense the government for services rendered. Specifically excluded from government reimbursement are items such as advertising costs, alcohol, debt service, automobile costs for personal use, entertainment, lobbying, public relations, etc.According to Booz Allen’s 2017 10K, “Contract costs include direct labor and billable expenses, an allocation of allowable indirect costs, and warranty obligations. Billable expenses is comprised of subcontracting costs and other “out of pocket” costs that often include, but are not limited to, travel-related costs and telecommunications charges.”In the Q3 2016 earnings call, CEO Horacio Rozanski referenced “aggressively pursued opportunities spending more heavily in bid and proposal and other indirect costs, to capture as much work as possible.” What he means is the firm is spending more on expenses that cannot be billed back to the government in order to win more business. Again, these expenses cannot be billed back to the government, but the DOJ and SEC investigation seems to be saying that’s exactly what Booz is doing. Its fraud, plain and simple.We must remember that Booz Allen’s expenses are audited every single year by a variety of government audit agencies. It's incredibly strict. What has happened is these government audits found something so egregious that it couldn’t be handled at their level with a simple fine so they had to refer this to the Department of Justice for further investigation. The investigation isn’t going away and is not just a simple civil investigation, it includes criminal wrongdoing.This leads us to the SEC investigation. What DOJ/SEC likely discovered is that Booz Allen not only overcharged the government by misallocating indirect costs as billable expenses, but it appears Booz has also inflated its gross margins for years. Take a close look at the chart below comparing Booz Allen’s gross margins against two other glorified HR defense contractor firms - CACI and Mantech. Both of these firms specialize in the same kind of body shop, butts in seat business as Booz, so we should expect their gross margins to be roughly the same. Booz is hiring the same people as CACI and Mantech, then recycling them back to the government, so they should all be in the same ballpark. Looking at the data, however, and it becomes clear that Booz Allen is doing something quite unique. Again, they're not conducting business substantially better or different than CACI or Mantech, Booz is simply allocating expenses differently. Whereas CACI and Mantech lump together direct and indirect costs associated with their personnel as their total operating expenses, Booz Allen segments out direct costs and ""billable expenses."" By segmenting the numbers in this manner, Booz Allen's Gross Margins appear higher because Booz is only including the direct costs (i.e. salary) or its employees in its operating expenses. The other line item for ""billable expenses"" is no different than CACI or Mantech's ""indirect expenses"" included in its overall Costs of Goods Sold, but the small move of segmenting the expenses affects Gross Margins. This fits nicely with their practice of making their business sound more sophisticated and potentially profitable than it actually is. Doesn’t it sound much better to say you’re a 50% gross margin business than a 25% or 15% gross margin business? It certainly does and it plays better in the road show when Carlyle took Booz Allen on its IPO tour in 2010.Author's calculations based on Booz Allen (BAH), CACI (CACI), and ManTech (MANT) 10K Annual Reports. Gross Margin % = (Revenue - Operating Expenses)/Revenue. Beyond the issue of window dressing Booz Allen’s gross margins, it also appears that Booz Allen’s EBIT margins are consistently higher than its competitors. Take a look below at the EBIT margin since 2010. Again, defense contractor profit margins are razor thin and dictated by the US government. There’s not much wiggle room here to extract additional money from this equation. The only logical explanation is related to the issue of ""indirect costs"" that are under investigation by the DOJ/SEC. If indeed Booz Allen has been billing the government for costs that are not directly related to the performance of contractor duties, then we would expect Booz Allen's margins to come down when they start eating these costs internally instead of passing them along.Author's calculations based on Booz Allen (BAH), CACI (CACI), and ManTech (MANT) 10K Annual Reports. EBIT Margin % = Operating Income/Revenue. The comparison with CACI and Mantech is especially enlightening. Luckily, we have the benefit of CACI’s audited financials going back to the early 90s. Booz Allen has been fleecing the government as a glorified HR firm for a lot longer than CACI, but CACI has been a public company for far longer, so we can benefit from looking at their numbers. What’s more, CACI has never been under a civil and criminal DOJ investigation or SEC investigation, so this tells me that they’re probably doing business the right way. Same for Mantech. Looking at CACI, we learn their their margins and cost allocation are incredibly consistent. This is EXACTLY what you would expect for a business in which your product is finding contractor “butts” to put in government “seats”, with set profit margins and labor rates. In their annual report, CACI makes it clear that their costs of revenue “include all direct contract costs including subcontractor costs as well as indirect overhead costs and selling, general and administrative expenses that are allowable and allocable to contracts under federal procurement standards.” This is why you can set an egg-timer to their gross profit margins.With Booz Allen, its a little different. Whereas CACI includes ALL the expenses associated with their employees in Cost of Goods Sold (i.e. direct and indirect costs), Booz Allen only includes “billable expenses.” Booz Allen’s “indirect costs” are still account for in total expenses, just not included in their Cost of Goods Sold, making it look as if Booz Allen’s gross margin is significantly higher than their competitors. With margins like that, your mind starts to wonder, “are they really that much better” or “wow, they’re incredible.” But they’re not, they just found a new way to put lipstick on the pig and have grown accustomed to overbilling the government for indirect costs not associated with their actual contracts with the government. To understand why this is happening we need to look back at the 2008 acquisition of Booz Allen by the Carlyle Group.In July 2008, Carlyle Group completed its acquisition of Booz Allen. The post 9/11 boom in defense spending still had a few years left until it reached its zenith in 2011 and Carlyle saw a prime opportunity. Booz Allen had been in the government contracting business for a long, long time, meaning it was basically like buying a high yield bond with the US government as your counterparty. As federal dollars flowed from the Global War on Terror, Carlyle forked up about $1.8 billion for the business. The acquisition price was considered a little rich at the time, but the savvy crew at Carlyle knew they were in for a windfall. They put up about $956 million in equity and $1.24 billion in debt that still sits on Booz Allen’s balance sheet. What was once a storied, reliable cash cow with very little debt (~$225 million debt pre-acquisition) soon became a highly levered testament to capitalism at its best, or maybe worst. Within months of closing the deal, Carlyle paid itself a special dividend of $114 million, followed a year later with a mammoth dividend of $497 million. Again, all financed with debt that still sits like an albatross around Booz Allen’s neck.By 2010, Carlyle was ready to take its little gift to the public with an IPO. Defense spending would continue to rise in perpetuity, or say they would say, and Booz Allen was the safest bet in the industry. Carlyle put lipstick on the pig by reframing the business as a “management consultant” and inflating its gross margins above 50%, considerably higher than anyone else in the industry. This is likely when the shenanigans started with Booz Allen’s “billable expenses.” Over the next six years, Carlyle sold off its stake in chunks, bringing its percentage ownership down from 58% in August 2013 to 0 in December 2016. The total proceeds from these sales was >$2.5 billion, bringing the total haul for Carlyle to more than $3 billion, excluding a steady stream of dividends over the years. It was a haul not often seen in the industry, rich even for Private Equity.In the end, Booz Allen was left with a substantial amount of debt on its balance sheet and what were likely the same accounting shenanigans that are now the target of its civil and criminal investigations. It all makes sense when you consider the perilous role of incentives. Ever since the 2008 acquisition, Booz Allen was been under pressure for a long, long time to produce a prodigious amount of cash for their corporate overlords at Carlyle. This kind of pressure distorts incentives and results in bad behaviors. Those behaviors are now catching up with Booz, even though Carlyle is long gone from the equation.Booz Allen’s business model always a little shady - a glorified HR firm, saddling the government with bodies and billing itself as a “management consultant” - but its central role in some of the largest leaks of classified government secrets in the history of the Republic is a little over the top.Booz Allen of 2018 is like Arthur Andersen circa 2002. This level of breach of trust harkens back to the downfall of Arthur Andersen. Much like Booz, Arthur Andersen prided itself on its long history with clients, its people, and its ability to win the confidence of clients. Like Booz, its “product” was its people. Once those people displayed such grievous ineptitude in its auditing of Enron, the firm was caput, almost overnight. Founded in 1913 and with nearly $9.3 billion in revenue, Arthur Andersen filed for bankruptcy in 2002. (Curious side note: Booz Allen was founded one year after Arthur Andersen in 1914; their fates, it seems, are forever linked.)  Arthur Andersen lost the trust of its clients and it was done. What was once the “Big Five” accounting firms was down to the “Big Four.” What’s more, everyone praised the downfall. It ensured accountability, restored trust to the system, and returned balance to the universe. It needed to happen.It then begs the question – how has Booz Allen been able to circumvent the same fate for so long? There’s no disputing the fact that Booz Allen’s employees are responsible for the greatest leak of government secrets in the history of the US republic. Nevertheless, Booz Allen has somehow come out as the Teflon Don. Since it revealed Edward Snowden was indeed a Booz Allen employee on June 9, 2013, its stock has increased 122% through 2018. The stock fell a meager 5% the day after and then returned its upward movement. Same thing with the revelation of Hal Martin and the inadvertent leak of 60k documents on the Amazon server – a small drop followed by continued upward movement. After the Snowden leak, Booz Allen executives even had the nerve to claim their government customers were “supportive” of the firm. Supportive? This is the LARGEST and most damaging leak of government secrets in the history of the United States. Largest…in…the…history. Ask anyone in the government, anyone close to the intelligence community, and they’ll tell you they’re furious at Booz Allen.Author's creation overlaying key Booz Allen scandals and investigations since 2013 with the stock price.What’s more, it seems as though its getting worse. You’d think the Snowden fiasco would lead to a broad rethink of the way Booz Allen does business. It did not. In October 2016, Booz Allen employee Hal Martin was arrested for stealing more than 50 Terabytes of data from the NSA (1 TB = 1000000000000 bytes). In May 2017, a lead senior engineer at Booz working on a classified contracts with the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NYSE:NGA) left more than 60,000 files on a publicly accessible Amazon server, including passwords to a US government system containing sensitive information.The Booz Allen name is forever tarnished. Don’t take my word for it, take a look for yourself. According to a November 2017 interview (four years after the leak), the National Security Agency Deputy Director George Barnes said “It should be pretty obvious to everyone that what Snowden did was a jolt to our system. Not only did he endanger what we’ve spent years developing, but he endangered the lives of the people we try to protect.” Former NSA head Michael Hayden was even more blunt – “The catastrophe in this case is that you lost so many targets in such a compressed period of time.” So let me get this straight - Booz Allen, trusted confidant of the US government’s most sensitive secrets, has an employee that compromises the government’s crown jewels to the extent that the NSA is still reeling from the impact four years after, and we’re supposed to believe that this will NOT impact their contracts with the government? If you buy that, I’ve got some ocean front property to sell…in Arizona.Booz Allen wiped its hands of the entire situation, claiming it’s a government clearance process that’s the problem, not the fact that Booz Allen hired, paid, and badged Snowden as a full-time employee. Let’s be clear – this is the equivalent of Arthur Andersen coming out the day after the Enron scandal and saying, “Yes, it’s our employees responsible for criminal behavior, but you let them in the building, gave them access to sensitive information, and allowed this to happen, so it’s actually your fault.” Can you imagine if Andersen even tried to point the finger back at Enron? What’s almost shocking is that Booz Allen almost got away with this. Government contracts are long-lived, usually on five-year government vehicles, making it costly and disruptive for the government to dislodge incumbents. But here we are four years on from the Snowden revelation, not to mention two other serious security breaches, and, surprise, surprise, the Department of Justice (read ) launches a civil and criminal investigation of Booz Allen, followed by a SEC investigation. Coincidence? I think not. As they say, “the wheels of justice turn slowly, but grind exceedingly fine.” It took the government a decade to kill Usama Bin Laden after bringing down the World Trade Center, but kill him they did. Booz Allen’s day of reckoning is upon us.According to an analysis of Federal Contracts data from USASpending.gov, in 2008, the Department of Defense accounted for 67% of all Booz Allen contracts. By 2017, this was down to 45%, a loss of nearly $1 billion. This is further supported by Booz Allen’s breakdown of revenue by segment. In Fiscal Year 2014, the same year the Edward Snowden scandal broke, Booz Allen’s intelligence segment peaked at 26% of all revenue, but by 2017 this was down to 23%. Booz has attempted to replace this revenue with other segments, with a notable increase in business with the General Services Administration, but its clear Booz Allen’s once juicy DOD business has taken a massive hit that won’t soon recover.According to Booz Allen’s 10-K, “We compete based on our technical expertise and client knowledge, our ability to successfully recruit appropriately skilled and experienced talent, our ability to deliver cost-effective multifaceted services in a timely manner, our reputation and relationship with our clients, our past performance, security clearances, and the size and scale of our company.” Would you think employing the most damaging spies in the history of the US government qualify as compromising their competitive position? I would think so.The Trump administration came into office with a substantially different view of government spending. Anything except defense spending its on the decline, with heads of various government agencies tripping over one another to reduce their budgets and one blue-ribbon government reform commission after another promising to “reinvent” government spending. This all suggests everything except defense spending is headed for a secular decline for the near future. Based on the decline in DOD and intelligence contracts referenced earlier, not only Booz Allen has compromised its position with its DOD and intelligence customers, but the company also been working against a tide of declining spending, broadly, and declining services spending, specifically, for years. Booz Allen has been able to “smooth” its earnings stream for quite some time (the lofty assumptions baked in contract backlog has been an issue for years), but this is finally catching up with them.According to a March 2017 GAO report “Assessment of Government-wide Trends” (GAO-17-244SP), GAO’s analysis of government-wide contracting data found that defense obligations to buy products and services decreased by almost 31 percent from fiscal year 2011 through 2015, from $399 billion to $274 billion.Sources: Defense spending data pulled from Federal Reserve FRED Database. Defense Contract Spending derived from CSIS study ""U.S. Department of Defense Contract Spending and the Industrial Base"". Booz Allen Revenue pulled from BAH Annual reports and IPO prospectus.Source: GAO Analysis of Federal Procurement Data System - Next GenerationThe Trump administration has focused on strong defense as a core aspect of its platform and announced a 12% increase in FY18 Defense spending. The increase isn’t going where you think. Under Secretary of Defense James Mattis, the DOD has embarked on a broad rethink of how it spends money with a focus on increasing lethality of the force.In a October 5, 2017 letter outlining his main lines of effort, Mattis described his third line of effort as bringing “business reforms to DOD.” Specifically, “this line of effort instills budget discipline and effective resource management, develops a culture of rapid and meaningful innovation, streamlines requirements and acquisition processes, and promotes responsible risk taking and personal initiative.” Now stop and think for a second - do you think this includes a glorified HR firm like Booz Allen proposing the same government and military personnel back to the Department as contractors at an inflated price? I think not.Even worse for Booz Allen, spending will go towards companies that produce innovative products, not glorified HR firms like Booz providing services. During a August 2017 visit to Silicon Valley, SecDef Mattis applauded the efforts of organizations like the Defense Innovation Experimental Unit (DIUX) that awards contracts directly to innovative start-ups, circumventing entirely archaic HR firms like Booz Allen. Mattis pointed out that he sees “many of the greatest advances out here on the West Coast in private industry.”SpaceX, the rocket firm founded by entrepreneur Elon Musk, started with absolutely nothing - no contracts, no guidance, no inside track with retired General officers or former heads of government agencies. They only had their gumption, passion, private capital, and a vision to disrupt the space industry. After only a few years, they’re now stealing contracts from the venerable United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Even more intriguing, SpaceX is doing this all cheaper and better than their competition. According to a June 2017 analysis by Ars Technica, an online science journal SpaceX costs the government ~$83 million per launch versus ULA’s $422 million. Let me put this another way - a start-up is disrupting the largest, most entrenched defense contractors that are getting away with charging the government 500% more for the same service. This is the penultimate David v Goliath and exactly what SecDef Mattis and everyone else in the Department of Defense refers to when they’re saying they want to leverage the expertise of Silicon Valley.Booz Allen doesn’t even begin to compute in this equation. They’re like a goofy, drunk, overweight version of Goliath that has been getting away with contracting murder for decades. Now the check is coming due with a DOJ/SEC investigation and a string of security breaches.. They won’t last for much longer.So how do we value a company like Booz Allen? Its a company under civil and criminal investigation, misled Wall Street about its business model, inflated its gross margins, played a central role in the greatest leaks of government secrets in the history of the United States, and operating in an industry in a state of either secular decline or with customers fleeing Booz Allen like the last, poor, miserable souls on the Titanic. The unknowns inherent in this valuation could confound even the best of prognosticators, so let’s just try to keep this bounded with some sense of logic.Here’s what Booz Allen currently looks like. Its been a cash cow for a long time, trading at inflated multiples based on the expectation of increased defense spending. Again, let’s try not to focus on the unknowns here, but logic suggests that all the variables outlined in this write-up will eventually spell doom for Booz Allen’s revenue, margins, and subsequently, the multiple that Wall Street assigns to the company. There’s too much uncertainty around the company for this not to be the case. With that said, let’s bound the discussion of our valuation around three cases - base, bull (short), and bear (short). The main theme for each scenario is simple - reversion to the mean. There's too many unknowns out there regarding Booz Allen's future, so let's simply agree that their numbers will more than likely simply revert to the industry mean.The base case is, in my calculation, overly generous and still implies a 24% decline in the stock price. The base case assumes that the company’s revenue, profit margins, billable expenses, indirect costs, everything stays the same with no impact from its investigations, Snowden effect, or anything else. Highly unlikely in my mind, but let’s go with it. The only thing that changes in the base case is the EV/FCF multiple comes down to reality in-line with its peers. The SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF includes 35 defense contracting companies, not just glorified HR firms like Booz Allen, but a wide variety of firms selling to the government. The ETF trades at an average of 18.5 Enterprise Value (EV) to Free Cash Flow. Using this valuation metric is more suited for defense contractors instead of using price to earnings so we can avoid all the potential pitfalls of using GAAP earnings. The EV/FCF metric is a better predictor of share performance, so let’s keep this simple and say that Booz Allen simply stops trading like a high-tech growth company and more like its peers. Same numbers, same everything, better valuation, and this brings the stock price down to $30.32, a 24% decline.The bear short case again assumes that the company’s revenue stays the same, but I think we can safely assume that the SEC investigation brings its financial reporting practices back in-line with its peers with CACI and Mantech. This would mean its gross margins come down to 23.4% simply because we’re not segmenting out operating expenses and bring this back in-line with industry practices. We can further assume that its EBIT margin comes back down to early because it is no longer able to get away with billing the government for “indirect costs” that are actually internal Booz costs. This would mean its EBIT margin comes back in line with CACI and Mantech at 7%, down from its current 8.34%. Nothing too substantial, just back in-line with industry peers. In terms of multiple, we’re going to be generous and assume the EV/FCF multiple stays at its current 22.8 so the company continues to trade like a high growth tech stock. Unlikely, but let’s see what happens. This gives us a per-share value of $27.56, a 31% decline.The bull short case makes the same assumptions as the bear case - same revenue, bringing margins back in-line with peers - and takes it one, logical step further. Let’s assume that the EV/FCF valuation also comes back to earth with peers at 18.5 instead of 22.8. Look what happens here - a 49% decline in stock price down to $20.45 per share.These scenarios all paint to one, very conclusive picture - Booz Allen is on its way down. Based on all the unknowns in the case of Booz Allen, I think the most likely scenario is the business starts to suffer substantially from the investigations, realignment of margins, and multiple compression bringing the company back down to earth. This points to an even more substantial decline in the stock, well below the $20.45 in the bull short case and a greater than 50% decline. The trickier part is going to be how the company survives if its business model is inherently broken, its customers hate it, and all the while it still has to service that debt load from its Carlyle days.Any way you look at, Booz Allen is facing a vast amount of uncertainty ahead and warrants a substantial revision to the downside. Best of luck being Boozie — you’ll need it."
4352328,105703,2020-06-06T11:35:00-04:00,"Booz Allen Hamilton operates a wide moat business with entrenched relationships in the defense and intelligence sectors of government.The company has a strong track record of market-beating returns that I expect will continue for many years ahead.Latest quarterly and annual results give me confidence in the strategy going forward.The current valuation presents a compelling ""growth at a reasonable price"" opportunity.","Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) is a premier public and private consultancy firm that has weathered the pandemic better than most other companies. Over the past three months, its share price performance has trailed only that of stay-at-home plays like technology giant Microsoft (MSFT) and bleach-maker Clorox (CLX). While shares are not exactly cheap, I don’t believe they are expensive, either, given the company’s strong track record of rewarding investors. At the current price, I believe investors can get strong growth at a reasonable price, resulting in market-beating returns over the next 5-10 years.Booz Allen Hamilton is one of the largest a global consultancy firms with over 27,000 employees. It has a mix of both public and private sector clients operating in, among others, civil government, defense, intelligence, energy, financial services. Over its 100 year-plus history, Booz Allen Hamilton has consulted on high profile projects such as helping to transform the Navy during World War II from an antiquated organization into a more effective one with less red tape, replacing old chains of command with new management units that worked together. Other high profile projects in its history include organizational and budgeting work for NASA since its founding and participating in the Chrysler turnaround during what was the first big auto bailout in the 1970s.Source: BizjournalsHere’s a snapshot of their key client industries, with 96% of revenue coming from the recession-resistant government sector, and 69% coming from the combined mission critical defense and intelligence sectors.Source: Company WebsiteBooz Allen has solidly outperformed the market in both the near term and over the past decade. What I like about the company is that it has sticky relationships with its clients with stable, contracted revenue. In addition, many of its employees are required to undergo rigorous background checks and gain security clearance before they can work on sensitive government engagements. This provides Booz Allen with somewhat of a moat in that its government clients cannot easily switch consultancy firms due to the institutional knowledge and expertise that the company has built up over many years.As seen below, shares have far outpaced the market by 17% over the trailing six-month period.Source: Yahoo FinanceBooz Allen’s total return over the past decade as thumped that of the S&P 500. With dividends reinvested, shares have returned a whopping 26.5% CAGR and an 844% total return since 2010. These are high growth tech company-like returns with the added benefit of recurring and sticky contractual revenue from the government.Source: Dividend ChannelBooz Allen delivered a solid 2020 with revenue excluding billable expenses increasing 9.9% YoY to $5.2 billion. What’s even better was that its adjusted net income grew at a faster clip at 13.6% YoY, suggesting that improved cost management initiatives bore fruit. Adjusted diluted EPS (ADEPS) grew an impressive 15% YoY to 3.18 per share, incrementally driven by share repurchases and by $38 million in R&D credits resulting in a lower tax rate.The company has achieved an astounding cumulative 66% ADEPS growth over the last three years, far outpacing the 50% growth goal set by management in 2019. I’m also encouraged by management issuing strong guidance for 2021 with a midpoint of 3.50 ADEPS, representing a solid 10% YoY growth.Source: Company WebsiteThe company’s backlog of projects is healthy at $20.7 billion with a 7% YoY growth, representing the company’s highest ever at fiscal year-end. I’m also encouraged by the increased win-rates in 2020 and that COVID-19 has had immaterial impact on the business. Here’s what the CFO Lloyd Howell had to say on the conference call:Source: Q4’20 Investor PresentationThe company was active on the share repurchase front, especially during Q4 with the depressed share price. Out of the total $182 million spent on share repurchases in fiscal year 2020, the bulk of it ($156 million, or 85% of total) was spent in Q4 at the attractive average price of $69 per share. The company also boosted dividends at a fast clip, with increases in both Q3 and Q4. Since the start of the fiscal year, the dividend has been increased by 35% to 0.31 per share. The dividend also appears safe and set to continue growing at just a 35% payout ratio based on $147 million in dividends paid in 2020 and free cash flow of $423 million.Source: Q4’20 Investor PresentationMost adults can probably recall the high profile case of the Edward Snowden leak back in 2013. Edward was an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton at the time, and the case undoubtedly caused reputational damage for the firm. The firm has recovered nicely since then. Although this was a rare occurrence, it’s something that investors should be mindful of as the firm deals with sensitive information that can cause material damage to its government clients if leaked.In addition, with nearly 50% of the firm’s book business devoted to the defense industry, cuts in defense spending can materially impact the firm’s growth prospects. I don’t see material cuts in the near future as global tensions are a perennial factor that I don’t see easing anytime soon.Booz Allen Hamilton has a storied history and plays a mission critical role for its government clients from having accumulated a wealth of knowledge and expertise over many years. It has a recession-resistant business model and a strong track record of shareholder returns that have far outpaced the market. I see the strong growth trend continuing for many years ahead as government relies more on private contractors and less on full-time staff. Lastly, I believe BAH is one of those stocks that you can buy in a well-diversified portfolio, and set on stress free autopilot as it compounds annual returns.I see shares as somewhat undervalued at the price of 79.17 and a PE of 22.30 as of writing. For a growth stock with a history of strong shareholder returns, I have a buy rating with a price target of $88 with a forward PE of nearly 25, representing a one year return of 12% including dividends."

        Concerns over the impact of US government budget cuts are overblown and much of the financial impact for BAH has already been realized.
        I believe the firm is of outstanding quality for a variety of reasons, including its durable competitive advantages from security clearances, longstanding client relationships, etc.
        Stock seems significantly discounted under 15x adjusted EPS and closer to 10x FCF.
        $1 special dividend should bolster stock over next month.","Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) is currently highly-ranked by Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula, which uses EBIT/EV and ROIC to systematically identify above-average businesses at below-average prices. My research has largely confirmed that BAH fits this description, and for that I am recommending the purchase of the company's common stock.Background2014 marks BAH's 100th year in business. In 1914, Edwin Booz opened a 'business engineering services' firm with the idea of tailoring his consulting work to fit unique client needs. Many consider Booz to have pioneered the management consulting industry. Since then, the company has seen consistent growth for most of its long history (see chart: goo.gl/97vi0Z) and become one of the most respected management and IT consulting firms in the world, particularly in its niche of public sector consulting in the US. In 2008, the firm split its private and public sector businesses, partly to avoid conflicts of interest and partly to create value after Carlyle acquired the firm, into Booz & Company (private sector) and Booz Allen Hamilton (public sector). In November 2010, BAH went public and Carlyle began reducing its position in the company, which it has continued doing recently (current ownership interest 45.8%). In 2011, BAH's non-competition agreement expired and the firm entered the private sector. In the last few months, much of the company's executive management team has turned over with many retirements following the navigation of the company through a tough FY14 that included a 16 day government shutdown in October - the third longest in US history, $30B in reduced federal funding to the Department of Defense (source of ~50% of BAH's revenue), the Edward Snowden/NSA debacle last June-July, and an unusually harsh winter.Business QualityBusiness quality is an ambiguous phrase but by my interpretation, BAH scores highly. The firm earns excellent returns on capital (see graphic: http://goo.gl/WvDQwa) and increasingly so with improvement from 28% pre-tax in FY11 to 46% pre-tax in FY14. This is largely enabled by the company leasing all of its real estate and being positioned in a labor-intensive industry in consulting. The consulting industry seems highly-conducive to business quality. Firms sell an intangible product that can easily and often does add far more value to clients than the cost to the firm. Competition exists, but companies don't compete intensely on price, and pricing is typically very rational. Brands are meaningful and differentiation is relatively easily achieved. Various industry growth drivers exist:BAH also has durable competitive advantages through:Though FY15 should be another rough year with a projected mid-single digit decline in both revenue and adjusted earnings and total backlog down 15% at FYE14, the backlog decline is overstated because the company is completing projects 10% faster now than in FY13 (so turnover is higher and backlog is lower) and the company has grown revenue remarkably consistently over long periods of time at 7-13%. $64B of sequestration spending cuts hurt the company in FY14 and are part of the reason for the rough FY15 expectations. Based on the $1.2T of mandated federal spending cuts from 2013-2021 or $133B per year, the magnitude of the annual budget cuts should expand to 208% or more of what has already been experienced. I expect the full extent of the budget cut-related pains to be experienced this year and next, after which a return to the historical growth rates is very reasonable. Two sad truths:It's even worse to admit that this unfortunate status quo will remain, but I think that's the case and BAH should continue to reap the benefits as it has for 100 years. Despite the century of growth, BAH still has a very long growth runway. The company estimates that $101B was spent by the US government in fiscal 2013 for management and technology consulting services. LTM revenue only amounts to 5.4% of that. The company recently re-entered the commercial and international markets following the expiration of its non-competition agreement. Commercial/International contributed $141.8 million or 2.6% to revenue in FY14, up from $116.9 million / 2.1% in FY13. 3% or roughly $156M was mentioned in the most recent conference call for FY15 and there is no reason non-US government business cannot drive firm growth and begin to contribute significantly to the business' performance. I also believe there is a long runway for further margin improvement even after the improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin from 6.3% in FY08 to 9.7% in FY14. For one, this is a very low base, especially for a consulting business. Second, public sector work in the US is typically lower margin than commercial and international work and as commercial/international continues to increase as a percentage of total sales, margins should benefit. Third, a continued shift to fixed-price contracts will benefit margins. Contracts the company enters into are either structured as cost-reimbursable, time-and-materials, or fixed-price, with time-and-materials more profitable than cost-reimbursable, and fixed-price generally being the highest margin (albeit with some incremental risk; think leverage). Right now, BAH's revenue mix is skewed toward the low-risk, low-margin end of the spectrum with 55% of revenue from cost-reimbursable contracts and only 17% from fixed-price. 2 years ago, the mix was even more skewed (see table: goo.gl/bVJZMm). The trend is toward fixed-price though as bureaucrats have begun to favor this for some reason or another, and BAH management expects this to continue. This has driven margins up in the past and should continue to in the future.ValuationI prefer not to use financial models as I feel they can become a tool of confirmation bias. If something is obviously cheap enough to be worth buying, a model is unnecessary anyway. At fair value, I would expect a business with excellent qualitative characteristics, a long growth and margin runway, a long history of 7-13% growth, a 2.1% dividend yield, and 46.5% pre-tax ROIC to trade somewhere in the range of 14-18x the greater/more accurate of EPS and FCF. At $22.5/share, BAH currently trades at:The company consistently converts much greater than 100% of net income to FCF. Over the last 5 fiscal years, FCF has averaged 182% of net income. With that, I tend to give more weight to FCF and at 10x FCF, the stock looks cheap regardless of whether the true fair multiple of the firm is 14x or 18x.CounterargumentsThere are a few bearish arguments I am anticipating and would like to address and refute where appropriate. Hopefully, to the extent that my counters fail to quell concerns about the company, the risks of an investment in BAH will become apparent. There are, admittedly, a few meaningful ones.Argument A: Price cuts and margin contraction are imminent as the US government realizes how dependent BAH is on its business and tries to get a better deal as budget cuts force bureaucrats to look for fat to cut out.Counter: It is not as if the US government represents itself in negotiations with BAH as one party. BAH does works for a great many, in fact, most government agencies and divisions and negotiates individually with these parties. FY14 revenue came from over 5300 separate contracts and many more task orders and ""No single task order under any contract represented more than 2.3% of our revenue in fiscal 2014, 2013, or 2012. No single contract accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2014, 2013, or 2012.""Argument B: A massive revenue decline is imminent as government spending is curtailed voluntarily or involuntarily with the mandated budget cuts.Counter: Argument B holds more weight as we have already seen the sequester in action and further budget cuts are inevitable, however, political views aside, I would not characterize current government spending as inflated - the US has always spent a lot of money relative to other countries, particularly on defense where BAH derives 50% of its revenue. I also think areas like entitlements and the purchase of outdated weapons and vehicles (surprisingly and painfully common) will be cut out more than consulting services considering the very evident inefficiency of our bureaucracy, the increasing importance of cyber protection, data analytics, etc. A large chunk of cuts have already been seen ($64B) and BAH's revenue was only down 4.9% and despite that operating income actually improved. I don't think the budget cuts should be belittled as it is probably the most significant risk and I understand that it introduces a great deal of uncertainty, but I just don't think the world is going to fall apart.Argument C: The management turnover (CEO/Chairman, CFO, Vice Chairman, and 2 senior partners) changes the circumstances dramatically and makes a historical analysis moot.Counter: There has indeed been a lot of transition of late, but I don't think it is particularly surprising. Shrader is 69 and his replacement, Rozanski, was paid a very comparable amount last year. Rozanski has been with the company for 20 years. He seemed competent and engaged in his answers in the company's Q4 conference call. Also, many of the elements of the long BAH thesis are not contingent on management. For example, the consulting industry will be excellent and conducive to differentiation and excess returns on capital whether Rozanski or Shrader is leading BAH.Argument D: A repeat of the Edward Snowden/NSA debacle of last year and the hacking of 2011 could put BAH's relationship with the US government in jeopardy. The firm aids the US government in violating the rights to privacy of its citizens and it would be unethical to support such deeds by purchasing stock in the company.Counter: Black swan events are always possible, but I would hope the company has since taken measures to prevent these sorts of damaging events. Snowden was employed by the company for less than 3 months, the firm fired him immediately, and the company was cleared of fault in hiring and handling him. All things considered, it was handled well. With the 2011 hacking, the firm was not hurt in a material way financially either. The firm's reputation inevitably took a hit in both cases, but other than that the damage was rather limited. As far as the ethical implications of an investment in BAH, I generally disregard my ethical views in investing. It is challenging enough without additional restrictions.Argument E: The company is not creditworthy and so it is not worth my time as an equity investor below creditors on the food chain.Counter: The company does indeed have a Ba3 rating from Moody's, 3 notches off the investment grade cutoff, and this argument can often be reasonable, but in this case the poor credit rating is not due to BAH generating insufficient, unpredictable cash. The firm is quite profitable. I think creditor concern is more related to worry of more special dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases, etc. - uses of cash that benefit equity holders but hurt creditors. The company has paid out a total of $10/share in special dividends in FY13-14 (48% of current stock price), and with Carlyle still holding a very significant interest in the company and a reputation, like most PE firms, for pushing for special dividends as a way to extract value independent of the market, creditor concern regarding a dividend or similar action is quite justified. The concern is unjustified for owners though. As far as whether the company is actually creditworthy and a safe investment, I believe so. 57% of the debt is due >5 years out and the firm is quite profitable. Net debt/EBITDA is 2.63 which is not outrageous, though a bit higher than I'd like to see. I'd prefer to see less financial leverage and more operating leverage via the previously mentioned shift from cost-reimbursable contracts to fixed-price.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In Booz Allen's (NYSE:BAH) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $21 per share, about in line with where it is currently trading. Let's take a look at how we derive this fair value estimate and also talk a little bit about the importance of investors having a fair value range -- also called a margin of safety.But first, a little background about our research firm to help with the content of this article. We think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Essentially, we're looking for firms that overlap investment methodologies, thereby revealing the greatest interest by investors (we like firms that fall in the center of the diagram below):At the core, if a company is undervalued both on a discounted cash-flow basis and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Booz Allen posts a Valuentum Buying Index score of 6, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm, its neutral relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. For relative value purposes, we compare Booz Allen to peers Corrections Corp. (NYSE:CXW), CRA Intl (NASDAQ:CRAI), and FTI Consulting (NYSE:FCN). Let's dig into the report.Our Report on Booz AllenInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsBusiness QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Booz Allen's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 40.7%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.3%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Booz Allen's free cash flow margin has averaged about 6.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Booz Allen, cash flow from operations increased about 62% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 63% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Booz Allen's shares are worth between $16-$26 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $21 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 11.5 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 8.1 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 0.6% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 1%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 7.6%, which is above Booz Allen's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.4% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Booz Allen, we use a 9.3% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $21 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Booz Allen. We think the firm is attractive below $16 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $26 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Booz Allen's fair value at this point in time to be about $21 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Booz Allen's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $27 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $21 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Even in the case of a near perfect peer, rival or business model, there are still myriad potential pitfalls of using any relative valuation approach, which is why our research and analytical work is grounded instead (or in addition to) in discounted cash-flow analysis and a firm-specific fair value estimate based on the intrinsic qualities of the actual firm being valued.Many investors may feel that multiple analysis or relative value analysis is the only way to view equity valuation. It's possible that a lot of investors may not know the benefits of the DCF above any other valuation process. The DCF focuses on the intrinsic qualities of the firm to arrive at a firm-specific fair value. Using a variety of different valuation approaches, including relative valuation, remains the cornerstone of the Valuentum process, but with any relative valuation assumption, the very idea of comparing it to another firm will always be imperfect (no two firms are ever the same). Before reading this article on Booz, let's talk about this topic a little more and then come back.Select hereBooz Allen Investment ThesisBooz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) provides management and technology consulting and engineering services around the globe. The firm reported a strong quarter in the first quarter of its fiscal 2017 (ends March 2017). Both revenue and net income advanced more than 5% on a year-over-year basis in the period as the company continues to benefit from technology changing and developing faster than any other point in time. Most importantly, Booz Allen Hamilton's backlog leapt nearly 30% from the year-ago period to $12 billion, offering visibility into its future performance.A fundamental driver of Booz Allen Hamilton's success is its strategic partnerships and alliances, which help it deliver the most technologically-advanced solutions and serve as a translator of cutting edge technology to clients. We like its combination of consulting expertise, domain knowledge, and technical capabilities, all of which are differentiating factors. The firm's first quarter report evidenced that it is on track for sustainable growth.Looking ahead to the rest of fiscal 2017, Booz Allen Hamilton has prioritized the improvement of organic growth while executing with agility and efficiency. The operationalization of its past investments in advanced capabilities and talents will aid in such an initiative. Management is expecting revenue to be 2%-5% higher than fiscal 2016 in the year, while adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance comes in a range of $1.65-$1.75.Booz Allen's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Booz Allen is a provider of management and technology consulting services. The firm's largest client is the US Army. Examples of its work includes rapid prototyping of equipment to protect soldiers on the battlefield and the design of wireless military communications.• Backlog trends appear to be turning in the right direction. At the end of fiscal 2016, Booz Allen's total backlog totaled $11.8 billion, compared to $9.4 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. The driver was a ~45% jump in priced options backlog. The duration and timing of newly awarded contracts can adversely impact reported backlog.• Management is expecting revenue growth in the low to-mid single digits for fiscal 2017 thanks in part to backlog growth, which has been pushed higher by increased investments in bid and proposal activity as the government contracting environment stabilizes. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $1.65-$1.75.• The company's book-to-bill has been volatile. For example, In the second quarter of fiscal 2016 it reached 3.49, compared to 0.92 in the previous quarter. The full year measure came in at a six-year high of 1.45x.Economic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital.The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Booz Allen's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 64.8%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Understanding the Risk Free Rate and the Cost of DebtQ: Can you explain why you use the risk-free rate you use in your valuation model? Why do you use a risk free rate assumption of 4.25% when the current spot rate of the 10-year Treasury is about 2%?A: In our discounted cash-flow models that we use to value every non-financial operating company in our coverage universe, we match the duration of future free cash flows (from year 1 to perpetuity) with expectations of the average discount rate over this forecast horizon (from year 1 to perpetuity). We think the best way to achieve expectations of the long-term future average rate of the 10-year Treasury (risk free rate) is to use the weighted average of the historical 10-year Treasury and the current spot rate.The goal of using a weighted average risk free rate in our DCF process is to achieve balance with respect to the duration of future cash flows. For example, discounting a cash flow in Year 20 at the current spot rate doesn't make much sense to us. Other methods consider the yield curve in discounting future free cash flows, or use a long-term average of the risk free rate without considering near-term changes in the 10-year Treasury rate. We think the use of the spot rate on the 10-year Treasury as the risk free rate in any valuation model would not only cause significant fair-value volatility but also result in a systematic overvaluation of companies relative to their true long-term intrinsic worth.Source: Valuentum SecuritiesQ: Can you explain how you arrived at the after-tax cot of debt?A: The credit spread is added to the risk free rate assumption in arriving at a company's pre-tax cost of debt. In the same light as to the rationale deriving the long-term risk-free-rate assumption, we use a fundamental assessment of credit quality to derive our own estimate of a company's credit spread, not a spot representation or recent debt issuance spreads (as might be found in an SEC filing, for example). We call our derivation the ""synthetic credit spread.""In situations as in the current credit markets, which may underestimate a firm's true cost of borrowing in the financial valuation context, we feel a synthetic credit spread is more appropriate in matching a long-term estimate of the cost of borrowing with our forecast duration, which expands through 20 years and beyond. The pre-tax cost of debt is tax-effected to capture the interest tax shield that corresponds to the application of an enterprise free cash flow model applying earnings before interest, after taxes.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Booz Allen's free cash flow margin has averaged about 4.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Booz Allen, cash flow from operations decreased about 25% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 219% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think Booz Allen is worth $25 per share with a fair value range of $20-$30.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 3.7% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3- year historical compound annual growth rate of -0.4%.Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 8.3%, which is below Booz Allen's trailing 3- year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.1% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Booz Allen, we use a 10% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows, which is based on the firm's capital structure being split by ~73.5% equity and ~26.5% debt along with a cost of equity assumption of 10.8% and an after-tax cost of debt assumption of 7.5%.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $25 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Booz Allen. We think the firm is attractive below $20 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $30 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Booz Allen's fair value at this point in time to be about $25 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Booz Allen's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $32 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $25 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

1815732,34421,2013-11-07T07:21:30-05:00,,"One year after paying a $7.50 per share dividend, Booz Allen Hamilton Holdings (NYSE:BAH) still looks cheap. The risks facing the company have increased, given the uncertainties still surrounding the federal debt and deficit and the sequester, but they appear to be manageable.BAH reported fiscal 2014 second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.45 per share, compared with $0.27 last year. Excluding certain items, such as amortization of intangible assets and debt issuance costs, the company earned $0.47 per share, up 20.5% from $0.39 last year. Consensus estimates were $0.37 per share.The increase in earnings came despite a small decline in revenues. Second quarter revenues were $1.38 billion, compared with $1.39 billion last year. This year's revenues benefited from the November 2012 acquisition of ARINC's Defense Systems Engineering & Support Division, which generated $68.2 million of revenues. Excluding this acquisition, revenues declined 5.6%.The company was able to offset the decline in revenues through its continued focus on improving operating efficiency. Management has been striving to reduce indirect and overhead costs and maximize billable hours. It has reduced total headcount by 3.3% this year. Consulting staff, which accounts for 90% of total headcount, has been cut by 2.9%; administrative and support staff by 7.2%. Management has also been reducing fixed costs and operating capacity wherever possible, for example, by vacating office space as leases expire.The success of these efforts to date is evident in second quarter operating costs. Direct costs (mostly consulting labor) and billable expenses were flat as a percent of sales (76.2% of revenues this quarter vs. 76.1% last year), but administrative costs declined 18.4% to $173.5 million or by 270 basis points to 12.6% of revenue. As a result, adjusted EBITDA surged 24.2% to $153.8 million.BAH's cash flow performance, however, was not nearly as good. Cash flow from operating activities declined from $315.7 million in last year's second quarter to only $65.7 million this quarter. (For the first six months of this fiscal year, CFOA was $139.6 million compared with $389.7 million.)Last year's second quarter cash flow was exceptionally strong, due to a concerted effort by the federal government to pay outstanding receivables (possibly to get more money into the hands of small businesses to boost the economy). The company collected $231 million from receivables in last year's second quarter.This year, the government was less forthcoming, probably because it was seeking to keep debt below the legal limit. The company collected only $25 million from receivables this quarter and ended the quarter with $968 million in receivables, up from $840 million last year. Days sales outstanding increased from 57 to 66.Despite the modest squeeze in operating cash flow, BAH has declared a special dividend of $1.00 per share in addition to its regular quarterly dividend of $0.10. Both dividends are payable to shareholders on November 29 to shareholders of record on November 11. (The stock began trading ex-dividend on November 6.) With these payments, the company will have paid out a total of $9.00 per share in special dividends and $0.65 in regular dividends in less than two years.For tax purposes, 35%-40% of the total dividends paid in fiscal 2013 were treated as return of capital. It appears that the bulk of the company's retained earnings have been paid out. This year's total dividend payments of $1.40 per share are below the $1.60 per share in anticipated earnings this fiscal year. As long as full year earnings for tax purposes are not below $1.40, all of this year's dividends will be treated as taxable income, but the actual tax treatment will not be known until the end of the fiscal year on March 31, 2014.The announcement of the latest special dividend raises the possibility that this might become an annual event. If BAH is able to sustain its recent historical performance, this is feasible. By my calculations, the company has generated an average of $263 million in free cash flow (defined as cash flow from operating activities minus cash flow from investing activities) over the past three fiscal years. This includes an expenditure of $158 million in fiscal 2013 for the ARINC acquisition (which averages out to about $53 million over the three-year period, according to my methodology). The regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on roughly 150 million outstanding shares currently costs the company about $60 million annually. That leaves $200 million in free cash flow that can be used for a variety of purposes, including a higher level of capex, acquisitions, debt reduction and special dividends. The company could also use some of its current cash position - $423 million at September 30 - to fund the current and possibly future special dividends.The company has labeled the planned $1.00 dividend as ""special,"" so it is not at this time willing to commit to making any of it ""regular."" On the other hand, management has said that it will look at all of the potential uses for the company's free cash flow going forward and could decide to pay another special dividend next year, if better opportunities do not arise.Still, its priority is to pursue growth through acquisitions - on the commercial side of the business and possibly outside the U.S. - to help augment and diversify its earnings and revenue base.Going forward, the key risk facing the company is the potential for Federal budget cuts that would directly affect existing and future BAH contracts. The sequester has taken a modest toll on BAH. Management currently sees no opportunity for ending the sequester before the end of the federal government's current fiscal year on March 31, 2014.As a result of the sequester and other budget cuts, the company's backlog at quarter's end was down 6.4% over last year. The funded backlog was down 8.4%, but the unfunded portion was down only 1%. The undiscounted value of potential follow-on projects, called priced options, was down 7.7%.Management says that the decline in the backlog reflects a concerted effort by its federal government clients in the current uncertain budget environment to reduce commitments to 12 months or less. In many cases, commitments for funding may extend out for only 6 months. So while the drop in the funded backlog is a concern, a meaningful portion of the unfunded backlog is typically converted into revenues each year. It makes sense, therefore, to look also at the funded and the unfunded backlogs together. On that basis, the backlog is down 5.1%.Of the three primary government sectors served by BAH, management says that the Defense business is robust and the Civil business is holding its own, but the Intelligence business is turbulent. In response to questions, management said that this turbulence relates to changes taking place among the various intelligence agencies, which are comparatively late in responding to budget pressures. Management does not believe that this turbulence is due to specific sanctions against it from the Edward Snowden affair.Last June, following Mr. Snowden's leaks, Bloomberg Businessweek highlighted the significant presence that BAH has in the U.S. intelligence infrastructure. At that time, some experts suggested that the NSA and other intelligence agencies might seek to reduce their exposure to outside contractors by bringing more of the work in house. That may be possible, but those agencies had spent a number of years increasing their use of contractors in order to gain access to specialized talent and to reduce fixed costs. Any change in policy will likely take time to implement. Tightened security policies should also help to eliminate future leaks.Furthermore, BAH typically participates in projects that are high priority (even mission critical) for its federal government clients. As a result, it was able to maintain client support at 90% of pre-shutdown levels during the October shutdown. This focus on critical projects should serve to cushion the company's near-term exposure to future budget cuts.For now, BAH says that it is doing well in a challenging environment. Although its profitability was up sharply in the first half of fiscal 2014, the second half will be more challenging, in part because of the costs that it incurred as a result of the October federal government shutdown, which are now estimated to be $0.02 per share.Consequently, management has left its original guidance for fiscal 2014 unchanged. It expects GAAP earnings of $1.47-$1.57 per share and Adjusted Earnings of $1.55-$1.65 per share. Full year revenues will, however, decline 3%-5%, slightly worse than previous guidance.At the 11/5 closing price of $17.60, the stock is trading at 11 times the midpoint of its fiscal 2014 earnings guidance. Consensus estimates currently anticipate that earnings will be flat in fiscal 2015.As noted, the primary downside risk for BAH investors is the potential fallout from big and sudden cuts in its business with the Federal government, including in its Intelligence business, which accounted for 23% of total fiscal 2013 revenues. BAH has so far been able to boost margins in a flat revenue environment by improving operating efficiency (i.e. maximizing billable hours and minimizing indirect or overhead costs.) Although it may be able to squeeze more profit out of the existing business (and therefore boost margins more), it should at least be able to hold margins constant, if revenues continue to decline.Even with no growth, the current level of earnings equates to an earnings yield of about 9%. This year's regular and special dividends translate into a dividend yield of nearly 8%. Excluding the special dividend, BAH's stock has a regular dividend yield of 2.3%. Since free cash flow approximates earnings, the company therefore has the ability to maintain a dividend yield between 2.3% and 9%, as long as it can sustain revenues. The potential for earnings growth through either acquisitions or a resolution to the Federal budget problems would raise the total return potential for the stock.Alternatively, the company may also decide to use some of that excess cash flow to reduce debt. Its total debt outstanding at September 30 was $1.67 billion, down $67 million from a year ago. Any reduction in debt would reduce leverage risk for BAH shareholders. For now, though, after reducing the floor on its credit facility by 0.75% recently and with interest rates still at very low levels, the company is content to use most of its surplus cash flow for other purposes, including paying the special dividend.Disclosure: I am long BAH.

1491582,41921,2013-06-10T12:34:45-04:00,,"Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) up until today was an under the radar management consulting firm with a solid track record as far as its financial performance. As of today, nothing about the financial performance from the past matters. This name now should be considered untouchable for the time being. Late last week, a whistleblower revealed secrets with regards to a sensitive US government program being operated that collected enormous amounts of data that everyday citizens most likely considered private. Phone calls, emails, internet search history, you name it, and if the allegations prove to be true, this information was not as secret as you would have believed before last week. Over the weekend, it was revealed that the source of the leaks was an employee of Booz Allen. The admission by this employee with regards to the amount of supposedly classified access he had information to is absolutely startling. The ability of a private citizen, working for a private agency contracted by the US government, to blow the lid off of an intelligence and information gathering program is game changing. The political angle of this is best served for another article. The fallout from the events of this weekend very easily could amount to a paradigm shift in how private companies are awarded future work by the US government. There will be a price to pay for this breach of security, and while the person responsible for stealing the information is the ultimate responsible party, it is next to impossible to imagine a scenario where the company that employed this person does not suffer greatly in some manner. Booz Allen is attempting to aggressively distance itself from this incident, and investors should wait for the dust to settle before thinking a sell-off in this stock presents a buying opportunity. When almost the entirety of your business is tied to US government work, it is hard to envision a scenario where anyone can predict what the fallout for the company might be.Why Booz Allen Is Now UntouchableBooz Allen is deeply ingrained in the business of providing services and expertise to the US government. Last year, the company earned over 98% of its total revenue from US government contracts across various different entities. For example, contracts with the US Army accounted for 16% of total revenue for the company last year. Work for US intelligence agencies accounted for over 20% of the total revenue for the company. If you spend 5 minutes reading the FY2013 10-K for Booz Allen, it feels like you see ""U.S. Government"" mentioned in almost every single paragraph. The revelations from this past weekend should put the entirety of that revenue stream in jeopardy for the future. You can argue that this was the work of a rogue employee, and that is certainly true. However, companies have internal controls and other safeguards in place for a reason. It is not as if the person who leaked this information was able to recite from memory every detail about the program. The leak involved removing classified information, such as a PowerPoint presentation, from some sort of secure government system. This is a failure of control on the part of Booz Allen.The implications of this revelation are wide ranging. Already, the pundits and talking heads alike are questioning how secure government information is in light of the significant increase of outsourcing work to private contractors. For better or worse, Booz Allen will now be the example used of the risks from outsourcing national security type work to private companies.I purposely am not telling you anything about the balance sheet, income statement, growth potential (before this weekend), or other pertinent facts about Booz Allen. The reason is that these items do not matter, for now, in light of the news from this past weekend. Investors should avoid Booz Allen until the fallout from this security breach is quantifiable.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2344295,43971,2014-07-25T16:30:26-04:00,"Competitive advantages associated with century-old brand and longstanding customer relationships.Consulting is an excellent industry involving a highly-intangible service, limited price competition and benefiting from value-based management and enterprise technology trends.The details above and BAH's excellent management make BAH an excellent business and I believe sustainably so.46.5% ROIC plus ~10% growth for some time plus excellent business quality deserving a premium plus 2.07% dividend yield, should not equal <10x EBIT, 13.7x EPS, and 14.4x FCF.Backlog decline, management transition and tough FY15 guidance present challenges that I believe are temporary and causing this phenomenon.","I was motivated to research Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) for two reasons. I recently looked at another IT-oriented consulting company, Accenture (NYSE:ACN), and I'm really quite bullish on the broad consulting industry (both management and IT consulting) for the next 10-20 years. I also noticed that many of the companies I've been interested in recently are highly ranked on Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula screener. I re-read his classic book, The Little Book That Still Beats The Market, and subsequently used the screener to find more quality businesses at reasonable prices. Booz Allen Hamilton popped up.BusinessBooz Allen Hamilton provides management consulting, technology and engineering services mainly to the US government (97% of revenue) in a variety of fields. The company was founded in 1914 by Edwin Booz, who is considered a pioneer of the management consulting industry, and the company enjoys the resulting brand and reputational benefits.I've looked at a variety of companies and industries thus far and at this point, consulting is one of my two favorites (the other is pharmacy benefit management in which 100% of my funds are currently parked in Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX)). What makes a good industry? I think there are a few major elements:I think consulting has many of these characteristics and IT-oriented consulting is even better, benefiting from the broad tech shift. There is a fitting excerpt from my Accenture article that very much translates to the BAH story, but it is about half the article and over a thousand words, so rather than quote it here, I'd encourage readers to read the ACN article in conjunction with this one. In short, BAH benefits from the continued rise of VBM, consulting being a highly intangible service that can easily add far more value to clients than cost to BAH, limited price competition in consulting, and the increasing popularity of analytics, SaaS, task automation and other buzzword tech trends driving enterprise consumption.I also believe BAH has a pretty strong competitive advantage through its long-standing and extensive relationship with the US government. Below are government agencies that BAH has worked for 15-plus years:Source: BAH FY14 10-KWith relationships lasting so long, I strongly suspect that BAH has a far better understanding of these clients' problems and strategies than competitors and ongoing solutions in place that require monitoring and updates, for which BAH is paid. 79% of FY14 revenue was derived from contracts of indefinite length/indefinite quantity. That sure sounds like recurring revenue and I would think a client would have to be quite comfortable with BAH to keep such loose contract terms. 75% of BAH's people seem to have the advanced understanding I mentioned:These relationships also provide BAH a great deal of credibility in trying to win business from other government clients where there seems to be a good deal of opportunity:With 71.9% of BAH's FY14 revenue or $3.9B coming from US government ""Civil"" and ""Defense"" clients, it seems the company has just 3.9% market share in that combined market. There also is opportunity in a continued push in commercial/international where the company entered following the expiration of a non-competition agreement 3 years ago. This currently only makes up 2.6% of the company's revenue but I don't see why that has to remain the case. Further, the recent data breach debacles seem to be a strong indicator that BAH and its competitors are more needed than ever.I also gather that BAH is well managed. Value Line calls the company ""deftly managed,"" the executive team is internally raised and seasoned, and another fitting excerpt from my ACN article:Earlier this month the company filed with the SEC announcing that long time CEO/Chairman Ralph Shrader will retire as CEO but continue as Chairman. He has been with the company for 40 years and is surely very important, but I don't think this is disastrous. His replacement, Horacio Rozanski, has been COO since 2011 and with the firm since 1992. Shrader is 69 and it seems like Rozanski has been groomed to take over and this was planned well in advance.Overall, I was very impressed by Booz Allen Hamilton's business model, business, industry and all other relevant qualitative details that I came across. At this point, this company is probably in the top 3-4 of those I've researched as far as business quality. I'd need to do more due diligence before pulling the trigger if I was to buy, but at this point I already feel very comfortable - comfortable enough to invest a significant portion (~33-50%) of my investment assets at the right price.ValuationCalculating ROIC as EBIT / (Total Assets - Goodwill - Current Liabilities + ST Debt), I got 46.5%. That's excellent. ROIC is the best measure of business quality in my view (and Joel Greenblatt's) and the result here confirms my qualitative conclusions above.BAH has hit a rough patch recently with backlog down 15% YOY and the lowest it has been in 4 years. The company also is guiding for a mid-single digit decline in both revenue and adjusted earnings. However, I'm not overly concerned. The company's long-term performance is fair and I feel that will resume over the next 5-10 years. From FY08-14:And from FY10-14:Analysts estimate 10% earnings growth over the next 5 years. The company also pays a dividend that amounts to a 2.07% yield. I believe what we have in BAH is:For that, I'd be willing to pay 17-20x EPS or FCF and yet the business trades at:I strongly suspect that the business is significantly discounted.ConclusionI believe Booz Allen Hamilton has significant competitive advantages (especially for a company of its size), a sustainable business model and returns on invested capital, and operates in a highly-attractive industry. The company's stock also seems significantly discounted by various metrics. The backlog, management transition and rough FY15 guidance present challenges, but I believe these are temporary in nature and the firm's stock will not remain discounted for long. Many of the articles I've written recently have ended with something to the effect of ""I like the business and the stock, but would like it better at (insert price) and will set a price alert there and monitor the stock before performing further due diligence."" That is not the case here and I want to make it clear to readers that I am still very much interested in this company and plan of performing more due diligence in the next week or two and releasing a more comprehensive piece and issuing a definitive recommendation.Disclosure: The author is long ESRX.

1587502,21523,2013-07-31T05:17:51-04:00,,"Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) is yet another entry from one of Magic Formula® Investing's (MFI) favorite industry sectors - defense and government contractors. The stock is up nearly 30% over the past 3 months, riding the defense bull market along with several fellow MFI stocks like Northrop Grumman (NOC) (up 21%), Lockheed Martin (LMT) (also 21%), and Exelis (XLS) (up an impressive 37%).The key questions are - does the defense market have the ammo to blast higher, and how is BAH positioned to benefit if so?Booz Allen has been in the government consulting game for a long time, since World War II. Today, 99% of revenues come from Uncle Sam. 55% of sales are to defense clients - the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and other Department of Defense (DOD) agencies. 23% of sales are to the intelligence community - the NSA and other ""classified"" agencies. The remaining 22% are to civil government departments, primarily in the disciplines of financial services, health, security, and justice / law enforcement.Government contractors provide all kind of services, but Booz Allen's fall into a few categories. Management Consulting and Operations is the biggest one, providing project management, supply chain logistics, analysis and implementation for intelligence, military, healthcare, and other department concerns. The company also supplies contractors for technical and engineering implementations - the people who implement and build the systems and tools spec'd by the consulting guys.Revenue growth over the next several years will be a challenge. Sequestration went into effect on March 1. As a result, federal defense spending is expected to fall 6% this year and about the same for 2014, and grow at about 2% after that through 2023, which is far below the 7% growth rate experienced from 2000-2012.Booz Allen's results have mirrored this - revenue was down 1.7% in fiscal (March) 2013, and forecast to be down about 2% for 2014. The company has relied on acquisitions (such as ARINC) to expand service offerings in important strategic areas, and is re-entering the commercial market. Improving margins have also been a catalyst - restructuring and tight management of headcount has allowed Booz to raise operating margins from under 4% in 2010 to 7.7% last year. As a result, BAH has actually grown operating earnings at a 12% compound growth rate over the past 3 years.However, further margin upside is likely limited. Close comparables to BAH (like SAIC (SAI) and ManTech (MANT)) run margins right around the 8% mark. I'm dubious as to how much more management can squeeze out of the business model.So the story here is one of mediocre-to-no revenue growth, limited margin upside, a fair-but-middling regular dividend (2.1%), and no history of meaningful share buybacks. Booz did pay a massive $8/share in special dividends during 2012, but we've missed the boat on that and the balance sheet was dirtied up as a result ($1.7 billion in debt vs. $350 million in cash). Some have tried to pin leaker and former employee Edward Snowden as a risk on BAH, but I don't see it - the military has already admitted no wrongdoing on the company's part.Given all this, Booz Allen does not look like a particularly interesting Magic Formula® pick at this point in time. My price estimation was $18.50/share, actually slightly below current trading prices. We'll pass on this name and look for more attractive opportunities.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1316771,44401,2013-04-03T04:39:55-04:00,,"Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) is a highly sophisticated management consulting firm that has quickly built a track record for shareholder-friendly dividend policies since its November 2010 IPO. The company has an excellent history of revenue growth and cash generation and is currently trading at a very attractive free cash flow multiple due to excessive concerns about the sequester and an uncertain government spending environment.BAH was founded in 1914 and has served the U.S. government since 1940. The commercial and international portion of the company's business was spun off to its management in 2008 (now Booz & Co.) and BAH was subsequently acquired by The Carlyle Group, which is still a majority owner.Today, the company serves substantially all of the cabinet-level departments of the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense, all branches of the U.S. military, the U.S. intelligence community, and a wide variety of civil agencies. BAH supports these clients by established expertise in four primary areas: Strategy & Organization, Analytics, Technology, and Engineering & Operations. Through these, BAH performs critical tasks for its clients:In the original S-1 filed before the IPO, BAH provided financial data back through the fiscal year ended 3/31/2006, when revenues were $2.9 billion. Six years later, they have doubled, to $5.85 billion in FYE 3/31/2012, representing a 12% CAGR completely uninterrupted by the recession. While the historic financials made public in the S-1 require more complicated analysis based on management ownership and the Carlyle transaction, Adjusted EBITDA has followed the strong revenue growth:Of course, free cash flow is a more important metric, which was $221mm in FY10, $208mm in FY11, and $283mm in FY12. Ignoring a boost from working capital runoff from accelerated government payments, TTM FCF at 12/30/12 was $344mm. With a market cap of $1.85 billion at 4/2/13, this represents an 18.5% FCF yield. What has BAH done with all this cash? Well, it paid $1.1 billion of dividends in 2011 against that $1.85 billion market cap.Show me the money:Prior to the IPO, at 3/30/2010, BAH had a bit over $1.5 billion of debt outstanding after the Carlyle transaction. Only $238mm of cash was raised for the company, which was used along with cash flow to reduce debt by $600mm. Following the IPO, The Carlyle Group retained a 71% ownership stake that has only been reduced to 67% at 12/31/12. This could lead to speculation that the IPO primarily provided liquidity for management and Carlyle is still very interested in owning a large part of the attractive company.After refinancing its existing loans and retiring its expensive mezzanine debt in 2011, BAH was upgraded from a B+ credit rating to BB+ and the company started paying a 9-cent quarterly dividend in February 2012. Four months later, in addition to the second 9-cent dividend, BAH paid a $1.50 special dividend from existing cash on hand. Two months after that, with the third 9-cent dividend, BAH paid a $6.50 special dividend funded through a leveraged recapitalization.Due to the strength of BAH's operations, the company's credit rating was only downgraded one notch, to BB, with S&P's calculated debt/EBITDA increasing from 2.5x to 3.9x, which is elevated but manageable:In addition to funding generous payments to shareholders, BAH spent $158mm to acquire the Defense Systems Engineering and Support business from ARINC Incorporated, another Carlyle portfolio company. DSES is expected to be accretive to earnings almost immediately, for BAH's fiscal 2014, which began on April 1, 2013. Looking to sell the company, Carlyle split ARINC's defense business from its commercial aviation offerings as potential acquirers were concerned about organizational conflicts of interest.BAH has modest capex requirements after completing the setup of a hoteling model for its consultants to cut back on office space required for growth, and these should run at ~$30mm annually vs. ~$80mm of depreciation expenses, boosting FCF versus reported net income.But why would a shareholder-friendly company be trading at an almost 20% FCF yield?Sequester this:The inability of Congress to make a budget deal has resulted in the automatic budget cuts known as the sequestration to take effect as of March 1, 2013. Due to exemptions on some programs, including Social Security and Medicaid, the cuts appear to fall disproportionately higher on defense spending as a percentage of total government spending. While this has already been extensively covered in the media, there are two primary takeaways:1. The sequestration cuts were negligible.2. Many people don't realize this and completely overreacted.The sequestration cuts removed $85 billion from the U.S. government's fiscal year 2013 spending. In fiscal year 2012, the government spent over $3.5 billion, including ~$675 billion on national defense and ~$650mm on non-defense discretionary spending available from the U.S. Government Printing Office (or condensed on Wikipedia). This is a 6.4% ""cut"", yet government outlays are still projected to increase in nominal dollar terms over the next few years according to CBO projections. Government outlays as a percentage of GDP would decline from 22.8% of GDP in 2012 to 21.5% by 2017, which is still slightly above the 40-year average of 21%. Accordingly, in spite of the commotion in the news media, companies like BAH seem to have relatively little to worry about.The problem is, when people overreacted to the sequestration, some contracts and programs in FY13 were delayed due to some uncertainty at BAH's customers since no one really knew what the sequester would look like at the time. Following the increased interest from the leveraged recap, BAH guided to adjusted EPS of $1.60-$1.70 for FY13. On the 3Q13 conference call, the CFO guided down slightly to $1.60-$1.65. As a result of what was billed as the most painful government cuts imaginable, BAH, a company that generates 98% of its revenues from the U.S. government, cut the top range of its EPS guidance by 3%. Due to this uncertainty, the CFO also indicated that they would not yet guide for FY14.Regardless, 3Q13 results were positive: Revenue was down 3.5% from 3Q12, but this was primarily due to lower indirect/subcontracting arrangements, which acts as a contra-revenue item, but has reduced costs further. Adjusted net income was up 5.9%, Adjusted EBITDA was up 13.1%, and Adjusted EPS increased slightly, from $.40/share to $.41/share. BAH's funded backlog was essentially flat, with an organic total of $2.9 billion at 12/31/12 and 12/31/11 (DSES added $247mm). More detail regarding these items and adjustments can be found in the 3Q13 investor presentation.Even if the sequester or any shutdowns would be worse than expected, BAH has positioned itself with a highly variable cost structure, so the company can protect its margins by reducing headcount if revenue does take a hit. If not, BAH can continue adding consultants and growing revenues like it has done consistently for decades.The Warren Buffett value approach is to buy excellent businesses facing temporary setbacks. Given that the sequester is really a very minor setback for BAH, potential shareholders are being offered a bargain with a very large margin of safety at an almost 20% FCF yield for a company that has very clearly demonstrated its desire to return this cash to shareholders.Disclosure: I am long BAH.

1035191,39051,2012-11-29T09:51:11-05:00,,"Recommendation: I recommend refraining from the purchase of Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) common stock. The business has historically generated ample excess cash flows and could achieve strong growth in the future. However, the business depends on the federal government for 98% of its revenue and profits. Predicting government demand ultimately proves futile and demonstrates BAH's weak pricing power. Consequently, the stock is unsuitable for investment.Revenue and Profits (in thousands):After adjusting for restructuring charges, amortization of debt, other depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, tax benefits utilized, and capital expenditures, it is more accurate to say that profit, or rather free cash flow, was $295,000 in FY2012. Looking forward, adjusting for increased interest expense, free cash flow for FY2013 will be $275,000. Consequently, the equity value represented in the open market suggests a forward free cash flow multiple of 7.3.Government Consulting Industry DynamicsThe market prices the business with the hostility it might similarly hold toward a cyclical commodities operation. Yet, sustained economic advantages abound in the form of minimal capital investment, high returns on capital, and high barriers to entry distinguish the business from a highly competitive commodities operation.Investment in property, plant, and equipment is minimal; compare Alcoa's (NYSE:AA) 6% depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue compared with just 1% in the instant case. Return on assets is 17%, with virtually all of the profits available for distribution to shareholders. The largest cost is workforce, a variable cost that can be adjusted according to business conditions.Unlike competitors, growth has come naturally, not as a result of aggressive acquisition strategies. Competitors have consistently spent up to four times investment in property, plant, and equipment on acquisitions, whereas Booz Allen Hamilton has rarely made acquisitions.The company's long-standing relationship with its client, the United States Government, raises high the barriers to entry for potential market entrants. It is the eighth leading defense contractor by revenue. It is the leading technology consultant, along with IBM, in the world by revenue. And it started consulting to the government in 1941, when it assisted the Secretary of the Navy in preparations for the Second World War.For the government, hiring new market entrants carries an unnecessary risk of loss. Booz Allen Hamilton has knowledge of, and experience with, government systems, which often they have helped to manage and engineer. They have a broad scope of expertise spanning a 24,000 headcount, 76% of whom hold government security clearances.Thus, a persuasive reasoning approach to the company's historical business dynamics demonstrate that it is does not operate similarly to a perfectly competitive commodities operation.As further proof of economic advantages, bidding figures on government contracts contribute additional support. The company has a win rate of 53% on first-time competed contracts. However, re-competed contracts, which had previously been won are re-won 91% of the time. This figure strengthens the conclusion that significant incumbent advantages exist.Promising Additions to Earnings PowerThe company is strategically focused on areas where the federal budget is expected to grow. Such areas as cyber security, conversion to cloud computing, healthcare IT, and energy infrastructure IT are all areas where the government is almost certain to increase spending over the next generation. Early indications of the company's success at transitioning toward new business include the ""Cyber War"" simulation, the Cyber Solutions Network, and the recent consulting and services partnership with RSA for cyber attack preparedness and response.A non-compete agreement blocking the company from the private sector, established when it was split-off from a larger corporate structure in 2008, was lifted in mid-2011. Combined with newly quartered operations in Abu Dhabi, non-U.S. government business has since passed the 2% threshold as a percentage of overall revenue. The revenue from this line of business is potentially enormous, considering that the global cyber market is set to reach $80 billion by 2017.In summation of the points so far discussed: a) the business operates in a high-barrier to entry industry­­­­, b) returns on capital are high, c) capital investment is low, d) strategic positioning toward growth areas is optimal, and e) a potentially massive line of business in the private sector is in its very early stages of development.Government Demand and Pricing PowerIf the operation is a fine-tuned engine, then government demand is the fuel. The issue is whether and to what extent an investor in common shares can rely on the federal government to allocate funds to management and technology consultation. The usefulness of predictions is largely a function of how certain we are about those predictions, and to predict government expenditure is an endeavor fraught with uncertainty.The possibilities for how the federal government allocates capital over a generation or more are nearly endless. The baseline budget for defense, for example, could grow at a compounded annual rate of 2.5% in nominal terms from 2013 to 2021 as currently set forth by the Department of Defense. The stagnation, and potentially negative real growth, could put downward pressure on the company's operating margins so that historical margins of 6%-8% are reduced to 4%-6%. Fewer contracts on which to bid, in conjunction with a strict application of low-price, technologically acceptable (LPTA) could, foreseeably, result in such a scenario.Alternatively, a large-scale proxy war could break out in Syria and spending on contractors could grow at the high rates of the 2000s. Yet another alternative is that sequestration takes effect and creates a slew of unforeseeable outcomes.On a larger scale, post World War II outlays by the federal government have historically been about 21.5% of GDP, yet in the past few years we have seen outlays at up to 24% while government revenue declines and a greater part of income is made through the sale of debt as revenue collected from taxes is historically low. In what way this historical shift will resolve itself is anyone's guess. The wide range of outcomes combined with the lack of certainty, takes this valuation of demand for Booz Allen Hamilton's services into the realm of speculation.Majority OwnershipThe Carlyle Group LP (NASDAQ:CG) holds 75% of the company's common stock. The group could reduce its stake in the company by issuing additional shares by as much as, if not more than, 25% of those now outstanding while retaining its majority control. Meanwhile, management, in large part, is compensated through the issuance of stock options.While the risk of dilution is not certain, there is little, if any, protection against it occurring. In order to value the equity raise positively, it would have to be assumed that Carlyle was putting the money to good use. However, one of the attractions of BAH is that organic growth has been the general rule, and, therefore, reliance on rational deal making would have been unnecessary.Because there is no protection against dilution, and because Carlyle is an active dealmaker with, arguably, more to gain than to lose by raising equity, the possibility of dilution poses a significant risk to the current value of the shares by as much as 30% or more.Final AnalysisThe issue rests, finally, on whether demand for services can be relied on with confidence. In any worthwhile investment, positive results should be a near certainty. Predicting government expenditures, especially given current fiscal and political conditions, falls well outside the boundaries of arithmetic or logical reasoning. Statistical data of government expenditure may prove to be useless, or, worse yet, misleading. Available historical performance for industry peers going back to 1994 may very well represent data in which subnormal business conditions never occurred. Untouched in this analysis, but adding uncertainty, is the leveraged capital structure arranged by Carlyle.As such, calculating either value or an adjoining margin of safety to protect against future adverse events becomes overwhelmingly difficult, and the security, therefore, seems unsuitable for analysis, and, consequently, for investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

716731,25120,2012-07-12T05:39:27-04:00,,"Shares of Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) the consultant company, rose more than 13% in today's trading session after the company said it is considering paying a special dividend of $1 billion.Special DividendHalfway during the trading day the company announced that it will launch about $2.25 billion in credit facilities. The company will borrow $500 million in revolving credit facilities and the remainder in secured term loans. The company will use the proceeds to refinance $959 million in existing debt and might use the remaining funds to pay a special dividend of $1 billion.Shares of Booz Allen Hamilton ended the day 13% higher after peaking at $17.41 per share on the back of these announcements. A special dividend of $1 billion would represent roughly 40% of the company's market capitalization, as the dividend could be as large as $7 per share.Annual resultsBooz Allen Hamilton generated $5.9 billion in revenues for the full year of 2011. The company reported operating income of $388 million for that year, with net income coming in at $240 million, or $1.70 per share. Booz Allen Hamilton is relatively conservatively financed, holding roughly $960 million in short and long term debt. The company holds roughly $480 million in cash and equivalents for a net debt position of around $480 million.Investment ThesisThe ambitious plan could provide a huge boost for Booz Allen's shareholders. The special dividend will result in roughly $1 billion in additional debt. Given the company's current net debt position of $500 million, Booz will hold about $1.5 billion in short and long term debt, a debt position which the company can easily sustain.As such the debt position will come in around 4 times 2011's annual operating income. Net income which came in at $240 million for the full year of 2011, would fall to around $200 million on a pro forma as the company's debt service costs would increase. As such earnings per share would come in around $1.50 per share on a pro-forma basis.As investors await a $7 special cash dividend, the operating assets of Booz Allen will be valued at around $10 per share. This values the operating assets at 7 times annual earnings, measured on a conservative measure.Shares trade 3% lower so far this year, including today's gains. If the plan will be executed I see upward potential for levels in the low twenties.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
746001,24491,2012-07-25T03:21:23-04:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In Booz Allen's (BAH) case, we think the firm is undervalued. We think it is fairly valued at $21 per share. In the spirit of transparency, our report on Booz Allen and hundreds of other companies can be found here.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for more info on our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Booz Allen posts a VBI score of 3 on our scale, reflecting our 'undervalued' DCF assessment, its neutral relative valuation versus peers, and bearish technicals. We compare Booz Allen to a peer group consisting of Corrections Corp (CXW), CRA Intl (CRAI), FTI Consulting (FCN), and Huron Consulting (HURN).Our Report on Booz Allen imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsBooz Allen earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 37.5% during the past three years.Although we think the firm's DCF valuation indicates a potential attractive investment opportunity, we'd be more comfortable investing in the firm if it was more attractively priced on a relative basis versus peers as well.Booz Allen has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 4.1% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 2 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 51.6%.The firm posts a VBI score of 3. We don't find the firm that attractive based on this measure, and we'd grow more constructive if it registered an 8 or higher on our scale.The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 2.4%. We expect the firm to pay out about 21% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Booz Allen's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 37.5%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 8.9%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Booz Allen's free cash flow margin has averaged about 6.3% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Booz Allen, cash flow from operations decreased about 3% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 56% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Booz Allen's shares are worth between $16.00 - $26.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $21 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 10.3 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 7.2 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 1.4% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 4.6%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 5.2%, which is below Booz Allen's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 1.4% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Booz Allen, we use a 8.9% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $21 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Booz Allen. We think the firm is attractive below $16 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $26 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Booz Allen's fair value at this point in time to be about $21 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Booz Allen's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $27 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $21 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

834421,34421,2012-08-29T02:18:08-04:00,,"Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) is one of the leading providers of management and technology consulting services to the U.S. government in the areas of defense, intelligence and civil markets. Now 68%-owned by the Carlyle Group, the company went public in November 2010. Since then, BAH refinanced its debt in early 2011 and initiated a regular quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share in February 2012. In May 2012, it paid a special dividend of $1.00 per share to shareholders.On August 1, BAH announced that it would pay another special dividend of $6.50 per share on August 31 to shareholders of record on August 15. Since the stock is trading with ""due bills"", anyone buying the shares up to the close of trading on August 31 can receive the special dividend. At the close of trading on the 31st, the closing price of the stock will be marked down to exclude the special dividend and the stock will resume trading ex-dividend when the market opens back up again on September 4.Most of the dividend will be treated as a return of capital to shareholders. At the end of June, the company had $150.6 million of retained earnings. According to management's GAAP guidance of $1.40-$1.50 per share in earnings for fiscal 2013, I estimate that BAH will add another $97.4 million, net of regular dividend payments for the balance of this fiscal year. Thus, I estimate that roughly $248 million of the $1 billion (or $1.60 of the $6.50 per share) special dividend will represent income to Class A common shareholders. The actual split between income and return of capital will not be known until fiscal 2013 earnings are reported, which probably will not be until the end of May 2013. Shareholders will therefore have to estimate the income/return of capital split for tax purposes for 2012.Despite the announcement of the special dividend, BAH's share price performance has been disappointing. The stock closed today, August 28, at $18.59. Excluding the $6.50 special dividend, which will be paid on Friday, the stock is effectively trading $12.09. well below its closing price of $14.69 on July 10, the day before the company announced that it was pursuing a billion dollar payout. The chart below plots the relative performance of BAH, both including and excluding the implied $6.50 special dividend, compared to the S&P Mid-Cap 400:Chart 1Relative Performance of Booz Allen Hamilton Common Stock (Regular Way and Implied Ex-Dividend) vs. the S&P Mid-Cap 400July 2, 2012 = 100Data Sourced from StockCharts.ComSome might consider the current stock price justified considering that roughly $5 of the special dividend will likely qualify as a return of capital. However, stock prices are forward-looking and based upon the outlook for earnings and dividends. BAH looks cheap both against the broader market and its peer group.Table 1Booz Allen Hamilton vs. Its Peer Group on Key Financial and Market MetricsStock Prices as of August 28, 2012Data for this table obtained from Google Finance, Yahoo! Finance and MSN.BAH peer group = ICFI, MANT, SAI, GD, LLL, LMT, NOC and RTNManagement has issued non-GAAP earnings guidance of $1.60-$1.70 for fiscal 2012. The current consensus estimate is $1.62, which gives the stock an implied forward multiple (excluding the special dividend) of 7.5 times, well below both the average forward multiple of its defense consultant peers of 8.9 times and its big defense contractor peers of 9.9 times. (See Table 1 below.) If BAH, ex-dividend, were valued at the 9 times peer group average, the stock would effectively be trading at $14.58 per share, which is 20% above the current implied ex-dividend price of $12.09.It has been a rough year for all of the defense consulting firms, due to fears of cutbacks on project spending that could be mandated by the sequestration process. BAH CEO Dr. Ralph W. Shrader has compared the current contract award process to white water rafting. Obviously, all of Washington is nervous about the potential for budget cuts.On the other hand, Dr. Shrader has also expressed his confidence in BAH's ability to adjust its business to changing market conditions. As a consulting firm, the company does not have a significant investment in property, plant and equipment. Consequently, while its primary goal is to retain talent, it can, if necessary, cut operating costs more easily to keep them in line with revenues. Thus, BAH has steadfastly maintained its adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings guidance, even though it is somewhat uncertain about the revenue outlook.At the end of the fiscal first quarter (June 30), the company's total backlog was down 8.7% to $10.2 billion against the prior year level, but its funded backlog (i.e. the remaining value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has been appropriated or otherwise authorized) was up 5.1% to $2.58 billion.Given the stock's low forward P/E multiple and the company's ability to adjust to market conditions, I think that BAH is cheap at the current price. It will continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share, which translates into a 3.0% yield at the current implied ex-dividend stock price. The stock has been surprisingly slow to react to recent developments. (It held between $17.00 and $17.50 for a few days after the official dividend announcement and did not approach $19 until the middle of the month.) Even so, BAH investors will undoubtedly be watching with great interest to see where the stock opens on September 4, the first day of trading after the special dividend is paid.Disclosure: I am long BAH.

1524412,41921,2013-06-27T11:04:30-04:00,,"Unless you have been living in a cave for the last few weeks, you are most likely acutely aware that potentially one of the largest national security breaches in US history recently took place. Immediately after the news broke, I highlighted in an article the connection the rogue employee who stole the sensitive data had to Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH). Without diving into much detail about the company itself, I presented the case that Booz Allen should be considered untouchable as a potential investment. The article intimated that regardless of what Booz Allen could have done to prevent the security breach of an employee hell bent on committing what should be considered treason, the company henceforth would see damage to its reputation and could potentially lose significant amounts of business. In the preceding few weeks since the initial revelation, more damning evidence has come out that casts Booz Allen in an even worse light than the original revelation did. A US Senate committee investigation has brought to light that Booz Allen identified apparent discrepancies in the employee's resume which possibly should have raised a red flag. Another government screening agency also identified discrepancies and still the employee was hired. The rest is history. In the words of the Director of the National Security Advisor, when referring to Edward Snowden who committed the crime:The stock of Booz Allen is down just about 7% from where it was prior to the revelation. I continue to believe that the fallout from this incident will hit home on multiple fronts. First, the company is at risk for a loss of its government contracts, specifically those dealing with national security type interests. It is impossible to quantify how large this risk may be, but just giving investors an idea of how important this business is to Booz Allen will paint the picture of the potential impact. Second, it is an unequivocal fact that the company will incur material expenses both in determining how this breach occurred and implementing processes to ensure that it does not occur again. Consultants, attorneys and any other number of outside firms will have to be paid so that the company can prove that it is minding the store so to speak. The recent capital actions taken by the company, in terms of the special dividend in 2012 and raising significant debt to fund this dividend, leaves the company with a heavy debt load at an inopportune time.How Does Booz Allen Make Money?Booz Allen makes money in a very simple manner. Through government contracts. The following language comes straight from the FY2013 10-K report:Substantially can be defined as over 99% of the company's revenue as of FY 2013.Where the story begins to get complicated is what portion of the total revenue Booz Allen derives from governmental clients that would not be so pleased to find out that the company has lax controls that might contribute to a rogue employee stealing US intelligence. Here, we see how big of a piece of the revenue pie the work for intelligence agencies is, again from the 2013 10-K:23% of the total revenue is directly tied to intelligence agency contracts. The benign last sentence from the paragraph above is what catches my eye. The company notes that additional revenue tied to supporting intelligence type activities is included in its revenue attributed to Defense clients. This is where the biggest piece of the revenue pie comes from:This leads to a whopping 78% of the total revenue in FY2013 tied in some way to either US intelligence agencies or defense departments (Army, Navy, etc...).Booz Allen is constantly ranked as one of the top employers to work for in the US and has ties with the US government that go back over 70 years. I'm not speculating that one seemingly isolated incident is enough to destroy what this company has become today and the valuable services it provides to the US Government. I am, however, willing to say that the company will be under the spotlight, which is never a good thing. The bigger issue will end up being the US Congress openly debating the role of private companies augmenting the US government for items sensitive enough to be required the highest levels of security clearance.Financial OverviewPart of the reason for my skepticism surrounding Booz Allen is that the company is not necessarily a bastion of growth to begin with. Management is very shareholder friendly with multiple special dividends over the last few years. At the same time, core operating results have been under pressure, specifically on the top line as seen below from the Q4 2013 earnings presentation:The one item the company threw on this slide that it is obviously trying to highlight is its backlog of future revenue, representing contracts signed as of 3/31/13 that could ultimately turn into revenue. The company conveniently leaves out of this slide that the majority of the increase in backlog is related to contracts that are not yet funded via any type of governmental appropriation. In fact, the portion of the backlog that has received funding and is more of a guaranteed future revenue stream fell 13% from the prior year as seen below from the 2013 10-K:Keep in mind that all of these figures preceded the theft of US intelligence information discussed in the introduction.The outlook for FY2014 shows a decline in revenue and earnings compared to the prior year:An item of note is that the company made an acquisition during 2013 that is helping to support its revenue number for FY 2014. An analyst questioned company management on the Q4 2013 earnings call, and management indicated that the organic revenue excluding the impact of the acquisition would show a decline of 5 to 6% from the prior year.Another item that pains me to see as a shareholder is the absolutely ridiculous growth in the number of shares outstanding which is shown in the chart below:BAH Shares Outstanding data by YChartsOver a 4 year time period, the total number of shares outstanding grew over 20%. The company had over 144M diluted shares as of the end of FY 2013, compared to 116M at the end of FY2010.From a balance sheet standpoint, the company has not been afraid to lever up with debt to fund special dividends and acquisitions over the past few years as seen below:BAH LT Debt data by YChartsThe track record for Booz Allen is to pay out special dividends, use its substantial cash flow to reduce debt, and then pay out more special dividends and issue debt again. It is a wash, rinse, repeat cycle. In 2012, the company paid a roughly $750M special dividend which was the equivalent of ~$6.50 a share. No small potato for a stock with a market cap of ~$2.7B prior to the special dividend being paid out. The company is clearly shareholder friendly in this regard, but potentially friendly only to those who hold the majority of its shares, which in the case of Booz Allen is a the well known private equity Carlyle Group. Individual investors should not kid themselves about the intent of Booz Allen with its shareholder actions. When the Carlyle Group owns almost 70% of the outstanding shares, any shareholder friendly action is directed at the private equity fund and not Average Joe shareholder.What Happens Next / Investment OutlookIf there is no fallout related to this incident than I will frankly be more concerned about our country than I am today. Booz Allen has a section in its 10-K that discusses the security clearance levels given to its employees, and what percentage of employees receive those security levels:Booz Allen employed 24,500 people at the end of FY2013. Of those, 21% had access to Top Secret information that would cause ""exceptionally grave damage"" to national security if disclosed to the public. The company had over 5,000 employees with access to this type of information, and all it took was 1 employee to bring about one of the greatest intelligence failures in the history of the US. This is not an indictment of Booz Allen. The US government cannot fire itself if one of its employees disclosed top secret information. It can fire a private company. When you are Booz Allen and the entirety of your revenue stream is dependent on the US government, the last thing you need is to be thrust in the spotlight as the sequestration goes into full effect and every liberal in the US Congress is already itching to cut spending on national security and defense budgets. This just gives those looking to cut these types of costs more ammo. I am of the belief that the final shoe has not dropped and that Booz Allen will incur material costs both of a one time and recurring nature, to provide the appearance that it is completely revamping how it ensures that the employees it hires have been properly vetted. I also believe it is inevitable that the company will lose some portion of its intelligence contracts if for nothing else so that an example can be made. I would expect to see a downward revision to earnings estimates with the reasoning being the sequestration and non-recurring costs related to the national security incident. There are also very real questions about liability in this matter. The US government will incur significant costs to change protocols, potentially revamp entire programs of a sensitive nature that may have been compromised, and ultimately spend hundreds of millions of dollars trying to undo the damage caused by this security leak. Is it safe to assume that Booz Allen will not be asked to share in these costs? I would hope not, as a taxpayer funding both the US government and Booz Allen and its private equity majority shareholder.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

4378512,102101,2020-10-11T13:03:07-04:00,BlackBerry is expanding the capabilities of its UES offerings.These capabilities will strengthen its presence in the government vertical.BlackBerry's strength with large enterprises hasn't benefitted from its improved capabilities due to its confusing product strategy.I reckon the new capabilities might follow the same path.,"BlackBerry (BB) is set to release new products to complement the capabilities of its Spark platform via its Cyber Suite package. This article explores the strategy behind the new products. I explain why it might not be the game-changer. This article also explores the potential impact of these capabilities on BB's competitive positioning and market expansion opportunity.Chart (Source: Forrester)BlackBerry is set to release a secure web gateway product and a data loss prevention product. Before delving into the new products, it is worth highlighting that BB's Zero trust strategy is taking shape. BB was featured in Forrester's analysis of Zero Trust platforms for Q3'20. BlackBerry had high scores in device security and Zero Trust advocacy. It had average scores in attractive segments like network security, data security, workload security, analytics, and security automation. The improved Zero Trust visibility isn't hard to fathom, given BlackBerry's experience in endpoint visibility, which benefits a lot from the acquisition of Cylance. The report praised BB's unique approach to Zero Trust, which leverages its endpoint security capabilities for endpoint visibility and its app security capability for data and access security. BlackBerry's ability to leverage its UEM (unified endpoint management) capabilities to play into the work from home (WFH) theme has been impressive. However, I remain wary of the positioning of BB's UEM offering as its remote working solution appears to be gaining more leverage than its UES (endpoint security) offering. This might partly explain the recent goodwill impairment on its balance sheet. It is puzzling why BB isn't giving its UES solutions more visibility to drive its leadership in endpoint security. SWG & DLPA secure web gateway (SWG) is an adaptive appliance designed to protect access to networks and web apps as the traditional security perimeter becomes mobile. Secure web gateways provide secure access to enterprise resources regardless of a user's location. At the peak of COVID-19, SWG players like Zscaler recorded a massive spike in demand for their employee access and cloud access solutions. Employee access solutions provide secure access to resources owned by enterprises. Cloud access solutions provide secure access to cloud networks and third-party apps. It will be immediately obvious that providing such a solution at scale to millions of endpoints and networks across the globe isn’t something that can be done overnight or in a year. The success of Zscaler and other SWG vendors is a result of years of hard work. I also attribute the success of secure web gateway vendors to the market's perception of how these solutions should be consumed. Secure web gateways are perceived as adaptive replacements for traditional firewalls. When enterprise CIOs were dusting their business continuity plans off the shelves at the peak of COVID, the glaring problem was how to replace firewalls since most employees won’t be accessing corporate apps beyond the HQ or branch perimeter. This explains the spike in demand for VPNs and VPN replacement solutions. Another reason for the success of players like Zscaler is their ability to solve complex web access problems. Large enterprises demand traffic inspection, content filtering, and remote browser isolation capabilities. Large enterprises also have the budget to pay for these capabilities. As the Secure Web Gateway functionality expands, the line between basic SWGs and CASBs (cloud access security broker) blurs. Therefore, it is more likely that BB releases a CASB and not a web gateway. BlackBerry has more of a vertical focused go-to-market strategy, unlike other security players that play by market segment. Wording its marketing message that it will be releasing SWG products makes sense if it plans to offer basic SWG to SMBs. It will be tough for BlackBerry to offer basic SWGs to large enterprises. Large enterprises that want basic SWGs can easily task their existing network security vendors to enable their web proxy module. Network security vendors can leverage their partnership with top public cloud platforms to offer CASB functionality if they need data leak prevention solutions.Given its vertical focus, BlackBerry will most likely design its SWG solution to solve business problems related to data security and compliance. This explains why BB is also working on a DLP solution on the side. It will have been easier to digest its SWG play if BlackBerry states it will offer a CASB with SWG and DLP features. I reckon BB might be perceived as a competitor to Zscaler and Cisco (CSCO) by playing in the SWG space, which isn’t really good for BlackBerry's competitor strategy.Source: BlackBerryAs a CASB vendor, BB can leverage existing UEM capabilities for endpoint visibility. This will be complemented by its user and entity behavior technology acquired from Cylance. Providing more granular visibility and data leak prevention management capabilities to popular apps like Microsoft 365 will require partnerships. I reckon most cloud platforms will want to control data and access security for their cloud apps. This will make it tough for a niche player to focus on protecting access to cloud apps solely. This probably is the reason why BB chooses to be perceived as a web gateway player as it sells its DLP solution to highly regulated verticals. The monetization opportunity will be geared towards improving the depth of BB's capabilities in highly regulated verticals. BlackBerry now shares a dollar net expansion metric. It will be insightful to watch that number after it releases its SWG and DLP offerings. Driving new customers with its SWG solution will be tough. I expect cloud platforms to keep evolving their data security features to prevent the rise of new DLP players.Also, evolving a robust SWG capability will cost a fortune. It isn't clear if BB will be willing to compete in the large enterprise segment, which has players like Zscaler and network security vendors like Palo Alto Networks (PANW). Even if it is willing; I am not sure it has the resources. I believe BB should focus on strengthening its UES capabilities to play in the endpoint security space. BB's endpoint and remote work products were lost in the IoT noise last quarter. Currently, the WFH solution is categorized under the UEM section of its website. The SWG and DLP capabilities risk following the same path as customers demand WFH solutions with strong security features. Given the hot demand for WFH solutions, it is possible BB made this classification because UEM is a better revenue driver than UES. If this true, it means Cylance has been underperforming. This isn't good for BB's long term revenue trajectory. Bulls don't agree with me that the UEM space is getting commoditized.Investors should wait for the growth of the software division as we exit the current calendar year. Until the product strategy gives the UES solutions more prominence, I remain neutral on BB's Spark platform's new capabilities."
4376405,24849,2020-09-25T15:12:27-04:00,Company announces top and bottom line beats.Licensing revenues jumped while core business struggled.Key financial metrics weakened sequentially.,"Thursday morning, we received fiscal second quarter results from BlackBerry (BB). The company has continued to struggle in recent years, leading its shares to greatly underperform the market as investors favor growth names. While the headline numbers again looked strong and sent the stock much higher early on, the stock lost those gains throughout the day and ended negative as it didn't appear BlackBerry had made any great progress.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)For the second quarter, non-GAAP revenues of more than $266 million beat estimates by about $26 million, while GAAP revenues were $7 million less. Non-GAAP EPS, which always beat, came in at $0.11, beating by nine cents, while GAAP per share losses of $0.04 matched estimates. In the graphic below, you can see a breakdown of the revenue results, in millions.(Source: BlackBerry supplemental financial information, seen here)As we've seen in a number of recent quarters, licensing revenues saved the day with a massive sequential jump. The core software business continued to struggle, declining by $17 million over the prior year period, and barely showing any sequential growth. Perhaps things would be better if the company was investing in R&D and Sales/Marketing, as those two key expense categories dropped from $192 million a year ago to $136 million in the just reported quarter. Some of that operating expense decline is due to the pandemic and government subsidies, but at this point, BlackBerry needs to spend more if it wants to grow anywhere near most new age tech companies that are worth tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars.As I discussed in my earnings preview article, some of the company's key metrics regarding Cylance had deteriorated throughout the previous fiscal year. At the Q1 report, management stopped providing this important information, but transitioned to more of a business as a whole snapshot. Unfortunately, the three items presented all showed weakness in Q2 as the graphic below details. These numbers look even bleaker when you look at the balance sheet. Total deferred revenues, which started the fiscal year at $373 million, have declined to $316 million in just six months. The company's financial document also shows that sequentially, the net customer churn rate went from approximately zero to three percent.(Source: Quarterly earnings slides, fiscal Q1 and fiscal Q2)Another item I think investors started to fret over was guidance for the current fiscal year. Despite the large revenue beat for Q2, CEO John Chen said on the conference call that BlackBerry expects total revenue to be around $950 million for the year. The street was around $955 million going in, so unless he is really underpromising here, the second half of the year isn't going to be as strong as expected. This also makes sense with the one-time licensing deal struck in Q2 that helped that category vastly outperform expectations.In the end, fiscal Q2 was another quarter with BlackBerry spinning its wheels. The headline numbers looked great, but it was mostly due to one-time licensing items yet again, and key software/service numbers weakened again. Guidance for the year was not very strong, and while competitors continue to show massive revenue growth, BlackBerry's top line isn't going anywhere fast. After hitting a high of $5.40 in Thursday's pre-market, shares closed down for the day, and they fell through their 50-day moving average in the process, which could lead to additional selling in the near term."
4379099,102101,2020-10-14T16:11:16-04:00,"BB's growth factor faces strong headwinds as we complete the fiscal year.Despite the reduced hurdle rate for tech stocks, the risk premium for BB remains huge.While the new debt issuance is attractive, the market expects more competition. This explains the minimal movement in stock price despite its potentials in IoT.This thesis explores the near term financial outlook.","Source: physBlackBerry's (BB) last earnings results didn't impress. The volatile macro-environment continues to impact its software and services segment. The licensing segment picked up the tab in a quarter in which investors and analysts weren't so optimistic. Going forward, BlackBerry's top and bottom line continue to be muddled by its shifting revenue recognition method, reporting classification, capital structure, the volatile macro environment, and GAAP/non-GAAP reconciliations. This article assembles the muddled financial picture.BlackBerry derives its revenue from two broad segments: Software & Services and Licensing & Others. Software & Services is a combination of what used to be the IoT division and Cylance. The IoT division consists of BB's UEM (unified endpoint management) revenue (pre and post-Good Technology), QNX (automotive and embedded), and other offerings, including Radar, AtHoc, Certicom, Secusuite, Jarvis, and BlackBerry professional services.For clarity, I will be using the old BTS (BlackBerry Technology Services)/ESS (enterprise software and services) classification, which has QNX, Radar, AtHoc, Secusuite, Jarvis, Certicom, and Paratek under BTS. Cylance will be a standalone segment. AtHoc and Secusuite used to be under the ESS segment. UEM will consist of EMS (enterprise mobility services), Workspace, Apps, communication services, and BB Dynamics. I will also be lumping IP and licensing under Licensing. Others be a placeholder for the historical run rate of other licensing programs.Source: Author (for educational purposes only)For the top line, I am assuming the BTS segment, which is mostly driven by QNX, took a major hit in the first half of the year. I assume revenue declined to $35m last quarter. This is only logical since QNX is assumed to generate an annual revenue run rate between $200m - $250m. If we add Radar and other products under BTS, I believe the BTS segment was set to deliver an annual revenue run rate of $250m - $300m before COVID-19 happened. I am assuming a gradual increase in revenue in the back half of the year. I also expect a strong contribution from AtHoc. I find AtHoc's new use cases in incident management and the recent partnership with Microsoft (MSFT) attractive. I am expecting the UEM segment to be flattish due to growing competition and commoditization.I am assuming Cylance is only logging a 20% growth. I believe this is a generous estimate, given its exposure to small businesses. I expect new behavior analysis and data loss prevention capabilities to strengthen its positioning in the Fed vertical. Besides this, there is yet to be any compelling indicator that BB can compete with pure endpoint players like CrowdStrike (CRWD) that are fully positioned for the future of cybersecurity which is cloud-based. This correlates with BB's recent statement that it will soon release a cloud version of its endpoint solution.I am using BB's guidance of $250m for the licensing division. In total, the licensing & other segments will drive $274m in revenue in CY'20. From the table below, licensing will be a net headwind to overall growth in 2H'21, while the software and services segment won't pick up full momentum until Q4.Source: Author (for educational purposes only, adjust unusual items and other changes to OCF)I lumped unusual items and amortization expenses. I assume amortization expenses will hover between $42m - $44m in Q3 and Q4. This correlates with BB's guidance of $85m in amortization expense for the remainder of FY'21. This means I'm only anticipating unusual expenses of $6m-$8m per quarter.In terms of margins, COGS will be flat as acquisition-related amortization offsets the high margin shift to software revenue. I expect OpEx to pick up as QNX engagements grow. My OpEx forecast excludes stimulus benefits (CEWS funding) and the cost savings from licensing arrangements. These non-recurring expenses represented 15% of OpEx in H1'21. I also expect more spending in the Cylance division to drive growth. The interest savings from the debt refinance will be offset by reduced interest income. A huge portion of the GAAP/non-GAAP disparities to net income will also be minimized. This includes the recent impairment charge to long-lived assets. I am only factoring stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles in my non-GAAP projections. I expect restructuring costs to be negligible. Together, these reconciliations will contribute $0.07/share to my non-GAAP EPS forecast.Source: Author (for educational purposes only)I expect billings to rebound in the second half of the year. Working capital improvement (improved deferred revenue, better collection of licensing receivables) will drive a strong OCF margin in Q3 and Q4.BB got a reduced interest rate (1.75%) after it refinanced its debt, which means the market believes in the ability of its software business to drive growth. BlackBerry raised $365m. The conversion premium puts the conversion price at $6/share. This represents approx. 10% of BB's common shares outstanding. If converted, the debt won't be dilutive to shareholders if BB deploys the cash to fund projects that are accretive to cash flows. The prospect for BB's Spark platform is still strong, and there is a strong potential for BB to gain more market share, especially in the IoT space. BB also has most of the capabilities it needs. It's not clear if the bulk of the capital will go to cloud platforms. Though, I don't see BB building much on its own with its little cash trove.Source: BloombergBB's cash cows aren't pulling their weight. QNX's revenue decline is excusable; however, Cylance also appears to be underperforming in terms of growth. It seems the UES segment is lost in the mid-market furor. It also appears there aren't enough engagements in the Fed vertical to turbocharge growth. I remain wary of the growth of the UEM segment. Besides AtHoc, the segment appears to be trudging along.The attractive reinvestment rate of its overall business is appealing in the absence of impressive growth. Cylance especially benefits a lot from a lot of existing capabilities that have been developed over the years. The current valuation shows the market isn't yet sold on the IoT strategy. This makes the upside potential worth exploring.I will go for a momentum-driven valuation in which I expect BB to trade in line with other slow-growth peers. If revenue growth outperforms, there is no doubting the potential for significant multiples expansion in the long term. If BB enjoys reduced risk premium due to the low-interest-rate environment, it's not clear if it can build a moat around its cash flows if its IoT bets play out. Therefore, I am projecting a trading range of 2x - 3x CY'20 revenue. I expect BB's valuation to remain range-bound in the short term.Competition will be more of a headwind to growth than margins. This will be most pronounced in the UEM segment. I am also wary of BB's ability to grow Cylance, given the competition in the endpoint security space. Lastly, scaling the IoT platform without depending on cloud platforms is tough to project.The macro-environment remains a significant headwind to BB's revenue. Going forward, I expect the proposed stimulus package in the US to be supportive of new vehicle sales. This will assist the BTS segment in relieving the pressure on the software business to deliver in the next quarter.It is tough to make the market believe in the IoT vision, given the current macro turbulence. I will rather wait for more improvement from Cylance before I place my bets. I expect BB to invest more in gaining market share across most of its operating segments. This will pressurize EPS growth. Overall, I rate BB a hold as I wait for the IoT strategy to unfold."
4377860,69905,2020-10-06T14:34:20-04:00,"Digging into BlackBerry's Q2 2021 results and how it shapes up against its long-term goals.Licensing segment was very strong during Q2 2020, up 86% y/y.Challenging to build a positive investment thesis here.","BlackBerry (BB) delivered strong Q2 2021 results. But as we look ahead towards the rest of its fiscal year, it's difficult to get overly excited while paying more than 2x next year's sales.Source: author's calculations, GAAP revenues, **fiscal 2021 guidance taken from the earnings callBlackBerry has been through an unstable time this past year. Meanwhile, looking ahead, there appears to be little relief for shareholders as its full-year fiscal 2021 guidance is likely to hover around negative 7% y/y.This is a rough estimate on my part, given that CEO John Chen alludes to BlackBerry's full-year revenues being around $950 million - hence, I've allowed for some conservative guidance from BlackBerry, assuming that full-year revenues would reach $965 million.Given that we know that Q1 2021 was challenging but now firmly in the rearview, that quarter's performance alone would not be enough to drag down BlackBerry's full-year revenues to reach negative 7%.This implies that some of BlackBerry's quarters for the remainder of the year should also be turning in negative revenue growth rates.For their part, Wall Street analysts are expecting Q3 2021 to be even worse than Q1 2021 (a period when the economy went into lockdown):Source: SA Premium ToolsFrom my perspective, I believe this expectation might be overly bearish, even if it is pointing in the correct direction.So, if revenues are struggling to gain traction, what should bulls keep in mind?Source: Q2 2021 Investor PresentationBlackBerry set out its long-term timeless goal to reach 90% recurring revenues from its software products. On the surface, this appears an impressive goal.However, looking through BlackBerry's SEC filings and a different perspective becomes evident:Source: Q2 2021 10-Q SEC filingHighlighted above we can see that during fiscal 2020 (last fiscal year), BlackBerry's recurring revenues were already greater than 90%. This implies that BlackBerry's long-term goals are lower than its performance last year.Source: Q2 2021 Investor PresentationFurther dissecting its revenues, we can see that BlackBerry's Software and Services segment accounts for approximately 60% of BlackBerry's total revenues.Source: author's calculations; Q2 2021 Press StatementsHence, given that 90% of this segment's revenue is from recurring sources, this translates into approximately $486 million of recurring sources. Seeing that BlackBerry's market cap is $2.5 billion, having very close to $0.5 billion from recurring sources, particularly in the present market where investors are craving from SaaS-like businesses, this is very attractive.However, aside from having a recurring source of revenues, investors also demand high growth from these businesses, and on this front, BlackBerry struggles to satisfy.Moving on, Q2 2021 (most recent quarter) was a strong period for BlackBerry's Licensing segment, which saw its revenues jump 86% y/y to $108 million.Once again, if we compare BlackBerry's Q2 2021 performance with its full-year guidance for this segment to reach modestly above $250 million in fiscal 2021, we are left with unappetizing prospects.To illustrate, during H1 2021, BlackBerry's Licensing segment reached $166 million. According to BlackBerry's own guidance, assuming it reaches approximately $260 million for its full year 2021, this implies that H2 2021 would bring in close to $94 million.If BlackBerry's Licensing is $94 million or thereabouts over a 6-month period, this not only implies a rapid deceleration from Q2 2021, but it actually means that its Licensing revenues would be less than the $58 million it generated during its turbulent Q1 2021 period.It's difficult to build a compelling reason to remain long BlackBerry at present.On the one hand, BlackBerry's growth rates continue to generally meander towards the negative, even if along the way it has the odd positive quarter, as we just witnessed in Q2 2021.Furthermore, its cash flows are not looking all that enticing, particularly as we think of a mature company's cash flow profile. In fact, during its trailing six months, BlackBerry's cash flows from operations were simply at breakeven.Having said that, breakeven is a marked improvement from the negative $47 million BlackBerry reported during H1 2021.Assuming that BlackBerry's next fiscal year, fiscal 2022, were to improve from this year's results, and its top line was to reach $1.1 billion, investors are already being asked to pay a 2x multiple to next year's sales. For a company with no consistent growth, this is still too big a multiple.BlackBerry just reported a very strong quarter, but as we look ahead towards the remainder of its fiscal year, it appears that this recent quarter's performance was a flash in the pan and that the rest of its fiscal year is expected to deliver shareholders with negative results.Meanwhile, I contend that its valuation still remains elevated for what BlackBerry offers investors."
4374346,24849,2020-09-15T07:48:57-04:00,"Shares languish under $5 as market rally continues.
        Key competitor continues to shine with impressive results.
        CEO approaching 7-year anniversary with little progress to show.","One of the most disappointing stocks that I've covered in this market in recent years has been technology company BlackBerry (BB). Despite multiple acquisitions that have used up almost all of the company's cash, and several supposedly high interest technology products/services under its belt, the stock has been hit hard under CEO John Chen's leadership. Next week, the company is set to report its fiscal Q2 numbers, and it is time that this name finally shows it is worth investors' attention.BlackBerry will report its results on Thursday, September 24th, before the market opens. Current estimates call for the firm to report non-GAAP revenues of $239.83 million, a decline of more than 8%, with non-GAAP EPS of 2 cents as compared to break even in the prior year period. The company has missed top line estimates in three of its last four quarters, while beating bottom line figures every quarter for the past several years.BlackBerry's most recent acquisition of Cylance does not seem to be doing well. In the latest earnings report, management didn't even break out its results in the earnings release, and key statistics up to that point had been looking bleak. This was the deal that was supposed to cement BlackBerry's growth revival, but it definitely seems to be more of an anchor now, and contributed to the massive goodwill impairment charge that was taken. Meanwhile, take a look at what Cylance competitor Crowdstrike (CRWD) has done in its recent quarters:BlackBerry revenues are forecast to decline by more than 13% during its fiscal year. On the flip side, Crowdstrike is forecast to see its top line surge by more than 70%, and that's likely before even more guidance raises. In fact, looking forward to their respective next fiscal years, Crowdstrike is expected to surpass BlackBerry in total annual revenues. In fiscal 2018, Crowdstrike had less than $119 million in yearly revenue, and now we're only about a year away from it passing BlackBerry, a company that once had $20 billion in total revenues per year.I'm sure next week's conference call will also see some questions about BlackBerry's latest bond deal. Management previously said it would be repaying its notes due this November, which is fine, and there was plenty of cash on hand to do this. However, why did the company turn around and then announce it was going to borrow $535 million, only to cut the deal to $365 million? The new deal featured an equity conversion price 40% lower than the past bond issuance. BlackBerry's balance sheet was just fine, so adding debt again seems curious unless management is looking for another acquisition or will start a meaningful share repurchase program.BlackBerry investors don't want to see just another adjusted earnings beat, one that takes out key expenses like stock based compensation. They are tired of seeing revenues going nowhere, as in the most recent quarter where they tied a new quarterly low under CEO John Chen. GAAP revenues have not topped $300 million in any period in the past four years, and analyst estimates don't see this level being topped for another two years or more. This is likely a key reason why over the past three years, institutional ownership of this stock has gone from the low 60% area to the high 40% area. On Monday, BlackBerry shares closed a few cents below their 50-day moving average. If they don't get above this key technical level after the earnings report, there likely will be more selling pressure moving forward. While many tech names have surged to valuations in the tens or even hundreds of billions with very little revenues, BlackBerry cannot even get its market cap to top $3 billion currently. As the chart below shows, shares have lost nearly a quarter of their value since John Chen was named interim CEO, while the NASDAQ index is up more than 167%. (Source: Yahoo! Finance)In the end, it is time for BlackBerry to step up to the plate and finally deliver. Competitors like Crowdstrike are growing at tremendous rates, with their share prices being rewarded as such, while BlackBerry is having trouble showing any growth at all. With less than two months to go from John Chen marking 7 years at the helm, investors are definitely losing patience, and that needs to change soon."
4358848,102101,2020-07-16T12:40:21-04:00,BlackBerry needs to step out of its comfort zone.Its endpoint and cloud security offerings need to drive the go-to-market strategy for BB to grow market share.This might drive the need to focus more on large enterprises.BlackBerry has the right capabilities. The IoT bets need more features to make BlackBerry competitive with network security vendors.Using a partnership strategy to improve its competitive posture doesn't appear sustainable in the long term. Invest with caution.,"Source: CybraryWhen BlackBerry (BB) acquired Cylance, the aim was to capitalize on Cylance's AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning) capabilities to build its EoT (enterprise of things) security platform. This deal was also expected to be synergistic to its IoT solutions.Acquiring an endpoint security player requires two capabilities:BlackBerry saw a different vision that revolved around embedding Cylance into its IoT solutions and innovations. This pushed the near term cash flow expectations from Cylance into the future due to the energy that will be expended to integrate Cylance into Spark (EoT platform). This bet isn't bad, given that the advent of 5G networks will drive the ease of protecting IoT devices. It's also interesting to know that Cylance had capabilities in embedded system security and autonomous security before the acquisition. These capabilities fit well with QNX (embedded and auto security). Throw in the capabilities in AI, EDR (endpoint detection and response), threat hunting, security consulting, and the Cylance deal looks like a no brainer.Around the period BB acquired Cylance, VMWare (VMW) also acquired Carbon Black. Investors will note that Carbon Black fits nicely with VMware's push to provide cloud security solutions for the modern enterprise. Since it acquired Carbon Black, VMWare has folded another security company into its cybersecurity platform. Octarine was acquired as a Kubernetes security play to help enterprises protect cloud workloads. It's immediately obvious that Cylance was acquired to protect the future of computing while Carbon Black was acquired to protect the present (cloud workloads and cloud data lanes).Source: Morgan StanleyThis doesn't mean Cylance isn't immediately accretive to BlackBerry's growth. At the minimum, it plugs churn from existing UEM (unified endpoint management) customers who are aching for threat prevention and EDR capabilities. It also drives multiples expansion as BB is perceived as a SaaS company, which will.enjoy elevated SaaS multiples. Like Good Technology, and a host of other security acquisitions, Cylance is now rebranded under BB Spark. How has Cylance evolved since the acquisition?BlackBerry has made a series of updates since it acquired Cylance. Immediately after buying Cylance, BB had to improve on its brand positioning to make Cylance more appealing to existing EMM customers. This was achieved via industry awards and third-party effectiveness tests for Cylance Protect (threat prevention using AI and ML). Cylance isn't ranked as a leader, innovator, or challenger in Gartner's EPP Quadrant (2019). Pulling out of the niche players' space will require a huge task, which includes improving on the weaknesses highlighted by Gartner.BlackBerry partnered with AttackIQ immediately after it acquired Cylance to improve its capabilities in endpoint security configuration. This is a level-one capability compared to the deep vulnerability assessment capabilities offered by the likes of Qualys (QLYS), Tenable (TENB), and Rapid7 (RPD). AttackIQ leverages the MITRE ATT&CK framework, which now serves as one of BB's leading third-party tests for the efficacy of BlackBerry Protect. Enrolling for third party tests provided by the likes of NSS Labs is a way to convince enterprise decision-makers about the block rate and appealing TCO (total cost of ownership) of a security product/platform. The capabilities to be acquired from AttackIQ have now been extended to SafeBreach.BB's next move was the release of Cylance Persona. Cylance Persona fits into BlackBerry's UES platform, a subset of BlackBerry Spark (BB's EOT platform). BB Persona adds user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) capabilities to BlackBerry Optics (BlackBerry's EDR offering). Optics complements BB Protect to drive active threat detection and response for malicious attacks that are missed by BlackBerry Protect. BlackBerry isn't the only EDR player that offers UEBA capabilities. Its EDR offerings haven't received top ratings in recent quarters. Most EDR leaders have solid UEBA offerings. This means the addition of Cylance Persona extends beyond UEBA.The addition of Cylance Persona complements BB's Zero Trust strategy, which correlates with Bryan Palmer's experience at Cisco (CSCO). Zero Trust is partly about giving users, and IP-enabled devices the appropriate bandwidth and device access that correlates with their network privilege. The Zero Trust capabilities are important because BB needs a robust IoT strategy to acquire market share. The Zero Trust capabilities will also serve as a way for BB to compete with network security vendors who are investing heavily in SD-WAN and other edge security and networking standards. This means BB has to improve its cloud computing and security offerings.BlackBerry's recent launch of BIS (BlackBerry intelligence security) is the first iteration of its next-generation cloud security strategy. BIS's ZTNA (zero-trust network access) strategy is a sign that low latency and speed of delivery will be major metrics to watch as it scales its cloud offerings. The BIS launch appears to be focused on mobile endpoints to stress-test the adaptability of BB's ZTNA strategy as it expands into the IoT space.Next, Verizon expanded its managed security service portfolio with Cylance. This move highlights BB's potential forays into the SecOps space. The efficacy of BlackBerry Protect is supposed to reduce false security alerts (positive/negative). Combined with Optics (automated threat hunting), and adding its integration with other security platforms, developing future capabilities in SIEM/SOAR (security operations) is inevitable. Therefore, when Forrester named BB as a strong performer in the incident response space, it wasn't far fetched.It was a no brainer when BB launched CylanceGUARD as it represents the last major missing piece in its UES strategy. CylanceGUARD combines human expertise and intelligence from Cylance to deliver a managed security service. To efficiently scale this solution, BB needs more threat intelligence. CISOs will find it tough passing up Symantec, FireEye (FEYE), CrowdStrike (CRWD), and network security vendors who have shipped tons of security appliances. Therefore, when BB announced its integration with Chronicle's Backstory, the reasons for the partnership weren't tough to decipher. Chronicle was spunned from Google X (its moonshot division) to be a standalone cybersecurity company.Chronicle includes Virustotal (a malware search engine). Penetration testers are familiar with Virustotal, and security analysts often upload files suspected to be infected with malware as part of their threat hunting process. Chronicle leverages Google's huge data storage, computing capability, and affordable licensing model to help enterprises with threat intelligence. Other notable partners on Chronicle's platform include Carbon Black, Fortinet (FTNT), Avast, and Tenable. It's clear that Chronicle is good for improving threat intelligence at a low cost. The only downside arises from security governance and data privacy issues that might be raised by customers as BB scales its threat intelligence capabilities. Scale, speed, and automation are key to delivering a best-of-breed IoT security solution. It's clear that BB will be relying on cloud service providers to achieve this goal. The recently announced partnership with AWS to improve its IoT and edge computing resources solidifies this conviction.BlackBerry has also extended its Cylance capabilities to mobile devices. This was achieved by infusing its threat protection capabilities into its UEM solution. This provides BB with a strong mobile threat detection capability to add to its EPP offerings. When Gartner is writing its next report for the EPP space, the major weakness that will be highlighted is BlackBerry's go to market motion. The product innovation criteria will be a strength for BlackBerry. The latest Cylance updates include an improved UI, unified agent for Optics and Protect, and support for Linux systems. These represent a huge portion of weaknesses highlighted by Gartner. Going forward, BB has plans to add capabilities in SWG (secure web gateway), and DLP (data loss prevention). By the end of the year, BlackBerry's security toolkit will resemble a cross between Zscaler (ZS) and CrowdStrike. That's fairly competitive.Blackberry is approaching parity with pure-play cloud security providers. It only needs to strengthen its go-to-market strategy going forward. Adding capabilities in SWG and CSPM (cloud security posture management) is a good way to launch more capabilities in cloud security. Cylance had a solid reputation (over 100 Fortune 500 companies) before it was acquired by BlackBerry. It boasted clients like Toyota, Panasonic, and The Gap. Today, the landing page of its enterprise page doesn't list attractive enterprise clients (top clients are often highlighted during quarterly conference calls). It appears BlackBerry is underplaying its strength with large enterprises.As COVID-19 has established, BB missed the short window of opportunity to make a flurry of cloud bets that will have proven decisive today. BB acquired Cylance with capabilities in endpoint protection, EDR, and consulting. Cylance also adds capabilities in IoT security. BB can improve the depth of its offerings in the cybersecurity space by doubling down on its cloud security strategy. This will require strategic integrations with top cloud platforms and granular capabilities in cloud security (container security, workload protection). The speed of service delivery is also key.Short term investors should realize the need to be patient. Long term investors shouldn't underestimate the probability of a Zoom-like (ZM) harvest with the IoT security bets. This will be catalyzed by the growing need to protect IoT devices from coordinated cyber threats.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4360007,24849,2020-07-22T16:25:27-04:00,Company is issuing new debt to mostly replace maturing notes.Conversion price drops by 40% due to stock price fall.Management better use this money to its advantage.,"I recently published a blog post detailing why I believed BlackBerry (BB) management needed to make a major move. With shares of the company struggling despite a massive tech sector rally, investors need a reason to believe moving forward. On Wednesday, we did get a move that could fit into one of my ideas, but it remains to be seen if management will follow through.For those that need a refresher, BlackBerry has $605 million in convertible debt coming due this November. The conversion price is $10 per share, so with the stock trading at less than half that, the debt either has to be repaid or refinanced. Wednesday's news was that the company will repay these notes a little early, but there is also another piece to this overall transaction. Here are the key parts that were announced:Had BlackBerry not issued the new debt, it would have reduced interest expenses by 100%. However, that would have left the company with just over $300 million in non-restricted cash on the balance sheet. This new move will allow the company to have about $850 million in cash, before considering any cash flow changes since the end of the latest quarter.Perhaps the biggest key here is that Fairfax and this other investor got a conversion price that was 40% below the previous debt deal. That shows you how bad management has done in recent years, with another bad earnings report coming just a few weeks ago. This would be nearly 90 million shares of dilution if fully converted, whereas the previous debt deal was just 60.5 million shares and that deal was $70 million larger in principal.BlackBerry management now needs to do something with this cash. It cannot just sit there and let the funds earn paltry interest, just to say it has added liquidity since you are paying 1.75% interest. I mentioned in my blog post the idea of a buyback program, and at less than $5 a share, the company could buyback well over 100 million shares of stock. Essentially, BlackBerry could eliminate any possible dilution at a price that's well lower than the $6 debt conversion price.On the other hand, BlackBerry could try another acquisition to try to improve its revenue picture. The company is expected to see roughly a 13% decline in the top line for the current fiscal year, while competitors in the space are growing by leaps and bounds. BlackBerry has made 3 major acquisitions under John Chen, but revenue growth is still a mystery. The Cylance deal, the largest of those purchases, looks very bad now after a major write-down in the latest quarter and the company not even disclosing that segment's numbers.In the end, the BlackBerry debt deal is quite curious. The company could have easily just waited until November to pay back the convertible notes, and it would have wiped out all of its interest expenses. Now, management will have more liquidity to work with but what will it do with those funds? The last time a buyback program was announced, barely and shares were bought back, and acquisitions under this management team have been less than impressive. This new debt deal also has a much lower conversion price, meaning investors could be facing a lot more dilution moving forward. As the chart below shows, BlackBerry shares have been a terrible performer under John Chen despite a massive market rally, so investors are hoping that Wednesday's news could be the start of a turnaround. For now, I remain skeptical.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)"
4369265,24849,2020-08-17T14:15:58-04:00,Ownership by major firms declines yet again.Institutional ownership down below 47.50%.Stock continues to underperform the tech sector.,"About three months ago, I detailed how institutional ownership in BlackBerry (BB) hit a key point, declining below 50% of outstanding shares. Major firms have continued to sell the stock over the past few years, as the business continues to struggle and the stock goes nowhere. Recently, the latest set of data came in, and it showed even more selling by institutions.With just about all firms having reported their end of June holdings data, total shares held in BlackBerry by institutions is below 264 million shares. That's a decline of more than 7.5 million shares from the end of March. As the graphic below shows, there were more sellers than buyers during the quarter, with the average position decrease being much larger than the average position increase.(Source: Nasdaq BlackBerry institutional data, seen here)The largest holder of the stock, Primecap Management, sold just under 3.5 million shares. Over the last three years, this firm has reduced its BlackBerry position by almost 12 million shares. In the summer of 2017, there were four major firms that held at least 21 million shares in BlackBerry, while today there are only two firms that have a two handle of shares (in terms of tens of millions).When I first started tracking this data at the end of Q2 2017, institutions held over 338 million shares of BlackBerry. That number is now under 264 million, despite the fact that the company's outstanding share count has risen by more than 24 million shares over that time. Stock-based compensation continues to dilute investors every quarter, and there is no current buyback plan to offset any of this or reduce the share count.The main reason major holders continue to sell is the lack of progress under this management team. Despite massively reduced estimates, the company still missed on the top line with its latest results. While competitors are showing massive growth, BlackBerry's revenue picture is extremely murky. There was also a huge goodwill impairment charge taken in the quarter, likely due to struggles in the Cylance unit, the major acquisition that John Chen made to help with revenue issues.It will be interesting to see what happens with this management team if results don't start to really improve in the short term. The coronavirus can only be blamed for so much, especially as many tech giants are reporting tremendous results and soaring to valuations in the trillions. Since John Chen was named interim CEO in late 2013, BlackBerry shares have lost almost a quarter of their value. As the chart below shows, that's during a time where we've seen a massive rally in the Nasdaq index.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)In the end, institutions continued their large sales of BlackBerry during the second calendar quarter of 2020. These major firms dipped below 50% ownership during Q1 of this year, and reduced their positions by several million shares more in the latest three-month period. As BlackBerry revenues continue to struggle and the stock goes nowhere, this trend is not likely to reverse anytime soon."
4356357,104053,2020-06-30T09:56:21-04:00,"BlackBerry acquired Cylance at the end of 2018, using a big chunk of its cash on hand.Now, after almost two years, it’s fair to say that the purchase has not paid off.Neither Cylance nor the rest of the company’s software business looks in good shape right now.The big write-off accounted in Q1/2021 is probably related to Cylance.","One of Charlie Munger’s most famous quote states that one of the keys to great investing results is “sitting on your ass.” In the business world, this is probably also true when it comes to M&A operations.It is certainly true for John Chen, CEO of BlackBerry Limited (NYSE:BB), who signed a check in the amount of roughly $1.5B in November 2018 to acquire Cylance, a California-based cybersecurity company which applies AI to the noble art of virus and cyber-threat detection.The acquisition didn’t look bad at the time, as everyone was excited about the company’s product (basically, an innovative antivirus) and both rates and sales growth were terrific (BlackBerry needed to accelerate its top-line growth to attract more investors). Moreover, since the Canadian firm wanted to be recognized as a cybersecurity company, it needed to add an antivirus to its offer (what’s better than a new AV generation?).However, the devil is in the details and, unfortunately, there is quite a long list of details that surely worked against BlackBerry.It’s relatively easy to show a high percentage in growth when the numbers are low: BlackBerry itself showed an impressive growth in its software sales when John Chen took the helm of the company.Yet, when the numbers are already high, in order to sustain growth, significant investments are needed.Usually, at this point, tech companies set up an IPO, which, if successful, can provide a remarkable influx of capital in the balance sheet, which is ideal to boost sales. Subsequently, in a bull market, with a lot of liquidity available, the game can continue with the issuance of new shares to greedy investors who don’t want to miss out on the next big thing, especially in the tech sector.Sometimes it works for both the companies and the shareholders (even though it often ends in a blood bath for the investors, but this is another story).If the so-called unicorn doesn’t go IPO but is bought out, as was the case for Cylance, the story doesn’t change much. If the owners want growth, they will need to finance it. Now, that is not a big issue when the buyer is much fatter than what it bought out, of course. But in case of a merger or quasi-merger, things are more complicated. When BlackBerry bought Cylance, its sales were just about 5 times greater (~$900M vs ~$170M) and, after the purchase, the Canadian firm’s net cash position was about plus $300M. There was another ~$700M of credit line available, in the form of debentures with an expiration date of less than two years. Therefore, burning $4-500M in cash to try to boost Cylance’s top line was actually possible, although somehow risky.At the same time, CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD), which, in 2018, was somewhat of a clone of Cylance in terms of product offer and growth figures, managed to raise as much as $700M with its IPO.Needless to say, the growth paths of the former twin companies started to diverge: in 2019, CRWD increased its top line by 93%, without worrying much about being profitable or burning cash. On the other hand, exactly a year ago, John Chen, understandably, tried to stop the cash hemorrhage at Cylance, which was very evident in Q1/2020.Free cash flow plummeted to a negative $66M in that quarter, after a very promising performance during the previous year (without Cylance). In the end of 2019, the cash flow trend turned towards the positive side, but still considerably less than the year before (see the picture below), and, notably, at the expense of Cylance’s growth, which has stalled in the last two quarters. That is probably why Cylance’s father, Stuart McClure, decided to resign just a few months following the acquisition.Source: Seeking AlphaBlackBerry often stated that it acquired Cylance for its technology, in other words, for the possible synergies with its other software units (UEM and QNX). To be fair, this point is not that clear: it’s unknown if the technical integration has already been completed, but, for sure, the business ex-Cylance has not improved that much.Source: Company’s reports (Author elaboration)In my opinion, John Chen, who sat on a considerable cash cushion at the end of 2018 (about 50% of BB’s total market cap), made a mistake then and, I am quite sure, deep down, he is regretting it now. He was pressured by a huge community of consultants and financial experts to use its cash and he went against his own conservative style. He bought a company for its growth prospects and paid a big price for it. He got dragged into a game he had never played before. Now, after a year and a half, BB’s shareholders have realized they paid for a company more than seven times its revenue, with little or no growth. Moreover, BB spent a big part of its cash for it and now there is little room for other meaningful acquisitions.Last quarter (Q1/21), BB wrote-off a huge sum from its goodwill assets (-$594M). It mentioned the impairment was related to the ‘Spark’ segment, which makes Cylance the main suspect: a considerable part of the enterprise’s value has been destroyed! John Chen would have been much better off if he had stubbornly kept on holding its cash (which also included at least $20M in annual yield) and waited for a market correction before deploying it. Meanwhile, he could focus on the company’s efforts on supporting the fundamental business in order to avoid, for example, a drop in ESS sales in fiscal 2020. Without the Cylance integration distraction, that result could probably have been achieved. Finally, a correction materialized last March, and several buying opportunities arose: for example, MobileIron's (NASDAQ:MOBL) market cap plummeted to ~$350M three months ago. BB could have bought a company which has the same top-line figure as Cylance, already FCF positive and very easy to integrate with its existing UEM business. As I stated here, through this acquisition, BB could become one of the main players in a market which is becoming increasingly interesting (and fast-growing!). Then, it would automatically represent a prime buy-out option itself, especially after the debentures held by Prem Watsa are repaid at the end of this year. All this for roughly one third of what was paid for Cylance (a $500M check would have been more than enough to buy out MobileIron last March).After 18 months, it’s time to take stock of BB’s biggest acquisition: Cylance. Unfortunately, the operation didn’t turn out as expected and now it’s quite evident that BB overpaid for a company that didn’t change its course much. Instead, it somehow contributed to halt BB’s turnaround. BlackBerry shareholders can only look at the mistake as a lesson to avoid such miserable outcomes in the future. The company still has many aces up its sleeve (QNX and its large collection of tech patents, to cite a few). Also, Cylance could hopefully end up achieving a decent (and profitable) growth, but, surely, these missteps must be avoided in the future."
4355584,69905,2020-06-25T08:26:24-04:00,"BlackBerry's revenues are down 20% year-over-year, but management remains optimistic.Although BlackBerry has a strong balance sheet, this is not enough of a reason to be bullish this stock.BlackBerry is overvalued, and investors have little reason to wait around for better days here.","BlackBerry's (BB) Q1 2021 results were weighed down by shelter-in-place. BlackBerry's hard numbers remain uninspiring while at the same time BlackBerry's management team remains very positive towards its near-term prospects, declaring that BlackBerry may even finish fiscal 2021 with non-GAAP profitability. However, I struggle to see how shareholders paying approximately $3 billion market cap for BlackBerry are likely to be positively rewarded. BlackBerry's best-case scenario for fiscal 2021 points towards BlackBerry reaching positive free cash flow. Even then, if that transpires to be the case, investors are still paying an exorbitant multiple. This stock is best avoided.Throughout the past year, I have been bearish BlackBerry and argued that BlackBerry's acquisition of Cylance is masking the contraction of its core portfolio. Below is a quote from a recent article,Close followers of BlackBerry may have spotted a small difference in this quarter's reporting. Please see below how Q4 2020 segment was reported, while paying close attention to the bump in Cylance segment revenue.(Source)As you can see this biggest delta amongst the segment came from that expensive acquisition of Cylance for over $1 billion.Now, please examine this recent quarter's reporting (Q1 2021) below:(Source)As you can see BlackBerry has changed its reporting in order to mask the fact that Cylance's revenue is not growing particularly fast. And more importantly, that BlackBerry overpaid for Cylance.Next, BlackBerry's Q1 2021 results reported that its non-GAAP revenue contracted 20% year-over-year. The reason for this quarter's underperformance being macro headwinds in the auto and other embedded sectors.Going ahead, BlackBerry Unified Endpoint Manager (“UEM”) and Cylance will be renamed Spark platform. BlackBerry's Spark suites combine endpoint security, as well as endpoint management, leaving it well-positioned to combat cyber threats.Looking for BlackBerry's numbers, and you will spot that not only was this quarter's revenue down 20% year-over-year but also that BlackBerry's gross margins contracted by 230 basis points year-over-year.Furthermore, BlackBerry's Licensing segment was down 27% year-over-year. Given that this segment has very high margins this ended up having an overbearing effect on BlackBerry's gross margins. (Note: no tangible figures are reported to substantiate my claim, but this is typical of licensing and royalty revenues.)Meanwhile, during the earnings call, BlackBerry's CEO John Chen remarked that ""all the businesses performed in line or better than our expectations, except for QNX"".Readers should note that QNX Software is put in vehicles and it is the royalty fee that gets reported with BlackBerry's Licensing segment. Chen sounded upbeat and bullish during the earnings call, noting that its Licensing segment is ""off to a solid start for the fiscal year"". In the past, shareholders pointed out that BlackBerry's strong balance sheet was a reason to remain bullish on this stock.I remarked at the time that investors should not base their bullish thesis on a strong balance sheet because a strong balance sheet is only positive if management are above average capital allocators. Furthermore, I charged that CEO John Chen and his team have thus far failed to convince me that they were good capital allocators, with the noticeable example of them dramatically overpaying for Cylance.During Q1 2021 BlackBerry still had a net cash position of close to $350 million. But unless they are able to suddenly improve in their capital deployment behavior, there's no reason to remain invested in BlackBerry for this reason alone. BlackBerry's free cash flow was negative $40 million in the quarter if we include its capitalization of intangibles. This was an improvement from last year's negative $71 million over the same period.Despite this improvement in the use of free cash flow, I question whether BlackBerry's shareholders paying approximately $3 billion market cap for this cash-burning enterprise are getting a bargain? Looking ahead to the end of its fiscal year, BlackBerry believes it will be free cash flow positive, and that it may also be profitable on a non-GAAP basis.On the earnings call, Chen pointed out to shareholders that this quarter's performance overlapped 'shelter-in-place' and that BlackBerry remains strongly focused on achieving profitability while investing for future growth. Even though BlackBerry's financial reporting, for now, contradicts BlackBerry's narrative, shareholders continue to give this company the benefit of the doubt."
4351623,24849,2020-06-02T21:20:40-04:00,Shares pop on news of Fairfax buyout talks.We've seen this story several times before.CEO John Chen likely needs to save face.,"On Monday, shares of BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) rose more than 6% after it was reported that Fairfax Financial (OTCPK:FRFHF) recently held talks to buy the remainder of the company it did not already own. This news brought BlackBerry shares over $5 for the first time since early March, a staggering rebound from its coronavirus selloff low of $2.70. However, the rumor was denied on Tuesday, making one wonder what was truly going on here.I've covered BlackBerry on this site since late 2011. We've gotten to the point where I can't count the number of BlackBerry buyout rumors on one hand. Here are just three examples of these rumors (here, here, here), where almost every large cap tech name has been the potential acquirer at some point, from Microsoft (MSFT) to Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) to IBM (IBM). Every time, the stock has popped on these rumors, but they've not yet once been proven right. In the end, shares fall back and usually go even lower when quarterly results disappoint time and time again.This rumor was a bit different, though. The acquirer would have been Fairfax Financial, which, at the end of March, was BlackBerry's second largest institutional equity owner. Fairfax owns more than 46.7 million BlackBerry shares out of 554 million outstanding. However, Fairfax also owns $500 million of the $605 million in BlackBerry debt outstanding. That BlackBerry debt comes due this November. Barring a miracle, it will not be converted to equity at $10 a share since shares currently go for roughly half of that.If the bonds are paid back, Fairfax will lose almost $19 million in annual interest it is receiving. If the bonds are refinanced like they were last time, I expect Fairfax will be a major player in the deal again. If someone else other than Fairfax acquires BlackBerry (see details on page 94 of annual filing), then an offer has to be made to repurchase the bonds at 115% of par. Of course, with the notes due in just over 5 months, the timing of that may not be applicable if a deal can't be done before then.Going forward, $6.50 is an interesting level to watch. That's the price that BlackBerry shares closed at on the day when John Chen was named interim CEO back in 2013. I'm sure the company's leader would like to see any buyout above that, but, of course, that's a substantial premium over where shares have traded in recent months. It doesn't help the situation that many new age tech names are soaring to market caps of at least $20 billion, like Cylance competitor CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD), Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), etc., while BlackBerry remains with a sub $3 billion market cap.The reason it is so hard to predict a potential buyout price is that valuations in this market are all over the place. Since most of these new tech names don't have GAAP profits, P/E ratios are not calculable, meaning price to sales is usually the most meaningful metric to look at. BlackBerry trades at 2.6 times its current fiscal year's expected sales, which is almost IBM-like dead business territory, while the new age names I mentioned above go for double-digit times their sales. For example, Zoom goes for over 61 times expected yearly sales, and CrowdStrike is at 28 times. Both of those two report quarterly earnings on Tuesday. Of course, these newer names are growing their top lines quite dramatically, while BlackBerry revenues are mostly flattish and roughly 95% off their all-time high.In the end, BlackBerry shares popped on another buyout rumor, a scenario we've seen time and time again, only for the rumor to be denied on Tuesday. This time though, it was a major holder of the company's shares and bonds, not a major tech player, that was mentioned as the potential acquirer. Some might consider BlackBerry ripe for the picking with an unhappy investor base, with shares at the lower end of their multi-year range. I was skeptical when this rumor came out Monday, given the history of BlackBerry takeover rumors, and Tuesday's news basically confirmed that skepticism again."
4377526,104053,2020-10-04T21:07:38-04:00,"Q2 sales beat is just an illusion.Without a one-off in the Licensing segment, it would have reported another miss.The Software and Service businesses keep on struggling.The reporting practice is confused and misleading.","BlackBerry’s (NYSE:BB) Q2/2021 is out, and it shows an impressive beat of both top and bottom line consensus: namely, sales came in at $266 million Non-GAAP against an estimated $240 million, and Non-GAAP EPS was $0.11 vs. $0.02.I know that here many authors usually point fingers at the Non-GAAP accounting numbers. Honestly, I have never done that. On the contrary, I have often stated that BB’s Non-GAAP revenue numbers make sense. Non-GAAP EPS too are consistent: they just leave out some non-cash costs, except maybe the restructuring costs, which, in any case, never exceed a few million dollars per quarter.However, in Q2, BB overperformed even under GAAP, but the problem is that a great part of the company’s results is due to a large one-off License deal.Non-GAAP sales came in, as previously mentioned, at $266 million, +2% Y0Y and +24% sequentially.However, in Q1, the company reported Software & Service revenue at $156 million (Non-GAAP), while in Q2, it was at $158 million. A year ago, this revenue segment (called IoT and BlackBerry Cylance) totaled $185 million. It’s minus 15% YoY: not a cause for celebration!The big positive comes from the Licensing part, which is, in fact, up 86% sequentially and 16% YoY. Specifically, this area now also includes BB’s fees for its old hardware business, a legacy which continues quarter by quarter, even though it will not last forever. In Q2/21, it will not exceed a couple of million dollars, and therefore, will not affect the yearly comparison that much. The problem is that this large gain is kind of a one-time occurrence, as John Chen revealed in the Q2 conference call:Moreover, the guidance for the Licensing business has not changed after this quarter, standing at $250 million, thus leaving very little hope for the second half of the year, namely just about $90 million.On a positive note, the company didn’t burn cash in the first half (see the picture below), but it’s doubtful this trend will continue in the second part of the fiscal year, which should result in about $470 million in sales, considering the reiterated guidance for the full-year top line at $950 million. That means H1 and H2 will have the same revenue, but in the second half, Licensing and Others (the business with highest margin) will contribute much less.Source: Company's documentsAn important shortcoming comes from the way BB accounts for its business.Two years ago, the company divided its business into four parts:After the acquisition of Cylance (FY 2020), the first two parts where combined into IoT, and a standalone category was added for Cylance. It looked like this:This resulted in the loss of an important part of information for the general public, namely the performance of BTS, which owned a crown jewel like QNX and the valuable Enterprise business. This year, we have just this report:Source: Company's reportConsequently, we don’t even know how Cylance performed, except for some laconic information released in the conference calls.Needless to say, this type of communication significantly deprives investors of a complete understanding of the company’s results and it may, eventually, cast doubts on the performance consistency. Actually, it may look like BB’s management is intentionally hiding some decisive information.Such information includes, for instance, the revenue of QNX, Cylance and the UEM business, as already mentioned, but it would also be crucial to know the profitability of the various segments, which BB has never disclosed.I am aware that it is probably difficult to ascribe some costs, like the R&D expense, to the different segments. Nevertheless, this accounting effort should be quite simple, at least for the Licensing business, which seems to be a separate entity.Speaking of Licensing, it is common opinion that the profitability of this segment should be quite high, as it is simply made up of fees for the rights to use BB’s intellectual property, but that is not very consistent with the overall profitability of the group. In fact, if the Licensing sales stay mostly untouched at the bottom line, that means the rest of BB’s business is highly unprofitable - a circumstance that would cast serious doubts on the long-term viability of the entire business model because it relies on a core business that is actually unprofitable and declining. Again, without further clarification, BB’s shareholders can only hope this is not the case.Licensing is likely to be the less transparent part of BB’s business too. I wrote some time ago about this topic, and since then, the situation has not changed much.We know that three years ago, BB sublicensed to Teletry a part of its impressive number of patents (how many was never disclosed), and long story short, the Licensing division has been the only one that, between one-time and non-recurring sales, has been able to steadily grow throughout the years. We also know that the segment, at a certain point, was benefiting from BBM Consumer’s licensing fees (which abruptly ended last year) and from the licensed BlackBerry brand for the manufacture of mobile phones, which also stopped. However, we also don’t really know if the flow of fees from these programs really stopped and when. We don’t know the margins of the segment, but the graph below, related to the top-line sequential growth over the years, speaks for itself.H1/21’s Licensing sales registered another YoY increase, thanks to the outstanding results of the second quarter, as already mentioned, and it’s worth mentioning that last fiscal year was already a record one for this business! According to the company’s own guidance, the growth should slow down in the second part of the year, but anyway, there is clear evidence (or at least little doubt) that the business is strong and valuable.Source: Author’s elaborationSo, here comes the opportunity: why not monetize this (arguably, non-core) business and sell it to an interested buyer? The sale of BB’s tens of thousands of patents would imply a significant offer, and the company could use the proceeds to boost its core business or to acquire new ones hopefully with a better outcome than the one from the last purchase!I believe the company has a clear chance to play an important role in the ADAS market as well as in the future connectivity and IoT landscape, but important investments are needed to further develop BB’s promising products: the funds for these investments could possibly come from a lucrative sale of the company’s patents.BlackBerry easily beat the estimations in Q2/21, posting a yearly and sequential growth.However, the positive performance was driven by a one-off in the Licensing business. The company is becoming increasingly difficult to analyze given the lack of information management provides regarding the state of its many businesses.It looks like Cylance is flat YoY (which is terrible in itself), QNX is suffering and Licensing is in great shape. The guidance for 2021 is also critical, because it seems like Licensing will decelerate (a lot!) in the second part of the year, and consequently, the Software and Service business should perform very well, growing strongly both sequentially and YoY just to meet the guidance.The firm needs a catalyst right now, and it could arguably come from the sale of its non-core Licensing business, which would unlock great value and new funds to boost core operations.Without a meaningful shift, this company (and stock) will probably keep on struggling in an environment which is progressively becoming increasingly cloudy, mainly due to external factors."
4355877,24849,2020-06-26T13:39:31-04:00,Revenues miss despite dramatically reduced estimates.Company takes large goodwill impairment charge.Shares continue to struggle under CEO John Chen.,"After the bell on Wednesday, we received fiscal first quarter results from BlackBerry (BB). While expectations were very low going into this week as management had basically issued a warning at the previous earnings report, the company still found a way to disappoint. CEO John Chen's tenure continues to be one of terrible performance, and this week's report did nothing to change that narrative.For the quarter, the company announced non-GAAP revenues of $214 million. This missed street estimates by a little more than $1.5 million, despite the average street figure coming down by a massive $58 million since the previous earnings report. This top line figure was down from $267 million a year earlier. Since the fiscal Q4 report, analysts had slashed their fiscal year revenue estimate by almost $180 million, more than 15% of the expected total. As most were expecting, management blamed the pandemic for the weak results. BlackBerry did provide the following yearly guidance in its Q1 financial information document, which came in basically in-line with street estimates, unlike CrowdStrike's (CRWD) recent report which had guidance well above the street.While BlackBerry Cylance competitors like CrowdStrike are showing massive revenue growth, 85% in its most recent period, BlackBerry continues to be stuck in the mud. The ongoing struggle to get the top line going in a meaningful way, especially in regards to Cylance, is likely a key reason why institutional investors continue to flee this stock. CrowdStrike's annual recurring revenue (""ARR"") increased 88% Y/Y in its latest quarter, and grew to $686.1M as of April 30, 2020, of which $85.7M was net new ARR added in the quarter. On the other hand, Cylance's ARR has nearly flatlined since BlackBerry acquired it more than a year ago, and management didn't even include this key statistic in its Q1 financial information document.If we look at revenues on a GAAP basis, the year over year decline was from $247 million to $206 million. Licensing and other revenues dropped from $79 million to $58 million. The company also consolidated its prior other categories of software and services revenue into one, with these revenues declining by $20 million year over year to $148 million. As the chart below shows, this was actually the lowest fiscal Q1 GAAP revenue figure BlackBerry has reported under John Chen. Dollar values are in millions.(Data sourced from company earnings reports, the latest of which are found on company IR site, other reports were retrieved via Google search.)When it comes to the bottom line, the company produced a non-GAAP profit of 2 cents per share. However, this number really isn't that meaningful, as the company has beaten here every quarter since August 2015. The company always makes a bunch of adjustments to its results, like taking out stock-based compensation that many world leading technology companies do not take out anymore. To put things in perspective, non-GAAP net income was $12 million for the period, but stock-based compensation was $14 million. BlackBerry's operating expenses were also $9 million lower than they could have been thanks to $9 million in government subsidies resulting from claims filed for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") program to support the business through the COVID-19 pandemic in the quarter.On a GAAP basis, the company announced a massive loss of $636 million. This was mostly due to a $594 million in a non-cash, one-time goodwill impairment charge primarily related to the impairment of the BlackBerry Spark reporting unit. The company's goodwill category on the balance sheet dropped by more than 41% during the quarter as a result. Goodwill and intangible assets remain around 90% of the total stockholders' equity balance. Cash and investments declined from $990 million to $955 million, and the company still has $605 million in principal debt coming due later this year.BlackBerry shares continue to be one of the worst performers in the tech space right now. As the chart below shows, the name has lost more than a third of its value over the past year, while the NASDAQ index has seen a rise of more than 23%. Even another recent buyout rumor, which was eventually knocked down like several ones before, failed to ignite the stock. If we go back to the day in November 2013 when John Chen was named interim CEO, shares are down more than 23% despite a 144% rise in the NASDAQ index. Hiding your money under your mattress would have been a much better decision than holding BlackBerry. Many tech stocks have been hitting all-time highs recently, but this name is certainly not one of them.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)I don't mean to be a broken record, but how much longer can this company stick with John Chen at the helm? He was brought in to fix the hardware division, which was supposed to take 18 months, and three years later he finally gave up after a massive failure. The Good and AtHoc acquisitions were supposed to transform BlackBerry's enterprise offerings. Cylance was brought in for its massive revenue growth. Despite all of the above, plus QNX, Radar, and everything else, the company's non-Licensing revenues were under $150 million in the quarter. Management can keep talking all it wants about this massive addressable market that the company serves, but it's not really translating into any meaningful results. BlackBerry shares continue to significantly underperform the market, and this week's earnings report has done little to change that."

It could be said that is already as low as it is likely to get.,"BlackBerry (BB) rallied on the news that Prem Watsa, one of BlackBerry's biggest shareholders, is considering taking the company private. If I was a shareholder at this valuation, given that I would be highly likely to be underwater already, I would hold onto my shares for now.In other words, although I don't recommend investing in 'hope', I reason that a substantial amount of pessimism is already priced into BlackBerry, given that it already trades for less than 3 times sales.Thus, the risk-reward balance is now roughly equal, and I'm now not as bearish its prospects as I have been.BlackBerry shareholders have taken a strong beating here over the past few years. But the past is in the past. What matters today, is looking ahead. What prospects do shareholders have here? Despite having been tremendously bearish the company since the back end of 2018, when the facts change, I'm happy to reverse my opinion:Source: Author's October 2018 Article on BlackBerryIndeed, admittedly, the news of Prem Whatsa making a move on the company could be something that reignites a potential re-pricing of BlackBerry. But is that all? Does this mean the bullish thesis is back on? Not so fast.This was the graph I used at the start of April:As noted then, and repeated now, BlackBerry acquired Cylance in Q1 2020. Consequently, we'll only be able to tell its organic growth prospects once Q1 2021 gets reported, towards the end of June. I'll repeat this for emphasis: BlackBerry got a meaningful amount of inorganic boost throughout its fiscal 2020 driven by its acquisition of Cylance.So is Cylance is the driver of the thesis here? Again, not so fast.Source: author's calculations, Q4 2020 resultsSometimes amidst all the noise, we forget what's worth what. Here's arguably the most astonishing aspect of the whole BlackBerry story: BlackBerry Cylance makes up 15% of BlackBerry's total revenues, that's it! For the amount of commentary which revolves around this business unit, this is largely immaterial to BlackBerry's shareholders. Moving on, what attracted me to analyze BlackBerry with a fresh pair of eyes was the rumor that Prem Watsa was considering taking BlackBerry private.Given that the company has not denied these rumors, I would give it a fairly substantial weight of say, 65% that it is possible.The question is of course, at what price? To answer this question, we should put a value to BlackBerry first.Seeing that the only segment which is reporting above mid-single-digits growth for BlackBerry is its Licensing business, which was up 9% year-over-year, we should weigh up this segment firstly as it offers the company its strongest potential. We know from the earnings call that there was some pull forward on its Licensing segment. Nevertheless, looking back to the whole of fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019, we can see that BlackBerry's Licensing segment was up close to 15% year-over-year.If that were to continue growing over the next couple of years at anywhere 15% or even 10%, that could be quite a substantial driver for the company. But asides from that, what's Watsa thinking?For the whole of 2020, BlackBerry's free cash flow reached $14 million. One could argue that this figure includes significant restructuring. Without these add-on cash-costs, its free cash flow would have reached $31 million. Consequently, we are left with a company that's priced at north of $2.5 billion market cap and priced at more than 80x free cash flow.On the other hand, Prem Watsa has been invested a substantial sum already, and his cost average appears to be much higher, with John Vincent putting the figure at close to $12.xx.Is Watsa thinking that BlackBerry now trades for less than 3 times its sales, the lowest since 2016, thus, this makes it quite attractive?Furthermore, one could argue that many other SaaS players (software-as-a-service) are being priced at close to 20x sales, thus making BlackBerry's 3x to sales a huge bargain opportunity? I'm unsure.However, relative to other players such as CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD), this makes BlackBerry seem particularly cheap in comparison. Prem Watsa is meaningfully underwater, and I would reason that throwing good money at bad money is not really what the underlying thesis here is. Watsa must believe there's upside potential here, although I struggle to find much.Having said that, given the lack of market opportunities for investors that are not priced with exorbitant price tags, this makes BlackBarry's laggard, ever-so-slightly more attractive."

I bring that month up because it is when BlackBerry (BB) named John Chen as its interim CEO as it looked for a major turnaround. Nearly seven years later, the stock is well below where it stood back then, dramatically underperforming the Nasdaq Index as seen below. Recently, things reached a critical point when it comes to ownership of the stock.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)It was almost three years ago when I first started watching institutional ownership of BlackBerry shares. At that time, I mentioned how a number of the top holders had recently sold, which coincided with a major rally after the company received a windfall from Qualcomm (QCOM). That ownership number, which was based on data from the end of June 2017, showed total institutional holdings of more than 338 million shares, or about 63.7% of BlackBerry shares outstanding at that time.Fast forward nearly three years, and the situation has changed quite a bit. In the graphic below, you can see the current data on this situation, with a key level having recently been crossed. With almost all of the end of March 2020 data in, institutions now own less than 50% of outstanding BlackBerry shares. Total holdings are down nearly 10 million more shares since my last update on this situation nearly a year ago.(Source: NASDAQ BlackBerry institutional ownership page, seen here)The number of shares sold was quite large, but the average sell per firm was also much larger than the average buy. Top holder Primecap sold about 4.9 million shares, almost 7% of its holdings during the period. Iridian Asset Management has now reduced its position to less than 7.2 million shares, down more than two-thirds from the 22.75 million shares the firm owned when I first analyzed this data.So why are so many firms reducing their positions? Well, it has to do with BlackBerry continuing to struggle in this space. The company's most recent earnings report was unimpressive again, and analyst estimates have been coming down ever since. Going into that report, the Street was expecting non-GAAP revenues of $1.15 billion during this fiscal year, nearly 5% growth. The current average is down to $986 million, or a 10% decline. The Cylance acquisition has not done well, while major competitor CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD) continues to grow its top line by a significant amount.I've been saying for years that CEO John Chen needs to be replaced. That idea might gain even more traction if the company continues to disappoint with its results. Investors have been pointing to his success at Sybase for a reason to be optimistic, but they've been using that argument for years now and BlackBerry continues to struggle. With a major debt payment due in less than 6 months, BlackBerry's net cash balance of around $300 million doesn't give it a lot of financial flexibility to make another major move. However, skeptics will say that Chen's major purchases have all been flops, so it's hard to support him doing anything big right now.In the end, BlackBerry hit an inflection point recently. Institutional ownership of the stock dipped below 50% at the end of March as large investors continue to flee the stock. CEO John Chen has not inspired much confidence, and shares continue to dramatically underperform. If the current selling trend continues in the next few quarters, you have to wonder if the company will finally make a leadership change."

While the stock has sold off on mixed forward guidance presenting an attractive opportunity for value diggers, investors should bear in mind that near term gains might not be as pronounced as anticipated due to competitive pressure preventing the mass adoption of BB's cloud platform. As a result, investors should continue to remain cautious.Source: BlackBerryGoogle's COVID-19 Community Mobility Report shows a 44% dip in workplace commute traffic, and a 14% surge in traffic in residential areas in Canada, BlackBerry's home country. A similar trend has been observed in top cities across the globe. This trend favors the adoption of remote work tools for business continuity. BlackBerry has the products to drive more sales via its remote work offerings. This will help it expand its sales pipeline in Q1'20.How robust will the pipeline build be? Let's explore.Assuming this is true, there should be a spike in traffic on BB's website as tech and non-tech workers hit its IP-enabled assets to learn more about its offerings.SimilarWeb shows that traffic has been on a downtrend.Source: SimilarWebFor an apples to apples comparison, here is Okta's (OKTA) trend (identity and access management platform). Source: SimilarWebAnd here is Zoom (ZM).Source: SimilarWebGoogle Trends revealed a little spike in demand for BlackBerry's productivity offering. Here is the latest comparison (Cylance) with CrowdStrike (CRWD). Source: Google TrendsIf BlackBerry is recording a lot of leads, the traffic trend to its IP-enabled assets shouldn't be on a downward slope. I have serious doubts about the robustness of BlackBerry's pipeline build this period. In the least, if consumers are exploring BB's platform, it should be observed at the top of its sales conversion funnel (website visit, app store rank). Assuming we make the argument that sales reps are only selling to key decision-makers who, in turn, deploy these solutions for their employees, then there should be a surge in demand for endpoint solutions like its UEM app in the android play store. No such trend exists. As a result, investors should be careful buying shares of BlackBerry based on its growth factor or robust sales pipeline build in the near term.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)BlackBerry's income statement and recent capital allocation strategies give the vibe that BlackBerry has all the parts of the puzzle in place to start driving growth and ROIC as it hasn't made any new acquisition since Cylance. Its website lists products positioned to drive revenue. Since the acquisition of Cylance, most of the leading cybersecurity vendors have picked up more capabilities in cybersecurity. If the charts laid out in the demand section are considered, it's not clear BlackBerry has what it needs to drive serious growth in 2020. When you throw in the commentary about the 50% revenue loss scenario analysis during the last earnings call, investors will realize that an extension of the current bear trend is already clearing its own path.Source: BlackBerryI have no issues with BlackBerry paying back its convertible debt; the decision is accretive to BB's EPS factor as it saves on interest payment. I'm only concerned about the efficacy of the existing products to drive cash flow, given that BlackBerry now has little cash to make new acquisitions.QNX is vulnerable to the shutdown that has affected the sharing economy as major transportation facilities have been crippled. The UEM platform is the star that is supposed to shine the brightest this period; however, the free 60-day licensing move suggests it's mostly a sales pipeline tool at best. BlackBerry doesn't have ample leverage to ramp its pipeline during this period. It faces serious competition for its collaboration tools from the likes of Slack (WORK), Atlassian (TEAM), Microsoft (MSFT) Teams, and G Suite. If you turn in the direction of endpoint security, that space is equally congested. This means BB needs to have a blowout licensing year to do better than 2019. I doubt that is happening going by the recent guide in its annual report. This effectively creates a mismatch between the bullish SaaS revenue growth narrative and its near term product momentum.Like most companies, BlackBerry's biggest challenge will result from macro headwinds impacting free trade flow across top economies. This will lead to the demise of businesses with huge financial leverage. There will be downsizing and consolidations, which means investors should expect a revision of BlackBerry's total addressable market heading into the next earnings call. If economic activities don't pick up due to a possible extension of the COVID-19 induced lockdown, those UEM call options (free-trial) might expire worthless as the move doesn't reflect BB's product strength.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Competitors like CrowdStrike and Okta recently IPOed. BB's most recent significant capital raise is from the arbitration win with Qualcomm (QCOM). This puts it on the same footing with new cloud security players in terms of its capital allocation incentives. As a result, it acquired Cylance, a move which poured a fresh coat of paint on its rebranding strategy to be perceived as a pure SaaS play.While the street is valuing competitors for their strong growth and momentum factor, BlackBerry isn't enjoying the same treatment as its annual revenue (~$1billion) is where its competitors hope to be within the next two years.Source: Author (base estimate assuming a V-Shaped recovery)Another issue I have with BlackBerry's growth structure is the combo of products under the hood. While most competitors have well-defined platforms with capabilities that ensure they all derive from the network effect, BlackBerry's product unification is more of a recent attempt to streamline the EMM and cybersecurity business under one umbrella. If the strategy is working out fine, the IoT division is supposed to drive strong double-digit growth. Most cybersecurity companies have products that complement each other. Fortinet's (FTNT) product lineup includes capabilities in WiFi, cloud, endpoint, and network security, which are all available to every one of its customers. I find it tough to come up with compelling evidence that BlackBerry's QNX customers also buy Radar, or BlackBerry's Athoc customers also buy its EMM solution. At best, its products are macro complementary, not micro complementary. This means it has products that can be used in different departments of a company, while individual products struggle to become the dominant platform in each department. This means that while upsell and cross-sell will be easy for competitors, BB will struggle to make a similar case to its customers.Source: Seeking AlphaAs it stands, I'm not sure BB is playing the game its competitors are playing. While it has the DNA of a SaaS company, its moves don't correlate with those of its peers. It hasn't created that gung-ho level of DevRel network that makes you go wow via loads of extensible APIs. It doesn't have the usability or latency hack that is driving the virality of products like Zoom, CrowdStrike, or Slack. QNX is the biggest weapon it can use to create a serious uproar in the future of moonshot tech. However, QNX has been substituted from the pool of serious near term growth drivers until the lockdown orders are lifted.Source: AuthorThis means going forward, BlackBerry will be split between improving its profitability factor and its growth factor. Improving the growth factor seems to be the right strategy as it will attract the interest of growth investors who are after the next big thing in tech. It's only going to be dangerous as growth investors don't have the stomach for quarterly revenue miss or single-digit/low-mid-teens growth.Source: Author (highlighted products benefit strongly from the remote work theme)BlackBerry isn't in the best position to take advantage of a period that could have accelerated the success of its years of hard work towards transitioning into a SaaS platform. Investors should fully assess the UEM stack before taking a position. While valuation remains suppressed, there is no strong signal to show that BB will be driving substantial growth after we exit the current bear market.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

The company’s pivot from its iconic mobile paging dominance a decade ago and towards enterprise software is not yet paying off. In 2020, bulls would point to the relative overvaluation of CrowdStrike Holdings (OTC:CRWD) to argue that BlackBerry shares were worth more. But CrowdStrike’s strong business growth justifies the lofty price-to-earnings multiples.BlackBerry is still a “show me” story.The company has come a long way from shifting its revenue from hardware to software. In FY2014, software and services accounted for 3% of the $6.8 billion in annual revenue. In FY2020, nearly all of BlackBerry's $1.1 billion revenue comes from its mobile software from Good, WatchDox, and Secusmart.Image courtesy of BlackberryCylance, along with its Unified Endpoint Management, will be referred to as the Spark platform. Unfortunately, the unit showed no spark of growth in the quarter. Still, it added 279 new customers. New active subscription customer growth topped 15%. These figures will be of limited help for investors trying to calculate the unit’s contribution to profits. Furthermore, shareholders will have to adjust the $594 million non-cash goodwill writedown in the just-reported Q1/2021 quarter.Data courtesy of Stock RoverFrom the balance sheet above, notice the cash on hand declining by 34% compounded annually since fiscal 2018. Goodwill is now back at levels not seen since before several of BlackBerry’s acquisitions. Long-term debt is mostly unchanged in the $627 million range.Unless BlackBerry sells debt or stock to raise cash, investors no longer have to worry about expensive acquisitions that are not adding to the company’s growth prospects.Due to the slow uptake of Cylance, BlackBerry’s software and services revenue will not grow by more than 10-15%. Not a single analyst has a “Buy” rating on the stock. Nine rate the stock as a “Hold,” with an average price target of $5.43 (per TipRanks). More recently, two analysts assigned a price target that implies a 1-year return of between 25.26% and 46.14%:(Source: TipRanks)Investors may build a 5-year discounted cash flow growth exit model to come up with a fair value.

First, I assume EBITDA as a percentage of revenue jumps to 25%. Second, assume that revenue grows by 15% in FY 2022-2023:Slow sales of Cylance is a near-term headwind for BlackBerry shareholders. But on the company's conference call, CEO John Chen said: the product demonstrates “that our AI-led solution and managed service Protect customers from global threat efforts, we were especially pleased by the performance of optics. We surpassed many EDR players who happen to be ranked above in the industry analyst report.”Effective threat detection that applies artificial intelligence may separate Cylance from the other endpoint detection and response (“EDR”) suppliers.

The Sell signal for the stock could quickly reverse and become a Buy signal next. Investors will have to wait another three months. If the company reports better revenue, not just installation counts, from its IoT division, and Cylance sales jump, the stock will rebound.BlackBerry will need Cylance revenue growing at double the rate it forecasts for this year. This is not impossible, but it is unlikely. Investors who bought BB stock should continue holding it. Shares are inexpensive at current levels."

There is no free cash flow and cash burn is a little high for this market environment.,"BlackBerry Limited (BB) investors may be wondering what is going on as the share price continues to be pummeled unrelentingly. In less than 1 1/2 years, BlackBerry stock has gone from ~$13.30 to under $3, a 78% loss in value. In the last month alone, BlackBerry shares have dropped more than 50%.BlackBerry has several headwinds that are working against it. There is a perception that the entire cybersecurity industry is saturated and stocks in this industry have been punished this year, even before the COVID-19 scare. BlackBerry is in the business of cybersecurity since the acquisition of Cylance and is being drawn down with the rest of the industry. The auto industry is crashing as the anticipated global recession ramps up. BlackBerry's QNX operating system is very much dependent on the auto industry. BlackBerry is also working on some assisted driver ventures that will likely be either put on hold or pushed back by perhaps years as demand for vehicles dries up.Although it appears that BlackBerry stock is performing worse than most stocks, in reality, its performance over the last month is in line with the cybersecurity and auto industries as shown below.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)BlackBerry may have an additional headwind as ex-Cylance shareholders are now allowed to sell their BlackBerry shares as of Feb 21.The following scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth illustrates BlackBerry's stock valuation relative to the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red on the scatter plot and represents a typical valuation based on next year's sales growth. As can be seen from the scatter plot, BlackBerry is sitting slightly below the best-fit line, implying that the company is modestly undervalued based on forward sales multiple.Given the turbulent market conditions and the likelihood of a severe recession, I believe that investors should only be looking at strong companies with minimal debt and cash burn along with good free cash flow.BlackBerry has a reasonable total debt to equity ratio of 0.30, no complaints there. But the free cash flow margin is 0%.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)There is no free cash flow headroom in a deteriorating market.I monitor a company's cash burn by examining the SG&A expense relative to sales.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)BlackBerry is spending 71% of its total revenue on SG&A expenses (and R&D). While this level of cash burn is not outlandish for a high-growth company, I don't really put BlackBerry in the high-growth category. This company is really just keeping its head above water and its growth is attributable to the Cylance acquisition. My fear is that the SG&A expense margin could rise fairly substantially in a recession.BlackBerry has several headwinds going against it as the pandemic ramps up. The headwinds include cybersecurity bearishness due to an overcrowded market, the auto industry which is suffering as a global recession is anticipated, and ex-Cylance shareholders that can now dump BlackBerry shares without restriction. I don't feel that BlackBerry has strong fundamentals. Zero free cash flow and higher than nominal cash burn are not enticing in the current market environment. Therefore I can't find a good reason to be a buyer, even with its beaten-down stock price. I am giving BlackBerry a neutral rating."
4335719,69905,2020-04-02T16:18:26-04:00,"Unimpressive results and a lack of guidance opens up too many questions.With $14 million of free cash flow for the year, and only $385 million in cash, the company is left in a precarious position.This stock is still overvalued.","BlackBerry (BB) reported weak Q4 2020 results. The company still cannot provide positive forward guidance to reassure investors. Given its $2 billion market cap valuation, while making less than $20 million of free cash flow, all point out the fact that this company is still best avoided. Here's why:In my previous article in January, I noted:To be absolutely clear, this is not an ""I told you so moment."" The ""past is in the past"" and the time to act is still upon us.Here's my perspective: Knowing something and not acting is the same as not knowing. It's in this vein that I lay out my thesis here:Source: author's calculations, using GAAP revenuesI have frequently contended that BlackBerry's prospects continue to contract and that excluding BlackBerry's acquisition of Cylance, BlackBerry's consolidated revenues continues to decline over time. As a reminder, BlackBerry acquired Cylance in fiscal Q1 2020 (calendar 2019).However, one aspect of the analysis that's missing in the graph above is BlackBerry's guidance. BlackBerry's CEO John Chen said:I have consistently argued that once BlackBerry would get into Q1 2021, once Cylance revenues start to lap with the previous year, BlackBerry's revenues would start to dramatically decline.Having said that, BlackBerry did not deem it adequate to provide any guidance in this turbulent market environment, thus we'll have to wait a further 90 days.I was positively surprised to see that BlackBerry's Licensing unit grew year-over-year to $108 million compared with $99 million in the previous quarter - a 9% revenue growth increase. Chen noted on the call:Further, BlackBerry's Licensing Unit and Cylance were both positive contributors to BlackBerry's Software and services segment, allowing this segment to post solid sequential revenue growth of 6%.BlackBerry beat consensus by delivering $0.09 of adjusted non-GAAP EPS - this astonished me. But then you see that the total diluted number of shares decreased by approximately 10% since the previous quarter. The reason being that BlackBerry repaid its converts that were maturing in November 2020. This means that BlackBerry's gross cash will come down by the $605 million for the convertibles. All else equal, its cash position is now approximately $385 million. Without the repurchasing of its convert, its non-GAAP EPS results would be significantly lower. It's difficult to point towards just one reason. But if pushed, I believe that the combination of poor visibility ahead and overall market uncertainty presently are weighing on the stock after hours. Moving on, investors have frequently noted that BlackBerry is undervalued because it holds a strong cash balance. But this cash balance is now starting to dwindle. Furthermore, given that BlackBerry can hardly be portrayed as a high-growth company, particularly since its growth was a one-off expensive acquisition for Cylance, investors are left with a mature company, with unimpressive growth capable of generating $14 million of free cash flow for the year.Specifically, investors are asked to pay more than 180x free cash flow for a company that's unlikely to return to growing at north of 15% year-over-year any time in the foreseeable future. In fact, I believe that once BlackBerry starts lapping its Cylance acquisition this year, it may not even grow its revenues at 10%. Next, if we consider the impact of a global recession on its operations it's highly likely that many of its customers will attempt to defer all non-essential Blackberry's services, meaning that BlackBerry may even struggle to even eke out 5% revenue growth in 2020.Accordingly, paying such a huge premium for such poor growth prospects is far from a satisfactory investment. In a market with a plethora of awesome and unique bargain opportunities, it's unlikely that many investors would be content to pay north of a $2 billion market cap for BlackBerry. I know that it's frustrating to see one's investment continue to sell off. I have been in that situation countless times before and will be there countless more times in the future.But over time, you learn to become increasingly detached from our investments.Warren Buffett teaches us that a stock doesn't know we own it, and the stock doesn't know what our breakeven point is. The stock simply reflects the company's intrinsic value over time. It's still not too late to exit this investment and preserve one's capital."

Nevertheless, I continue to charge that its shares are already substantially overvalued, priming investors for future disappointment.(source)BlackBerry's CEO John Chen once again noted BlackBerry's acquisition of Cylance for $1.4 billion, hailing it as a large ""commitment"" on his part and declaring it a success.Despite my strong (continued) assertion that BlackBerry overpaid for this acquisition, the truth of the matter is that Cylance has at least not meaningfully detracted from BlackBerry's high margin business:Source: author's calculationsAs you can see, this time last year BlackBerry ex-Cylance posted 75.2% GAAP gross margin, while this latest quarter (Q3 2020), including Cylance it is substantially unchanged -- down 100 basis points (on a GAAP basis).A further rewarding characteristic of the bull thesis should point to recurring software and services revenue, including BlackBerry Cylance, being above 90% in Q3 2020.Indeed, investors crave a very steady and predictable revenue stream, hence, the more predictable BlackBerry's top-line is, this implies the less risky investors will consider the company, lending itself towards being repriced at a higher multiple for its stock.Onto some less positive attributes. BlackBerry Cylance was up 15% year-over-year. Whereas several cyber-security competitors, such as CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD), are still reporting very strong growth rates at close to triple digits, BlackBerry's Cylance appears remarkably lackluster in comparison.Realistically, it should be noted that BlackBerry's Cylance, notwithstanding getting so much attention only generates approximately 15% of BlackBerry's consolidated GAAP revenues:Source: author's calculationsMoreover, BlackBerry's software and service GAAP revenues, excluding Cylance, which are the bulk of its consolidated revenues only grew by approximately 3% year-over-year.In other words, it will be interesting to note how BlackBerry's Q1 2021 will be guided next quarter, once Cylance's acquisition starts to lap itself.Further complicating the bullish thesis is BlackBerry's present valuation.BlackBerry's free cash flow before considering the impact of acquisition and the integration expenses, restructuring costs and legal proceedings was positive $41 million. Over its trailing nine months, BlackBerry's adjusted free cash flow after adjustments was a paltry $9 million (negative before adjustments).Even if investors assume that BlackBerry could consistently generate closer to $100 million of free cash flow, this would imply BlackBerry would be priced at close to 36x best-case optimal scenario.Source: author's calculations; GAAP resultsIndeed the table above shows the dichotomy between old-era companies such as Motorola (MSI) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) where investors are in no way overpaying for a promise of a better tomorrow, versus the likes of ''alluring'' companies such as CrowdStrike and BlackBerry.BlackBerry's Q3 2020 delivered the results which on the surface looked compelling for bullish investors. But digging into its results, I contend there is little reason to consider this stock worthwhile investing in.BlackBerry's growth rates are likely to flatten out during fiscal 2021 (after next quarter) as it starts to lap its Cylance acquisition, whereby in the best case scenario it's likely to generate somewhere between 5%-10% top-line growth.At this point, shareholders will start to question whether it's truly worthwhile paying more than 36x free cash flow multiple for a company growing at less than 10% on the top line."
4333031,24849,2020-03-19T12:44:38-04:00,Shares drop to new low under $3.00.Company must show growth trajectory still in tact.Producing cash flow now becomes a key item.,"When I covered the fiscal Q3 earnings report for BlackBerry (BB) back in late December, I never thought shares would be where they are today. As we get ready for the company's next earnings report, the stock hit a new low below $3.00 on Wednesday as markets have plunged on coronavirus fears. Today, I'd like to look at where expectations stand heading into the Q4 report on March 31st, given how this earnings report could determine which direction the company goes from here.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)In the year ago period, BlackBerry was just starting to integrate Cylance into its overall business and financial picture. The company reported GAAP revenues of $255 million and non-GAAP revenues of $257 million. With not a lot of expenses yet added on from the money-losing Cylance business, BlackBerry reported a GAAP profit of $51 million, or $0.08 per share. After making its usual round of several adjustments, the company reported a non-GAAP profit of $60 million, or $0.11 per share.The to be reported fiscal Q4 period in a couple of weeks will be the final one where BlackBerry will see meaningful year over year revenue growth thanks to the Cylance acquisition. Currently, the street is looking for non-GAAP revenues of $296.5 million, which would be a little more than 15% growth. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to drop to $0.04 as BlackBerry continues to digest more Cylance expenses.In the graphic below, you can see how BlackBerry's revenue segments have evolved over the last seven quarters. Investors are looking to see if IoT will grow year over year, while Licensing should remain strong. Cylance could be the wild card, as management previously cut its non-GAAP revenue growth forecast for that segment to 20% for the year from 25% to 30% due to a shortfall in anticipated customer renewals.(Source: BlackBerry Q3 income statement supplement, seen here)Perhaps even more important will be the company's guidance, especially since this is a Q4 report and we should get full fiscal year 2021 guidance. With the Cylance acquisition anniversary passing, BlackBerry's past year revenue figures are now much higher, meaning growth rates are forecast to decline. The current expectation is for total revenue growth of 7.2% in the current fiscal year, down from roughly 20% in the just finished period. Analysts see things being even weaker in fiscal Q1, currently calling for less than 4.8% growth.The other major item I want to look at is the balance sheet, primarily in regards to cash flow. BlackBerry ended fiscal Q3 with $970 million in cash and investments, but also had $605 million in principal debt. That convertible borrowing comes due towards the end of this year, and since $10 is the price for which the bonds can be converted to equity, that's not likely to happen. Thus, BlackBerry management will either need to pay this money back, depleting its cash balance significantly, or look to refinance to keep some financial flexibility moving forward.In the end, BlackBerry shares have plunged to a new low, and investors are hoping that maybe the Q4 earnings report can reverse that trend. This will be the last quarter with major growth help from the Cylance acquisition, but that segment's forecast was cut at the previous report. As the company tries to grow its software and services portfolio, management must also likely refinance a major debt due later this year. If this report doesn't turn out to be as positive as hoped, perhaps it will be time for management to just sell the company and let someone else pick up the pieces."
4335403,24849,2020-04-01T06:22:55-04:00,"Q4 results mixed as revenues miss, non-GAAP EPS beat as usual.Management doesn't give guidance, yet was supposed to do so on call.Key Cylance metrics continue to weaken.","After the bell on Tuesday, Canadian technology firm BlackBerry (BB) reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results. With the stock having hit a new multi-year low in recent weeks, investors have been hoping this report could help cement a recent rebound. Unfortunately, this quarter's report was not that great, so we might see shares try to retest that low.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)As I discussed in my earnings preview article, investors were looking to see how much growth could be delivered across the key business segments. Unfortunately, the ""IoT"" business fell short of management's expectations due to softness related to coronavirus. As management stated on the conference call, some deals weren't completed, but the hope is that they will once the market stabilizes. On the flip side, Licensing revenues came in ahead of expectations as some deals were completed earlier than expected. That's been a blessing in a number of recent periods, helping revenues to be better off than they might otherwise have been. In total, non-GAAP revenues of $291 million missed Street expectations by more than $5 million. This was the second revenue miss in the last three quarters for BlackBerry, after a previous streak of eight revenue beats in a row.On the bottom line, non-GAAP EPS of $0.09 beat by a nickel per share. This was of course after a number of adjustments, and that entire beat can basically be attributed to two write-downs that totaled $27 million. I don't think analysts were looking for any goodwill impairments. On a GAAP basis, the company is still in the red, even after taking out those one-time charges. BlackBerry basically beats the non-GAAP bottom line 100% of the time, but as I've previously stated, I don't consider this adjusted metric very useful as management excludes key expenses like stock-based compensation.When it comes to guidance, things get a little awkward. The earnings press release said that a fiscal 2021 outlook would be given on the conference call. However, on the call, CEO John Chen said that in light of the coronavirus situation, giving any financial guidance would not be wise, so I don't know why the earnings release said what it did. While the CEO did provide some broad statements on the macroeconomic environment, investors looking for any type of growth forecast here were disappointed, and perhaps a bit confused as well.As a point of reference for when we get more clarity on the situation, analysts went into the Q4 report expecting $1.16 billion in fiscal 2021 revenues, or about 5% growth ($60 million increase). However, I should note that just six months ago, expectations were much higher, with the Street expecting more than double that revenue growth ($130 million). It's hard to say where Street estimates will go from here without any actual guidance, but I can tell you one of the main reasons why they have dropped in recent months.One big item that worries me is the annual recurring revenue number that the company has been talking about in regard to Cylance. Take a look at what has been reported during the fiscal year - with the first three fiscal quarters' details here (Q1, Q2, Q3) - along with what was stated on the Q4 call. As a point of reference, the first part in each of the ARR detail segments in each respective quarterly report is the company's definition of ARR. It's the same in all of the reports, so I won't duplicate that part.Additionally, as I discussed in a previous article, the dollar-based retention rate here has been going down. After what was supposedly six quarters with the figure over 100%, the number decreased to 99% in fiscal Q3. On the Q4 conference call, John Chen only said it was ""over 90%."" The Cylance patterns here are not looking good, especially when a key competitor like CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD) is constantly beating revenue expectations and giving guidance above and beyond what the Street is looking for.As mostly expected, BlackBerry management confirmed that it will likely be paying off the convertible debt that matures later this year. The stock is well under the potential conversion price, and capital markets at this point aren't in great shape. However, if that changes, perhaps it will refinance, just so it has a little more financial flexibility on the balance sheet. If the bonds are just paid off, total cash will equal net cash, since the company will be debt-free, and interest expenses will go to zero. The net cash balance is a little under $400 million currently.I've brought up this subject before, but it must be done again in light of another unimpressive report. When will calls for CEO John Chen to be replaced finally start to increase? He has failed in many large efforts at BlackBerry, notably with the hardware division, and investors are suffering as a result. Take a look at the chart below comparing BlackBerry to the three main US index ETFs since the day he was named interim CEO. Even putting your cash under a mattress would have been much better than holding BlackBerry shares over this time. These numbers are as of Tuesday's close, so the BlackBerry performance number would be even worse if you include the after-hours decline.(Data sourced from Yahoo! Finance - ETFs adjusted for dividends)In the end, it was another unimpressive earnings report from BlackBerry. Revenues missed Street estimates, and that's despite another pull forward of Licensing revenue. Non-GAAP EPS continued its beat streak thanks to many adjustments including some meaningful impairments, but on a GAAP basis the losses continued. Cylance numbers continue to weaken, and management really messed up when it came to giving guidance. Shares declined in the after-hours session as a result, and a retest of the lows could be possible unless investors find something positive to hang on to here."

This transition took longer than anticipated because, as noted by Buffett, business transitions are inherently challenging and requires time to successfully effect change.Since CEO John Chen made the difficult decision of ending mobile phone manufacturing and concentrate on software and services, some have complained of the significant drop in revenue. By pulling data from numerous financial statements, I will show Chen’s decisions were wise and have positioned BlackBerry for growth with high-margin software and services. In the financial numbers that follow, except for per share data, data represents thousands.Chen joined BlackBerry at the tail end of fiscal year 2014, which ends at the end of February. For the years prior, during, and after Chen became CEO the income statements for hardware, software and services indicates the difficulties Chen inherited:Source: blackberry.comAs one can see, revenue dropped by greater than two-thirds resulting in multi-billion dollar losses. However, when I separated hardware from software and services, despite hardware generating most of the revenue, hardware revenue resulted in negative or insignificant gross margins:Source: blackberry.com while software and services, with less revenue, resulted in significant gross margins:Source: blackberry.comIn the years that followed, revenue stabilized, earnings broke even, and shareholder’s equity has started increasing:Source: John Kastanes – data pulled from blackberry.comIn late fiscal 2019, Chen purchased of artificial intelligence and machine-learning cybersecurity firm Cylance for $1.4 billion. During Q3 2019 earnings press release, Chen stated:Chen’s purchase of Cylance has been met with some criticism; particularly for the price paid and slowing acceleration. Chen is known as a frugal individual not willing to overpay for acquisitions so I doubt he overpaid. The acquisition of Cylance required time to integrate into BlackBerry’s software products; however, it appears to be coming together with new products.Initial revenue growth was slow but growth has started to increase with Cylance contributing to most of BlackBerry’s growth. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2020 BlackBerry reported:Source: blackberry.comThree and nine month GAAP revenue by product:Source: blackberry.comThree and nine month non-GAAP by product:Source: blackberry.comFor fiscal 2020, Chen is comfortable with total company revenue of approximately $1.1 billion in non-GAAP and $0.06 in non-GAAP profitability. If BlackBerry were able to achieve that target, it would mean approximately $300 million in revenue during Q4.During the Q3 earnings call, Chen made two statements that caught my attention. First, Cylance will be accretive in fiscal 2021; and second,Analyst Trip Chowdhry from Global Equities Research asked a question pertinent to Chen’s statement above. Chowdhry asked if BlackBerry’s pipeline with the U.S. government was progressing. Chen replied with this statement:If BlackBerry’s products meet U.S. government requirements, that could become a source of recurring stable revenue.BlackBerry has $605 million convertible debentures on its balance sheet that pays 3.75% or $22.69 million per year. These debentures mature November 13, 2020 and each debenture is convertible into common shares at a price of $10 per share. BlackBerry has $970 million in cash and investments: if the debentures don’t convert, BlackBerry has the resources to pay the debentures and will result in increased earnings.BlackBerry doesn’t pay a dividend; however, investors may want to consider selling options to generate income. Investors owning shares may be comfortable giving up their shares for $10 per share by selling January 2022 $10 calls. Each call option represents the obligation to sell 100 shares if they are called. As of the time of writing this article the mid point between the bid-ask was 61 cents; if you sold the call for 61 cents that would amount to $61.00. If share price remains below $10 through expiration date, you will continue to own those shares and pocket the $61. If share price rises above $10, you have limited your upside to $10 or $1,000 for each call option sold.A second strategy for advanced investors is selling January 2022 $5 puts. Selling a $5 put option requires you to accept purchasing shares at $5 through the expiration date. At time of writing this article the mid point between the bid-ask was 64 cents; selling a $5 put would amount to $64.00. If share price remains above $5 through expiration, you don’t have to purchase additional shares and pocket the $64. If share price falls below $5, you will likely be assigned and must have sufficient funds in your account to purchase 100 shares or $500 for each put sold.John Chen was hired by Prem Watsa to stabilize BlackBerry. This required eliminating low-margin hardware manufacturing and developing and acquiring high-margin software companies resulting in significant revenue decreases. To offset hardware revenue declines Chen purchased cybersecurity firm Cylance for $1.4 billion in late 2018. The integration of Cylance with BlackBerry’s software products required time and resources. Chen appears to have overcome these challenges with revenues increasing and earning growing.BlackBerry is small compared to other companies in the space it competes in; however, BlackBerry’s products are gaining market share as demonstrated by increasing revenue. While this bodes well, this is a hypercompetitive space and things can reverse quickly. If you are contemplating investing in BlackBerry, keep your purchase size that will allow you to sleep if BlackBerry hits a rough patch.If you own shares and are content with exiting at $10 per share, consider selling January 2022 $10 calls to generate income while owning shares. If you would like to purchase shares at $5, consider selling January 2022 $5 puts. I have sold both options as a means to generate income and add shares at lower prices. Keep in mind you must have sufficient funds in your account or you will have to pay high margin interest costs.This is the start of a new year and BlackBerry is now a contender in cybersecurity that could generate significant revenue and good earnings. With a healthy balance sheet, good product offerings, and intelligent management I like BlackBerry’s prospects. Consider a small investment in BlackBerry I believe you will be better off in the future."

SNSR offers an investment in a high-growth market segment along with a fraction of the risk posed by BlackBerry.In my last article, I mentioned that Steve Capelli was moving into the role of CRO and that I believe that it is a positive move, but not to expect a positive impact on revenue for at least 6 to 12 months.

""Double-digit percentage increase"" is vague enough that I find it concerning.In addition, there is some confusion over exactly what the 2020 non-GAAP revenue growth outlook actually is, whether it is 23%-25% or 20% as pointed out in BlackBerry Makes Some Progress.In my last article, I indicated that BlackBerry's stock was substantially undervalued, hence the reason for the speculative buy.

The above chart shows one of the three scatterplots: EV/forward sales estimate versus Next Year's forward revenue growth estimate.It can be seen from the above chart that BlackBerry sits below the best-fit line and is therefore still undervalued relative to its peers. The best-fit line has an R-Squared of 0.66.I have new techniques to analyze fundamentals. One of them is to plot the SG&A expense margin versus next year's estimated earnings margin as shown in the scatterplot below.(Source: Generated by private software used in the Digital Transformation Marketplace)BlackBerry has a higher SG&A expense margin than the majority of stocks in my custom digital transformation stock universe. This observation is a result of BlackBerry being more than 1 standard deviation above the best-fit line. The R-Squared value is 0.63. Part of the reason for higher SG&A expense could be due to the acquisition of Cylance and perhaps efficiency will improve once Cylance is fully integrated. Time will tell, but for now, expenses are higher than desirable.Three months ago, I gave BlackBerry a speculative buy rating in order to take advantage of the collapse in stock price. The stock has now recovered to the target price and it is time to exit this stock.While BlackBerry may continue to demonstrate a turnaround in fortunes, I don't find the current state of the company to be remarkable.

The company works across multiple verticals, which comprise transportation, government, education, healthcare and manufacturing.With the EV around $3 billion and annual revenue base of about $1 billion, we see the EV/revenue ratio of 3.7x as appropriate at this time, which translates into the target price of $7. At this point, we believe that BB has taken much of its ""medicine"" already, and the bottom may have been reached. We are cautiously optimistic about the drivers below, which, in our view, translate into a turnaround story of sorts.See Acceleration in IoT Business: We believe this business will accelerate during the quarter: from -5% Y/Y to -2.3% Y/Y, driven mostly by new clients. Further, we expect the BTS segment to grow at least 17% Y/Y, while the ESS segment grows roughly 9% Y/T. All of these estimates denote a serious improvement from the previous quarter, which we believe marked a short-term bottom for the company.BlackBerry QNX as the Core Driver of BTS: We expect QNX to demonstrate a solid contribution to the BTS revenue base, with QNX growing aggressively, despite the pressures on the auto production. Customers continue to actively spend on BB software in both current and future auto designs, which should help with ARPU down the road.Radar Segment to Benefit From New Clients: If last quarter BB added 8 new clients, such as Labatt, we believe that this quarter should have at least 10 new customers, particularly since the pricing effects are so favorable. Further, we expect incremental business from existing companies, such as Lowe's (NYSE:LOW).Cylance to Show Momentum, Albeit Possibly Not This Quarter, But 2020: We are projecting 26% Y/Y growth in 4Q, which is as much as 400 bps of acceleration from the prior quarter, driven by robust growth in active subscriptions in professional services and manufacturing segments. At the same time, we believe that momentum may be even stronger in 2020, when financial services traction kicks in, and we may see Cylance grow at 35%+ Y/Y.Oil & Gas Industry to Show Further Traction: We see this as a new and developing vertical for BB, destined for some bumps along the road, given the fluctuations of oil prices, but at the same, we believe that there will much traction beyond 2020, once the vertical fully develops. Management was upfront about it in the past: ""While we are not satisfied with the short-term results, the timing of these changes is important as we are entering a refreshed cycle of our security and communication products that are well-suited for the current security trends.""Don't Forget Service Access Fees: As we meticulously model the BB business, we are also cognizant of service access fees, which we estimate to be around $6 MM during the quarter. This is a fairly small, but often overlooked contribution, which we actually expect to trend at a $40 MM run rate for the year 2020.Macro risks: Economic slowdown has a risk of harming BlackBerry's business.Tariff risks: The trade threat is substantially tied to macro risks, which is mainly manifested via tariffs; hence, there is inevitable caution that companies have toward investments as a result.Technological risks: Failure along any step in the supply chain can lead not only to business slowdown, but to a branding risk, from which BB may struggle to recover.Regulatory risks: The security software sector cannot escape these risks, particularly when it comes to the international segment."

It has fallen by nearly 50% since I first argued that investors should sidestep this investment.Source: author's coverageHaving said that, what matters for investors today is what happens going forward and not looking back.For new readers, I'll note that I specialize in deep value. In essence, I pick out securities that have fallen in value where I attempt to selectively choose stocks that are most likely to succeed in turning around, meanwhile buying them cheap in the expectation to sell them higher.On balance, I find that BlackBerry is more likely to cause investors to realize further losses in the future than strong upside potential.Accordingly, even though BlackBerry is cheap today, it is likely to go onto to become cheaper in the future.The graph below notes BlackBerry's GAAP revenues:Source: author's calculationsThe problem for investors is that this revenue growth rate is not supportive of a company trading for approximately $3 billion market cap. Consequently, in an attempt to bolster its revenue under the premise of providing investors with more leading indicators, BlackBerry focuses investors' attention on its non-GAAP revenues instead.For example, for Q2 2020, BlackBerry's adjusted revenue growth hit 22%. However, its GAAP revenue, as the graph above shows, is more muted at 16%. Readers can no doubt perceive the problems. A company growing at 22% and a company growing in mid-teens are two very different sorts of companies.Moving on, depicted below are BlackBerry's main revenue segments:Source: author's calculationsThe problem for BlackBerry is that it derives more than half its revenues from its IoT revenue sources. However, this segment is posting unimpressive growth rates.Source: BlackBerry's Q2 2020, Y/Y revenue comparisons.BlackBerry's latest result demonstrates that, rhetoric aside about BlackBerry 'retooling' its sales force, the numbers largely speak for themselves.It should be noted that BlackBerry's CEO John Chen was absolutely correct to recognize that cybersecurity would be an explosive sector in high demand going forward.The problem for shareholders is that, with the passage of time, it appears increasingly likely that, in an effort to participate in this sector at any cost, BlackBerry may have overpaid for Cylance. What makes me say so?Firstly, deploying $1.4 billion in cash for Cylance, a company that is unlikely to generate $180 million in revenues in fiscal 2020, is a steep premium.Secondly, Cylance's sequential GAAP growth appears to be less 10%. For such a small enterprise to already be tapering its revenue growth rates in a rapidly expanding sector, it does bring into question the value proposition of this asset?Howard Marks declares that there is no such thing as a value trap, that either business has value or it does not.(Source)Rather than getting caught up in semantics, I believe the correct process here is rather than question whether or not BlackBerry has any value left, the process is to defer our thought process to Charlie Munger:(Source) Invert, always invert.How much could a business, which is growing in the mid-teens, which is barely GAAP profitable, be worth if said business's revenues reach around $1.2 billion?That would be a much more interesting answer. But my fundamental belief is that this business is not worth paying up 3 times its forward revenues.BlackBerry has numerous moving parts. However, I have attempted to simplify the investment process by pointing out vitally important questions, such as what are its go-forward growth rates and potential rewards for shareholders who are asked to pay up more than $3 billion to participate in this opportunity."

Today, I'll take a look at where expectations stand and what investors should focus on most.With a few days left for things to possibly change slightly, analysts are currently looking for non-GAAP revenues of about $276 million and non-GAAP EPS of two cents. These numbers compare with $228 million and five cents, respectively, from the year ago period. As a reminder, last year's period did not include any results from Cylance, with that major acquisition bringing in a large share to all of the top line increase, as well as losses that are pressuring the bottom line a bit.The company has beaten on the bottom line every quarter since August 2015, primarily thanks to a multitude of non-GAAP adjustments, so it wouldn't surprise me to see another beat there. The earnings report three months ago showed the first revenue miss in more than two years, however, so we'll see if that was the start of a trend or the company gets back to beating on both lines. Also, we may see things change in the future regarding revenue reporting with the SEC looking closer at companies that are using adjusted revenue figures in their reporting. In the first two fiscal quarters of the year, Cylance has basically accounted for all of the revenue growth, especially when looking at a GAAP basis. That's basically because legacy businesses are still being bled down to zero, while the IoT segment (the largest revenue segment) isn't doing very well. This is where things like Radar, QNX, and the enterprise are housed, and it's seeing very low growth right now. This segment is really the major part of BlackBerry's future, so it needs to start showing improvement. Licensing revenue growth has offset legacy business revenue declines at times, but BlackBerry also needs to get the top line growing outside of Cylance. We're only a few months away from lapping the Cylance purchase anniversary, at which time investors will get a very clear picture at how fast things are growing. For the May 2020 period, the first where we have a fully lapped quarter, the street is looking for revenue growth of just 3.4% currently.It was in that last disappointing earnings report where CEO John Chen stated that top line troubles were mostly as a result of softness in the enterprise software and services arena. He said that the rough patch could last another two quarters, so I'll be looking to hear if that sentiment has changed at all. This resulted in the yearly revenue growth forecast being cut at the top end, with the latest range at 23-25% for the fiscal year, so investors should watch for any updates there, especially after the September World Tour kicked off to highlight BlackBerry's strengths in this space. Management will also need to show that it can get the top line going while also improving GAAP margins. Cylance was losing money when acquired, so BlackBerry is reporting sizable operating losses even after benefiting from a re-evaluation of its debt. In fiscal Q2, for instance, the company's operating loss was $66 million on just $244 million in revenues when excluding the debt adjustment, which is a loss of 27 cents for every dollar of revenue.I'm also curious to see how the balance sheet looks. Recent quarterly losses have resulted in some cash burn, but the net cash balance was over $300 million at the end of fiscal Q2. In less than a year, just over $600 million in convertible notes come due, but with a conversion price of $10, they are not currently forecast to be exchanged for equity. Either the debt will have to be repaid, or management will look to refinance this issuance again.I mentioned in my opening that it has been a tough year for shares, and that is evident in the chart below. Investors may be feeling even worse, however, when you consider how strong the stock was during Q1. Shares closed Friday 30 cents above their 50-day moving average, a key trend line that has finally leveled off recently. A good report would get this key momentum indicator moving higher, but if shares drop below it, this would provide more resistance and could easily send the stock back under $5 in the near term.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)One other item I'll be looking for this week is an update on whether or not the management structure is changing again. It was in early November when the company's COO left the firm after only about 10 months on the job. John Chen was going to take over this responsibility at that point, but will the company find a new leader for that position or keep Chen overseeing it? You can make the case that he has been a very disappointing CEO so far, so putting even more on his plate would seem to work in favor of the bear camp. Another bad report this week could put even more heat on the company, with the potential for investors to demand changes at the top.In the end, BlackBerry really needs a strong earnings report this week if it wants to salvage its stock price for this calendar year. The revenue warning that came at the fiscal Q2 report sent the stock to new multi-year lows, and while there has been a recovery from the bottom, shares are still down 20% for the year. The company needs to get its top line going, and I'm not just talking about growth coming from the Cylance acquisition. Management also needs to improve its margins, as large GAAP losses usually lead to cash burn. What do you see being announced this week? I look forward to your comments below."
4308256,104053,2019-11-21T09:51:13-05:00,"BlackBerry’s ESS business needs a boost.Cylance integration and Spark will probably serve the company well.MobileIron could fast track the process and provide BlackBerry with thousands of new clients, positive free cash flow and valuable IP.The recent drop in MobileIron’s stock price could be the right opportunity. The company is now fairly valued.","BlackBerry's (NYSE:BB) ESS business has given its shareholders some headaches in the last year.As I discussed here, in order to execute his turnaround strategy, John Chen leveraged on this segment, once focused only on the mobile device management application (BES), and turned it into a multi-layered management service enterprise. In fact, it now covers all the different areas, through BBM for Enterprise (both as standalone intranet and as part of the EMM package), the BBM platform as a service, Workspaces (securing electronic document transfer), secure networked crisis communications (AtHoc), and secure text and voice (SecuSUITE).The business grew from $148M in FY2015 (the first year with John Chen at the helm) to $423M (Non-GAAP) in FY2018, at an impressive CAGR of 30%, thanks to a smart M&A activity, which culminated in the acquisition of Good Technology, one of BB's main competitors in the field at the time.Then, they came across some problems. The FY2019 results show a 15% decrease, due to a change in their accounting method, which prompted the Canadian company to change how they marketed their products (from multiyear licensees to subscriptions).For H1/2020, the picture is not better, with the segment decreasing by probably 5-10% YoY and giving BB's short sellers a good excuse to sound the alarm. However, the future doesn't look that somber, because BB's offer will soon benefit from the Cylance integration and Spark will enter its second year of development.Moreover, the decline in gross revenue experienced by the ESS business is probably overshadowing a growth trend of its recurring revenue, due to the shift towards a full subscription model. In other words, what really decreased was the non-recurring revenue.With that said, it's clear that now this sector is the main (if not the only) area of improvement for the Canadian security company. BB's priority now is to keep up with its big competitors, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and VMware (NYSE:VMW), as well as defend its market share in this fast-growing business.And, as far as the market share is concerned, it is quite difficult to find reliable sources showing the exact composition of the ESS market. I trust the one from Daniel Bartus, which I already proposed in one of my past articles, even though it is a bit dated now.Source: Daniel Bartus, Bank of America Merrill Lynch-Author's elaborationNevertheless, all the evidence suggests that BB is maintaining a solid third position, behind the two previously-mentioned big fish, with a little over 10% of the total market, followed by a small, interesting outsider: MobileIron (NASDAQ: MOBL), which pioneered this arena, together with BB, no more than 5 years ago.MOBL is a relatively small company that has managed to successfully carve a niche in the EMM industry (6-7% of the total addressable market) through a mobile-centric approach applying a zero-trust philosophy in the management of the enterprise's connected devices.Source: Company's presentationIt has a whole plethora of customers (more than 16,000) in several verticals and regulated industries, like manufacturing, oil & gas, automotive and financial institutions.This is the main reason why BB should be interested in this hypothetical deal: the types of customers of the two companies are somehow complementary. BB is strong amongst governmental agencies and healthcare operators and is trying to expand on those verticals in which MOBL is already well-established.The business is constantly improving, as shown in the chart below:Source: Company's presentationAs highlighted in the picture, they are also switching to a subscription-based model, just like BB.The recurring revenue has been increasing more than the total comprehensive sales:Source: Company's presentationThe operating cash flow has been positive since H2/2017 and the company has been FCF-positive since 2018.Following a strong correction after the last earning release, MOBL's total cap decreased to roughly $500M, which represents an acceptable entry point for long-term investors.To make a long story short, the acquisition of MOBL could drastically improve BB's ESS business, launch the Waterloo company as the main player in this area and make BB itself an acquisition target. Moreover, it could add several valuable patents to BB's licensing business. All this without deteriorating its financial shape. Instead, as we have already seen, MOBL could immediately become accretive to its cash flow and neutral to its net income. However, BB's balance sheet may suffer if a part of its liquid assets is converted into intangibles. Therefore, it becomes obviously crucial for BB to get a good deal even if the recent fall of MobileIron's stock price gives BB some wiggle room.BlackBerry has about $1B between cash on hand and short-term investments.Almost 70% of that should be used to pay off a convertible debt tranche, which will expire in one year.Of course, this doesn't mean that the company has a purchasing capacity of $300M or $400M. It's worth mentioning that the convertible's subscriber is also BB's main shareholder: Prem Watsa, who also happens to be John Chen's biggest sponsor. Therefore, it would be relatively easy to negotiate a credit line extension, probably at even better conditions, until, let's say, November 2023 (date of John Chen's exit). The conversion price could also be lowered to around $8-9 in exchange for a lower interest.BB's SP could possibly surge to more than $10 per share within a year if the market finally recognized the intrinsic value and the long-term potential of the Canadian company. If that was the case, its debt would automatically be converted into equity.With that said, how much could MOBL be worth?The California company has managed to maintain a long-term and stable growth path, which allowed it to reach operating cash flow positivity last year and, most likely, profitability this year.Moreover, its recurring revenue rate is considerable (about 90%) and its gross margin has always been remarkable (80%). With these premises, if the growth trend keeps the pace with its total addressable market, MOBL will keep on increasing the FCF in the years to come. Thus, if we discount the expected future cash flows, we will be left with a figure of roughly $250M, to which I would add around $100M, coming from the current assets minus the deferred revenue.As far as value is concerned, MOBL has an equity value of about $40M, which does not take any intangible assets into account. I would add at least $350M to that, given the considerable R&D activity the company has always been capable of financing.All this considered, I would assign a fair value of about $400M to the company.And yet, this is a fair value for a stand-alone company. BB could add considerable value to the equation thanks to multiple potential synergies and the possible monetization of MOBL's patents.Together with BB, MOBL's fair value could easily reach the $600M threshold.Therefore, I think John Chen should make a bid of around $7-800M to acquire its competitor. With MOBL's current total cap of less than $550M, at the time I am writing this, I think that an offer bringing a 40% upside to the company's market value has a concrete chance of being accepted, especially after the negativity and skepticism sparked by the last unfavorable earnings release.Undoubtedly, BlackBerry's main area of improvement is its ESS business. It started declining six quarters ago, after the company switched to a full subscription model, and was never able to reverse the downside trend.If BB manages to successfully turn this segment around, this alone will be enough to see John Chen's long-term strategy in a completely different light.An interesting option to help the process would be an acquisition.I believe that, at the right price, MobileIron would be a perfect fit for BB."
4303341,24849,2019-11-06T15:39:22-05:00,Company COO leaves after less than 10 months on job.Most important business segment now goes to CEO John Chen.Shares could face technical resistance in near term.,"After the bell on Monday, we got what I believe to be some troubling news out of BlackBerry (BB). The company announced that its COO, Bryan Palma, was leaving to pursue other opportunities. Normally, I wouldn't make such a big deal of one executive leaving, but the timing of this departure combined with the company's most recent struggles make me a bit worried.The biggest problem here is that Palma just joined the firm in late January, with a major press release from the company talking about this being such a great hire. Palma was hired to lead the Internet of Things segment, the company's largest revenue division. He was praised by CEO John Chen for his ability to deliver growth for strategic industry providers, and was said to deepen the firm's executive bench. BlackBerry praised Palma's experience at firms like Cisco (CSCO), Boeing (BA), HP (NYSE:HPQ), and Pepsico (PEP), and the new hire provided the following statement:At a time where BlackBerry's IoT business is the key to its future growth, it's alarming to see the segment's leader not even last a year on the job. Initially, there were no details on what opportunities he is going after, so it's not like he also was named to some other big job at the same time. The press release talking about him leaving was just a couple of sentences, not even mentioning any accomplishments, wishing him good luck, or anything else. It's always amazing when firms have these long releases when someone is hired, but when they leave you get just a couple of sentences.What bothers me most is that BlackBerry is now saying that the IoT business will be led by CEO John Chen. Strangely enough, the COO departure comes on the anniversary of Chen being announced as interim CEO on 11/4/2013, but Chen's leadership has been rather poor. BlackBerry has bled more than 95% in revenue from its peak, failed at some key turnaround efforts Chen that he was supposed to be able to fix, and this has resulted in shares down almost 14% in six years. As a comparison, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is up nearly 96% over this time.In the latest disappointing earnings report, it was the IoT business that perhaps was the worst performer. Why should investors be happy now that the company's CEO, who's done a terrible job over the years, is now taking the reigns? It worries me that there wasn't even someone who could be promoted to take the spot, especially considering the firm talked about such a deep executive bench when Palma was hired.I wonder if the latest news will put an end to the recent rally in BlackBerry shares seen below. As the chart shows, the name was heading higher and potentially about to meet its 50-day moving average. This key technical line could provide resistance if shares don't break above it, but if they do, it could turn into a line of support.(Source: Yahoo Finance)In the end, BlackBerry investors have to be disappointed with Monday's news. Having a COO leave less than a year on the job, after he was praised as a tremendous hire and was so happy to lead the IoT segment transformation, is a major red flag in my opinion. With no news on where Bryan Palma is heading just yet, it would be even more troubling if he left with no new position all lined up. At a time where the IoT business needs to shine, investors might not have much confidence with CEO John Chen leading the segment, especially as his time at the helm has been a tremendously tough one for shareholders."
4302309,105197,2019-11-04T15:18:33-05:00,"BlackBerry’s fall from among the top players in the smartphone pecking order was as phenomenal as was its rise to the top.The company has been desperately trying re-align its portfolio to remain relevant in a world dominated by cloud and edge.The pessimism around BlackBerry has led to the markets ignoring the possible value in the company’s patents, which we think can make the stock a multi-bagger.","BlackBerry (NYSE: BB) was previously known as Research In Motion (RIM) and was a pioneer in smartphone development. The company lost out to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet/Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the mobile operating systems and the commoditization in hardware also did not help the BlackBerry’s cause. However, during its heyday, BlackBerry amassed a trove of patents. While the consensus puts the value of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio at around the company’s current market cap, we think BlackBerry’s IP could make the stock multiply at least 3x from its current levels.In a simplistic representation, if the server is the hub, the edge is the spoke. The edge is where much of the data will reside in the future due to the connected devices and need to get last-mile information. The natural consequence of last-mile focus has been the pivot in the business model of companies focusing around the edge towards the edge. Including the companies that were already playing at the edge, analysis of edge data has spawned a new generation of security. While the likes of Splunk (NASDAQ: SPLK) are looking at data at the machine level, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO), etc. are analyzing traffic trends to preempt threats.Source: Microsoft Press ReleaseNot only has the endpoint security market become overcrowded but also have major players starting tying up to enhance their existing solutions. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) had tied up with Akamai (NASDAQ: AKAM) for Akamai's CDN (content delivery networks or last-mile caching) solutions. Considering Azure’s growing ecosystem, a strong edge network bolsters the case of connected devices (gaming, etc.) to be housed on Microsoft’s Azure network.For BlackBerry, the focus was on secure messaging and a premium user experience – BlackBerry was a leader in mobile when the world was trying to transition to the mobile. Considering that now it’s a ghost of its past self, BlackBerry has done the right thing by re-purposing its mobile-first portfolio to cater to the rising connected devices ecosystem. However, BlackBerry, a consumer product company that lost 40% of its market share in four years to newcomers in the smartphone space, begets the question: If BlackBerry could not hold its bastion against iOS and Android, how can one expect BlackBerry to carve out its niche in the increasingly complex endpoint security and connected devices markets (which are already dominated by iOS and Android)? The best answer is possibly BlackBerry’s stock price performance over the years.Data by YChartsEvidently, the market has been less than enthused with the BlackBerry management’s consistent hope about the transformation of the company’s business.We see BlackBerry not as a potentially fast-growing SaaS company but as an undervalued patent elephant. Since the company’s execution has left a lot to be desired, we will only be discussing the value of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio.Per the company’s 40-F for the period ending February 2019:The value of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio was around $3 billion in 2013. Another way of looking at this patent portfolio is that BlackBerry was estimated to have a revenue run rate of $200 million per year from this patent portfolio, which at a near zero marginal cost comes to $2 billion for the remaining duration of 10 years ($200 million X 10 = $2 billion).The estimates of $2-3 billion rely on the third-party analysis or have been arrived by adding all the expected revenues for 10 years out. The 10-year approach is more applicable to an asset, where the use cases are defined. Applying the same framework to patent valuation may not necessarily be correct since the use cases for an asset will be limited versus that of a more fundamental element such as a patent. As an example, patents on telegraphic communication will have many more use cases across the value chain of communication and across industries versus a hotel (as an example of a hard asset that can be valued by adding cash flows) where the use cases will be limited to renting or selling the asset.In the case of BlackBerry, analysis suggests that the company has patents spread across communication software and hardware, which further increases the potential use cases that BlackBerry’s IP could have.SourcePer the analysis presented, dated December 2017, BlackBerry had a total patent count of 20,253 (7,016 US and 13,237 worldwide) and patent application count of around 20,000 (nearly 40,000 less 20,253). Per the US Patent Office, BlackBerry was granted 337 patents (-50% y/y) in 2018. Assuming that BlackBerry also got worldwide patents in a ratio consistent with that of existing ratio worldwide patents to US patents, BlackBerry possibly got 636 patents (=13,237 / 7,016 times 337) in 2018. Thus, the total portfolio comes to 21,226 (= 20,253 + 337 + 636) patents at the end of 2018.Per the company’s end of February 2019 filing, BlackBerry’s total patent and application count was 37,500 which would imply an application count of nearly 16,274 (37,500 less 21,226).Based on the value of $2.5 billion (average of $2-3 billion as the estimated value of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio), the price per patent comes to $117k (= $2.5 billion / 21,226). To put this number in perspective, IPOfferings, an IP research and advisory firm, had published the value of deals and data for price per patent during the 2012-15 period to be much higher.Source: IPOfferingsOur estimated price per patent is nearly 74% (1- 117/449) lower than what IPOfferings reported for 2015.The article in 2013 had claimed a $3 billion value of the patents, and then in April 2018, the royalty from patents was estimated at $200 million. It is quite strange that since 2013, the value of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio has hovered around $2-3 billion when the use cases of technologies owned by BlackBerry have grown. Even at $2-3 billion, the price per patent comes out significantly lower than what industry numbers were four years back in 2015. Thus, quite clearly BlackBerry’s patent portfolio has been underpriced by the market.Accordingly, we value BlackBerry’s patent portfolio based on market numbers. Considering that during 2015-18, the price/patent should have gone up (the addressable market for technology applications has been expanding), we need to adjust the 2015 reported price/patent to reflect what the price/patent would have been in 2018.As a proxy for the potential appreciation in the market price of patents, we use the change in S&P 500 Information Technology Sector index during the same period and adjust the 2015 price/patent by the change in the index during this period.Source: S&PAt the end of 2015, the index was at 721, and at the end of 2018, it was at 1,088. The net change during this period was 51%. Adjusting the 2015 price/patent, we get $678k ($449k times 1.51) as the price/patent at the end of 2018.Before we estimate the value of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio, let us also consider the 16,274 applications that the company had. Per reports, the US Patent office granted over 50% of the applications in 2018. Simply applying 50% to BlackBerry’s patent application count of nearly 16,274 applications, we get 8,137 granted patents (16,274 X 50%).Thus, BlackBerry’s total patent portfolio is likely to be nearly 29,000 (21,226 + 8,137. The exact number is 29,393 but we round it off to 29,000 to keep the calculations simple).We apply a certain percentage discount to the value per patent to account for litigation costs and other IP related risks. What is left is applying our estimate of value per patent to each of these 29,000 patents to arrive at the value of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio.Source: Author estimatesEven at a 50% discount to our estimated value/patent of $678k, BlackBerry’s patent portfolio could be worth around $10 billion. Considering the current market cap of the stock is closer to $3 billion, our most conservative assessment represents a 3.3x jump in BlackBerry’s $5.5 stock price.From a risk perspective, the intrinsic value of the patent portfolio is $2-3 billion, which should limit the downside to $3.6 per share.Who will buy: We think there are only a few buyers who will be able to absorb the breadth of technologies covered by BlackBerry’s patents. These buyers will also need to have significant resources to fund a deal (which we think would be at least $10 billion), limiting the list of potential buyers to the usual suspects (Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Google and Microsoft).Value of the patents: The royalty revenue from BlackBerry’s patents has been estimated to grow, indicating healthy demand for the company’s IP. We think our estimate of $10 billion may be the base price, and should a bidding war begin, things could look much better for the shareholders.Cylance, QNX, ESS: While John Chen had helped turn around Sybase to be ultimately sold to SAP (NYSE: SAP) in 2010, with BlackBerry, Chen is also at the helm of a company that was a leader in consumer technology but is having to transition to an enterprise set up to survive. The ensuing complexities don’t lend BlackBerry amenable to be easily managed. We think in case of BlackBerry, Chen is creating a proof of concept with tactical acquisitions and strategic alignment of sales team, etc. to showcase the real potential of BlackBerry’s IP rather than necessarily trying to build an enterprise software company. However, when a patent sale materializes, the work done in building out the company’s enterprise framework could become a cherry on the cake. Timing of sale: The biggest challenge to BlackBerry’s stock moving up will be the closure of the potential patent portfolio sale. While the company has opened up for licensing its IP, there could be some more time before an outright sale is achieved, testing the patience of investors wanting to benefit from BlackBerry’s patent pile.BlackBerry in many ways was (is?) going down the path of Kodak. However, the learnings from past and acknowledgement of competitor strength versus its weakness can help BlackBerry salvage some value for its shareholders. Should the company be able to build out a comprehensive narrative around the value of its patents leading to a respectable patent sale, we think the BlackBerry stock could potentially be a multi-bagger from its current levels."
4303546,104053,2019-11-07T01:46:10-05:00,"BlackBerry stock has hit a 16-year low.There is no rational explanation for such a big discount in the stock trade.John Chen is undoubtedly executing his infinite game’s strategy.The margin of safety has become terrific, and that’s what value investors generally seek.","BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) looks like Wall Street’s red-headed stepchild. The market tends to overreact at every slight misstep from the Canadian security company, while ignoring any positive news.This constant valuation imbalance has been damaging to the stock price, which last month plunged to a 16-year low to less than $5 per share: a 30% dive due to a “disastrous” quarter, where BB missed the top line’s estimations by about 3% and - wait for it - not only did it beat the bottom line forecasts, but it managed to come back to a positive free cash flow after a first quarter with cash generation that was in the deep red.And speaking of the free cash flow trend, I have noticed that many cannot see the real numbers for some reason! That’s why I am providing them here, with the hope of avoiding further confusion.BB’s management provides FCF in two forms:It’s worth mentioning that the first could be bigger or smaller than the second, as legal proceedings are able to generate both positive and negative FCF.Source: BlackBerry’s financial reports (Author’s elaboration)To cut a long story short, I decided to increase my stake at this level considerably, averaging down the total position (now carried at $6.4), even if it meant selling some of my other investments, because the potential for BB’s upside is terrific now and the margin of safety is very reassuring, to say the least.I will soon give details for my last points.Several critics focused their attention on the supposed stall in BB’s organic growth in the Q2. In fact, after subtracting the contribution of Cylance (the company’s most recent acquisition) from the quarter’s results, we are left with a flat top line YoY (-2% Non-GAAP).Yet, it does not make much sense to consider the plummeting Service Access fees + Handheld Device division. It is a relic of BB’s past hardware business, has decreased by 70% YoY and is expected to go down to zero in a few quarters.Thus, the real organic growth (coming from the Software & Services business) was positive by around 4% YoY (Non-GAAP). This is certainly not an impressive number, but it is acceptable for a company that is not losing money nor burning cash, as opposed to many other players in the tech arena whose double-digit growth is often achieved at the expense of their net cash position. Actually, BB’s growth rate sounds pretty good if we consider that now its stock is trading at a huge discount to its fair book value, which includes companies like QNX, Cylance, and Good Technology, as well as tens of thousands of tech patents, which John Chen has been monetizing quite successfully.Source: BlackBerry’s financial reports (Author’s elaboration)It’s also worth mentioning that Q2 was a weak quarter even last year, when the top line of BB’s Software & Services was flat YoY, while growth, including SAF and Handheld devices, decreased by 14%. Let me emphasize once again: in the second quarter of 2018, BB registered a 14% decrease YoY!This year, with the exclusion of Cylance, the company reported just a -2% decline YoY.Source: BlackBerry’s financial reports (Author’s elaboration)Nevertheless, this didn’t prevent the Canadian firm from posting a 9.6% growth in FY2019 for its Software & Services business (topping management’s guidance).This year, history will probably repeat itself, with a full-year revenue figure close to the higher end of the guidance (+25%), or, in other words, roughly $1140 million. This is total revenue, while Software & Services’ revenue will probably grow even more.Most importantly, even if BB failed miserably and posted a total growth of just +20% in FY2020 (namely $1100 million), it would not really matter. Regardless, the company would post a Non-GAAP profit and a positive FCF (considering that, even in Q2, BB managed to be FCF positive for $14 million), further improving its already advantageous cash position (cash on hand of roughly $1000 million and net cash position of $333 million). From a wise investor’s perspective, it’s more important to focus on long-term developments, opportunities and challenges, like Cylance’s integration into BB’s pre-existent offer and the further penetration of Cylance (+24% YoY) into its huge TAM. Moreover, the company is winning several designs in the IOT space: 26 for BTS and new logo wins for the ESS business, like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (OTCPK:IDCBY), as well as the oil & gas industry vertical in the last quarter. Not to mention any possible new product development, which can literally happen at any moment considering the extensive patented knowledge BB is sitting on.The recent partnership with CACI International (NYSE:CACI) for a certified mobile communication app, while widely ignored by the press, is a clear example of the company’s long-term potential.There are truly many reasons to jump on this stock at the current liquidation price (I doubt that if the company went into liquidation tomorrow its shareholders would be paid anything less than $10/share). That’s why I increased my position considerably, while many have been clearly (and sadly) abandoning the ship, showing a lack of long-term mindset (which should be a given for any investor) and a constant focus on a bearish narrative, driven by irrelevant short-term details like the GAAP/Non-GAAP saga, which I have already debunked.As observed in the last conference call, BB’s revenue can now be divided into two equal parts: IOT and Cylance+Licensing, each accounting for roughly 50% of the total.Next year (FY2021), even in the worst-case scenario, the top line will organically grow by 5% (IOT flat and the other segment +10%), with positive free cash flow probably for more than $100 million and a (quite conservative) sum-of-the-parts net assets valuation of $10-12 per share. I can’t see how the stock could be traded for anything less than $9.One of the business mentors I value the most is Simon Sinek, author of the book The Infinite Game, among others - a very interesting read.The game theory defines two different kinds of games: finite games and infinite games. The thesis of the author is, in short, that the business arena is an infinite game with an unspecified number of players, resources and time. There are no rules in an infinite game either. Therefore, it is impossible to understand who is winning or losing. People just decide to abandon the game when their resources run out or are acquired by other players.In a finite game, people compete against each other. In an infinite game, every player just competes against himself, trying to constantly learn and improve according to an ideal mission or “cause”.The main point is: there are leaders who think they are playing a finite game and leaders who are aware the game is infinite. Does that sound familiar?John Chen is the perfect example of an infinite player. While managing both BlackBerry and Sybase, he was not too concerned by competition. Sometimes you have the best product, sometimes others have it. What is crucial is to always improve and to build a strong team, a great culture and a spirit of loyalty among your people and your customers. That will make your company survive the inevitable storms and last long.Undoubtedly, BB is a much better company now than it was six years ago. If anything, the following table will serve as a reminder:Source: BlackBerry’s financial reportsEven BB’s critics cannot dispute that. They would rather argue that John Chen could have done more, for example shut down the hardware division right after starting his position as CEO, something I personally disagree with. Closing departments and product support divisions affects people, and certainly not in a positive way. BB has always had a community of loyal clients. An infinite leader needs to take care of them. If your first move as a new boss is to chop heads, how will your employees regard you? They will fear you in the short term, but will they be loyal to the company in the long run?Your shareholders will probably appreciate the cost cuts, but the reality is that a company does not need its shareholders, it needs its employees and its clients.A finite game leader cares about his shareholders, an infinite game leader cares about his team and clients.The moral of the story is: if you are a short-term speculator, try to pick a company that is playing a finite game. Good luck with that. If you are an investor, then you may want to choose and stick with a company that plays an infinite game. Investing looks more like a marriage than an affair.BlackBerry is such a company. It will not run out of business easily. Instead, it’s set to play an infinite game. If the stock market was shut down for the next five years, I would still be perfectly comfortable with my investment in BB.A constant wave of excess criticism has pushed the stock to the current bankruptcy level: it’s the perfect time to buy."
4300219,102101,2019-10-29T23:56:40-04:00,"BlackBerry Spark will play the QNX role of driving BlackBerry's valuation in 2020.BlackBerry could witness an increase in valuation and retest the $4-billion market cap range.However, this will be more of a function of multiple expansion than earnings growth as BlackBerry will need to keep reinvesting to stay competitive.Regardless, I reiterate my net bearish stance until the stock provides a compelling competitive advantage to squash the need to worry about near-term volatility.","Source: YouTube2020 is going to be an exciting year for BlackBerry (BB), cybersecurity, and cyber safety companies. There's the U.S election which will fuel more Federal security spend, there will be the widespread adoption of 5G, which will drive the adoption of cloud IT solutions spurring the demand for cloud security solutions to protect them, and lastly, we will have the first full year in which no company can deny the need not to spare some budget for data security and privacy driven by GDPR.All these trends are bullish for BlackBerry and its cybersecurity counterparts. However, for BlackBerry to enjoy most of these wins, it has to position itself as the go-to-vendor for best of breed solutions in the segments it plays in.BlackBerry plays in the MDM, endpoint, EFS, IoT, and cloud security segments. In terms of its total addressable market, BlackBerry has tons of leeway. However, for BlackBerry to lock in its potential wins, it has to edge out competitors. The largest pure-play cybersecurity company by market cap is Palo Alto Networks (PANW). Every quarter, the company doesn't fail to remind its investors about its successful displacement of competitors during RFPs and refresh cycles. Yes, the competition is that serious. So, when I hear BlackBerry bulls seek solace in the fact that its product offerings address a wide TAM, I feel the need to show them that they are seeking comfort in the wrong shelter. What they need to focus on is a critical analysis of BlackBerry's ability to win in its key product segments.The future of cybersecurity is going to be automated, cloud-based, intelligence-driven, and integrated.Companies want to reduce the number of security appliances they buy. Also, they want these security appliances to communicate with each other for rapid threat intelligence and data analytics insights.BlackBerry is swinging in that direction with BlackBerry Spark. It's trying to fuse its capabilities in crisis management, UEM, endpoint security, and embedded security into one platform. The interesting part is that BlackBerry Spark is a platform for endpoints at best. At the end of the day, what we will have is an endpoint platform with some use cases in crisis management. Every other offering is still about endpoint security. Most IoT devices are endpoint devices.In summary, BlackBerry is entering 2020 as an endpoint security provider. In essence, BlackBerry will be competing against all the vendors in the chart below.Source: GartnerIf you're wondering why Cylance isn't growing revenue in the high double-digit, the chart above provides some answers. Network security vendors like Palo Alto offer their endpoint solution as an attachment to their security platform. These attachments are mostly at a reduced price to cross-sell new customers while reducing their total cost of ownership. For Microsoft (MSFT), its endpoint solution is next to free. This competitive stack isn't the best for BlackBerry. If it doesn't hamper BlackBerry's ability to rapidly acquire more market share, it will affect its ability to improve operating margins.On a brighter note, there will be consolidations. VMware (VMW) recently acquired Carbon Black, just like BlackBerry acquired Cylance. BlackBerry itself could be acquired by a bigger entity with capabilities in embedded security. This is one of the last straws bulls are hanging onto.For endpoint solutions with automotive use cases, we have QNX. BlackBerry plans to integrate Cylance into QNX, which is excellent.QNX isn't yet the big money business it's expected to be. While QNX is now present in over 120 million cars, this hasn't reflected in the revenue from the BTS division. BlackBerry continues to sign big wins; however, when it comes to revenue, 2020 won't be different. Yes, there will be incremental revenue as the royalties trickle in. However, 2020 won't be the breakout year.Source: VMWareI'm not bullish on the ESS division heading into 2020. I share an updated version of this chart yearly, and as always, BlackBerry is the one losing market share. I know Yasch22 won't agree with me on this one. The success of MobileIron (MOBL) might be an indicator that there is money to be made in that space. However, MobileIron is projected to grow at 10% in 2020. The company makes roughly $60 million per quarter. The company has a market cap of $719 million, and it doesn't make a profit.Sum of the partsKIA Investment Research provides a concise sum-of-the-part analysis of BlackBerry. I think Cylance is worth $1.2 billion. Using an ARR of $300 billion, this amounts to a modest price-to-sales ratio of 4. Though, the possibility exists that BlackBerry could find a buyer who is willing to pay up to a sales multiple of 7. However, unlike other competitors, Cylance is a pure endpoint offering. And its AV solution is making me feel queasy about its true pricing power. Most AVs are now offered for free, and Symantec's (SYMC) recent price cuts to its consumer security offering point to the future of AVs and consumer security solutions as a whole.$1 billion is a bullish estimate for BlackBerry's 40,000 patents. KIA Research is a patent expert, and he puts the lower ballpark of his estimates at $1.5 billion, which I think is a bit above the top as the $1 billion one time patent arbitration win is still a black swan event. Currently, BlackBerry makes $200-250 million in yearly revenue from its patents.QNX is a $250-million yearly revenue business. Using a P/S ratio of 4, in line with the average of other IoT security companies, QNX is easily worth a billion.Other bets, including ESS, Radar, SecuSUITE, and AtHoc, are worth $500 million. This is mostly driven by ESS.Source: AuthorFor my peer-based valuation, my peer comparisons are FireEye (FEYE) and Symantec. I picked these two as they are the most similar to BlackBerry in terms of the business phase of their lifecycle. I'm leaving out names with lofty valuations like CrowdStrike (CRWD) to avoid skewing the data. BlackBerry's peer average P/S is within the range of 2X to 4X. To accommodate volatility, I forecast the forward P/S trading range to expand to 2X-6X, with 2X being extremely bearish and 6X being extremely bullish. This gives a valuation range of $2-6 billion, assuming yearly revenue of $1 billion and an average market cap of $4 billion.Most investors don't like a DCF on a name like BlackBerry; however, for old school investors with the cash flow estimate approach to valuation, I've included a DCF analysis below.Source: AuthorI won’t be sharing the full model; however, I will use the table above to explain my thesis. Firstly, I expect revenue growth to decline from a yearly growth of 19% in 2020 to 15% in 2021. This will be driven by the growing endpoint and IoT business, partly offset by the declining ESS segment. I project IP and licensing to be a strong revenue contributor. I’m projecting gross margin to improve by 100 basis points y/y. R&D will be more of a flattish to single-digit improvement due to the investment required to oil the Spark platform. SG&A % of revenue will improve to 39% as BlackBerry completes the design of the BlackBerry Spark platform.I’m assuming interest expense and tax rate will remain at the historical rates. Therefore, I'm expecting improvements in EBITDA and net income, which will be accretive to cash flow from operations in addition to stock-based compensation, and D&A. Using a weighted average cost of capital of 10% in line with the software industry average, a growth till perpetuity of 3% in line with the global GDP growth, I arrived at an equity value of $2.4 billion. For a quick, back-of-the-envelope calculation, I’m modeling FCF % of revenue to improve to 11% by 2024, which is the exit year for the 5-year DCF.To derive the market cap, I’ll be adding cash of $894 million and a debt of $627 billion. This gives a market cap of $2.74 billion. Using shares outstanding of 547 million, we get a share price of $5.00 /share.2020 will be interesting for BlackBerry. It will be volatile as usual, and I won't be surprised if we retest $7/share. However, as stated in my earlier article, the $7 we will revisit will be $6.

4313920,24849,2019-12-23T15:30:37-05:00,Company beats on top and bottom lines.Guidance could have been a bit more straightforward.Cylance ARR continues to slow meaningfully.,"Last week I had an article published where I talked about the need for BlackBerry (BB) to have a strong earnings report if it hoped to salvage the year for its shares. With the stock down 20% and investors worrying if the revenue growth picture wasn't as rosy as hoped, I thought it would be a good chance for management to show the plan is working. The company beat estimates as it usually does, and although the report definitely wasn't a home run, it was enough to get shares higher.For the fiscal third quarter, non-GAAP revenues of $280 million did come in about $4 million ahead of the street. However, I should note that expectations had come down quite a bit thanks to management warning at the previous report. Q3 estimates back in September were nearly $289 million, so a lower bar was a big part here. Non-GAAP earnings per share of three cents beat by a penny, and as I detailed in my earnings preview, the bottom line pretty much always beats. When excluding adjustments like restructuring, stock based compensation, etc., the company lost $0.07 on a diluted GAAP basis.When looking at the individual revenue segments, it was again Cylance that drove most of the year over year gains as expected, $39 million of the $41 million total GAAP increase. While the largest segment, IoT, did show a nice sequential rise, it was down $3 million year over year, continuing the soft patch discussed on the Q2 call that's almost over with. The Licensing business showed another nice increase, more than 13%, but that was partially offset by the bleed off from legacy revenues.The biggest positive I saw was the improvement in margins sequentially from Q2 to Q3. GAAP gross margins were up over 200 basis points which when combined with a nice revenue jump led to a $22 million rise in gross margin dollars. A little more was spent on the operating side to get those revenues, which can be expected, but the company still went from a $66 million true operating loss (when taking out the debt adjustment) to a loss of $49 million. That's still a lot in the red for a company with less than $270 million in GAAP revenue, but improvement was at least made.BlackBerry was also able to show some improvement in the balance sheet. Cash and total investments finished Q3 at $970 million, up from $938 three months earlier. The net cash balance is obviously much lower when factoring in the $605 million in convertible debt, but producing some cash is certainly better than burning it. Those notes have shifted to the short-term liabilities section of the balance sheet since they finished the quarter less than 12 months from maturing in November 2020.One thing that does worry me, however, is the annual recurring revenue that the company is talking about in regards to Cylance. Take a look at what has been reported in the three fiscal quarters so far (Q1, Q2, Q3). As a point of reference, the first part is the definition of ARR that's the same in all three reports, so I won't duplicate that.Six months after we got the first good look at Cylance, the ARR number hasn't really changed, but it's lapping higher and higher prior year period values, so the growth rate has been halved and the dollar increase is dropping a bit. Additionally, the company stated that its dollar-based net retention rate was 99% in fiscal Q3, which seems to be the first time under 100% for any Q1 through Q3 period in the last two fiscal years.Another thing that bothered me a bit with this report was the confusing guidance that BlackBerry gave. On the conference call, CEO John Chen said, ""we are comfortable with the current consensus estimates for the company, which is approximately $1.1 billion in non-GAAP revenue."" However, that number would represent just over 20% in growth over the prior year period. Yet, in the slide below, management called for 23-25% growth.(Source: BlackBerry earnings slides, seen here)A few percentage points might not seem like a big deal, but it is massive here since all of the current revenue growth is coming from the Cylance acquisition. The difference between just over 20% and a say 24% number could mean that the rest of BlackBerry could be up 2% versus down 2%, for example. Since 23% non-GAAP revenue growth means a top line number of $1.127 billion, Chen saying he was comfortable with approximately $1.1 billion was a very odd statement and makes it appear like the company was cutting its revenue guidance yet again.The true test for BlackBerry will come at the next report, when management provides guidance for its fiscal 2021 period. Because the company basically closed the Cylance deal around the start of this fiscal year, revenue growth is forecast to drop off quite a bit as the acquisition period is lapped. Going into Friday's report, the street was looking for 8.2% revenue growth next year, compared to an expectation for 20.2% this year, or perhaps more depending on what you believe management actually said as I noted above.As for BlackBerry shares, Friday's more than 12% rally seemed quite fair in my opinion. A bit of those gains were likely somewhat of a relief rally, since the Q3 report was not as bad as the Q2 one. While shares might not get back to the break even level for the year (at $7.11), at least they aren't below $5.00 like they were at their lows. If global markets keep rallying into year end, perhaps we could see the stock head towards $7, but with a stock up nearly 35% from its lows rather quickly, some profit taking wouldn't be surprising either.In the end, BlackBerry made some progress in Q3, allowing shares to continue bouncing off their recent lows. While lowered estimates did play a part, the IoT business is improving and Licensing remains strong. Now, management will need to get Cylance growth going a bit, as well as expanding items like QNX and Radar. Fiscal 2021 will be the true test, especially with a major debt coming due late in the period. If shares are to get anywhere near the $10 conversion price of those bonds, BlackBerry will need to show that revenue growth remains at a decent pace."
4294712,102101,2019-10-02T23:24:12-04:00,Investors can avoid the overvaluation mistakes of the past if they stop comparing BlackBerry to overvalued cyber plays.Cylance and CrowdStrike are both endpoint security solutions and should be valued as such.CrowdStrike's valuation will eventually revert to the mean of its peers.Cylance needs to show more growth to command the lofty valuation desired by bulls.The DNA of BlackBerry's IoT division needs more support to stand the test of time.,"Ever since BlackBerry (BB) bought Cylance, there has been a gnawing desire by bulls for BlackBerry to command the same premium as CrowdStrike (CRWD). This desire has spurred the narrative that BlackBerry should try a name change. This has caused some bullish investors to miss the warning signs when BlackBerry is tending towards the overvaluation territory. This article provides some insights on how to avoid getting caught in the stampede at the exit that resulted in more than a 26% sell-off after the last earnings.Before I jump into my bearish missive, I want to point out that the founders of both companies (CrowdStrike and Cylance) are rivals and have worked together on writing a book and some tech projects at McAfee. They tried to work together on the CrowdStrike project, after which the CEO of Cylance decided to start his own security company. So, in terms of the core founder's drive and desire, both companies are cut from the same tree, and that's where the similarities end.Data by YChartsCrowdStrike is still trading at a lofty valuation. I've studied cybersecurity stocks for the past six years, and they almost always follow the same pattern. They IPO at a lofty valuation, lose momentum while investors watch the fading growth story drive the stock's valuation down. Only a few cybersecurity stocks have been able to defy gravity by retaining their IPO narrative.There is a clear difference between the management of BlackBerry and CrowdStrike in terms of their go-to-market approach. Just like Waymo was able to draw more attention than most autonomous vehicle start-ups, CrowdStrike has been able to command a bigger valuation because Alphabet backs it and it also has Google as a customer. Cylance is backed by BlackBerry. If left to choose or fund a stock that is backed by Alphabet versus a stock that is backed by BlackBerry, your guesses are as good as mine. Also, CrowdStrike counts AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) as customers. The future of cybersecurity is not only about endpoint or IoT security; it includes a lot of cloud security as well. The cloud security market is one of the fast-growing cybersecurity segments. Scoring major cloud providers like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and AWS as customers speaks volume. It is also important to mention that Dell recently dropped Cylance in a three-way alliance with CrowdStrike and SecureWorks (SCWX).CrowdStrike is enjoying a bigger market share and a faster growth rate compared to Cylance. Even as the law of large numbers is about to catch up with it, CrowdStrike is doing over 100% y/y growth, and it's projected to do nearly half of that next year. Cylance is averaging 24% y/y growth according to the last earnings report. It's like comparing a Ferrari to a Fiat in terms of speed. Even though it's overvalued, CrowdStrike is above Cylance in terms of capabilities and management's vision.BlackBerry needs to complete the integration of Cylance before the positive effect of the synergy narrative can kick off. Currently, we are still in the early innings of the Cylance integration. Remember that BlackBerry has similarly acquired moVirtu, WatchDox, AtHoc, and Good Technology. These acquisitions were followed by synergy narratives and several quarters after, they are yet to deliver jaw-dropping results. In the spirit of ""Cylance is different,"" remember that QNX is also different. As a standalone, QNX addresses a massive TAM of the future of autonomous cars. With the first-mover advantage and early success it has scored, it is still yet to push a billion in ARR.  Source: MicrosoftCylance is an endpoint security solution. This fact has been analyzed before. While the endpoint security market is just one dimension out of the multiple facets of the cybersecurity market, it is also overcrowded. Also, it's hard to differentiate if Cylance is an advanced endpoint solution or an advanced antivirus solution. If you place it in the advanced AV security market, then you can't compare it with CrowdStrike as CrowdStrike solves more problems such as threat intelligence, vulnerability management, and managed security services.Going forward, CrowdStrike's valuation will continue to correct itself. This is obvious because matured players in the cybersecurity industry who are doing over $2 billion in yearly revenue have seen their annual growth rate fall below 30% within a short period.Data by YChartsCrowdStrike once commanded a bigger market cap than Check Point (CHKP) and Symantec (SYMC) at less than 25% of the quarterly revenue of either of both companies. CrowdStrike is not the best scale for weighing BlackBerry's valuation.Cylance and CrowdStrike are two separate animals and should be valued as such. They are managed by different owners; they command different market share and are growing at a widely different rate. Applying the same valuation ratio to both names is going to guarantee that someone gets burned. The recent correction has proven that the market won't be judging BlackBerry using the same valuation yardstick as other overvalued cybersecurity startups. This desire is a fundamental part of the bullish thesis of some commentators on Seeking Alpha.From the last earnings call, Cylance isn't leading up to its hype. It's supposed to play a vital role in BlackBerry Spark, the future of BlackBerry's endpoint security platform. In the wake of an underperforming ESS business, BlackBerry needs products like Cylance to pick up the tab.Data by YChartsRather than trade in the valuation range of frothy cyber plays like CrowdStrike, Zscaler (ZS), or Proofpoint (PFPT), going forward, BlackBerry's valuation multiple will resemble more matured names like FireEye (FEYE) and Symantec. Like BlackBerry, they are no longer considered startups, and investors have more insights into the long-term outlook of their security offerings. As a result, BlackBerry's current valuation is closer to its intrinsic value. Going forward, a $6/share price point will be the new anchoring point (the old anchoring point was $7/share) where bulls and bears agree on BlackBerry's valuation."
4294609,24849,2019-10-02T12:32:26-04:00,Shares down more than 31% since Q2 earnings report.Management is not really inspiring confidence.Investors looking for a bottom to be put in.,"Over the last six trading days, one of the worst stocks in the market has been BlackBerry (BB). As you can see in the chart below, shares have lost nearly a third of their value after a disappointing earnings report, putting the stock at its lowest point under CEO John Chen. With investors having to seemingly given up on the company's potential, it's time to take another look.(Source: Yahoo Finance)Just to recap, the company missed quarterly revenue expectations and reduced the top end of its revenue growth forecast for the full year. This was primarily due to the softness in its enterprise software and services segment, in which the sales team is being reorganized. This tough patch could linger for another couple of quarters, but some of the weakness is being offset by the strength in the Licensing business.When you include the revenue decline from the company's legacy businesses that are being bled off, all of the growth and then some currently is coming from the Cylance acquisition. This makes some of the numbers a bit tough to look at, given so much of the Cylance revenues are considered non-GAAP, so the company has numerous exhibits in its reports to show adjustments between the two reporting methods. After the earnings report, the full quarterly document was released, and it did show a few troubling Cylance numbers (non-GAAP) when combined with data given on the conference calls:Q1 figures detailed on conference call and quarterly information document:Q2 figures detailed on conference call and quarterly information document:Is Cylance the next shoe to drop? If the ARR and subscription growth numbers come down again in the back half of the year, I would find it hard for the company to continue guiding to 25-30% revenue growth for Cylance. That would likely also result in another overall decrease to the total revenue growth forecast, unless the ESS business picks up quicker than thought or more Licensing revenues are pulled forward as we've seen multiple times.What worries me most about BlackBerry's management is that management has done nothing to really boost investor confidence in the short term. There have been no insider buying reports out, and the argument for a buyback has only increased at these levels. If you believe shares are worth more than $10, then the company should be buying back a lot of stock at roughly half of that to offset the potential dilution from the convertible bonds (which convert at that $10 price) that mature next year. Also, the company's latest guidance is actually above where the Street is, meaning that analysts expect another revenue cut to come.Now we have seen BlackBerry's shares drop after disappointing earnings reports before, many of which I've covered in the past couple of years. The difference this time is that the drop is so much bigger, more than 30% in less than two weeks of trading. Shares also are at a point that many investors in this stock have not seen before, and as I've detailed over the past few years, institutions that were the company's biggest supporters when we saw the large Qualcomm (QCOM) windfall have been bailing in large numbers. It will be interesting to see if that sales trend continued in Q3 when we get data in the next month and a half.With the stock down so much, valuation comes into play for some. BlackBerry is trading for just over 2.5 times expected sales in its fiscal year, and its total market cap of $2.82 billion is just over twice what was paid for all of Cylance. Key Cylance competitor CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD) trades for about 29 times its expected fiscal year sales, and that's even after a more than 40% drop off its yearly high. Even a name like Microsoft (MSFT), cited as a growing competitor by BlackBerry CEO John Chen on the recent earnings call, goes for 7.5 times its expected fiscal year revenues. On a price to sales basis, BlackBerry looks extremely cheap compared to its space.While I've been very bearish on BlackBerry in the past, the recent plunge does make the name appear in a much different light. Given the valuation, I could see it being worth a look, but only as a speculative play, not as a large core holding in a portfolio. The recent earnings report has gotten worse as more information has come in, and management hasn't put its money where its mouth is with shares falling. I'm sure we'll start to hear some rumors of a buyout crop up with these depressed prices, but will John Chen and other leaders be willing to admit they failed by selling out? In the end, BlackBerry's fall has made it worth another look, but if Cylance becomes the next shoe to drop, any short-term rebound we see will likely be short lived moving forward."
4296911,69905,2019-10-16T19:37:52-04:00,"A recap of how the shares got here.Cash flow trend is highly indicative of BlackBerry's prospects.Why, going forward, investors are not too late to sidestep this investment.","I have been consistent in warning readers to sidestep BlackBerry (BB). Starting with one year ago, when I wrote Challenging Opportunity:Was I prescient at the time? Certainly not! I simply understood that investors were overpaying for this stock.Further, I've been unwavering ever since. Today, I explain why it is still not too late to sidestep this investment.Author's coverage of BBSourceEarly in 2018, BlackBerry had a net cash position of $1.5 billion - a strong balance sheet with plenty of firepower to successfully pivot. Today, it has a net cash balance of just $220 million (notice a difference)?Readers would retort that BlackBerry has numerous patents that carry significant intangibles. Possibly, but if, after a while, your company's position of strength starts to erode and a position of weakness emerges, then it's time to sidestep your investment.Cash is only worth 'cash' for a going concern. Dwindling cash flows together with growing debt should, at a minimum, raise a yellow flag.SourceWhat happens when the 'ugly' facts get in the way of a beautiful story?I frequently remind investors to be extremely selective when deploying their hard-earned savings. Of course, shareholders that have selected BlackBerry are conceptually doing the right thing - they are being contrarian.However, it is not enough to be contrarian. Investors need to be contrarian and correct. And within a reasonable time frame!Source: author's calculationsIn the graph above, I have taken BlackBerry's cash flows from operations for the past 3 full fiscal years and averaged them out. This figure does not include any acquisitions, or capex requirements to survive or regular purchase of intangibles. There are 'gross' cash flows - if you will.We can see, notwithstanding Cylance's acquisition, BlackBerry is not generating positive cash flows. In fact, we were to analyze clean free cash flow. Over the past six months, BlackBerry used negative $69 million.Source: author's calculationsBlackBerry's shareholders frequently extol that the competition is more expensive, implying that BlackBerry must be cheaper. Yes, Carbon Black did get acquired by VMware (VMW) at a punchy multiple.But simply because BlackBerry is relatively cheaper than the others does not automatically make BlackBerry 'cheap' relative to its opportunity.Moreover, the verdict is still out on whether BlackBerry's peers will succeed in cutting out enough market share to support their valuations - particularly CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD).It has been clear for some time that cybersecurity is a rapidly growing sector. But knowing exactly which company will have a dominant position in this highly fragmented market is an incredibly challenging endeavor.Further confounding issues for BlackBerry's shareholders, at close to $3 billion market cap, too many shareholders are investing in the 'belief' that BlackBerry's newly found trajectory will succeed. Although, sadly, investing on emotion rather than rational facts rarely leads towards positive returns.Specifically, for BlackBerry to return back the same share price of $10.50 when I first recommended sidestepping this investment, it would need to see its market cap soar by 100% to $6.4 billion.However, given that it's only barely expected to break even on a non-GAAP basis, it will not be long before top management starts to abandon ship.Investing is never easy. And we all make mistakes - it's part of the game.But what is a problem is sticking to our guns when there is ample evidence that investing in BlackBerry at $3 billion offers investors a negative risk-reward profile."
4293869,47591,2019-09-27T06:52:29-04:00,"BlackBerry's Q2 2020 report was disappointing and also involved narrowed (towards the lower end) revenue guidance.Full-year revenue growth may be around +24% now, although that is largely due to its Cylance acquisition.Excluding Cylance and its other segment, BlackBerry is now projecting +6% revenue growth.ESS growth has been significantly lower than expected, with guidance estimated at 11% lower than initial expectations, and may be around 0% for the full year.Despite its challenges, BlackBerry looks like a decent value at under US$5.50, as that prices in only modest growth going forward.","BlackBerry (BB) has seen its stock fall to a price last seen in 2003 after reporting disappointing Q2 2020 results combined with revenue guidance that was narrowed to the lower end of its original guidance. In particular, BlackBerry's Enterprise Software and Services business (representing around 40% of 2019 revenues) was down in the mid-teens year-over-year in Q2 2020 and appears likely to end up slightly negative to slightly positive over the full year.That being said, BlackBerry's share price appears to be fully pricing in (and then some) its weaker revenue growth outlook, and I think it is a better value now than it was a week ago.BlackBerry now expects its non-GAAP revenue growth in FY 2020 to be +23% to +25%. While this growth rate seems decent on the surface, BlackBerry's Cylance acquisition closed late in Q4 2019 and only contributed $3 million in non-GAAP revenue to BlackBerry's FY 2019 revenues. Cylance did around $170 million in total revenues in 2019, so that acquisition alone would result in +18% revenue growth in 2020 for BlackBerry if all its businesses grew 0% from 2019.At the midpoint of its new guidance range, BlackBerry anticipates delivering $1.136 billion in non-GAAP revenue in FY 2020, of which approximately $217 million comes from BlackBerry Cylance (25% to 30% revenue growth from 2019). Excluding BlackBerry Cylance, total company revenue growth would only be +1% year-over-year, although that includes a sharp decline in the Other category (handsets and service access fees). Excluding BlackBerry Cylance and the Other category, revenues are expected to be up +6% year-over-year.BlackBerry's original guidance called for total revenue growth (excluding BlackBerry Cylance) of +2% and growth (excluding BlackBerry Cylance and the Other category) of +8%, so the total growth rate has not come down much. However, the Enterprise Software and Services (ESS) business that is reported under IoT has performed poorly.BlackBerry Cylance has performed up to expectations, while licensing revenues are expected to be up slightly in FY 2020 (I've modeled it at +3%), compared to initial guidance for -5% licensing revenue growth.This means that the IoT business may only grow +7% this year compared to initial expectations for +14% growth (at guidance midpoint). Within IoT, the BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) business was always expected to grow faster than ESS. That may have meant +21% and +10% initial growth expectations though, while now BlackBerry may only expect -1% growth from ESS with BSS performing according to expectations.If BTS was originally expected to grow +16% and ESS was originally expected to grow +13%, the updated guidance would suggest ESS growth of around +2% now. In any case, it appears that ESS growth is down around -11% from initial expectations, and is likely to be close to 0% for FY 2020.BlackBerry has attributed the ESS softness to the retooling of its salesforce and believes this impact to last through FY 2020, although it does believe that the second-half ESS revenues will be at least a bit improved from the first half. BlackBerry also noted that competition in this sector has become a bit more aggressive.On the positive side, BlackBerry doesn't have any net debt and is still in decent shape financially. Despite diminished expectations, I believe that BlackBerry will be able to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth (excluding acquisitions) in FY 2021, which would put its revenue at around $1.2 billion.A 3.5x revenue multiple would then make BlackBerry worth around US$7.50 per share. This appears to be a reasonable valuation estimate for a software company with modest growth.BlackBerry has run into some challenges in FY 2020 with its ESS business. This business represented around 40% of BB's revenues in FY 2019 and was down in the mid-teens in Q2 2020, with salesforce retooling being blamed for the weak performance. For the whole year, ESS growth is expected to be close to 0%, and given competition, it may be prudent to model in flat to single-digit growth from that business going forward.At under US$5.50 per share, BlackBerry does not need to grow revenues by much to be a decent value though. I like the stock better at its current price and with slightly reduced growth expectations than I did when it was trading at US$7.50 last week and had a bit stronger revenue growth expectations though."
4293542,24849,2019-09-25T15:17:39-04:00,Company misses revenue estimates for fiscal Q2.Yearly revenue guidance reduced by management.Shares hitting new yearly low.,"Last week, I detailed how it was time for BlackBerry (BB) to finally deliver some impressive results after investors have waited years for the turnaround to be completed. Without a good report, I figured the stock could lose a key technical level and perhaps see a new 52-week low. Unfortunately, the Q2 report was not very good, and shares are tumbling as a result.For the fiscal second quarter, non-GAAP revenues came in at $261 million. Not only did this number miss analyst estimates, but it was the first miss by BlackBerry on the top line since May 2017. On the bottom line, non-GAAP earnings came in at breakeven, beating by a penny, but the GAAP loss of $0.10 per share was double what the Street was expecting.What's really disappointing is that while revenues grew quite a bit over the prior year period, all of that growth and then some came from the Cylance acquisition. On a GAAP basis, total revenues declined ex-Cylance, with the company's IoT business reporting a $4 million year-over-year decline. That's the segment that houses key items like Radar, QNX, and others, and is supposed to be the big growth arena for the company moving forward. On a non-GAAP basis ex-Cylance, the numbers were slightly worse, and the rise in licensing revenue couldn't offset the decline from legacy segments like hardware and service access fees.During the conference call, CEO John Chen mentioned that the softness in revenues was mainly from enterprise software and services, and that this rough patch could last another two quarters. He also mentioned that the competitive landscape is increasing a bit, primarily from Microsoft (MSFT). While he believes new products and services that are launching soon will help future growth, Microsoft is obviously a much bigger company with a lot more resources behind it.As I mentioned in my earnings preview article, BlackBerry bulls have been pointing to the name's valuation against competitor CrowdStrike (CRWD) since the latter went public earlier this year. CrowdStrike recently raised its yearly revenue forecast, and I thought BlackBerry needed to do so as well to get a valuation boost. Unfortunately, management actually cut its yearly revenue guidance, with a new range of 23% to 25% compared to the previous forecast for 23% to 27% growth. Basically, all of that growth is coming from the Cylance acquisition, so the rest of the business isn't growing at all.When we look at the income statement, the numbers weren't exactly impressive either. Despite a slight tick up in the gross margin percentage, gross margin dollars actually declined slightly sequentially thanks to the GAAP revenue decline. The operating loss excluding the debt adjustment rose by $2 million thanks to increased selling and marketing expenses not completely offset by lower R&D spending. On a GAAP basis, the company lost $44 million in the period, up $9 million sequentially.The company's balance sheet also weakened slightly over the three-month period. Working capital declined by about $55 million, while the net cash position remains above $300 million. We are just over a year away from the $605 million debt coming due, and it will be interesting to see if management decides to pay that back or refinance. With the stock remaining well below the $10 conversion price, the third option remains out of the picture currently.As a result of the poor earnings report, shares of BlackBerry opened down more than 18%. Not only is this a new 52-week low, but it puts the name very close to its lowest point under CEO John Chen. The company's Q2 results failed to show revenues growing as much as expected, and the yearly revenue forecast was cut at the top end. In the end, BlackBerry failed to deliver, and investors are voicing their opinion that this management team is not doing the job many thought they could.(Source: Yahoo Finance)"

Don't turn this into a long-term investment as fundamentals are so-so.New CRO in place, but don't expect a positive impact on revenues for 6-12 months.","Mimi On The Beach by Jane SiberryTo say that investors in BlackBerry Limited (BB) are having a rough week may be the understatement of the year. The Q2 2020 earnings call, which occurred Tuesday morning, resulted in immediate analysts' downgrades, which then caused the bottom to fall out of BlackBerry's stock price, dropping from $7.51 Monday night to a recent $5.51 on Wednesday afternoon.(Source: Yahoo Finance)But BlackBerry has not been singled out as the only overpriced player in the industry. The Great Leveler has been busy bulldozing over most cybersecurity stocks this summer while showing no patience for any weak-kneed CEOs. CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD), Zscalar (ZS), Tenable (TENB), and CyberArk (CYBR) are four of the hardest-hit companies, but there are others.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)In my previous article on BlackBerry, I indicated that I would wait a year, then re-evaluate where BlackBerry stands in terms of financials and traction for new products.However, based on recent price action, I believe that BlackBerry is severely undervalued, and now is a good time to jump in for a short-term trade. Therefore, I am revising my rating for BlackBerry from neutral to bullish.During the earnings call on Tuesday, it was indicated that the current CFO, Steve Capelli, will do a lateral transfer and become the new CRO. I view this as a positive move as Mr. Capelli has a great deal of experience with international sales, marketing, operations, customer support, and human resources. His profile can be found here.It appears that he was brought in at the beginning of 2019 as CFO in order to get his feet wet with BlackBerry's business with the full intent of moving him to the CRO position. This is a positive move for BlackBerry, but don't be surprised if, in the short term, the sales organization is revamped and expenses go up. If BlackBerry plays out like other SaaS companies, we should not expect a positive impact on revenue for at least 6 to 12 months.(Source: quoteparrot.com)Stocks tend to revert to the mean. Even Jane Siberry can tell you that. Overpriced stocks will fall back to the mean, and underpriced stocks will rise to the mean. This process often takes time but is a universal law.In this section, I will show that BlackBerry is substantially undervalued relative to other SaaS companies. At some point in time, BlackBerry stock will revert to the mean SaaS valuation. There are many variables to account for, but all else being equal, the implication is that the company's stock price will rise.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 84 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, BlackBerry is significantly below the trendline, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is much lower than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that BlackBerry is substantially undervalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.BlackBerry's stock price is sitting at approximately $5.51 as of Wednesday night. I am looking for a rebound up to the resistance level of about $6.60, probably within a fairly short period of time. $6.60 is the target price, and speculators should close out the trade when the target is reached.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)I wouldn't turn this into a long-term trade. This is a bet on an oversold stock price, not on good company fundamentals. That being said, this company is the flag-bearer for Canadian high technology ever since the collapse of Nortel. I believe that the Canadian government will provide support if required, particularly in the area of automotive products.Oversold stocks often remain oversold for a long period of time, depending on market conditions and the continued flow of bad company news. The momentum is downward, and the stock price may continue down to a much lower floor price.The market has been bearish with regards to SaaS stocks recently and with BlackBerry specifically. Even a slight miss on guidance or drop in billings on the next earnings call could result in another drastic share price revaluation.The trade dispute between President Trump and China is ongoing and has the potential to cause market turbulence or even drive the United States into a recession. A decrease in economic activity will have a negative impact on BlackBerry's operations. Brexit is a wildcard and may affect business in the UK, Europe or even globally.BlackBerry's Q2 2020 quarterly earnings call did not go over well with analysts, resulting in several downgrades. There has been a dramatic price drop from $7.51 down to $5.51. I expect that there will be a bounce up to the $6.60 range in the near term. Company fundamentals have not improved over the course of the quarter, but the company has installed an experienced CRO who has been brought up to speed on the business. I don't expect any improvement in sales for 6-12 months as a result of this move. I am revising my rating on BlackBerry from neutral to bullish based on the extreme undervaluation of the stock. Investors should close out the long position at a target price of $6.60. This is not a long-term play, not until revenue growth is demonstrated across the product lines."
4292567,24849,2019-09-19T17:13:10-04:00,"Lowered estimates likely to set up headline beats.Guidance needs to show situation is improving.Without progress, shares could see new lows.","Next week I will be curious to see the fiscal second quarter results from BlackBerry (BB) when the company reports on the morning of the 24th. With the company having reported a dud three months ago, shares of the stock are still down meaningfully since then despite a recent rally. After years and years of waiting for the company to deliver, it's time for management to prove itself.Let me say right off the bat that it wouldn't surprise me to see the initial headline numbers show top and bottom line beats when they come out. If we look at the company's earnings history, the name has seen eight straight quarters where both numbers came in ahead of street estimates. In fact, non-GAAP EPS haven't missed in roughly four years, although those are adjusted earnings that take out a lot of items, some of which are key expenses.One reason we've seen so many beats is that management has a history of talking down current and future periods. Also, there usually isn't specific guidance given, so analysts tend to be quite conservative. At the time of last quarter's report, street estimates for the Q2 period stood at $275 million and break even, respectively. A week before the report, current street estimates call for $265.7 million and a penny per share non-GAAP loss. That compares to $214 million and a 4 cent non-GAAP per share profit in the year ago period, although that period was before the Cylance acquisition. That current street estimate actually calls for a quarterly sequential decline in non-GAAP revenues. This is despite items like QNX and Cylance supposed to be improving each quarter, even as some legacy revenues still bleed off. BlackBerry bulls have been arguing that the company's valuation is way too low primarily because Cylance competitor Crowdstrike (CRWD) trades at a much higher market cap. While that's true, BlackBerry needs to be blowing out numbers and consistently raising its forecast like Crowdstrike has been, but BlackBerry management didn't raise its revenue forecast at the Q1 report.Here's where the valuation discussion comes into play. Crowdstrike currently trades for more than 24 times its expected sales in its next fiscal year, while BlackBerry goes for a little more than 3 times. BlackBerry is currently reporting non-GAAP profits, while Crowdstrike is in loss territory. However, Crowdstrike is expected to grow revenues three to four times as fast as BlackBerry is, primarily due to much lower base numbers. You can certainly argue that Crowdstrike seems overvalued, but analysts see BlackBerry as being worth roughly $3 more than it currently is, which would be substantial upside from current levels.With the addition of Cylance, BlackBerry has found itself back in GAAP net loss territory, and that's expected to continue in Q2. It will be interesting to see how operating expenses fare, given high gross margins don't mean much in this financial structure, and cash flow will be watched closely as we move closer to next year's major debt maturity. With shares trading well under the $10 conversion price, the notes will either need to refinanced or paid back, the latter of which would drain most of the company's cash pile. Even without conversion, the outstanding share count is rising a little by the quarter since management is not currently buying back stock.There are certainly reasons to be positive, like the expanded deal with Jaguar Land Rover recently announced, but BlackBerry needs to turn this into tangible financial results. We've been hearing for years about how great QNX is and how Radar has been getting all of these customers, yet BlackBerry doesn't break out these items in detail with its results and altogether they remain just two parts of a larger segment in which the numbers are included. Investors remember the days where the company had $20 billion in annual revenues, so it is hard to celebrate some of these ""crown jewels"" that represent revenues in just the tens of millions per quarter.So where will the stock be after next week's report? Well, interestingly enough it finished Thursday's trading almost exactly halfway between its 50-day moving average at $7.11 and 200-day at $8.05. If we get a positive report, I think we'll break above the longer term trend line, and that level will likely become one of support moving forward. However, a negative report would mean the flip side, being a stock below the short term trend line, one that would likely form resistance, and the $6.57 yearly low would be in play. In the end, all eyes will be on BlackBerry next week when the company reports its fiscal second quarter results. Given reduced expectations, it would not be a surprise to see headline beats. Like Q1, most or all of the revenue growth to be reported will come from Cylance, but will the rest of the business show any improvement? Investors have been getting more and more frustrated over time, and if we don't see a strong report, it's possible that shares will see a new low in the coming months. That would be unfortunate, given how much shares have underperformed the NASDAQ over the last five years to begin with. (Source: Yahoo! Finance)"

Back then, suggesting that the company should make a bold acquisition proved true two years later. In February of this year, it completed the acquisition of Cylance for $1.4 billion. While the security software sector heats up, sending stocks like CrowdStrike Holdings (OTC:CRWD) to over $100, it did not help BlackBerry stock at all.And now that BlackBerry is trading at $5.81, putting every shareholder at a paper loss, is it time to average down on the stock? For investors like me who sold the stock long ago in the double digits, does it make sense to start a position again, betting on the company's successful transformation?BB stock after the earnings report on Sep. 24:BlackBerry is a pure software play that pivoted itself away from the failing smartphone segment. Although the rapid deterioration in the business did not enable the company to generate any meaningful cash flow from hardware, BlackBerry prevailed. It solidified its MDM (mobile device management) product and rolled it into a unified endpoint management solution. It added enterprise apps through its Good Technology acquisition and then bulked up its IoT and secure messaging divisions. Fast-forward to the second quarter and investors will notice the problem: revenue is growing far too slowly:Source: BlackBerryAt $35 million in quarterly revenue, BlackBerry Cylance sales will trail last year's $355 million. Gross margin also fell from 76.7% to 72.1% while operating expenses soared. The research and development costs of $62 million are acceptable, but selling, marketing, and administration costs rose from $106 million to $132 million year-over-year. BlackBerry failed to offset the growing costs with a higher rate of revenue growth.On the conference call, CEO John Chen acknowledged that Microsoft (MSFT) is getting more aggressive. This will put pressure on BlackBerry's margins. But the company has new products coming out over the next six months. BIS is an example of a product that is already out. Yet, the changing landscape adds more uncertainties to the company's chances of growing software sales at a respectable level. VMware's (VMW) willingness to spend $2.1 billion for the acquisition of Carbon Black will only put tremendous pressure on BlackBerry's security business.BlackBerry's operating expenses grew because of the added costs of supporting Cylance. Rolling up Cylance into its own core offerings will weigh on profits. And the costs will not stop there. Given the increasingly competitive marketplace, it will need to spend more to improve Cylance sales. BlackBerry is hiring more sales staff to support both ESS (Enterprise Software and Services) and Cylance. To keep costs low, it will not hire more than it needs. So, as long as cash flow is positive, the company is willing to spend more to support software growth.The sales cycle for ESS is six to nine months, whilst Cylance is shorter by a quarter. As it pushes to sell CylanceGuard, the managed service solution should appeal to customers. Since its release this past July, customers, partners, and interested buyers gave positive feedback.The endpoint security market is a $14 billion opportunity and, based on the slide below, has the biggest market size potential:Source: BlackBerryTherein lies the opportunity for BlackBerry investors. Strategically, Cylance is a way to secure IoT that combines with Unified Endpoint Management, endpoint protection, endpoint security, and secure communications. The data systems and AI are there, too, on the single platform. In the short term, having more features will expose the company to more competition. And if one of the solutions is not as good as its competitors, uptake for the unified solution will slow.BlackBerry forecasts softness on ESS. A reorganization of the sales force will also hurt results. Licensing will grow, contributing to its expectations for non-GAAP profitability in fiscal 2020. Analysts are still forecasting a loss:Source: simplywall.stIts break-even EPS will not happen until FY 2021:Source: simplywall.stInvestors who bet that BlackBerry would turnaround by now should now expect the stock to underperform for at least two more quarters. Unlike DocuSign (DOCU) or Dropbox (DBX), both of which are top do-it-yourself stock picks, BlackBerry's platform offering is not yet resonating with its customers. If investors insist on holding the stock, consider buying the stock but holding puts as insurance.

Between university and working near full time, I haven't found time to publish an article on BlackBerry (BB) (or anything else) for over a year. However, I never stopped holding or following BlackBerry, and although in some ways, the story (or the share-price) haven't changed much. BlackBerry's added another wise tuck-in acquisition, the company beats earnings, and the stock does nothing. The company remains stubbornly undervalued relative to its peers, while it has competitive businesses in red hot business segments. Something isn't being properly sold to the market when ~$1 bn of cash on the balance sheet, a top UEM provider, CrowdStrike's (CRWD) direct competitor, a legacy IP portfolio that's being monetized and a dominant player in-car infotainment OS (which is dabbing its toe into autonomous driving) is being given a lowly $4 bn market cap by Mr. Market.Source: My exceptional Photoshop skills | CrowdStrike's performance should be infuriating while also intriguing for BlackBerry longsThere has been much excitement around BlackBerry's acquisition of Cylance, which substantively cleared out their formerly impressive cash balance (cash and equivalents now site at ~$935 mm as of Q1 results). Not only should this guarantee substantial organic annual revenue growth, but Cylance should also provide BlackBerry a competitive edge and synergies in UEM and QNX divisions.Cylance is one of the leaders in AI security, a rapidly developing and growing field. In (very) lay terms, think of how Netflix (NFLX) tailors recommendations to users. Computers can very efficiently process massive amounts of data from millions of sources and find similarities and commonalities in a way that would be cost-prohibitive and prone to error for a human to process. Cylance applies this AI to security services.2019 has provided us much more clarity into the growth trajectory of these companies. The two leaders in this field (by revenue growth), CrowdStrike and Cylance, were both private companies until this year, so the visibility of their financial statements was limited. CrowdStrike has since IPO'd and BlackBerry breaks out Cylance's top-line performance within their MD&A. There are old-world companies entering the field such as Symantec (SYMC), however, their platform is under-developed and seems to garner much less industry attention, they don't break-out their AI security revenues in financial statements, and in fact, faces YOY revenue declines. Cylance, CrowdStrike, and, to a lesser extent, SentinelOne, who remains private, are the unicorns of the sector right now.Data by YChartsNote: CrowdStrike completed their official public offering at $34 a share on June 11, 2019. As of the end of July, the stock has nearly tripled, showing a clear interest in the AI security sector from investors.This begs a few different questions. Why was BlackBerry able to acquire Cylance for $1.4 bn, while CrowdStrike now trades with an EV over $20 bn? Did BlackBerry hitch themselves to a losing horse or did they get a bargain? Or, equally possibly, is CrowdStrike's share performance getting a little 'Beyond' reality.Without being a computer scientist, we're stuck looking at customer sentiment, product positioning, and financial performance (predominantly customer and revenue growth).Annual recurring revenues (the sticky often enterprise customers that Cylance and CrowdStrike battle for) grew to $172 mm as of Q1 results (30% YOY growth), compared to CrowdStrike's $364 mm (114% YOY growth). Revenues for Cylance and CrowdStrike are seasonal, though Cylance's quarterly revenues (non-GAAP) came in at $51 mm (25% YOY growth) compared to $96.1 mm at CrowdStrike (103% YOY growth)...In defense of Cylance, BlackBerry's reporting period ends Mar. 31 compared to CrowdStrike's ending April. 30 (which can make a difference in terms of the seasonality of sales and CrowdStrike gaining an extra month to book sales and revenues). However, Cylance is about half the size of CrowdStrike in terms of revenues and bookings and is growing about a quarter as fast...In fact, this disparity in growth between Cylance and CrowdStrike sent BlackBerry's stock ~15% down on an otherwise solid quarterly result. Cylance's revenues grew 90% in 2018, to CrowdStrike's 109% (a much smaller gap).I've spent an obsessive amount of time reading BlackBerry's MD&A and AGM transcript as well as watching every post-earnings John Chen interview rounds, and there was no real explanation to Cylance's slowing growth profile. BlackBerry has guided towards growth deceleration throughout 2019.John Chen alluded to Cylance's target customers being small and medium businesses compared to CrowdStrike targeting large enterprises. This, frankly, seems like a dodge from answering the question. Cylance did have a similar growth profile to CrowdStrike until this year... what innately makes targeting SMB slower growth? How can Cylance kick its growth back up to being competitive with CrowdStrike?Fellow contributor Steve Auger wrote a fantastic article on CrowdStrike and its competitive position against BlackBerry Cylance. He made an interesting point about BlackBerry's position within the article.I respectfully disagree with the idea that BlackBerry won't consider a ""win-at-all-costs"" strategy for Cylance's fight with CrowdStrike. BlackBerry has been promising revenue growth, and bought Cylance at a steep multiple, instead of buying a cash cow legacy business (for $1.4 bn one could buy a business generating hundreds of millions in EBITDA and slingshot BlackBerry into profitability).In fact, BlackBerry has significantly more resources to fight this fight than CrowdStrike. CrowdStrike is sitting on ~$162 mm of cash and marketable securities post-IPO with >$200 mm expected cash-burn in FY 2019. BlackBerry essentially operates at break-even (small profit expected in 2019), with almost $1 bn remaining in the bank. Keep in mind, CrowdStrike just IPO'd shares from treasury... assuming BlackBerry were to IPO a part of Cylance (we'll get to this below), this could be well over $2 bn. BlackBerry is already eating significant R&D growth with the acquisition of Cylance, and management has alluded to ramping Cylance R&D to chase revenue growth over profitability. BlackBerry's R&D spend in Q1 was $76mm compared to $26mm at CrowdStrike. Sure not all of BlackBerry's R&D spend is at Cylance, but BlackBerry continues to operate at break-even while sitting on ~5x the cash and spending 3x CrowdStrike's R&D spend. There's nothing stopping BlackBerry from stealing top talent away from worse capitalized competition.The market has shown BlackBerry they see Cylance as the future. BlackBerry's overall beat with a weak Cylance performance sent the stock way down. Hopefully, management takes note and devotes resources accordingly. Cylance had a significant market share lead over CrowdStrike as recently as late 2017 and trades blows with user reviews. I encourage readers to do a quick Google search and look for themselves, there are many amalgamations of user reviews.Cylance does, however, solve a number of problems for BlackBerry. BlackBerry has been battling quarterly revenue declines for the past half-decade, with their head barely above water in 2018. Cylance has certainly solved this problem and put BlackBerry in a growth position.Source: Pg.20, BlackBerry Q1 2020 financial statements. GAAP numbers (revenues quoted above were non-GAAP).""Other"" within BlackBerry financial statements is essentially SAF (service access fees) from ancient BlackBerry OS cellphones. This is a sad business to see, as it's a total cash cow business. SAF is a terminally declining segment which has made total revenues negative for years. SAF is now essentially gone at the same time BlackBerry has added a business growing mid-double digits. The gauge of success over the past few years has been finding growth, and Cylance's growth combined without the drag of SAF declines should impress the market in coming quarters.Cylance also integrates nicely with existing business segments at BlackBerry. BlackBerry UEM (Unified Endpoint Management), another tuck-in acquisition by John Chen (formerly known as Good Technology). UEM in simple terms is software used to manage organizational data from a central point. There's plenty of minutia beyond that, securing data, removing errors, amalgamating identical pieces of information, etc.Simply put, Good Technology was good (no pun intended) but Good is a tiny insect in a field competing with the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and IBM (IBM)... being a part of BlackBerry still makes them a small player in the space. This is a space that's expected by Gartner to grow from $2.6 bn in 2019 to $6.8 bn in 2026.BlackBerry consistently ranks well in (pay-walled) comparisons of UEM providers, they're generally considered to be top 5 along with the likes of Citrix (CTXS) and IBM. Having Cylance and Good Technologies under the same tent gives BlackBerry a differentiator and a competitive advantage against the Goliaths of Microsoft and IBM. BlackBerry management has been somewhat short on specifics, though have noted multiple times that Cylance was acquired for UEM (and QNX) integration.Merging a cutting-edge AI-based security provider in with a UEM (who's focus is on securing data and protecting internal networks) is a natural pairing. It'd be great to see BlackBerry show strategic visions for ""BlackBerry Cylance UEM""... if anyone from BlackBerry reads this feel free to use that free of charge!Simply put, adding on a reasonably priced AI security company that differentiates BlackBerry offerings in UEM and QNX (their two growth drivers) and offers outsized growth makes a lot of sense... remember BlackBerry's two remaining major businesses, UEM and QNX were both tuck-in acquisitions by BlackBerry previously and have proved incredibly prescient by management.While BlackBerry sits with a market cap of $4 bn, it seems worthwhile considering IPO'ing Cylance while the market is hot on AI security. The sale of shares of 'BlackBerry Cylance' from treasury would serve multiple purposes. BlackBerry would likely receive a significant premium to their acquisition price earlier this year (Cylance isn't going to match CrowdStrike's $20bn market cap, but it's going to be higher than 7% of their market cap). For example, a sale of 33% of BlackBerry Cylance at a $4 bn valuation (1/5th that of their closest, albeit stronger competitor) would generate $1.32 bn in cash proceeds for BlackBerry or 1/3rd of BlackBerry's market cap (keep in mind cash on the balance sheet often receives a premium by Mr. Market). This keeps BlackBerry in a controlling position of Cylance, brings BlackBerry's total cash stake to well over 50% of their market cap, and garners attention towards BlackBerry's close integration of UEM and QNX with Cylance. BlackBerry could, in theory, commence a buyback of its own shares with only the cash proceeds from Cylance (1/3rd of float), and each BlackBerry share would hold the same per-share stake in Cylance, with a significantly shrunken float. This isn't some fantasy, this can be implemented so management and the board choose.Will this happen? I don't think so. John Chen seems to have a singular vision for BlackBerry as a leading UEM provider and a player in the autonomous drive software market, with Cylance augmenting those businesses. With that said, BlackBerry is back around $7, not that far off from all-time lows, even as John Chen has been executing against his strategy and is meeting guidance. Had Cylance chosen to go alone and IPO instead of joining BlackBerry, they'd likely have a much larger market cap than BlackBerry as a combined entity, even with BlackBerry's other businesses and proposed synergies in place. The market isn't respecting what BlackBerry is offering, and it hasn't been for a half-decade. At the very least, BlackBerry should be more promotional to the market about Cylance's potential, even floating the potential for an IPO. Chen can maintain executing on his vision even while capitalizing on high valuations of AI security providers.I don't think the animosity or calls for a change of management of BlackBerry are warranted. John Chen is making all the right decisions and has been prescient so far. Building a company that is a major player in skyrocketing UEM, AI security, and autonomous driving industries out of a dying cellphone maker deserves praise. However, that strategy can remain in-tact while taking creative steps to maximize values for patient shareholders. While the market continues to think of BlackBerry as well. BlackBerry's, maybe John Chen's, biggest mistake was changing the company's name away from Research in Motion."
4274578,102101,2019-07-11T18:00:58-04:00,Cylance is expected to command a premium valuation in the league of other cyber security companies.Cylance remains a niche player in a congested cyber space.Is a premium valuation really justified?,"A lot of BlackBerry (BB) bulls have been passing around the narrative that BlackBerry bought the Swiss army knife of cybersecurity by purchasing Cylance. This acquisition was made to accelerate the launch of BlackBerry’s IoT platform. Are they right? I know you're curious to know what BlackBerry actually bought and what it's capable of. Let's break it down.Cylance is an endpoint security solution. What is an endpoint? A laptop, phone, workstation, server, and any internet-enabled device that interacts with end-users. Think office laptop, your smartphone, your child's iPad.Before, companies used signatures to detect cyber threats. What you do is compare your file signature with the malware signature in your antivirus, and if there's a match, beep...beep, you get an alert that there's a virus on your device. Cylance totally improves on that. Using artificial intelligence, Cylance is able to detect, prevent, and alert you of an imminent cyber-attack or data breach before it occurs.As a customer, that's a huge leap from traditional AVs (antiviruses) that are so weak that they are often locked down by violent malware before a cyber attack occurs. Remember that time your AV wouldn't start? Yes, it was under a cyber attack. That's why most AVs don't work anymore. They're too slow and can't withstand zero-day or nation-state attacks.BlackBerry bought a solution that protects enterprises and small businesses with multiple endpoints from the most sophisticated attack vectors. If you read any of the product data sheets, you'll walk away with the knowledge that Cylance can protect against any cyber threat no matter how advanced in form. That's true on the surface level.Source: SteemitHowever, the internet stack has several layers and dimensions. These layers and dimensions can be attacked in multiple sophisticated ways. What are the true layers Cylance can defend?Cylance works from the network to the application layer. Think of Cylance like a next-generation antivirus. It can protect all endpoints a traditional AV will guard, including files, browsers, login attacks, web attacks and emails. Or, if you've ever used Norton by Symantec (SYMC), remember Symantec? Yes, BlackBerry bought a Symantec. The only difference is that Cylance is more of a role player.For example, Cylance can't protect your database. If you're a database administrator, then you'll be thinking Imperva (IMPV). Cylance can't protect your entire network. That's the job of next-generation firewalls from vendors like Palo Alto (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT). Cylance isn't a privilege escalation solution that protects against spear phishing attacks targeted at Fortune 500 execs; that's the job of CyberArk (CYBR). While it's also advertised as an APT (advanced persistent threat) solution, it's not as deep into that domain as FireEye (FEYE) or Proofpoint (PFPT).A cyber security provider is first value based on the total addressable market covered by its products. At the next layer is the level of competition in its segment(s). Next, we consider its current market share and growth rate. Lastly, we consider its innovativeness, TCO (total cost of ownership) of its products and services, and its ability to use its balance sheet to achieve growth at a leaner margin compared to competitors. The cybersecurity industry is a growing field, the least that is expected of any player in this field is a double-digit growth.Cylance plays in the endpoint/IoT/APT segments. That's three for one without considering its incidence response or consulting service.Radicati estimates that the endpoint market ($8.6 billion in 2018) will grow to $13 billion by 2022. This will be driven by the growing BYOD trend expanding the number of devices that can potentially be attacked by cyber threats. Another favourable trend is the population bust in emerging economies and Asia. More people are plugging to the web, and most users plug straight into the hands of cyber attackers.The APT market is smaller in size to the endpoint market. It's projected to grow to $8.6 billion in 2022, according to Radicati. It currently stands at $4.5 billion. An APT or advanced persistent threat is an attack vector aimed at stealing information. Think cyber espionage.The IoT market was valued at $7.5 billion in 2017. That's expected to grow at a CAGR of 34% into 2023. That’s the future, and that’s why BlackBerry paid that money for Cylance. Source: GartnerCylance is facing competition in the endpoint segment, its biggest niche. As indicated in the Gartner quadrant above, it appears the entry barrier to block a zero-day attack is low.Source: NSS LabsIn terms of the efficiency of its product, there isn’t much difference in effectiveness, though its TCO is higher compared to most vendors using data from NSS Labs. This makes it tough to command a premium valuation.In terms of its market share, Cylance has more room to grow. 10% of the endpoint market is $860m. Cylance isn't close to that in ARR. There's no doubt the synergies with BlackBerry Spark solution will expand its value proposition as it leverages upon the BB brand to capture more market share.Data by YChartsBlackBerry has cemented its spot as a strong player in the future of cybersecurity with the acquisition of Cylance. However, while a premium valuation is typical amongst early-stage start-ups like Cylance, valuing BB as such doesn't necessarily translate into value. The cybersecurity industry is rife with IPO booms and eventual valuation busts. To compare BlackBerry to CrowdStrike (CRWD) in other to command a forward price to sales ratio of 32 is simply exorbitant. CrowdStrike will eventually settle to its intrinsic value just like FireEye and Carbon Black (CBLK)."
4293440,69905,2019-09-25T10:19:32-04:00,Revisiting the bull thesis.Discussing BlackBerry's free cash flow.Why investors are not likely to be rewarded here.,"BlackBerry (BB) is an interesting investment which on the surface has all the hallmarks of a value stock.However, in this article, I discuss that despite any sunken cost fallacy why I continued to recommend that investors sidestep this investment.Two months ago I wrote about BlackBerry,Today, shareholders are in an even more challenging position. If two months ago, when I recommended that investors call it a day here, they were pounding the table that the stock is a bargain since the stock has fallen substantially it must be an even bigger bargain opportunity?Now, here is the problem. I'm a value investor and I know all the rules in my sleep:And all that is true when the company has huge underlying value. But I do not believe that is the case here.For example, in my previous article, I noted that BlackBerry deployed its war chest to acquire Cylance for $1.4 billion. The problem for BlackBerry is that it was too big a capital allocation deployment for an asset which does not appear to be growing all that fast. For example, in Q1 2020 its non-GAAP revenue stood at $51 million and then in Q2 2020 this was still $51 million in non-GAAP revenue.Digging further, in Q2 2020 BlackBerry generated $14 million of free cash flow, which is a huge improvement from Q1 2020 - where its free cash flow was negative $49 million.Having said that, if we account for BlackBerry's acquisitions of intangible assets, its free cash flow for its trailing six-months was negative $69 million.As it stands right now, BlackBerry still carries a net cash position of approximately $222 million. But BlackBerry will need to be extremely careful to make it last as long as possible if it wishes to be viewed as undervalued at close to $3.2 billion.Another argument which I hear from BlackBerry's shareholders revolves around the fact that BlackBerry's competition is more expensive.Source: author's calculationsI agree! The competition is very expensive. But one of them, Carbon Black (CBLK) was acquired, so it certainly emphasizes that companies with strong prospects are getting the values they deserve. Moreover, Carbon Black continues to pushing out close to 20% revenue growth as of its latest results.And again, yes, Crowd Strike (OTC:CRWD) is unreasonably expensive, but it is still finding very close to triple-digit year-over-year growth.All in all, there is ample evidence that cybersecurity is a rapidly expanding market, and that with the correct business model and strong-execution investors are happy to pay a premium for participation in this emerging sector.On the other hand, BlackBerry shareholders do not have much strong footing to go on by simply asserting that because BlackBerry's competition is performing well and being richly rewarded, that this automatically makes BlackBerry a bargain investment.On the surface this accurate. But underneath that, some common sense should still be applied. BlackBerry is a mature company, so investors are no longer willing to pay a premium for a 'story'.On the contrary, investors of a mature company which have seen its top-line growth rates falling for years, are more discerning and focused on free cash flow capabilities.BlackBerry was once a rapidly growing company. But that's in the past now.Going forward, what matters right now is that paying up more than $3 billion market cap for a company which is unlikely to generate any free cash flow this year, after having generated positive $50 million last year, over the coming 12 months might be viewed as too rich a price tag."
4277042,105080,2019-07-24T22:13:23-04:00,The pieces are finally in place for sustainable value creation.Three complexifiers that obfuscate the value inherent in the business.Three growth drivers that will create value.,"The following segment was excerpted from this fund letter.Most know of BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) (formerly Research in Motion) as the inventor of the smartphone. Some may know of BlackBerry as a value trap that has not appreciated in over 5 years. Some may also know that BlackBerry has recently finished a transition from a handheld device company to a software and services business. We have followed BlackBerry's transformation for years, and we believe that the pieces are finally in place for sustainable value creation.BlackBerry has three complexifiers that obfuscate the value inherent in the business. First, a shrinking top line previously made Blackberry un-investable. The shrinking top line was due to a 5-year turnaround that has taken Blackberry from a smartphone maker with $6.8B in sales, to a software and services business with over $1 billion in recurring revenue. This dynamic changed in Q4 2018 when Blackberry put up total company revenue growth for the first time in over 5 years. Second, BlackBerry modified its sales model to focus on subscription licenses at the expense of perpetual licenses, coinciding with a shifting accounting model under ASC 606. Third, BlackBerry is investing in new products and services, while facing an investing vs revenue and earnings mismatch in the financial statements due to the fact that the benefit of many current and past design wins do not show up in earnings until 2-3 years after the fact. All three of these earnings complexifiers follow a historical fact pattern that has created successful investment opportunities for us in the past.BlackBerry has three growth drivers that will create value. First, BlackBerry's QNX middleware provides an operating system and software development tool with a long tail of penetration and ARPU growth. As software increasingly defines the automobile, from driver safety assistance programs to infotainment installations, the use cases for QNX grow from the current higher end auto mix of today, to eventually, all 1.1 billion automobiles worldwide. As the addressable market grows, QNX ARPU grows. In the 3-5 years since the 150 million primarily infotainment based installed base had design wins, the penetration has increasingly shifted to higher margin, new cycle advanced driver assistance products such as digital cockpits. Importantly, the economic value for these recent, higher value design wins do not show up on the income statement (besides nominal six figure development payments) until the royalties begin to accrue 3+ years after the design win. Additionally, QNX has significant white space and platform scalability in other industries. This scalability is evident in the recent launch of QNX OS Medical 2.0, an operating system used in the development of secure medical devices. Significant white space also exists in industrial robots, green energy solutions, and building automation systems.Second, we believe that BlackBerry's acquisition of Cylance, a provider of advanced cyber security products, represents a 1+1=3 opportunity for revenue and earnings growth. As Cylance products are embedded into the BlackBerry portfolio beginning in 2H19, the cross-selling opportunities of the entire BlackBerry platform to Cylance's small-medium business customers, and to BlackBerry's large enterprise customers, creates upside that is not reflected in current market estimates.Third, BlackBerry has several secular tailwinds that support growing end markets. The rise of cloud computing has led to increased enterprise use of decentralized applications, which has created significant growth in the number of vulnerable endpoints that are then targeted by hackers. While this is happening, the increased use of connected equipment; from autos to industrial and home sensors has multiplied the number of vulnerable endpoints. With the step change in data throughput available with the launch of 5G, the number of endpoints on ""things"" communicating with each other will grow exponentially. We believe that BlackBerry's lead in endpoint security technology puts it in pole position to capture much of the growth in this market. While this is happening, the economic wars of the 21rst century are increasingly being fought through the theft of intellectual property and digital assets. We believe that the entire cyber security industry is underearning its potential.In any business we invest in, we look for multiple ways to win. With BlackBerry, we get accounting complexifiers that obfuscate the valuation, a QNX operating system with a first mover advantage and significant market applications and latent pricing power, cross selling and upselling opportunities of Cylance in both the existing footprint and across other industries, and secular tailwinds that support growing end markets. We get all of this for under 4x recurring revenues, supported by a margin of safety provided by a patent portfolio with over 37,500 patents with a 10-year average life, for a company growing the top line at 25% and doubling operating margins over time.Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4274717,28551,2019-07-13T09:30:00-04:00,"The transformation of BlackBerry from a hardware company to a software business is complete.In view of CrowdStrike's IPO, the Cylance acquisition looks brilliant.The market is pricing CrowdStrike as a winner-takes-all company.Why then is Cylance still growing at 30%?","BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) recently acquired Cylance, a leading AI-based cybersecurity platform for $1.4B, all cash. The market was unimpressed. At less than 7 times projected revenues, many investors criticized Jack Chen for paying too much.A few months later, CrowdStrike (CRWD), one of Cylance’s main competitors, went public and its market valuation immediately shot up to $13B. Including the nearly $200M in cash on its balance sheet, CRWD trades at 9 times the P/S ratio BlackBerry paid for Cylance.Such a difference in price could be explained by the difference in size. Indeed, CRWD’s revenues in 2018 (fiscal year ending Jan 2019) are higher than Cylance’s (whose fiscal year ends in February). But Cylance’s $170M revenues vs CRWD’s $250M do not justify such a valuation discrepancy. Everything being equal, based on last year’s revenues, Cylance should trade at two thirds of CRWD, roughly $8.5B. On this comp alone, it seems as if Jack Chen got a bargain.That is obviously not the full story. Profitability does not come into account since both companies are still losing money. More relevant is their comparative growth rates. Here CRWD seems to have a clear advantage. In 2018, CrowdStrike more than doubled its revenues (up 110%) while Cylance’s revenues went up “only” 90%. Moreover, the latter’s growth rate dropped gradually to reach a more sustainable 31% in the last quarter. The cautious John Chen expects Cylance to grow between 25 and 30% for the full year.CRWD is expected to grow faster than Cylance. By how much more, we will find out from the company’s guidance on July 18 when they publish their second quarter numbers. In view of this, and the fact that they are perceived by the market to be the industry leaders, CRWD does deserve a premium. But there seems to be room for more than one player.Another major player in the AI cybersecurity space is Carbon Black (CBLK). It has a $1.2B market cap and an enterprise value of $1.08B. CBLK’s 2018 revenues were $210M, up only 31% from 2017. CBLK’s growth rate is expected to be lower than Cylance’s in 2019.Comparing the three leaders in the sector, one has to conclude that the market has decided that this is a winner-takes-all business. In a recent Seeking Alpha article (BlackBerry: Not A Value Stock), Michael Wiggins De Oliveira uses the following comparison:More relevant is the EV/Sales ratio:Anything standing out here? Is Crowd Strike that much better? Are they about to wipe out all competition? Is there no room for other players in the industry? If so, how come BB Cylance is still growing at 30% and why are CRWD's revenues less than twice BB's?CRWD may have taken the lead in a very crowded $35B market for endpoint security. But that lead is not very big. In the article mentioned above, Michael explains away the huge difference in valuation by the fact that BB is a more mature company than CRWD. Mature companies attract a different sort of shareholder “than that which would get involved with a recently IPO’d stock.” This is a very weak argument, to say the least.BB is not a mature company at all. It is a company that has been completely reinvented. John Chen deserves an A+ for strategic thinking. Many investors have grown impatient, but it takes a long time to build a new company. Chen had to stop the hemorrhage, get rid of the legacy business, monetize the IP portfolio and refocus the business from a hardware company to a software company. The acquisition of Cylance is what should leverage BB’s expertise in cybersecurity for mobile devices to the next level. If anything, CRWD’s recent IPO and extreme valuation shows how prescient Chen has been by making an acquisition in a rapidly growing, cutting-edge industry.Furthermore one should not underestimate the synergies coming from BB’s acquisition of Cylance. The latter’s expertise is actively being applied to BB’s QNX and UEM businesses, further enhancing BB’s endpoint cybersecurity offering. In Chen’s words: The integration of BlackBerry Cylance into UEM “will add mobile threat detection capabilities using AI on to our endpoint management solution. This will be a very differentiated product in the endpoint market.” Combining Cylance’s expertise with BB's existing software will accelerate Cylance growth.BB is arguably the world leader in mobile security software, selling to most developed countries' governments and armies. Adding Cylance's AI expertise to QNX infotainment and Internet of Enterprise businesses could make BlackBerry a player that is difficult to overlook. QNX's infotainment platform is already installed in more than 150 million cars worldwide, according to BlackBerry. Demand for infotainment is already increasing rapidly. And, down the road, as cars become more autonomous, demand for security against car hacking will further boost revenues at BlackBerry. Similarly, increased security demand for Internet of Enterprise will grow.The brilliance of Chen's strategy is that all these elements work together. The addition of Cylance not only adds more growth to the immediate future, it also lays the groundwork for long-term growth by making the whole package more attractive. For this reason, it is wrong to value each division separately.Wall Street wolf pack mentality has focused on BB lately. John Chen cannot do anything right in investors’ opinion. Even the Cylance acquisition at less than 7 times revenues is being dismissed as a waste of money. Is it really? CrowdStrike may have exposed the purported Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee but then again Cylance is the company that exposed Iran’s Operation Cleaver!The fundamental transformation of BB is complete. Growth is ahead. Patient investors will be rewarded.MOPPX has 2.99% of its funds invested in BlackBerry as of July 10, 2019."
4275960,35181,2019-07-19T05:59:58-04:00,BlackBerry has completed transformation into a recurring revenue software company.Most recent YoY revenue growth was stagnant but guidance is for 25% growth in fiscal 2020.The company has low free cash flow margin and fails the Rule of 40.I suggest waiting for a year to see if BlackBerry's new products with Cylance integration are getting traction.Speculators could jump in now as the stock is undervalued on a relative basis and close to a support level.,"BlackBerry Limited (BB) is one of those companies that investors left for dead a long time ago. The stock once traded for almost $150 but now it languishes around $7. BlackBerry has come a long way, making a painful transformation under the leadership of John Chen, converting from a hardware vendor to software recurring revenues. Now the transformation is complete, shareholders are getting impatient and want to see results.While BlackBerry stock appears to be presently undervalued according to my relative valuation scheme, the company does not meet the criteria for the Rule of 40 (described later in this article). I suggest not investing in BlackBerry at this point in time. I would give BlackBerry a year to integrate the AI/ML endpoint security solution from Cylance into BlackBerry's products then check back to see how their financials look.(Source: BlackBerry)BlackBerry recently acquired cybersecurity firm Cylance which had YoY revenue growth of nearly 100%. However, once acquired, Cylance’s revenue growth dropped to 30%. The explanation given was that subscriptions surged when a virus was circulating. Once the threat was over, Cylance’s growth dropped back to its historical norm of 30%.Meanwhile, a competitor of Cylance in endpoint security, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (OTC:CRWD), has continued to experience 100+% revenue gains, leaving Cylance in the dust. Needless to say, BlackBerry shareholders have been frustrated, and Blackberry stock has paid the price.While Cylance and CrowdStrike have similar products, reviewers appear to prefer CrowdStrike according to Gartner Peer Reviews. This may explain why CrowdStrike has a much higher growth rate.(Source: Gartner Peer Insights)When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.BlackBerry had an unimpressive year compared to its peers with trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 3% while the software industry as a whole grew YoY revenues by 15.6%. But there is a lot going on at BlackBerry, including conversion to a recurring revenue business model, converting to ASC 606 accounting and the acquisition of Cylance.(Source: Portfolio123)For the purpose of calculating the Rule of 40 (explained later), I decided not to use historical revenue growth, but instead, I used the mid-point of BlackBerry’s guidance for fiscal 2020 which is 25%. This estimate seems fair given double-digit billing and a 30% YoY increase in annual recurring revenue.BlackBerry's free cash flow margin TTM has been steadily growing for the last nine months and is slightly positive, at 3%. I am not expecting any improvement in free cash flow for fiscal 2020 as BlackBerry expects to book $300 million in extra costs due to its integration of Cylance.(Source: Portfolio123)A rule of thumb often applied to software companies is the ""Rule of 40."" This metric helps SaaS companies balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin as I believe that it is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's revenue growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has balanced growth and cash flow resulting in financial health.BlackBerry's estimated revenue growth for fiscal 2020 is 25%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing twelve months was 3%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 25% + 3% = 28%Since the calculation comes out lower than 40%, I conclude that BlackBerry is not in good shape financially. If I were to use BlackBerry’s historical YoY revenue growth, the figure would be much worse. For this reason, I don’t feel that BlackBerry is a good buy at this time. Perhaps once Cylance has been integrated into BlackBerry’s products then free cash flow will rise and make an investment more attractive.This is where things get interesting and somewhat controversial. It seems logical to me that high growth companies should be valued more highly than slow-growth companies. To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of Enterprise Value (EV)/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 73 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123 /MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and “next year’s sales estimate” mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using “current year’s sales estimate” and “next year’s sales estimate” also provided by Portfolio123.The reason for using analysts’ estimates is because SaaS stocks tend to make a lot of acquisitions which can muddy the results of the scatter plot. The analyst estimates account for these acquisitions and the estimates are updated frequently. This makes for a cleaner chart. The sales estimates, unlike EPS estimates, are usually quite accurate for most SaaS companies except that they are usually a little on the conservative side.I use an exponential best-fit trend line as it appears to be more appropriate than a linear trend line for this application. As sales growth goes up, the valuation goes up exponentially. The trend line was calculated using MS Excel. I consider the stocks sitting above the trend line to be overvalued while stocks lying under the trend line are undervalued.As can be seen from this scatter plot, BlackBerry is positioned below the trend line, indicating that its EV/forward sales are lower than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that BlackBerry is undervalued.I would like the reader to note that BlackBerry’s guidance for fiscal 2021 is for 10% revenue growth, much less than fiscal 2020s 25% revenue growth. It is very likely that fiscal 2021 guidance is conservative and revenues from new products to be introduced this year are not accounted for. This is typical for SaaS to not include any revenues for products that have no history.If it is the case that fiscal 2021 achieves ~25% growth, then today’s BlackBerry’s stock price would be significantly undervalued. Given the highly depressed stock that is nearing long-term support, speculators could enter long now but this could be risky. I prefer to wait a year and see if BlackBerry’s new products are gaining traction. And of course, take another critical look at how Blackberry’s revenue growth and free cash flow are shaping up.(Source: Yahoo Finance)BlackBerry has just completed the transformation into a recurring revenue software company. Revenue growth has been stagnant but is predicted to pick up in fiscal 2020 to an estimated 25%. Earnings will take a hit due to the $300 million price tag for the integration of Cylance security technology into BlackBerry's products. The company fails on the Rule of 40 and it is best to wait a year to see if financials are improving and new products gaining traction.Speculators may be interested in scaling in now in the hope that the company's turnaround is successful. BlackBerry is undervalued relative to its peers and the stock price is near a support level. For normal investors, stay away for now.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"
4274688,24849,2019-07-12T11:52:20-04:00,Stock trades down to $7 and is down for year.Not a good setup if market actually pulls back.Management silence speaks volumes.,"A couple of weeks ago I mentioned how it was time for management at BlackBerry (BB) to step up to the plate with shares falling after Q1 earnings. Institutional investors have been bailing on the stock for a couple of years now, and the stock has done nothing despite the market rallying to new highs almost daily. The stock is now down for the year, a troubling sign when you think about the next market downturn.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)Despite the company beating on both the top and bottom line, there wasn't a ton of other positive news in the report. It seemed again that some Licensing and IP deals were booked earlier than expected, and if you exclude Cylance, total revenues were actually down over the prior year period. Since that Q1 report, we've seen analyst estimates for both revenues and earnings (each on a non-GAAP basis) for the current fiscal year and next one decline. On a true GAAP basis, excluding the debt adjustment the company is likely to be in a loss situation for a number of quarters moving forward.In my previous article, I argued for management announcing a share repurchase plan if it truly believed shares were undervalued. With next year's big debt maturity being convertible at $10 a share, buying back at these levels would let you offset that dilution and save some money in the process. Of course, this assumes you believe shares will be in the double digits by then, which I can't say is a given at this point. BlackBerry may have to just repay that debt or refinance it for a second time, but this time the company doesn't have as strong of a balance sheet.CEO John Chen's large pay package is based on shares more than doubling from current levels, which itself would be a decent incentive to boost the share price. For those arguing that BlackBerry should sell itself, that acquisition price would seem to be declining over time. A theoretical 30% takeover premium at $7.10 a share gets you a lot less than the same premium at $10 or more. Chen needs to do a lot better than that though, as the market is saying his time at the helm has been quite disappointing.Even if we exclude the buyback for now, what about some insider share repurchases? A look at NASDAQ data shows no recent insider purchases, and data from Canada shows the last time BlackBerry shares were bought on the TSE came way back in September 2017. Is there no executive or director at this company that could step up and buy shares? That doesn't send a positive signal to investors. Should shares continue lower, this would seem like a name that is perfect for an activist investor to try to step in and shake things up.While the NASDAQ index is up 85% over the past five years, BlackBerry shares have lost roughly 30% of their value. Since John Chen took over as interim CEO in late November 2013, you would have done almost as well holding cash or short term interest bearing instruments. With the company not deciding to buy back stock and no insiders even purchasing shares, it's very troubling that markets are hitting new highs every day and this stock is down for the year. Where would shares end up if markets pulled back or even had a brief correction in the coming months?"
4272656,24849,2019-06-28T11:03:59-04:00,Shares plunge after earnings report.Buyback should be considered.Valuation argument now in play.,"One of this week's biggest losers so far has been BlackBerry (BB), which has seen its shares tumble after the company's fiscal first quarter earnings report. While the headline numbers appeared to be decent, the overall results were not spectacular, so shares are heading towards their lowest point of the year. If management truly believes in this company's future, it is time for them to step up and prove it.(Source: Yahoo Finance)I was looking for $260 million in quarterly revenues and two cents in non-GAAP EPS. The company actually came in at $267 million and a penny, respectively. The difference was due to the realization of some Licensing/IP revenues that came in earlier in the year than expected per management on the conference call, as well as the company not making as many non-GAAP adjustments as I thought they would.Overall, investors seemed to be a little worried about the company's lack of growth, excluding Cylance. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues not coming from the acquisition were down $1 million over the prior year period, as declines in legacy businesses more than offset growth from software and services. Management reiterated its yearly forecast, one of the key items I was watching for in my earnings preview article. If there were any hopes that management was being conservative a few months ago and raise guidance here, that didn't happen.Another major item was the company's cash burn. Cash used in operations was $64 million, with another $2 million spent on capex. That leaves the company with $935 million in cash currently, and it still has $605 million in principal due for its November 2020 notes. If you were to exclude acquisition and integration expenses, restructuring costs, and legal proceedings, free cash flow would have been negative $49 million.So, why do I say it is time for management to step up? Well, I've received a lot of comments in recent articles, and even on the conference call, BlackBerry Cylance competitor CrowdStrike (CRWD) was discussed. CrowdStrike recently went public, and it currently sports a market cap over $13.5 billion. While CrowdStrike does have almost twice the annual revenues of Cylance and is growing at around 100% currently, compared to Cylance at 25-30%, BlackBerry's entire market cap is less than $4 billion.If management truly believes BlackBerry is undervalued, then it is time to put its money where its mouth is and announce a share repurchase plan. This is especially true for those that believe shares will be above $10 by November 2020, when the convertible debt comes due. That price is the conversion price, at which point, the company is effectively selling shares, resulting in 60.5 million shares of dilution.Buying back shares at a much lower price would effectively save the company tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. Let's say you repurchase 60.5 million shares at an average cost of $8, which is well above current levels. Since you'd be effectively selling them at $10 next year, you pocket $2 per share or more than $120 million. Those savings increase as the price paid goes down. If management doesn't see shares hitting $10, then a buyback doesn't make as much sense since it will have to repay the notes in cash or refinance them for a second time.Does BlackBerry management truly believe in the company's future? If so, it is time for them to step up to the plate and signal that this stock is undervalued. With shares tumbling after earnings, a repurchase program would save the company plenty of money if you believe shares will rise above the $10 conversion price for the November 2020 bonds. Investors are obviously fed up with the lack of progress, as BlackBerry shares are up less than 9% since John Chen was named interim CEO back in November 2013. As a comparison, the NASDAQ index is up 102% over that time."
4273286,22445,2019-07-03T08:30:57-04:00,"BlackBerry's FQ1'20 results were more or less what the market expected.After many years, the company seems poised to grow for 2020, at about 25% (mid-range of guidance).Yet, despite the current quarter and growth guidance, the stock seems fairly valued.","BlackBerry's (BB) FQ1'20 results were about what the market expected. Non-GAAP revenue grew 23% to $267 million Y/Y, with adjusted EPS of $0.01 which beat by $0.01.I almost never pay attention to a penny beat or miss, so the first thing I paid close attention to was revenue. It was a yawn. While I personally didn't have a revenue estimate for the company, $267 million in revenue was nothing to get excited about. Yes, it was higher Y/Y, but not sequentially.One of the issues with the quarter was that the revenue figure of the company's recent acquisition - security technology specialist Cylance - did not excite investors.Revenue from Cylance for the three months ended May 31 was $32 million. John Chen said Cylance software and services revenue grew 31% year over year. However, when it came to guidance, he expects Cylance growth for the rest of the year between 25% and 30%. This might mean growth deceleration. And if this turns out to be the case, then yes, the $1.4 billion BlackBerry paid for Cylance was too much.The company reported that QNX will be the preferred choice of all next-generation automotive design that LG (OTC:LGEAF) provides to OEMs. The problem is that we do not have any dollar guidance, and any revenue will come far into the future. And while there has been a lot of excitement for QNX over the years, substantial revenue has yet to ferment.Other than that, the conference call was nothing to get excited about.The main problem I see with BB shares is the valuation. I have mentioned this in my last two articles on the company (here and here). In a nutshell, the company is still not profitable enough to warrant a P/E, and growth is not high enough to warrant a premium Price/Sales ratio. As such, in the absence of higher growth, the stock continues to be fully valued, if not overpriced.Data by YChartsIf you notice in the chart above, revenue is basically just now bottoming, even after all the acquisitions the company has done over the years. So, unless we start seeing higher revenue growth, there are not too many reasons for investors to bid shares higher.I have to admit, however, that the assets BB has purchased, together with its own technology assets, have the potential for much higher growth. The problem is that the company is still not there yet.Something else that might be an issue is that the company has depleted all its cash. When BlackBerry shares were trading for $10-13 several years ago, a big portion of the value of the company was in cash.Today, the company has $358 million in cash plus short-term investments of $489 million, for a total of $847 million in liquidity. However, it also has long-term debt of $645 million. So, while several years ago BlackBerry had a positive net cash position, today it does not. This basically means that it does not have the financial ammunition anymore to be able to purchase growth.For the current year 2020, the company guided for non-GAAP revenue growth between 23% and 27%, and expects non-GAAP profitability. On a 12-month trailing basis, BlackBerry did about $940 million in revenue, so as per guidance, it will probably do about $1.2 billion in revenue this year.Yes, this is very good growth, but not enough to justify a $4.1 billion market cap in my book for a company that will barely make a profit and with a balance sheet depleted of cash.BB shares have traded along the $7.50 handle many times over the past 4 years. As such, a bounce is the most likely scenario from current levels.However, I am not comfortable enough to have a major position in BB shares yet. Either the stock has to dip below $6.50 to get me interested, or the fundamentals have to improve over the next several quarters, especially in terms of profitability.BlackBerry's multi-year revenue slide has probably bottomed. For the first time in many years, shareholders could expect to see growth to the tune of over 20%.However, the company is still not profitable enough to warrant a much higher stock price at the current time. Yes, I believe that the assets it has could lead to much higher growth (and a much higher valuation), however we are not there yet.In addition, if the Cylance acquisition does not live up to expectations, then yes, the company will have overpaid. And if this turns out to be the case, the market will not be kind to BB shares in the future.Finally, having said all this, the stock is probably in for a small bounce from current levels. And for the first time in a very long time, I have a very small trading position in BB shares.Please note it is only a trading position until further notice. My current rating for BB shares is Neutral."
4257113,104053,2019-04-26T11:36:00-04:00,"Total revenue first reached $1b in FY2005, rose spectacularly to $19.9b in 2011, and endured a long decline to a sub-$1b run-rate in Q1 of FY2018.The disaster narrative was due to burn-off of handset and SAF revenue, whereas the rebirth of BB as a billion dollar company in Q4/19 was based entirely on security-focused software.The addition of $170m annual revenue from recently acquired Cylance to BB’s software revenue of $857m brings total company revenue to $1.027b.The “billion-dollar BB” still has growing pains, but should have no trouble reaching minimal guidance of $1.13b revenue in FY/20.High end of guidance is $1.18b, where a 5-multiple values BB at $11.00.","A company’s history in condensed form is not much different from an investment thesis. A story with a positive trajectory is bullish, and the reverse is bearish. Naturally, investors take to sites such as Seeking Alpha to defend their versions of the story. Occasionally, these defenses are cynically negative (bashing) or cynically positive (pumping), but even these battles contribute to ongoing clarification.BlackBerry (NYSE:BB), known as Research in Motion for the first 28 years, officially turned 35-years-old just two months ago. The world knows the disaster narrative all too well, as we still see comments all over the web wondering, “Hasn’t BlackBerry died yet?” The new story is the company’s rebirth out of the old ashes, which has a few more miles to travel before it takes hold in the popular imagination.In FY2004, total revenue had risen to $595m, but in the following year it rocketed to $1.35b, and ultimately reached a peak of $19.9b in FY2011. By Q1 of FY2018 (March 1 to May 31, 2017), in a long fall that was just as dramatic as the rise, total revenue at BlackBerry fell to a run-rate of less than a billion dollars for the first time in 13 years.The two pillars of BlackBerry's revenue throughout its rise and fall as a billion-dollar enterprise were smartphones and service access fees, usually referred to as ""SAF."" A third source of revenue – software, services, and IP – was clearly the miniscule runt of the litter, treated as an afterthought in the bigger picture, especially in the years leading up to 2011 and even a couple of years after that. You could almost hear ex-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie thinking, ""How much could $20m here or $50m there mean to us, when we're pulling in $10 billion-plus a year in handset sales and as much as $5b in SAF?""By the time John Chen took over as CEO late in 2013, bankruptcy and dissolution were knocking loudly at the door, and total revenue was in free fall. The total ultimately hit $244m in Q1/18, for a run-rate of $976m. That was the quarter BB died as a member of the billion-dollar club. Specifically, revenue from smartphones had fallen all the way to $37m, and from SAF all the way to $38m.For several years, however, there had been signs of better things to come. To give one small example, in Q3/17, for the first time since the company began selling its rudimentary pager, revenue from Software and Services ($172m) was greater than combined revenue from Hardware and SAF ($129m). This was the point where the runt of the litter had clearly emerged to become BlackBerry’s top dog, though it was still looking a bit mangy.All along Software’s rise from $236m in FY/14 to the billion-dollar club, analysts have been making arguments against the quality of the revenue, and that BB was relying a bit too heavily on creative accounting. These concerns have diminished in relevance over the past five years in light of the following facts:* BB has put the Smartphone + SAF apocalypse into the rear-view mirror.* Paid $1.4b in cash for one of the hottest cybersecurity firms on the market.* Still has $400m in debt-free cash + $605m in low-cost debentures.* Software and Services revenue has grown steadily for the past five years.* EPS has improved steadily since Chen took over.Source: BlackBerry Financial Reports*GAAP EPS in FY/18 was skewed upward by the $945m Qualcomm settlement, demonstrating yet again that GAAP is most often inferior to non-GAAP as a measure of the company’s financial status.Another example: GAAP EPS has been skewed since FY/15 by the debenture fair value adjustment, where nominal non-cash losses or gains are recorded against the value of the debentures (presently $605m) in relation to the share price at the end of a given quarter. Counter intuitively, this government-mandated accounting measure knocks EPS down when the share price goes up, and vice versa. Fortunately, BB explains its GAAP vs. non-GAAP accounts in full, thereby rendering complaints about “true GAAP vs. misleading non-GAAP” particularly meaningless.The total increase in revenue from the time John Chen took over (near the end of FY/14) until the end of FY/19 is $621m, for an annualized return of 52.6%. This tale of growth has several complicating aspects.1. “Lumpy” Licensing and IP. For example, a huge contribution ($123m) was made by one-time patent-licensing deals in FY/16. In fact, “L.IP” has been a surprisingly regular contributor to BB’s success, especially in the past four years, despite aspersions cast on it by Wall Street for being non-recurring. L.IP has given a significant boost to the financials at least once per year since FY/15, boosting a quarter's results from average to excellent, as happened in the most recent quarter.2. Growth through acquired companies, a.k.a. “inorganic revenue.” This issue is cropping up again in billboard discussions of the Cylance acquisition, but it began in FY/15-16, when BB made six acquisitions. Predictably, the organic-inorganic distinction was used at the time as a vector of attack against BB, where contributions from older organic divisions such as BES, QNX, BBM and IP were seen as weak in comparison with those from the acquired “inorganic” companies such as Good Technology (~$90m per year) and AtHoc ($45m). The old debate is waning, as it’s clear today that BES, QNX, BBM, and IP have driven 65% or more of BB’s growth since FY/15.* QNX: from $100m in FY/15 to $204m in FY/19.* BBM (Enterprise and Consumer): from zero to nearly $100m.* L.IP: from zero to $286m.* BES: presumed share of the growth in Enterprise Software.3. Softness in Software and Services. Growth has decelerated over the past two years, primarily in the Enterprise Software division.Source: Company presentationsThe major reason given by the company for this decline is the change to the ASC-606 accounting rules, whereby BB could no longer list the full upfront amount paid for perpetual licensing contracts, and must now account for this revenue pro-rated on a quarterly basis, typically over a four-year time frame. However, there’s obviously a lot more going on here behind closed doors. To begin with, BB admitted that revenue fell by 11% from Q4/18 to Q1/19 on a non-ASC-606 basis (apples to apples). Even more recently, despite a rise from $83m in Q1/19 to $98m in Q3/19, revenue fell again to $94m in Q4/19, even though Q4 is traditionally very good for Enterprise SW.1. EPS improvementNon-GAAP earnings have been improving steadily quarter over quarter for the past four years, from negative 5 cents in Q1/16 to positive 11 cents in Q4/19. Leaving aside all the issues involved in reconciling GAAP to non-GAAP accounting, as well as the skewing of the financials by one-time revenue contributions (e.g. Qualcomm settlement) as well as one-time charges (e.g. all the restructuring charges), it remains obvious that BlackBerry has become almost boringly stable in terms of earnings. In the short term, however, the positive trend should change somewhat as the company attempts to digest its first acquisition in three years.2. The Cylance AcquisitionIn this article, I ignore Cylance’s potential contribution to BB’s value proposition and concentrate solely on the financials. The purchase price was $1.4b. According to the recently published Business Acquisition Report, Cylance revenue (synchronized with BB’s fiscal year) was $171m in FY2019, but costs were $295m, with $220m for operating expenses and $75m for cost of goods sold.If we blend BlackBerry’s and Cylance’s results, we get several interesting numbers. First, combined revenue in FY/19 would have come to $1.085b, although a $10m adjustment on BB’s side for deferred revenue acquired and a $48m adjustment on Cylance’s side “for fair value of deferred revenues as compared to carrying value at Acquisition Date” brings the total down to $1.027b.Second, if we divide Cylance’s loss of $125m by BlackBerry’s total shares outstanding, we see an EPS loss of $0.23. This precisely negates the positive $0.23 EPS achieved by BB for FY/19.Moreover, Cylance had reduced its quarterly deficit to $28.8m in the third quarter of its own fiscal year, running from November 1/18 to January 31/19. Source: page C-4 of the 6-K. Multiplied by four quarters, that net loss comes to ~$115m, or $10m less than the above-stated $125m. It’s also worth noting that Cylance’s costs have been further reduced as a simple result of BB paying off its debts, which were costing $10m per annum to service.During the conference call, Chen’s guidance for Cylance in FY/20 had three parts:(A) Revenue would grow by 25-30% – or from $170m to $212.5-221m. Note: In Cylance’s own most recent Q3 (Nov. 1 to Jan. 31), revenue was $48.6m, while the net loss was $28.8m, showing that total costs were $77.4m.(B) Cylance would be “accretive” in the second fiscal year (FY2021), which can be interpreted in two ways. First, that Cylance would start generating positive EPS starting in Q1/21. Second, that Cylance would only generate positive EPS for the whole of FY/21. Later, I’ll offer a compromise between the two positions, suggesting that the turning point will come at the midpoint of FY/21.(C) Chen said that BB “intends to improve operating leverage throughout” fiscal 2020, which in the context of Cylance means a primary emphasis on growing revenue and a secondary emphasis on cutting costs. CEO Chen has in fact suggested that the whole emphasis could be on growth, but this is unlikely, given that one of his greatest skills is the integration of acquisitions with cost cutting. Chen should be able to find more than a few places to harmlessly reduce expenditures.Below, I show one conservative example of what the road to profitability in Cylance might look like. To keep things simple, I work with a number of assumptions.1. Revenue grows in even increments of $2.7m from $48.6m to $70.2m by Q4/21.2. Costs are reduced by $2m per quarter, from a starting point of $77.4m. Note the above comment, that BB-Cylance has probably already taken care of business here through the reduction of debt repayment by $10m per year.3. Total outstanding shares = a constant of 550 million.All numbers except EPS in millions.Key observations on the above list:((A)) The list helps to show why Wall Street’s consensus estimate for BlackBerry’s non-GAAP EPS in Q1/20 is only $0.01. The first quarter for BB is often the worst of the year, and we already know Licensing will drop by as much as $35m ($0.06 of EPS) from the high of Q4. To achieve that single penny, BlackBerry will have to generate $0.11 from the rest of its going concerns to counter the drop of $0.06 from Licensing and $0.04 from Cylance.((B)) It lessens the initial shock of discovering that Cylance lost $125m in FY2019, because it lays out the quarterly sequence to profitability. The loss in each quarter becomes significantly less severe every three months.((C)) Oddly enough, SA author Bill Maurer seems to suggest BB would have been better off not purchasing Cylance at all. He offers two reasons: (1) the short-term decrease in EPS; (2) the preservation of investment income:“Ionly investing in 3-month T-bills at the current rate of 2.44%, losing $1.4 billion means a loss of about $34 million in yearly pre-tax interest income.”In actual fact, corporations get nothing even close to consumer-level rates for T-bills and other short-term investments. Below is a list of BlackBerry’s total“ proceeds on sale or maturity of short-term investments” for the past six fiscal years, compared to total cash on hand at year-end.Source: Company 40-F documents.3. Guidance for FY2020: $1.13b to 1.18bGuidance for FY2020 given during the Q4/19 conference call was unusually rich in details. Perhaps too rich, as the numbers ultimately don’t line up as neatly as they should. I’ll list each item in order, and add in the implied low and high for revenue.(A) “Internet of Things”: A new division combining the old divisions known as Enterprise SW and BlackBerry Technology Solutions.Growth of 12-16% from combined base of $571m (ESS = $367m; BTS = $204m).FY/20 revenue = $640m to $662m. (B) “Licensing”: Renaming of “Licensing, IP and other.”Drop of 5% from year-end 2019 of $286m.FY/20 revenue = $270m.Note: Last Thursday, we learned that Emtek of Indonesia was withdrawing from its agreement to license and promote BBM. According to Paulo Santos, the lost high-margin revenue would be “$34.5m per year.” However, Paul Treiber at RBC writes: “BlackBerry clarified that there's no revenue impact from Emtek shutting down the consumer BBM service because Emtek still intends to honour (and pay) its licensing agreement.” Whatever the case, the key part of BB’s announcement was that guidance for FY/20 would not be affected. We suspect Chen was aware, even prior to the Q4/19 financials, that Emtek was seriously considering a formal withdrawal from the relationship.(C) The combined totals of (A) + (B) above come to a range of $910 to $932m. However, BlackBerry also offered a slightly contradictory piece of guidance, saying that the three original Software and Services divisions combined would grow 8-10%, from a base of $857m.In this case, FY/20 revenue would range from $926m to $943m.(C) As we have seen, guidance for Cylance was growth of 25-30%, from a base of $170m in FY/19.FY/20 revenue = $212.5m to $221m.(B) Service Access Fees. $10 to $20m in FY/20.In sum, using the lowest and highest numbers from all of the above ranges, the range for total revenue in FY/20 is $1.132.5b to $1.184b.However, Chen complicated matters with yet one more piece of guidance: “total revenue growth will come in between 23% to 27%”. Total revenue in FY/19 was $916m: X23% = $1.127b. X27% = $1,163m.One solution to all the minor inconsistencies here is simply to accept a range based on the lowest and the highest possible figures, or $1.127b to $1.184b. Rounded: $1.13b to $1.18b.1. At a minimum, legacy (“organic”) Software and Services – now reduced to a division called “Internet of Things” and another called “Licensing” – will grow by $63m in FY2020. By Q3/20, we should see revenue from these two divisions together reach $250m+ for the first time, for a run-rate of $1b.2. The $270m guidance for Licensing is disappointing only in light of the extraordinary all-time high of $99m in Q4/19. Licensing has always been a wild card, where exceptional results have rarely been expected, but frequently delivered. Also, guidance for the coming year implies that average revenue per quarter in FY/20 will be $67.5m. What’s not to like?3. The biggest wild card: Licensing/IP numbers could easily be blown out of the water by wins in court against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP), and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and all three will likely be settled in the coming year. A bullish aspect of this situation is the classic toggle between risk and reward. The downside of a loss for BB is limited, as no valuation I’ve seen is counting on a win in these cases. The upside on the other hand could be massive.4. Cylance is on course for revenue of $221m in FY/20 and $265m in FY/21. It is foolish to fret about EPS at this stage of Cylance’s trajectory. A few lost beans in the next few quarters mean very little in the context of its own ongoing growth story, and mean even less in the context of Cylance’s value-add to UEM and QNX.Even as a reborn billion-dollar baby, it’s clear that BB still needs to endure some growing pains and more than a few diaper changes as it grows toward $2 billion. For example, Licensing was in a mess last week, requiring a flush of Emtek. It’s also clear that growth in Enterprise SW is being stunted by competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and so investors will need to keep a close eye on the nutritional value supplied by Cylance.Median guidance for growth of total revenue in FY2020 is 25%. If this comes to pass, John Chen and the rest of the BB executive will come back to the medical center a year from now, beaming with parental pride, and hoping that Dr. Market feels the same way.Note: the pun on ""Billion-Dollar BB/Baby"" originated with a poster at Stockhouse.com whose avatar at present is ""BB25230PurrCent.""I’d like to personally thank SA member “Yasch22” for the great help he gave me with the concept of this article as well its editing process."
4266908,24849,2019-05-28T19:23:18-04:00,Institutional ownership data shows another round of sales.More than 57 million shares sold in last 7 quarters.Will Cylance turn things around in calendar Q2?,"Back in 2017, I published an article about BlackBerry (BB) noting how major holders of the name were selling the stock. Since then, I have updated the situation a number of times as the trend has continued. During the first calendar quarter of this year, the company closed its major acquisition of Cylance, but the finalization of the deal did little to sway sentiment.In the graphic below, you can see the institutional ownership data at the end of calendar Q1 2019. However, there is one major firm, Norges Bank, that did not update its position size. That is significant because this holder had an increase of just under 3.5 million shares in Q4 2018; so if you take that out, the ""increased positions"" value would be about 20.85 million.(Source: BlackBerry institutional data, seen here)Even if you factor in that new positions had a larger amount of shares than sold out positions, the total institutional ownership amount declined by about 1.4 million shares from my prior update. That's not a major change, but it is still negative, and it was a continuation of the trend. Remember, in my first article, institutions owned more than 338 million shares, and now we are down to just 281 million. That's a significant drop in less than two years, and don't forget the outstanding share count has risen thanks to stock-based compensation as well as no buyback program.As I've continually discussed with the stock, investors have been fed up with the turnaround that took much longer than expected. Management was supposed to turn around the hardware business, and although they finally made the right decision to exit the segment, it cost precious time and resources. Total revenues have gone from $20 billion a year to less than $1 billion, which resulted in the major Cylance acquisition to get the top line growing again. As you can see in the chart below, BlackBerry's shares are up just a little bit over the past five years, while the overall market has soared.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)Just as we've seen a number of times before, BlackBerry's shares jumped right after earnings then quickly reversed. This time, it was because management gave a total organic revenue growth forecast (ex-Cylance) near zero, while the newly acquired business was going to add a lot to overall losses. Additionally, most of BlackBerry's cash pile, a key part of the bull case, was spent on Cylance; so there is not as much room moving forward to make more big bets without a major debt or equity offering.Since BlackBerry reports earnings late in the quarter, there isn't a lot of time for everyone to digest each report. Thus, I'm more curious to see what happens with institutional ownership in Q2, given investors will have more time to digest the initial guidance given regarding Cylance. Perhaps if the company reports a little earlier this time around, the first full quarter including Cylance results can be digested as well. In the end, the trend continues, however, and that is that institutional ownership continues to decline. Faith in BlackBerry is at its lowest point in a while, and thus shares continue to be a major laggard behind the overall market."

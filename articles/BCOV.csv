4326686,34421,2020-02-24T14:54:21-05:00,"2020 fourth quarter subscription and support revenues and certain customer metrics were disappointing and management set 2020 revenue guidance that was apparently below Street expectations.Yet, total revenues and non-GAAP fourth quarter earnings were within management's previous guidance.Despite the sell-off in the stock, the outlook is essentially unchanged and Brightcove remains a work in progress.","On Thursday (2/21), Brightcove (BCOV) reported somewhat disappointing 2019 fourth quarter performance and guidance which caused its stock to plummet 12.8% on the open and end the day down 7.2% (from the previous close). Yet, buyers emerged quickly after the stock got slammed at the open. The stock closed up 6.5% on the day from the opening low.Revenues for the quarter were $47.6 million, up 16.5% vs. the prior year (due mostly to the acquisition of Ooyala), but at the low end of management’s guidance and 0.5% below consensus estimates. More importantly, subscription and support revenue, which is the focus of management’s efforts to turn around the company, came in at $44.6 million, below management’s guidance of $45.3 million.On the conference call, CEO Jeff Ray said that the company experienced a challenging sales quarter. He attributed essentially all of the subscription revenue shortfall to the disruption caused by the final stages of the “aggressive reorganization of [BCOV’s] go-to-market team.” Although that reorganization is now complete, Mr. Ray said that challenging sales performance in the 2019 second half would impact the company’s 2020 revenue growth outlook. Accordingly, management set 2020 first quarter revenue guidance at $46.8 million to $47.8 million, about a half million below analyst expectations, and full year revenue guidance of $192 million to $196 million, below the $200 million plus in revenues anticipated by Wall Street.Brightcove ended the quarter with 3,595 customers down 3.4% sequentially and 5.0% for the year. Most of the decline was in volume customers, which is consistent with management's strategy and in line with the rate of declines in previous quarters. However, the number of premium customers also declined sequentially by 1.0%, which is a concern.Likewise, Brightcove's recurring dollar retention rate, a measure of anticipated revenues from customer contract renewals, was 89%, below its goal of the low to mid-90s. This was unchanged sequentially but down from 94% at the end of 2018. From a profit perspective, Brightcove reported 2019 fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.06 per share, which was at the high end of its $0.04 to $0.06 guidance range. Still, the company booked stock-based compensation expense of $4.8 million and merger expense of $3.4 million in the quarter, both above its previous guidance of $1.7 million and $3.0 million, respectively. Both of these line items are excluded from GAAP earnings in the company’s definition of (non-GAAP) adjusted earnings. By my estimates, the company’s reported 2019 GAAP loss per share of $0.17 was wider than the $0.08 per share loss implicit in its guidance.With similar line item adjustments, Brightcove’s adjusted EBITDA, according to its own definition, was $3.5 million in the quarter, within its guidance range of $3.4 to $3.9 million, and better than the prior year’s $1.4 million.As for earnings guidance, Brightcove anticipates 2020 first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.03 to $0.05 per share, better than analyst views, and 2020 full year adjusted EPS of $0.19 to $0.29 per share, which is consistent with Street expectations.Included in that guidance is the expectation that merger expenses will be $5.5 million in the 2020 first quarter, but only $6.0 million for the year. As noted in the comments to my previous BCOV article, merger expenses have been running high – they totaled $11.4 million in 2019 - more than twice the cost of the Ooyala acquisition. To my knowledge, management has not discussed the reasons why these expenses have been so high, but they hopefully will provide some explanation in the MD&A section of the company’s 2019 10-K when it is released. The 2020 first quarter guidance of $5.5 million is nearly twice as high as the average 2019 quarterly run rate. However, management’s guidance anticipates only $0.5 million in merger expenses for the balance of the year.Similarly, capitalized software costs rose again to about $1.9 million in the 2019 fourth quarter, up from less than $1.8 million in the third quarter. For the full year, they came in at $6.2 million, more than double 2018’s $3.0 million. Management’s disclosures suggest that amortization of software costs also rose; but the exact amount net capitalized software costs was unclear. This is another disclosure that should be included in the company's 2019 10-K.On balance, while there were some disappointing aspects to Brightcove’s fourth quarter earnings report, the results were largely within management’s guidance. Ditto for its 2020 guidance. The main concern that was reflected in the decline in the share price was the disappointing subscription and support revenues, which was acknowledged by management and incorporated into its 2020 revenue guidance. Yet, management says that the extensive changes made to its sales effort are now complete and that distraction should not be a factor in its 2020 performance.On the call, management touted its new product rollouts, especially Brightcove Beacon, its “over-the-top” offering that it says is positioned to be one of the most successful product launches in the company’s history. Management also spoke enthusiastically about Brightcove Campaign, its demand-generation marketing application that was introduced during the fourth quarter. One key question is whether these products can generate sufficient sales to make a meaningful impact in the company's overall financial performance.Management's 2020 guidance anticipates roughly a 5% improvement in revenues and by my estimates, a 400 basis point improvement in operating margin (excluding the anticipated decline in merger costs). At the current share price, the stock is trading at roughly 30 times management's adjusted EPS guidance. Consequently, in my opinion, the company's outlook for 2021 will have to anticipate further improvement to support the current valuation (or any increase in the share price).Fourth quarter results raised some new questions and added somewhat to the uncertainty. Yet, Brightcove remains a work in progress that can still achieve improved sales and profits in 2020. With the revamping of Brightcove's organization now complete, investors will learn whether Mr. Ray and his team can deliver meaningfully improved operating and financial performance in 2020 and beyond."

Their products enable companies to reach their customers through video advertising in the fastest and easiest way possible. Their clients include Dunkin' Brands, Puma, Lowe's, Hugo Boss, Showtime, and many more. Brightcove has employees in nine countries and over 4,500 customers in 75 countries, but their platforms are used to reach almost all countries and territories in the world.They have a range of products such as their Video Cloud, which is an online video platform with an HTML5 video player. This product helps their clients publish their videos on all internet connected devices. In 2016, BCOV's customers used Video Cloud to deliver 2.7 billion video streams per month.Brightcove's Zencoder is the service that downloads the videos and securely converts them into all of the different forms necessary to accommodate the needs of varying devices. The Video Cloud and the Zencoder helps ads reach target markets regardless of the device that they are using.Their other products - Once, Perform, and the Video Marketing Suite - ease the processes of strategically inserting ads, avoiding ad blockers, and collecting data to optimize marketing initiatives.Other than their own clientele, Brightcove has partnerships with large media and communications firms such as JWT, whose clients include giants such as Ford, Bayer, Johnson & Johnson, Kraft, Kellogg's, Unilever, Nestle, and more.Brightcove's financial numbers are not too great, but they are improving as seen by their income statement:Although they are not profitable yet, they have grown their cash flow from $23 million in 2014 to $37 million in 2016, and their revenue has also been consistently creeping upward. They have the capital to improve their products and improve their relationships with their big-name clients.As seen by BCOV's five-year chart, they are trading near their lows in the $6.20 range. However, their financials and their chart do show some growing room for near-term gains.The fact that Brightcove already has skin in the game of the newly popular and growing cloud-based computing world, with great technology and customers, gives them unyielding potential. The company could be a diamond in the rough right now, as it is still in the beginning stages and needs more time to develop. That being said, there are clearly several risk factors when it comes to investing in this company, such as tight competition, cyber security, and their less than stellar financial reports.This company has the workforce expertise, as their leadership has experience at companies like Oracle, Adobe, and EMC. It is possible that this company can blossom into something great and become a household name. At the inexpensive price at $6 and change it might be a good idea to start a small, long position or to simply track the BCOV's progress to see if and/or when it looks like they might become the real deal."
4361878,21815,2020-07-29T14:24:49-04:00,"Video traffic already had secular tailwinds and now a host of institutions and companies have been forced by events to make much greater use of video.The company is the market leader with its online video platform, but we find a curious disconnect between the optimistic language and the company's results and guidance.The company should still do well with the secular tailwind blowing and the shares are not expensive, but we expected more.","Streaming video, whether it's live or archive events or shows or programs, is of course a rising trend on the Internet and Brightcove (BCOV) has the leading cloud platform for that, Brightcove Video Cloud. But they offer a lot more (from the 10-K):The one thing they don't have is video communication like Zoom, which is a pity as demand for these services has skyrocketed since the pandemic. Nevertheless, there is sufficient secular tailwind blowing to expect the company, the market leader, to do well. The company has a number of recent growth initiatives and favorable developments:The Global Partner Program opens up it's services to channel partners, developers and agencies increasing the contact surface with potential customers.The Master License Program offers a managed service aiming to draw in a broader set of customers.The company launched Brightcove Beacon late last year, it is a SaaS based OTT app on which it's Play TV initiative was built (see below) and it is already raking in deals like one with a global pharmaceutical customer. OTT initiatives are popping up left, right and center even before the pandemic as a result of cord cutting, and with the advent of 5G this will only increase.The pandemic has provided a considerable amount of tailwind as a host of stuff has moved online, like education, marketing communciation and even events, for instance likeManagement named a whole list of companies whose virtual events and streaming business it handles, like the Real Hip-Hop Network, Arthur J Gallagher and Company, Masterclass, Tastytrade and others.In a pretty clever ploy, Brightcove itself turned its annual PlayTV event which had to be cancelled due to the pandemic into a permanent fixture (albeit free, for now, from the PR):Management expects the boom in video to last past the pandemic (Q2CC, our emphasis):Management sees tremendous growth in virtual and live events (Q2CC):Video is how business gets done today, according to management and they believe in hybrid model even when physical events return post-pandemic (Q2CC): There is steady revenue growth but operationally, things are not where management would like them to see:Data by YChartsManagement expects the boom in video to last past the pandemic (Q2CC, our emphasis):These came in better than expected and produced quite a rally in the shares (a good deal of which was given back the next day) with revenue 1% above last years quarter (but $3M better than expected) to $47.9M and non-GAAP EPS at $0.07, 4 cents better than expected.95% of the company's revenues comes from subscription and support, the other 5% from professional services (which earn somewhat lower gross margins).There was a dip in the dollar net retention rate to just 80.1% but this was mostly the result of one-off factors; a Japanese customer moving solutions in-house and Ooyala (which the company acquired last year), customers not renewing.Despite pandemic uncertainties (especially with respect to timing of closing of deals), management felt confident enough to provide a FY2020 outlook, as well as for the next quarter:Still, given FY2019 revenue was $184.5M, that boom in video use isn't really translating into much growth for the company, at least not yet, which is a curious disconnect with management talk (Q2CC):Data by YChartsThe graph is GAAP based, non-GAAP gross margin came in at 60%, 200bp below the Q1 figure but this was due to lumpiness in certain cost categories which should correct during the rest of the year.Data by YChartsCash flow has been recovering for a while, but the guidance only provides for $1M-$3M in free cash flow this year, which is a bit of a step back.The company sat on $27.8M of cash and equivalents at the end of Q2 during which it repaid $5M of its $10M revolver so $5M of debt remains. There has been a fair amount of dilution:Data by YChartsData by YChartsOn an (adjusted) earnings basis the stock is expensive as this year's EPS is exepected at $0.09, rising to $0.21 next year. Two times sales seems reasonable to us for a company generating 60%+ gross margins.While video might indeed be the way business gets done these days, as management claims and enterprise video demand is growing near triple digits, we have a hard time consolidating that with the 1% revenue growth in Q2 and even that exceeded expectations.The future looks to be a bit better, but only a bit. Revenue growth is guided in the low single digits, it's hard to get excited about that, even if operationally there is some improvement. While we are aware of the secular tailwinds and see some upside for the shares, we see better opportunities elsewhere, to be honest."
4342525,104952,2020-05-03T15:29:50-04:00,"The business will continue to benefit from increasing video content trends. Things started to pick up in 2019 after periods of single-digit, top-line growth.Between 2019 and early 2020, it acquired its competitor Ooyala and launched two products, Campaign and Beacon. Beacon also enables video publishing on increasingly popular OTT platforms.Within the same period, the business has had five consecutive quarters of double-digit growth.Furthermore, subscription revenue's contribution to total revenue increased by 300 bps to 96% in Q1 as solid new product adoption trends continued.","Brightcove (NASDAQ:BCOV) presents a good, long-term investment opportunity given the exposure to the rising trends in video content marketing. In a nutshell, the company builds a cloud video publishing and distributing system built for media companies and enterprises. The company has competitive products, having consistently been investing in R&D to increase the breadth and depth of its video platform. Revenue has tripled over the last eight years, though growth has slowed down and dropped to high single digits in recent times.However, towards the end of 2019, things seemed to turn in Brightcove's favor as it posted its first double-digit annual revenue growth in over four years. In light of the solid Q1 2020 results, we continue to believe that the stock will benefit from the growing trends of video consumption and also the investments in its products in the long run.As the demand for video content across various platforms such as OTT, online, and mobile devices continue to rise, media companies and various brands/enterprises are looking to produce more video content to capitalize on the opportunity. Brightcove has made some strategic moves to respond to these needs in recent times. The company acquired its long-term competitor Ooyala in early 2019. Furthermore, it launched Brightcove Beacon and Campaign towards the end of 2019 and early 2020. In March 2020, CEO Jeff Ray also purchased additional 10,000 shares to increase his ownership to 95,000 shares in the company, which was a signal that good things might start to happen soon.(Source: Company's 10-K)In Q1 2020, we indeed began to see encouraging results as the company grew its revenue by 11.7% YoY to $46.7 million. Much of that was due to the 15% increase in the subscription and support revenue, whose share of the overall revenue also expanded by 300 bps YoY to 96%. The effect of Ooyala acquisition was also seen in the 12% increase in the Premium segment revenue. Ooyala's clients include high-valued brands such as Tribune Media, Dell, and Sephora. Furthermore, with its newly-launched product Beacon, video marketing and publishing on OTT platforms becomes the key area that Brightcove is well-positioned to win. Given the continual rise of on-demand video viewing trends in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), HBO, Hulu, or Amazon Prime (NASDAQ:AMZN), the OTT market offers plenty of upside opportunities. In Q1, Beacon adoption was strong as the company landed two new customers with a variety of use cases.The liquidation of HOOQ, which was the company's largest customer, made a huge impact on overall revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and also retention rate. Based on the Q1 earnings call, the impact on revenue and EBITDA was $1.2 million or approximately 2% of the quarterly revenue. Given the uncertainty due to the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a real risk of losing any of the company's top-10 customers further. As the largest customer, HOOQ represents 2% of Brightcove's revenue, while the combined top-10 customers represent 14% of revenue. However, the HOOQ situation may also be more of a black swan event here. The five-year HOOQ was an ambitious loss-making venture launched by Singtel, the largest Singaporean telco. It aimed to be the Netflix for Southeast Asia, where the readiness of the on-demand video subscription market is questionable.The company recently withdrew its full-year guidance, though it provided a Q2 outlook of $44.5-46 million. The loss of HOOQ as the largest customer means that the Q2 revenue YoY growth will slightly drop, though profitability will possibly improve. At ~1.8x P/S, the stock is attractively priced at the moment. Given the positive effect the newly-launched products had across the key metrics in Q1, it is hopeful that the OTT momentum will continue in Q2.(Source: stockrow)A positive surprise in Q2 will easily drive the P/S up by 15-20% as we have seen in the Q2 and Q3 last year. We continue to believe in the long-term vision of the business, driven by its differentiated offerings and favorable video content marketing trends. By the end of 2020, we consider a ~10%-11% YoY growth to be the best-case scenario for Brightcove. The current TTM revenue of ~$189 million, however, only represents ~2% YoY growth. This results in a midpoint of ~6% YoY growth and full-year revenue of ~$195 million by the end of 2020, which we think is a reasonable base-case scenario."

The story, with the stock up almost 75-80% over the past few months, seems to be repeating once again, but there is limited evidence to suggest that the challenges for the business have eased in any meaningful way.Even if one believes that the OVP (online video platform) world will have more players than just YouTube by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the competitive challenges for Brightcove seem to be only increasing. For long, Industry experts have expected that as video content producers look for ways to manage their own premium channels, monetize content and obtain insights into audience viewing metrics, the demand for smaller OVPs will improve, but the argument seems to be failing to materialize with the fast changing industry dynamics.Argument for long-term success of smaller OVPs only getting more difficultMarket share data: Source: DatanyzeWhether one looks at the growth of the OVP industry in general, with the global OVP market expected to grow at a 14% CAGR through 2019, or YouTube's dominant market share, it is clear that small players like Brightcove, which is growing revenues around 10-12%, are losing edge fast.As a free platform, YouTube may continue to work for small and medium-size businesses, but growing demand for in-depth video analytics and customization may sway some demand towards other OVPs. Brightcove, known for live-streaming capabilities, management of mobile content, customization options and deep analytics, should ideally be able to monetize the fast developing market, but a highly competitive market is spoiling the party. With Adobe Primetime (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Amazon Video Direct (NASDAQ:AMZN) as the latest tech majors to get aggressive in the space, besides YouTube, the competitive challenges do not seem to be easing anytime soon.Some bright spots are there, but revolutionary differentiation missingThe company does have some promising initiatives that may help, but hardly anything that may help withstand the difficult market conditions. Over the past two years, efforts to make the platform more flexible, a new player and other server side ad solutions do not seem to have made any major impact on the revenues that grew around 10% in the most recent quarter and expecting anything different from the roll-out of new packaging and pricing options, which are expected over the coming months, may be ambitiousRecently, the company launched OTT Flow, a platform to help publishers launch OTT (over-the-top) video services on a turnkey basis that simplifies video distribution, removes the need for multiple vendors, allows consistent experience across different devices and supports advertising as well as subscription-based business models. A promising, but hardly any revolutionary change from Adobe's Primetime OTT.Earlier this year, the company added a new module - CTA (calls-to-action) to Brightcove Gallery, allowing easy collection of customer information for marketing platforms, tracking video campaign performance & measurement, insertion of display ads into video pages and connect with ad servers. A good move forward, but hardly earth shattering, competitively at least.But not enough to deliver for shareholdersWith limited technological or market share edge, smaller OVPs like Brightcove may not be able to attract a significant acquisition premium, while the valuation continues to be rich due to the headwinds that may be too strong to overcome. From a valuation standpoint, the business is trading at more than 70 times forward earnings, hardly a bargain, and an elevated level of operating expenses, on the back of increased hiring for sales & marketing, may continue to put pressure on profitability."
4310234,34421,2019-12-03T08:34:15-05:00,"Under CEO Jeff Ray, Brightcove is strengthening its sales effort, targeting four faster-growing niche markets and investing to identify new opportunities.
        These efforts have temporarily disrupted operations in 19Q3 and 19Q4; but management expects to deliver improved performance beginning in 2020.
        Brightcove's stock price already anticipates improved performance; so further upside requires the company to build upon its market leadership to achieve sustainable revenue and profit growth.
        With Mr. Ray's systematic and comprehensive go-to-market strategies and the addition of several seasoned executives to Brightcove's management team, improved performance looks like a good bet.","A key change at Brightcove (BCOV) since my previous articles has been the turnover at the top. In August 2017, after three consecutive quarters of earnings misses, Dave Mendels, who had served as CEO for more than four years, agreed with the Board to step down. Andrew Feinberg, Brightcove’s COO, stepped in as interim CEO.In April 2018, Brightcove appointed Hugh Jefferson (Jeff) Ray III as its CEO. Mr. Ray had served successfully in leadership roles at several technology companies, including Ellucian, Ventyx, DS Solidworks, Progress Software and Compuware. Brightcove Chairman Gary Haroian said that Mr. Ray “has demonstrated an ability to enhance go-to-market strategies, scale enterprises and expand business opportunities at global technology companies.” His “deep operational and enterprise sales experience will be instrumental in positioning Brightcove for improved market share and long-term profitable growth.”Brightcove’s Business. Brightcove is a leading global provider of cloud-based video services. Its flagship product, Brightcove Video Cloud, is the world’s leading online video platform. Video Cloud enables customers to publish and distribute high quality video to all types of internet-connected devices quickly, easily and cost-effectively. It also assists customers in monetizing video offerings and analyzing their performance.While Video Cloud has historically accounted for substantially all of the company’s revenue, Brightcove has a suite of complementary cloud-based products, These include Brightcove Zencoder, a video encoding service; Brightcove SSAI, an ad insertion and video stitching service; Brightcove Player, which creates and manages web-based video players; Brightcove Video Marketing Suite, a set of video services designed to assist marketers in driving awareness, engagement and conversion among customers accessing video content; and Brightcove Enterprise Video Suite, for internal communications (including live streaming of employee meetings) and employee training.Brightcove’s newest offerings include Brightcove OTT Flow, powered by Accedo, and Brightcove Beacon, both targeting the explosive growth in the “over-the-top” (OTT) market. These services allow OTT video publishers to deliver their content across a full range of devices (mobile, connected television and Smart TVs). They simplify workflows across multiple platforms. Through its subscriber management partners, Brightcove provides customers with an easy path to OTT video monetization with services such as registration, authentication, tracking capabilities and alternative pay formats such as ad-supported, subscription, freemium (i.e. combinations of free and premium services) and pay-per-view.With its broad product portfolio and by virtue of its longevity, Brightcove has established a leadership position in cloud-based video services. Its April 2019 acquisition of the OVP assets of Ooyala for $11.5 million ($8.9 million of stock and $2.6 million of cash) affirmed Brightcove’s leadership. Ooyala was once viewed as Brightcove’s primary competitor.Industry analysts – such as Frost & Sullivan, Forrester and Gartner - have recognized Brightcove’s market leadership. In 2016, Brightcove was named a leader in The Forrester Wave for its sales and marketing of its Online Video Platform (OVP). Frost & Sullivan named Brightcove its 2018 Global Company of the Year for capturing a 24% share of the “extremely fragmented” OVP market. It said that Brightcove’s “robust platform offering, ability to innovate based on customer needs, brand equity and geographic scale” have helped it become the market leader, in spite of heightened competitive pressures. In November 2018, Gartner named Brightcove as a Magic Quadrant leader in Enterprise Video Content Management for the second time. (In 2018, it shared the space with competitors MediaPlatform, Kaltura, Kumu and Panopto).Brightcove’s products are modular and scalable to meet the needs of a wide range of video content publishers. Its customer base consists primarily of content publishers who seek a single, integrated solution for their video content publishing and distribution needs. Many of its customers are either new to video or still climbing the learning curve. (In recent years, Brightcove has concentrated much of its research and development spending on improving the functionality and scalability of its offerings, as well as their ease of use.) Often, its more experienced customers’ use of video has not gained sufficient scale to justify the cost, time and resources required to bring video software development and maintenance in house. Very large-scale users who maintain their own video software might still utilize certain Brightcove products, such as Zencoder or SSAI, to meet specific needs.Jeff Ray’s Game Plan. Since becoming CEO, Jeff Ray has launched several projects designed to grow Brightcove’s revenues and profits:A major initiative is to improve salesforce execution. In December 2018, Brightcove appointed Rick Hanson, formerly SVP and GM of North America for CA Technologies, to the newly created position of Chief Revenue Officer. Mr. Hanson is now responsible Brightcove’s entire sales organization including direct sales, channel sales and sales made through professional service organizations. Early this fall, the company announced new leaders for its sales teams in North America and Japan. It has made a special effort to bring in new talent and beefed up its salesforce training and development. Every rep is now certified to ensure delivery of a consistent message everywhere that Brightcove does business. The sales effort has also been split into separate groups focusing on new business and customer retention.Brightcove is also focusing its new business development efforts on faster growing niche markets. Under the leadership of Charles Chu, who was appointed Chief Product Officer in July 2018, Brightcove has developed a strategy to target four (of nine) faster-growing niche markets, including OTT, regional broadcasters, corporate communications and marketing and demand generation. Sarah Larsen, who became Brightcove’s Chief Marketing Officer in September 2018, will lead the company’s unified marketing and demand generation strategies (designed to help customers convert potential leads identified through video into sales). Brightcove is also making investments to explore new market opportunities. It sees growth opportunities, for example, in market subsegments, such as live streaming to social media (e.g. Facebook and YouTube).Finally, Brightcove is seeking to raise the profile of its brand and its thought leadership to increase its visibility with both existing and potential customers. That effort is also being led by Ms. Larsen. The company recently launched the Brightcove Video Index, which offers data-driven insights into video streaming trends.Early Positive Results, But Still a Work in Process. These initiatives began to show early signs of success in Brightcove’s early in 2019. In 19Q1 and 19Q2, the company reported revenues and earnings that exceeded consensus estimates. It also reported a 5.5% sequential increase in premium customers, due to the acquisition of Ooyala.(Brightcove categorizes its video customers as either premium or volume. Premium customers are typically larger enterprises that have higher usage and more sophisticated needs. Volume customers are mostly small and medium-sized businesses that typically have lower usage and do not require advanced features or functionality. For Brightcove, volume customers have been steadily declining for years; while premium customers have been mostly flat, until recently.)Brightcove’s stock has been mostly in an uptrend over the past couple of years, but with considerable volatility. The stock rallied sharply in April 2018 after Mr. Ray was appointed CEO; but it was not able to hold on to those gains when investors presumably realized that Brightcove’s transformation would take time. The decline in the stock during the second half of 2018 also mirrored the sell-off in the broader market.Brightcove’s stock bottomed with the rest of the market at the end of 2018 and then rallied in 2019 to an intraday high of $12.88 on August 19, fueled by the general market rebound and the positive first and second quarter earnings reports. It has since fallen steadily and sharply, however, as management tempered expectations for 19Q3 and 19Q4.In its 2019 third quarter earnings report, Brightcove said that the accelerated pace of change following the acquisitions of Ooyala and another smaller “tuck-in acquisition” combined with its efforts to restructure the salesforce was disrupting operations temporarily. As a result, the company would likely see some slippage in its revenue growth and retention rate in 19Q3 and 19Q4. Nevertheless, management remains confident about the company's medium- to long-term outlook and expects that it will begin to deliver improved financial performance in 2020.Sizing Up the Upside Potential. Just how much revenue growth and margin improvement the company can achieve remains unclear. Management has not yet given specific guidance about its longer-term outlook.Part of Mr. Ray’s compensation package includes performance incentives that result in accelerated vesting of restricted stock if the company achieves certain financial targets. For example, 50% of his awarded restricted stock units (RSUs) will vest if the company achieves the “Rule of 30,” a combination of revenue growth (organic and acquisitions) and adjusted EBITDA margin that equals at least 30 for any future rolling 12 month period (calculated at the end of each quarter). So, for example, a combination of 15% revenue growth and 15% adjusted EBITDA margin would meet this requirement. Alternatively, Mr. Ray would get accelerated vesting on 25% of his awarded RSUs if the combination of revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin equals at least 20 during a measurement period. RSU awards for other members of Brightcove’s management team are also reportedly subject to this formula.Achieving a combination of even 20 would represent a significant improvement in Brightcove’s financial performance, as shown in the table below:Brightcove Inc.Historical and Projected Financial Performance with Key Non-GAAP Metrics: 2014-2021FIncluded in the table above are projections for Brightcove for 2019 to 2021. These projections are not based upon an assessment of the potential growth of the company’s base business and its four targeted growth segments or its ability to improve profit margins. Rather, they are based upon my view of what seems reasonable based upon its historical record, if Brightcove is able to move to sustainable growth in revenues and profitability. The 2019 projections are consistent with management’s guidance. The 2020 and 2021 projections are my own. Management will presumably offer its guidance for 2020 when it reports 19Q4 earnings in February.Valuation. At the current price of about $9, Brightcove has an equity market capitalization of $328 million and is valued at more than 100 times anticipated 2019 adjusted EPS of $0.08. With no debt outstanding and ignoring its Sept. 30 cash balance of $22.6 million and operating lease liability of $16.4 million, its enterprise value is also $328 million and its enterprise value-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple, based upon anticipated 2019 adjusted EBITDA of $8.8 million is 37 times. Obviously, Brightcove’s stock already anticipates a meaningful improvement in profitability.Conclusion. Clearly, video is not new to the internet. There are some segments of the market that have matured, which has made the business increasingly competitive. Yet, as network capacity, especially in wireless, has steadily expanded, the use of video continues to grow rapidly. Video continues to gain share against text and audio, the two other primary modes of communications. New markets, such as OTT, are also accelerating video’s market share gains. This “rising tide” gives Brightcove more opportunities to find growth, which raises the odds that Mr. Ray and his management team can be successful in lifting the company’s overall rate of growth.While it is difficult to say whether my projections are achievable (or possibly, whether they are too conservative), it is a pretty fair bet, I believe, that Brightcove will be able to achieve some meaningful improvement over its historical performance over the next year or two. Mr. Ray has adopted a thorough and methodical approach that addresses all aspects of the company’s go-to-market strategy. He has brought in new executives who have considerable experience in sales, marketing and product development. His team is now addressing all aspects of Brightcove’s operations, first by improving the effectiveness of the company’s sales effort (for new business and customer retention) and then by moving aggressively to exploit growth opportunities, including the near-term potential from targeting four faster-growing market segments and the longer-term potential by making modest investments to find new avenues for growth. Investors should be able to see Brightcove’s progress and make a better assessment of its growth potential by the second half of 2020. If the aggressive growth targets laid out by Brightcove’s Board of Directors prove to be unachievable, the company could conceivably become a target for potential acquirers, such as IBM, Oracle or even Akamai."
3454086,34421,2015-08-21T06:21:26-04:00,"Brightcove’s shares fell 27% from late June to July 31, the day after the company announced second quarter earnings. Since then its share price has stabilized.This was the first time in many quarters that the company did not beat on both the top and bottom lines, but management reaffirmed and narrowed its 2015 full year.The decline in the stock reflects concerns about whether the company can achieve consistent double-digit growth in revenues and earnings going forward.2016 will be a make or break year for Brightcove’s shareholders.","Brightcove (NASDAQ:BCOV) reported a non-GAAP second quarter loss of $0.04 per share, equal to last year's $0.04 loss and in line with the consensus estimate. Revenues of $32.85 million were $200,000 below the company's guidance and about $400,000 below the consensus estimate.This was the first time in more than two years that the company failed to beat consensus earnings and revenue estimates. The shortfall in revenues was due to the timing of customer renewals. About $500,000 in renewals slipped into the third quarter. Management said that it has revised its procedures to make sure that this does not happen again.The stock plunged on the news. On the day after the earnings release, BCOV hit a new all-time low of $4.81 in the first hour of trading, but quickly recovered to close at $5.47, down 8.4% for the day.That one day 8.4% decline capped a downtrend that began in late June during which BCOV lost 27% of its value. This was the second consecutive summer of suffering for BCOV shareholders. Last year, the stock fell after the surprise resignation of BCOV's CFO and a cut in earnings guidance following the loss of a major customer, Rovio, the maker of Angry Birds.This year, the cause of the drop was more subtle. Despite its failure to beat earnings and revenue estimates; Brightcove's full year guidance remains within the ranges set by management at the beginning of the year. In its 2015 second quarter press release, management narrowed its 2015 revenue guidance by $1 million on each side to $132.5-$133.5 million. It also narrowed its non-GAAP earnings guidance to the high end of the range (i.e. a lower expected loss) of $0.06-$0.09 per share, compared with earlier guidance of a loss of $0.07-$0.14.Investors remain focused on Brightcove's growth prospects. The company reported a decline in its premium customer count from 1,864 in Q1 to 1,857 in Q2. Management has talked regularly about sales successes, but it has provided little or no color on customer losses (except Rovio). Although the drop in the premium customer count was small, it was nevertheless disappointing because Brightcove should be beginning to build sales momentum after a year of retooling its business.A Tough Industry To Follow. Evaluating Brightcove's performance and prospects is difficult because the industry is fragmented. There are no pure-play, publicly-traded competitors. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and other technology service firms offer video cloud services, but it is a tiny part of their overall businesses. Brightcove also competes against a bevy of small, private firms, many funded by venture capital. Large media companies usually have sufficient scale to create and manage their own online video operations, with some help from technology service providers like Brightcove. With such a diverse set of players, little standardized industry data is available to evaluate Brightcove's relative performance.Despite sharing a common goal of a smooth and seamless video experience, online video publishers often differ significantly in their implementation practices. Brightcove has to provide a set of robust and technologically sophisticated tools that is common to every installation, but also allow content providers to customize their implementations.Thus, Brightcove does not offer a single, standardized product (like an iPhone, for example) that can gain quick customer acceptance and ramp up sales quickly. Its sales and marketing process is often lengthy. Customers may start with a few basic services and add more over time. Brightcove has to stay close to its customers to anticipate their evolving needs.After completing the Unicorn Media acquisition in 2014, Brightcove decided to discontinue its low-end service offering called Video Cloud Express, whose features had become largely commoditized. Instead, it is now focusing on the top 300 global media firms that are (or have the potential to become) sophisticated users of cloud-based video services. It is also targeting corporations that increasingly using streaming video as a marketing tool.Early or Late Adoption Phase? Although streaming video applications have been growing rapidly for many years, they are in many ways still in their infancy. Media websites have long offered video, but the deployment of streaming video as an alternative to (or replacement for) cable TV platforms is really just getting underway. Competitors such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Hulu, Vudu, Chromecast, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and others have begun to hit their stride in the past few years. Broadcast and pay TV networks, like HBO, are just now launching their streaming services.At the early stages of adoption, streaming video providers are focused more on delivering high quality experiences for their customers and less on sophisticated ancillary services. Demand for ancillary services will eventually grow, but it may be years before the more sophisticated service offerings become commonplace.Monetizing video streams is obviously important, but online video advertising remains in its infancy. Today, many broadcast and pay TV networks do not attach advertising to their video streams, perhaps to avoid rifts with platform providers like Comcast, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Even those who do not face such restrictions know that the ability to target advertising to individuals is still quite limited.For example, after paying a visit to Staples.com, you might find that display advertising from Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) follows you around on your travels through the internet; but that is still a far cry from targeting advertising to individuals based upon their income, age, personal preferences or medical afflictions. Privacy issues are still a concern. Some of Brightcove most advanced product offerings may therefore be ahead of their time.Similarly, many online video publishers may be content for now to play a single advertisement at the start of their video streams, even at the risk of being exposed to ad blocking technology, or to embed advertising within their streams. They may not seek the adoption of sophisticated advertising insertion technologies, such as mid-rolls and overlays, for quite some time.Yet, it is important for Brightcove to offer those sophisticated services to users who want to tinker with or deploy them right now, to position itself for growth as demand takes off. All the while, competition will be nipping at Brightcove's heels.MLBAM. The importance of getting videos to play correctly, across a wide variety of devices and at scale was evident in the recent decision by HBO to use MLB Advanced Media (MLBAM), the technology arm of major league baseball, to build its video streaming platform.HBO decided to go with MLBAM because it was confident that MLBAM could build a ""robust, stand-alone streaming service."" Its decision prompted the resignation of HBO's chief technology officer. HBO may have had other motives for hiring MLBAM - perhaps it wants to stream the World Series someday - but MLBAM does have extensive experience in building high volume ""over-the-top"" streaming services platforms.In this latest go-round, the business media began singing MLBAM's praises just as Brightcove's stock began its descent. MLBAM is the hottest and probably the most valuable property in the video cloud services business. In late June, the New York Post reported that MLBAM had hired Goldman Sachs and Evercore to explore its options, which might include an IPO. New Republic had previously speculated that MLBAM could be worth as much as $5 billion. In late July, MLBAM struck a deal to provide streaming services to the National Hockey League. As part of the deal, the NHL will take a 7%-10% stake in MLBAM. After denying that MLBAM would go public, Major League Baseball announced that it was setting up MLBAM as a separate subsidiary that might be worth as much as $9 billion.Despite the hype and the hope for scalability in the streaming video business, MLBAM too acknowledges that each streaming video deployment is different. With rapid industry growth, there is still room for Brightcove and others to succeed.Brightcove has undoubtedly built many long-term relationships within its base of 1,800 premium customers that started small and have grown over time. It has also lost customers to competitors and in-house implementations. Although industry growth is a tailwind, managing the business given the different and evolving needs of customers and tough competitive conditions presents ongoing challenges for Brightcove.2015 Second Quarter Results. In the 2015 second quarter, total revenues increased 6% year over year to $32.8 million, but were down 0.1% sequentially. Subscription and support revenues, the biggest component, fell 6.6% to $31.9 million and were up only 0.3% sequentially. Professional services revenues have fluctuated around the $1 million quarterly level for five consecutive quarters now and are expected to remain at this level for the balance of the year.The loss of Rovio has clearly affected sales and momentum. Rovio accounted for 3.8% of Brightcove's total revenues (and 15% of its video streams). Its contract expired at the end of August 2014, so comparisons should become easier beginning in the 2015 fourth quarter. Doing the math, the loss of Rovio probably cost Brightcove about 1.3% of 2014 revenues. It will lower the company's 2015 revenue growth rate by about 2% in 2015, according to management.Variation in regional performance helps to put the consolidated results in perspective. YTD through June 30, revenues were up 13.8% in North America and 25.3% in Asia. Europe was down 19.4%, which the company attributes to general economic weakness and buyer price sensitivity; but Rovio, which is based in Finland, probably explains most of the decline, according to my calculations. The company says that its sales teams are not executing as well in Europe as in other regions. Management has reshuffled its international team to get a better result.Against the 6% rise in second quarter revenues, gross profit increased $0.7 million year-over-year to $21.3 million, but gross margin slipped from 66.4% to 64.8%. Operating expenses were essentially flat at $24.4 million or 74.4% of revenues. Consequently, Brightcove's operating loss declined from $4.0 million to $3.2 million. Its net loss declined from $4.3 million to $3.6 million and net loss per share from $0.13 to $0.11. Its non-GAAP net loss per share was flat at $0.04.Brightcove managed its cash position well in the second quarter. Cash flow from operating activities was positive at $0.4 million. The company incurred $2.0 million in capital expenditures, financed in part by $1.0 million in net additional debt (capital leases and equipment financing). Cash on the balance sheet declined by $0.7 million to $21.2 million.2015 Outlook. At the midpoints, management's guidance for the 2015 third quarter anticipates revenue growth of 5% and a small non-GAAP loss of $250,000 or $0.02 per share. This will be the last quarter of headwind from the loss of the Rovio business. I estimate that the company's cash burn will drop further to $200,000 and that it will end the quarter with $21 million in cash.Management's full year guidance implies that fourth quarter revenues will increase 9.0% year-over-year to $34.2 million; the company's operating loss will narrow further and its non-GAAP EPS will be at breakeven. Based upon those inputs, I project no change for the quarter in Brightcove's cash or debt.The company's guidance anticipates revenue growth of 6%-7% for all of 2015. Adjusted for Rovio, its growth rate would be 8%-9%. Adjusted further for the impact of currency, its 2015 guidance implies revenue growth of 11%-12%.With adjustments for Rovio and currency, Brightcove's revenue growth is back to double-digit territory, setting the company up for further improvement in 2016, when the headwind from Rovio will be gone completely. There is no escaping the fact, however, that Brightcove's revenue growth has decelerated steadily and sharply over the past five years, from about 45% in 2011 to a projected 6.5% (before adjustments) in 2015. It is especially worrisome that Brightcove's revenue momentum has continued to slow, even after the Unicorn Media acquisition.Yet, Brightcove is performing in line with its guidance at the beginning of the year. Management said that this would be a year of retooling and refocusing: a year spent integrating a major acquisition, revamping out its product offerings and rebuilding sales momentum.2016 Projections. Consensus estimates currently anticipate revenues of $144 million and breakeven non-GAAP EPS. That translates to a projected revenue growth rate of about 8.5% and little to no improvement in profit margins.Given the company's results to date and its full year 2015 guidance, that 2016 consensus estimate seems conservative. Projected revenue growth is consistent with the company's guidance for 2015, excluding the impact of Rovio. The revenue projections do not appear to reflect any meaningful potential improvement in the company's European sales.The assumptions about profit margin are more difficult to gauge because they depend upon the strategic and tactical steps taken by the company to respond to both threats and opportunities in the business. For example, with a moderately more aggressive revenue growth estimate of say 12% and an overall assumption that operating expenses would be held at projected 2015 dollar levels, the company would achieve breakeven GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS of $0.32. However, that outcome implies that Brightcove would shift its orientation away from managing primarily for revenue growth toward a more balanced approach of managing for both growth and profitability. If revenue growth should prove to be disappointing in 2016, the company will probably be pressed to justify any increases in operating costs.The bar has been set low enough to support a recovery in BCOV's share price in the second half of the year. This could be similar to the trading that followed last year's steep summer sell-off. Management has held firm in its full year outlook throughout 2015 and its implied guidance for the remainder of the year looks achievable. Brightcove's stock price performance in the 2015 second half and into 2016 will likely depend upon whether it can raise and beat its implied guidance for the fourth quarter.Longer-Term Valuation Considerations. The financial model upon which I based my initial price target of $15 for Brightcove now clearly appears to be outdated. That valuation was based upon the belief that Brightcove could reach an average annual revenue growth rate approaching 20% and ultimately achieve a valuation similar to Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT).The stock can still deliver good returns at this lower level, but sustained revenue growth of 20% looks like a stretch. It is now conceivable that a return to consistent growth in the low- to mid-teens and a move toward profitability could give the stock upside to about $10; but there is still downside risk for shareholders, if growth lags and losses continue.The key here, I believe, depends on whether Brightcove continues to make progress in its selling efforts and in retaining its technological edge. If it does, more online video producers will seek the advanced features that it now offers.Without an increase in growth and a move toward profitability in 2016, however, Brightcove will be pressed eventually to consider other alternatives, such as a merger or buyout."
2751145,34421,2014-12-13T06:15:00-05:00,"The third quarter non-GAAP loss of $0.03 per share was significantly better than management’s guidance of a loss of $0.08 to $0.09 per share.Yet, Brightcove showed only slight sequential improvement in its revenues, loss per share and cash flow.Investors were relieved that Brightcove’s financial performance did not deteriorate in the third quarter, but the company remains a work in progress.With new products and progress in its revamped marketing efforts, Brightcove remains optimistic about its future prospects.As this transition period ends, investors will begin to focus more on the company’s sequential performance to assess its progress and growth potential.","On October 30, Brightcove (NASDAQ:BCOV) reported a third quarter GAAP loss of $0.12 per share, compared with a loss of $0.04 in the prior year quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, the third quarter loss was $0.03 per share, compared to a profit of $0.04 last year. (Non-GAAP earnings (or loss), by my calculations, exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and merger costs). The third quarter non-GAAP loss of $0.03 per share was much better than management's previous guidance of a non-GAAP loss of $0.08 to $0.09 per share.Revenues were $31.5 million, up 10.5% from the prior year and 1.7% sequentially. After the modest bump from the acquisition of Unicorn in January 2014, revenue growth has moderated. Subscription and support revenue increased 14.8% to $30.4 million year-over-year, but professional services and other revenue declined 45.9% to $1.1 million. The drop in professional services revenue is somewhat of a concern, because the associated services are often performed for new customer installations.Despite a 72.5% increase in average video streams to 1.6 billion per month (driven most likely from the Unicorn acquisition), Brightcove has been experiencing a modest decline in revenue retention rates (defined as revenue from contract renewals divided by revenue from all contracts due to expire). For the third quarter, the company's recurring dollar retention rate was 87%, compared with 91% in the prior year and 98% in the 2014 second quarter. Thus, it appears that even though customers are streaming more videos through Brightcove, they have been simultaneously cutting back spending on other Brightcove services or negotiating lower rates.These are both the best of times and the worst of times for the video cloud services industry. On the one hand, there is strong growth in video stream viewership, driven by the proliferation of smartphones and tablets, as well as increasing demand from ""cord cutters"" who cannot or do not want to pay $60-$90 per month for cable television service and ""cord nevers,"" younger viewers who prefer online video. In October, CBS and HBO both announced that they would begin offering stand-alone streaming services for a monthly fee to counter the threat from Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, Amazon Prime Instant Video, Google Chromecast and Apple TV. According to Richard Pfeffer, CEO of HBO, there are 10 million households in the U.S. that have high speed internet connections but do not subscribe to cable or satellite television services. Half of those households subscribe to streaming services, like Netflix.At the same time, there has been pressure on the use and pricing of video cloud services, probably from two sources: first, the content providers themselves, whose profits are under pressure because advertising rates for streamed video services are low. Consequently, they are pushing to minimize delivery costs, either by provisioning content themselves or by paying as little as possible for third-party services; and second, from the large numbers of Brightcove competitors (whose service platforms are not nearly as robust or sophisticated).Brightcove has responded to the current environment in several ways:While these strategies and tactics should lead eventually to improved performance, Brightcove still must focus on generating profits and cash flow as soon as possible. The company's resources are not limitless. At the end of the third quarter, it had $21.7 million of cash on the balance sheet and no debt. It is not clear whether all of the cash is immediately accessible by the company. Some of it must be retained in order to run the company. During the quarter, Brightcove expanded its credit line with Silicon Valley Bank from $10 million to $20 million to provide to more capital, if needed.As noted, the company showed only modest sequential improvement in its financial performance. Revenues increased 10.5% to $31.5 million, but gross profit increased only 7.4% to $20.7 million as gross margin declined from 67.6% to 65.7%. Operating expenses, meanwhile, rose by 15.6% or $3.3 million, reflecting across-the-board increases in R&D, sales & marketing, and general & administrative expenses. All of this is consistent with investing in the business, especially after a significant acquisition and change in marketing strategy; but the company is walking a fine line given the slower revenue growth and tighter gross margins. Its operating loss widened by $1.8 million to $3.1 million.About one-third of the increase in the operating loss was due to non-GAAP factors, including increases in the amortization of intangible assets and higher merger costs, offset partially by slightly lower stock-based compensation. Still, the increases in ""GAAP"" operating expense raise the risk of Brightcove burning cash.Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was positive at $2.6 million, up from $0.7 million in the second quarter, but all of the increase was due to a swing in working capital, including a significant increase in deferred revenue, a reduction in prepaid and other current assets and lower accounts receivable.The increase in deferred revenue is a puzzler. These increases are normally seen as a positive sign that a company is getting more business from its customers (which will lead to higher revenues in future quarters). However, Brightcove did not portray it as such. The company's year-over-year increase in third quarter deferred revenue was 15%, well above the 10.5% increase in revenues. Yet, the decline in gross margin and the lower revenue retention rate are indicative of a challenging revenue environment.I noted in my previous update that the company's accounting policy on deferred revenues seems odd. It is very unusual for a company to have high levels of accounts receivable and deferred revenues at the same time. In Brightcove's case, its third quarter outstanding accounts receivable balance amounts to 57.1 days sales, while its deferred revenue represents 83.5 days sales. Hopefully, the company and its new CFO, Kevin Rhodes will address this issue and make policy changes, if warranted, in Brightcove's year-end financial statements.Despite the sequential increase in cash flow from operating activities and slight increase in cash, Brightcove's ratio of current assets-to-total liabilities, a measure of liquidity, declined for the second consecutive quarter. The ratio has dropped from 1.13 in the first quarter to 1.10 in the second quarter to 1.08 in the latest quarter. (The decline was actually significantly greater from the 2013 fourth quarter to the 2014 first quarter but most of that drop was due to the reduction in cash used to pay for the Unicorn acquisition). This decline in liquidity has been gradual, so it is not a major concern now, but it should be reversed as soon as possible.On balance, the market reacted positively to the third quarter performance, apparently keying off results that were better than management's guidance. Since the stock had already dropped precipitously out of fears of a rapid deterioration in performance, its bounce following the earnings announcement amounts to an expression of relief.For the fourth quarter, management has indicated a non-GAAP operating loss of $2.2 million to $2.5 million and non-GAAP operating loss of $0.08 to $0.09. It anticipates revenues of only $30.3 million to $30.8 million, a decline of 2.3%-3.9% sequentially, but a gain of 1.9%-3.5% year-over-year. This is a marked slowdown in revenue growth from the third quarter, but reflects both the pulling forward of several hundreds of thousands of professional services revenues from the fourth quarter to the third and also the full impact of the loss of the Rovio (maker of ""Angry Birds"") account. Management said that the loss of Rovio will reduce fourth quarter revenues by $0.5 million sequentially and $1.4 million year-over-year.Despite the revenue headwind, the guidance represents a marked deterioration in performance both sequentially and year-over-year. It implies, by my estimates, a sequential drop of 250 basis points in gross margin and a 650 basis point sequential increase in Brightcove's GAAP operating expense ratio. Consequently, this looks like lowballing by management. Let's hope so.It is reasonable for management to try to push operating expenses, such as R&D, sales & marketing and even G&A, higher in an effort to invest in the business; but the guidance would, according to my projections, result in a free cash burn of nearly $3 million. At that level, I think Brightcove could afford to ""invest"" for perhaps a few more quarters, but if its business does not then begin to achieve liftoff, there will be considerable pressure to scale back spending. I, for one, would be content to see another modest non-GAAP loss of up to 3 cents, as long as it is accompanied by evidence that its marketing efforts are beginning to gain traction. Such performance would, I believe, cause the market to breathe another small sigh of relief and lift the stock closer to the $8-$10 range.The upside case in Brightcove is still based upon its leadership position and the growth potential of its market. Frost & Sullivan projects that the video platform market will more than double to $800 million in five years. That translates into compounded annualized growth of about 17%.Although demand for online video continues to grow at a rapid pace, the use of sophisticated services to deliver it has been slowed by profit pressure on content providers and increasing competition, especially for basic, low-end services. Yet, the move by large content providers like CBS and HBO opens up a new potential wave of growth, where the pressure to monetize digital content leads to the increasing use of sophisticated services, such as Brightcove Once.Although the uptake for higher end video cloud services has been slow, the growth of online digital media still appears to be at an early stage. It is understandable that users of these sophisticated video cloud services may want to experiment first and see how the digital video market evolves before making a big commitment.There is still the potential for Brightcove to score a big win, from a firm like CBS, for example, as more media companies offer network access directly to viewers for a monthly fee. Brightcove is still well positioned to benefit from this next wave, if and when it occurs, but it must maintain its competitive edge. If the market grows at the rates projected by Frost & Sullivan and Brightcove maintains its leadership position, it should be able to deliver consistent growth at a level that would support a mid-teens share price. Getting there, however, may take time, perhaps into 2016.As the market evolves, it is also possible that Brightcove may be acquired by a company looking to augment its product line with video cloud services. Brightcove competitor Ooyala was acquired by the Australian telecommunications firm Telstra for the equivalent of $360 million in August. In my view, the most logical candidate to acquire Brightcove would be a service provider, like Akamai.Although at the recent price of $6.40 the stock is down significantly from its 52-week high of around $15, there is little margin of safety, so there is still downside risk. Brightcove's stock currently trades at 2.5 times its equity book value of $2.58 and more than 14 times its tangible equity book value of $0.45. The upside case is therefore based upon its growth potential, which still looks reasonably good, and perhaps its acquisition potential. While the company's performance against management's guidance will remain an important benchmark for investors, especially during this period of transition, investors will soon (probably within the next couple of quarters) become more focused on sequential performance to assess Brightcove's progress and growth prospects."
2516765,28921,2014-09-24T03:19:56-04:00,"After lowering revenue guidance due to customer loss, BCOV fell 50% and trades at a now cheap 1.4x EV/sales with Q2 margins over 66% and steadily rising.BCOV loses customer Rovio, which was a high volume but low margin non-premium user of BCOV content delivery services. Not a long-term fundamental negative for the business.Attractive acquisition target as a fully integrated SaaS offering without its own low margin CDN. For instance, Amazon's AWS could purchase BCOV as a bolt-on suite to compete with Akamai.BCOV is the strategic leader in the fast growing online video platform market. Technologically inferior competitor Ooyala was recently bought for 5x sales by Telstra.","I've written a number of times recently about the rapid secular growth in online video, but always from an ad tech standpoint. That is, the strong trend of TV brand advertising dollars inevitably moving to online video. Most recently, I wrote about my favorite play to take advantage of this fundamental shift in advertising spending. That being an online video advertising company called YuMe (NYSE:YUME). Now one of YuMe's key technology partners is Brightcove (NASDAQ:BCOV) - the leading cloud based solution for delivering and monetizing video across connected devices. In layman's terms, Brightcove is an online video platform (OVP), not much different than YouTube, but focused on the enterprise market. With the Q1 acquisition of ad-sticher Unicorn Media, Brightcove has accentuated its focus more on the more lucrative and higher margin business of cloud video monetization rather than low margin commoditized business of content delivery and streaming.On the Q2 call it was revealed that Brightcove lost a 3.8% customer and this led to a revenue guide down that effectively cut the share price nearly in half overnight. The customer was Rovio, the maker of Angry Birds. Rovio was using Brightcove only for its streaming media capabilities. So Brightcove was reselling bandwidth purchased from Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) and Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) and reselling it to Rovio. This really isn't its core business and as the CEO said on the call, the trend is going the other way. That means that due to unprecedented technological complexity, companies are increasingly outsourcing online video distribution rather than tackling it in house. The trend is certainly pointing up. Enterprise video delivery and monetization is in high demand, and Brightcove is the industry leading solution.Brightcove is also a distinct acquisition target. The most obvious potential acquirer is Akamai, which is Brightcove's main CDN provider. Its CDN contract with Brightcove expires this year. However, I've been seeing Akamai push its own in-house Sola solution as an OVP that competes against Brightcove. It seems to me that Akamai is unlikely to acquire Brightcove as it is committed to building out its own Video Cloud type offering. Recently Telstra bought weaker competitor Ooyala for a valuation over 3 times higher on a price/sales basis than Brightcove. So it is clear that consolidation is occurring in this industry. Brightcove seems like a natural bolt-on acquisition for Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS as it pushes for greater reach. The Amazon CDN, which competes with Akamai, lacks a dedicated video marketing and monetization suite like what Brightcove has. Brightcove is firmly entrenched as the market leader of OVPs, most recently being awarded Frost & Sullivan honors again for 2014.Anisha Vinny, an industry analyst with Frost & Sullivan had this to say about Brightcove:The OVP business has not been a great one historically due to the high costs of staying ahead of the technological curve. However, Brightcove is the best of the breed. It is the clear industry leader with critically acclaimed technology and the most complete solution. While I believe that the company is likely to be acquired, the margins are healthy and growing at 66%. This implies that the business is sustainable on its own if it can turn the corner on scale. Given the positive margin trend and rapid customer growth, Brightcove should be able to accomplish this move to long-term profitability by the back half of 2015. Brightcove would have been profitable sooner if not for the recent Unicorn Media acquisition that brought video ad-stitching into the mix.Brightcove also owns Zencoder, which it acquired in 2012 and is the known leader in live and file cloud encoding. With all of these acquisitions, the Brightcove Video Cloud finally has all of the pieces of the puzzle to make it the premier OVP in the industry. Coupled with the recent guide down from the loss of the low margin Rovio business, Brightcove now offers an extremely compelling value proposition at only 1.4x EV/Sales with no debt and sufficient cash to see the company through to its goal of imminent long-term profitability. I think this is a case where the cream will inevitably rise to the top and Brightcove will either flourish as an independent OVP or be acquired due to its commanding technology leadership."
2345845,29461,2014-07-27T11:08:33-04:00,,"By Sam QuestBrightcove Inc. (NASDAQ:BCOV) yesterday announced financial results for the second quarter of its fiscal 2014 (2QFY14), after the closing bell. It posted per-share loss (NYSE:LPS) of $0.04, flat year-over-year (YoY), and beat analysts' estimates of $0.11.Brightcove's revenues were $31 million, up 15.2% YoY, and outstripping the consensus estimate of $30.23 million.Key Second-Quarter DevelopmentsRevenues grew on the back of a 10% net increase in the premium customers. Total customers were 5,995 for the quarter. As a result, revenue from subscriptions and support services jumped up to $29.9 million, an increase of 17% YoY. On the other hand, revenue from professional services and other sources declined to $1.1 million, a 15.4% decline YoY.The company also launched Brightcove Video Marketing Suite and Brightcove gallery this quarter. The former is a comprehensive suite of technologies that helps marketers maximize returns on investments, and the latter is a tool that helps its digital marketing customers create unique video portal experiences for their customers.The company also signed a partnership agreement with Oracle Eloqua in order to launch the Brightcove Cloud Component for Oracle Eloqua. This integration will assist marketers in adding their Brightcove Video Cloud software-powered videos to their Oracle Eloqua campaigns and pages.Weak GuidanceDespite the company's growth during the quarter, it issued weak guidance for the ongoing quarter and the full year. Brightcove expects third-quarter revenue to be $30-30.5 million, lower than analysts' estimates of $32.4 million. The company expects to lose $0.08-0.09 per share, also below the consensus estimate of $0.07.The company also lowered its year-end guidance: revenues are expected to be $122-123.5 million, and per-share loss is expected to come in at $0.24-0.28. These estimates are also lower than the Street's projections of $128.9 million and $0.22, respectively.There are three reasons as to why company has lowered its future financial outlook. Firstly, it expects that Rovio, one of its largest European customers, will not renew its contract when it expires in August. Rovio has been developing its own internal contact management system for a considerable period of time now. Finland-based Rovio contributed 3.8% of the company's total revenue in the first quarter.Secondly, the company expects revenue from its ""Once"" product will drop $1.5 million its original forecasts for 2014; customers haven't implemented the product as fast as the company had expected. The company is also experiencing problems closing out large deals in the pipeline.Shares of Brightcove are down a whopping 38% in late trading on the Nasdaq.Original PostDisclosure: No positions."
2349015,41741,2014-07-28T15:12:43-04:00,The company beat earnings expectations again (handily) but weak guidance pressured the stock.The key to the weak guidance was one of our worst fears: Large customer loss.This highlights the risk of future customer attrition despite the solid business model and relatively cheap valuation. We believe this risk is enough to warrant a change in perspective.,"Shares of Brightcove (NASDAQ:BCOV) fell off a cliff last week; quite literally. The stock was down nearly 40% in a single day after its earnings release. Although the company did beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Q2 actually marked the eighth straight quarter the company beat earnings by 25% or more.However, the Q3 guidance is what's spooked the market. Earnings are expected to come in at a loss of between $0.08 and $0.09, versus previous consensus of a only a $0.07 a share loss. The big news is that Brightcove is losing a large customer in Q3. European based Rovio (which accounts for just under 5% of revenues) has developed its own system and will not renew its contract in Q3.The near 40% fall last week puts us down 50% since we profiled Brightcove back in October. Our worst case scenario effectively came true, where we noted that rising competition could really hamper Brightcove's growth. It's worth noting that more customer losses could come, as we noted, ""The biggest competitor to Brightcove is Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Youtube. It allows users to upload their own videos for free.""Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2530355,34421,2014-10-01T06:15:00-04:00,"Brightcove’s stock fell 38% to $6.38 on July 24, when it reduced its 2014 revenues and earnings outlook. The cut in outlook was modest. Second-quarter results actually exceeded guidance.BCOV’s fall was exacerbated by the resignation of its CFO, which raises concerns about hidden accounting or financial problems. Although disclosures should be improved, I found no proof of problems.With a recent acquisition and operating losses, BCOV’s cash position has dropped sharply this year. If the cash burn does not end soon, BCOV will need to raise capital.According to Frost & Sullivan, BCOV’s core market is expected to double by 2019 (in five years).Although BCOV looks expensive by traditional valuation measures, the stock still has upside (to my $15 target), assuming that no problems emerge and the company moves steadily toward profitability.","On July 24, in conjunction with its earnings conference call, Brightcove (NASDAQ:BCOV) cut its outlook for 2014 revenues and non-GAAP earnings. It reduced its full-year revenue guidance from $126-$130 million to $122-$123.5 million, a decline of 4.1% measured at the midpoints. It also increased both the low-end and the high-end of its expected non-GAAP loss from $5.0-$7.0 million (or $0.19 to $0.25 per share) to a loss of $6.5-$7.5 million (or $0.24-$0.28) per share.For Brightcove, non-GAAP earnings exclude (non-cash) stock-based compensation expense, (non-cash) amortization of intangible assets and merger-related expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, these three items totaled $7.2 million or $0.23 per share, compared with $5.1 million or $0.19 per share in the comparable prior year period. Assuming roughly comparable non-GAAP expenses in the 2014 second half (excluding about $1 million in first half merger transaction costs), the company's full-year guidance now implies a GAAP loss $0.68-$0.72 per share. Last year, the company reported a GAAP loss of $0.36 per share and breakeven non-GAAP earnings.Second-quarter results actually exceeded estimates. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $0.04 per share, better than its previous guidance of a non-GAAP loss of $0.11-$0.12 per share. Revenues of $31.0 million were ahead of the company's guidance range of $29.7 to $30.2 million.The reduction in 2014 guidance was based upon three factors: First, the company has been notified by one of its largest customers, Rovio, the maker of Angry Birds, that it plans to end its relationship with Brightcove and bring the management of its video platform in-house. Rovio was a high volume, but low-tech user of Brightcove's services. It has recently accounted for 3.8% of BCOV's revenues and 15% of its video streams. The loss is a modest setback that will create some performance headwinds for 2015.Second, the integration of Unicorn Media, which was acquired in January, is taking longer than anticipated. Part of the delay is due to transitioning Unicorn to a different pricing model. (Unicorn's pricing model was volume driven with low upfront payments. Brightcove emphasizes bigger upfront retainers on annual contracts.) Part is also due to the complexity of integrating Unicorn's Once ad-insertion technology into Brightcove's existing Video Cloud platform. These difficulties caused some delays in several large customer implementations.Third, it is also taking longer than expected to refocus its salesforce. Previously, the company's sales force tried to bring in business from small and large video producers alike in an effort to build volume. Now, with the rounding out of its product portfolio following the Unicorn acquisition, Brightcove is focusing intently on getting big contracts with major media companies (like Viacom, ESPN and CBS) and enterprises with top brands (like Hugo Boss, Toyota and Intel) that are seeking to use video to build better brand awareness and customer engagement. Gaining contracts with these high-end users for its more sophisticated product offering probably requires longer lead times. Brightcove is also looking to expand its presence outside the U.S. and recently hired a new team to handle Asia-Pacific sales.Despite beating guidance on both revenues and earnings and making only a modest reduction in its full-year guidance, Brightcove's stock fell 38% from $10.27 to $6.38 on the day of the second-quarter earnings announcement. Since earnings and revenues exceeded guidance and the reduction in the outlook for 2014 was modest, this looks like an overreaction by investors.Along with the second-quarter results and change in guidance, Brightcove announced that its CFO, Chris Menard, was leaving to pursue other opportunities. Mr. Menard was highly regarded by the analyst community. Brightcove is still very much a work in progress, so this does not seem to be an appropriate time for a CFO change. There is almost certainly more to this story. I have not discussed this with the company or found a detailed explanation for the departure in the media.That surprising news along with the plunge in stock price raises the concern that Brightcove faces some hidden and undisclosed financial problem.At least one of Brightcove's accounting practices is unusual. The company records both deferred revenue and accounts receivable when it bills a customer for retainer payments on one-year (or longer) contracts. It is more typical to skip booking the receivable and record the deferred revenue upon receipt of payment. In these situations, Brightcove receives a large payment upfront, but recognizes revenue steadily over the remaining term of the contract. This accounting policy should have no impact on earnings, but it can and should disclose more about this practice. For example, it should provide a footnote that breaks the composition of its accounts receivable into two categories: one for contract retainers and another for normal receivables in the ordinary course of business.Although there are other items on my Brightcove disclosure wish list, I could find no other tangible and irrefutable evidence of accounting shenanigans. Nevertheless, with the questions surrounding Mr. Menard's departure, the market's apparent concern may not subside for a couple of quarters or more.A more pressing concern is the reduction in Brightcove's cash position. Its total cash and cash equivalents (plus short-term investments) declined from $36.1 million at the end of 2013 to $20.8 million on June 30, 2014. $4.3 million of the cash at June 30 was held outside the U.S. and the company currently has no intention to repatriate it.Of the total reduction in cash and short-term investments of $15.3 million, $9.1 million was due to the acquisition of Unicorn. The remainder was due to operating losses, capital expenditures and working capital changes. If Brightcove's cash burn continues at that rate, it would run out of cash in a year or so. Yet, the company is still in hiring mode as it seeks to grow the business.There is reason to expect better cash performance in the second half of the year. Brightcove should be able to work out the integration problems before too long. As the organization begins to pull together, it should build sales momentum. Despite adding people, management is acutely aware of the need to keep costs in check. Thus, operating costs will likely rise with revenues, but they should decline as a percentage of revenues over time.Furthermore, if the company's cash flow follows last year's seasonal pattern, its cash burn should ease over the next couple of quarters as it squeezes more cash out of working capital. This probably will not eliminate the concern, but it should alleviate it, as long as the rest of its business shows improvement.While there have been concerns about slowing revenue growth for Brightcove, video traffic is still growing at a rapid pace, which should guarantee solid growth for the video platform market. Alcatel-Lucent has projected (in its annual SEC filings) that video traffic will grow 720% globally between 2012 and 2017, which is equivalent to a compounded annual growth rate of 50%. With the growth in video traffic, Frost & Sullivan projects that the video platform market will more than double to $800 million in five years. That translates into compounded annualized growth of about 17%, which is only slightly above Brightcove's recent revenue growth rate (admittedly with help from acquisitions). The consulting firm notes that the number of regional video platform providers is increasing. But these regional competitors are less likely to offer products and services that are as sophisticated as Brightcove's.If so, this confirms the soundness of Brightcove's strategy. By focusing on the top users of video among major media and brand-focused enterprises, Brightcove can solidify its position among the market leaders, while building a profitable business. It also makes sense for Brightcove to exit the low end of the market, which is becoming more competitive (and perhaps commoditized).Valuing Brightcove is challenging, especially with the near-term slowdown in growth. By any traditional measure, the valuation looks high: The company has no earnings. It is trading at 12 times tangible book value. Its enterprise market value-to-EBITDA multiple is 70. (Except for a modest amount of capitalized leases ($1.35 million), Brightcove has no debt. It recently expanded its accounts receivable credit line with Silicon Valley Bank from $8 million to $10 million, but had no outstandings under the facility as of June 30.)Clearly, Brightcove will have to grow its revenues significantly and deliver sustainable earnings to justify even its current low valuation. However, as I discussed in my previous report on the company, the stock can deliver superior returns, if Brightcove can achieve rates of growth in revenues and profits that are consistent with other software-as-a-service companies, like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT). Under this methodology, my price target was (and still is) $15; but the time for getting there may stretch into 2016.As another check on value, consider the recent acquisition of Ooyalah, a Brightcove competitor, by the Australian telecommunications giant, Telstra. On August 11, Telstra announced that it had agreed to pay $270 million to increase its stake in Ooyalah from 23% to 98%. That works out to an implied valuation of $360 million for a company whose technology and market position are considered at least a step behind Brightcove's. (By comparison, Brightcove, with no outstanding debt, has a current equity market capitalization of $182 million.)As long as Mr. Menard's departure is not a sign of financial problems and the company is able to recover its growth trajectory, this speculative stock should have significant upside potential. Despite the collapse in its share price in July, the stock has held firm at the $6 level for most of that time since, making it more attractive from a technical point of view; but it has slipped in six of the past seven trading sessions.On Sept. 24, the company filed an 8-K with the SEC reporting that it had suffered a service disruption due to a distributed denial-of-service attack at third party data center facilities that it utilizes. It restored the services impacted by this disruption by Sept. 20. Brightcove has contacted federal law enforcement authorities about this matter and is conducting an assessment of its future vulnerability and capacity to withstand and recover from future attacks. This matter may result in charges to its profit and loss statement (for remediation expenses, litigation and other items, offset partially by service credits), but it did not say whether any of these charges would be covered by insurance. The company does not believe that the incident will have a material adverse effect on its business or financial results."
2307985,34421,2014-07-10T08:53:21-04:00,"BCOV has fallen back modestly after a 38% gain in eight weeks, probably on profit taking.
        New product introductions should resonate with big media customers and lift revenues within the next few quarters.
        Consensus estimates for the second quarter and management's guidance for 2014 appear to be conservative.","Brightcove (NASDAQ:BCOV) is likely to report 2014 second quarter earnings on or about July 24. Thomson Financial (via Yahoo! Finance) indicates an average analyst estimate for the second quarter of -$0.11 per share on a non-GAAP basis, wider than last year's -$0.04. Analysts anticipate revenues of $30.2 million, up 12.4% from last year's $26.9 million.For Brightcove, non-GAAP earnings typically exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles and merger-related expenses. I estimate that these items will amount to $0.09 in the second quarter, which would translate into a GAAP loss of -$0.20 per share, compared with the previous year's loss of -$0.12 per share. Brightcove's exclusion of these three items to arrive at non-GAAP earnings is consistent with common disclosure practices in the technology sector, even though some analysts prefer to use GAAP earnings to measure financial performance.For the 2014 first quarter, the company reported a non-GAAP loss of -$0.02, much better than the consensus estimate of $-0.09. Yet, management only affirmed its full year guidance of $126-$130 million in revenues and a non-GAAP loss of $5-$7 million (or -$0.19 to -$0.25). After such a big earnings beat, however, the Street was looking for a bump up in full year guidance; so the reaffirmation was seen as disappointing. On the day following the earnings announcement, the stock opened higher at $8.87, but then fell sharply on that day and the day after, closing at $7.95, down 10.4% in two trading sessions.Since then, however, Brightcove's stock has rebounded, helped perhaps by new product announcements at its annual Brightcove PLAY conference on May 8. These are enhancements to the digital video distribution process that allow media companies and digital marketers to add sophisticated features, such as Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and social media sharing to their videos, or adapt them more quickly and easily for playback on the full range of devices, including PCs, tablets, smartphones and widescreen TVs. Such new features will help improve the quality of user engagement. They also allow content creators to apply sophisticated analytics from third-party service partners, like Akamai and Nielsen, to measure more precisely the effectiveness of their media campaigns and calculate return on investment. Although the improvement in the quality of internet video and analytics in recent years is evident, these product enhancements appear to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. While Brightcove and its competitors are all chasing the same proverbial mechanical rabbit, Brightcove clearly creates the impression that it is the lead greyhound.After Brightcove PLAY, the stock rebounded back well above its 50-day moving average to nearly $11 on July 1; but it has since fallen back to around $9.50 currently, probably due to profit-taking after a 38% gain in just 8 weeks. The stock is now sitting on its 50-day moving average.Based upon its updated first quarter guidance, I believe that the company has set a relatively low bar for the second quarter and the rest of the year. Given its recent purchase of Unicorn Media, and with the improved outlook for the economy, which should create a more favorable business environment for content providers and digital marketers, Brightcove should be able to deliver better-than-anticipated financial performance over the next few quarters.Management's 2014 revenue guidance of $126-$130 million represents an increase of only a 9%-12.5% over 2013 revenues. In light of the expected continuing rapid adoption of sophisticated digital video offerings, this guidance seems modest. But it is also prudent, given that Brightcove has recently shifted its marketing focus exclusively in favor of its high volume media customers and is still in the process of finalizing its new product platforms.By my estimates, Brightcove's earnings guidance implies that the company will achieve profitability (on a non-GAAP basis) by the fourth quarter. With revenue growth probably constrained over the next quarter or two, the key to meeting that earnings guidance depends its ability to reduce operating costs. This ought to be doable. In the first quarter, the company was able to reduce sales and marketing costs as a percent of revenues by 370 basis points to 36.5% and general and administrative costs by 350 basis points to 15.2%. Similar cost reductions over the next few quarters combined with moderate revenue growth should allow Brightcove to clear its non-GAAP earnings goals.While it cannot be argued that the stock is cheap in an absolute sense - the company, after all, is still losing money - I believe, as I argued in my previous article (now available only to PRO subscribers) that Brightcove's stock still has significant upside. Given the recent pullback, which occurred on no news and on relatively low volume, the stock should have little near-term downside and at least a modest amount of upside potential (perhaps to $12-13). Getting and staying above $15 per share will, in my view, require clear evidence of real and sustainable revenue growth and a move to consistent profitability.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1931451,20875,2014-01-07T04:07:11-05:00,,"On Monday, Brightcove announced they have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Unicorn Media at a deal valued around $49M. Unicorn will do between $8-$9M in revenue for 2014, so they are getting a valuation of about 6x 2014 revenue, on a business expected to lose $12M next year. The deal consists of approximately 2.9M shares of Brightcove stock and approximately $9M of cash and is expected to close sometime this quarter. Brightcove is also paying approximately $2M to certain Unicorn employees as part of a multi-year retention plan and has announced that as part of the acquisition, five Unicorn Media executives will have senior leadership positions at Brightcove.While this deal makes sense from a technology integration point of view, Unicorn is losing a lot of money. The company did about $5M in revenue for 2013 and expects to grow that to between $8-$9M in 2014. The problem with the business is that Brightcove says that Unicorn will lose between $11M-$12M in 2014, which is a lot to lose on such small revenue. As part of this announcement, Brightcove has also announced preliminary fourth quarter and yearly revenue. Total revenue for the company in 2014 is expected to be $126M-$130M and they expect to lose $9M-$12M for the year.Brightcove had been telling Wall Street they were going to end 2013 as a profitable company, but now they don't even expect to be profitable in 2014. Wall Street was expecting Brightcove to be profitable this year, so naturally they aren't liking this news and Brightcove's stock closed down $2.98 a share, losing 20% of their value. Earlier in the day it was down 26% on the news. While Brightcove might have shown slight profitability for 2013 if they had not done the Unicorn acquisition, revenue growth would have been lower than expected. Brightcove's rate of growth is slowing with their 2014 projected revenue putting the growth of their business at about 10% for 2014.For those not familiar with Unicorn Media, the company sells a cloud based platform called Unicorn Once. It allows premium content owners to easily take one piece of video and deliver it to multiple screens and platforms and dynamically insert ads for VOD and live streams. The company's CEO, founder and largest shareholder is Bill Rinehart, who formerly was the founding CEO at Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) and their CTO, AJ McGowan was also from Limelight Networks where he served as Director of Solutions Engineering. Customers I know who use Unicorn's platform have spoken highly about it and Unicorn gets very high marks when it comes to support and service, but like all vendors in this particular segment of the market, Unicorn has had trouble scaling their business.The company was founded in 2007 and six years later only grew revenue to $5M in 2013. For all the talk of online video advertising, companies offering ad insertion services and platforms for premium content owners haven't had much success in becoming profitable and/or scaling their business. The market for these services, while very crucial to content owners, is too small and will stay so for a very long time. While Unicorn is tiny, even the two largest vendors in this market, Brightcove and Ooyala, have raised almost $275M to date but still aren't profitable. It takes far too much money to scale an online video platform business, especially when these vendors still get a large percentage of their revenue from the re-sale of CDN bandwidth and not from cloud platform services. Once companies in this sector grow to around the $100M mark, it gets very hard for them to grow their business at the rate they are accustomed to.It also doesn't help that vendors continue to set expectations in this market that aren't realistic, which Brightcove seems to have a habit of doing. I get that they are excited about the market they are in, I am too. Having passion is a good thing. But you have to temper that passion with setting the proper expectations in the market and being realistic. Brightcove made this mistake when in their S-1 filing they said the ""total potential market opportunity was approximately $2.3 billion in 2011, growing to approximately $5.8 billion in 2015″. And I cringed when I read yesterday's press release that quoted a high-level, generic research on the online video ad market saying, ""the online video advertising market represented $10.4 billion U.S. dollars in worldwide spending in 2013, with spending expected to grow to $16.8 billion by 2015."" Using these numbers, the size of the market Brightcove is going after is more than $13B, which means for 2013, Brightcove would not have even captured one half of one percent of the market. Yet, they have the most revenue of any other vendor. So how can the market be as big as these numbers say? It can't. Again, I get the excitement some vendors have for what they are doing, Brightcove included, but set the right expectations.Unicorn Media does have some unique intellectual property as they have been issued 14 U.S. patents and 7 international ones with 20 additional patents pending. Maybe that would explain why Brightcove gave them the high valuation they did, but patents are only worth something if you can enforce them. It takes a lot of effort and money to enforce patents and I don't see that being a business Brightcove is looking to get into, patent enforcement and/or licensing. As part of the deal, Unicorn's CTO will be become the new CTO of Brightcove and Unicorn's CEO will become SVP, Market Development for Media, which is a new group Brightcove has created inside the company to, ""define and bring to market focused solutions that help media companies increase their revenue and decrease costs."" How this goal is any different from what Brightcove is, and has already been doing for years with media companies, is not clear to me.As with any deal like this where a lot of technical integration needs to be done between multiple platforms, the success of this deal is going to be judged on how well both companies combine what they have. Based on what needs to take place, the companies have a lot of work cut out for themselves. Rather than me try to explain it, here's what the CEO of Brightcove said in a blog post, ""We plan to integrate Once technologies with future versions of Brightcove Video Cloud and Brightcove Zencoder. Over time, Video.js and other Brightcove Web players and native player SDKs will integrate with OnceUX technologies to support instrumented playback of Once streams. In a similar fashion, Video Cloud will eventually integrate with Once for video on-demand streaming, and Video Cloud Live and Zencoder Live Cloud Transcoding will integrate with OnceLIVE for fully monetized live event streaming."" That's a lot of integration. No date was given as to when they expect it all to be completed.In 2012, Brightcove spent $30M to acquire Zencoder which was projected to do $2M in revenue for the year. Add in the Unicorn Media deal and Brightcove has now spent $79M in two deals for two companies that combined, will add $12M-$14M in revenue in 2014. I understand where the pieces that Zencoder and Unicorn bring fit into Brightcove's ecosystem, which does make their platform stronger, but the valuation they gave both companies was way too high. Brightcove is making some huge bets as to the future of this market and while there is nothing wrong with that, you have to be realistic on what's really transpiring in the market and how quickly it will grow. Saying in your press release that you ""believe that online video has the potential to surpass traditional TV"" is simply buying into the hype. If the market Brightcove is targeting is really more than $13B dollars this year, how are they only expecting to grow their business as a whole by 10%? These inflated market projections that many vendors all use are simply that, inflated and not realistic.When it comes to doing ad insertion, in particular for live streaming, it's hard to make it work right. Even if you can do it, the market is and will be small for many years to come as there is more VOD content available than live. Plus even when it comes to the smaller live ad insertion market, it's a crowded arena. Vendors who have solutions, or are working on solutions for live ad insertion include mDialog, Yospace, Jivox, Ooyala, Blackarrow, Vubiquity, FreeWheel, Azuki Systems, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Volar Video and others. Some of these companies are still working on such solutions and others may not work as well as advertised, in fact some don't, but the point is there are a lot of vendors in the market trying to solve the same problem, for a market that can realistically only support a few of them.Not to mention, the fragmentation in the online video advertising world is a nightmare as no standards exist, which keep the market for online video advertising services from really growing quickly. You have physical ad insertion vs. ad / campaign management and content ops vs. ad ops with no overlapping server-side insertion functionality between the two. Add in the fact that there is a lot of strategy involved with premium content owners trying to find the balance of how much content is streamed on the Internet vs. protecting their legacy cable TV ratings, and stream stitching for ads is only one small part of the problem. A larger business problems exists in addition to the technical one.I respect Brightcove for what they have done. They basically created the industry they are in. They are passionate, they love what they do and from everything I have seen and heard, they treat employees well and treat customers with respect. But they have to set realistic expectations not only for Wall Street, but also for the rest of the industry. I talk to a lot of Wall Street money managers about Brightcove's business and many don't find them a compelling story anymore. They always say to me, ""I expected the market for these services to grow faster and be larger."" And it's not just Wall Street Brightcove has to set the right expectations with.As long as Brightcove is the leader in this market for these services, based on revenue, others look to them for the valuations they put on the acquisitions they make. Like it or not, Brightcove is the barometer for the online video platform industry and everyone notices what they do. Eighteen months after Brightcove's acquisition of Zencoder, we have no data points from the company to show if it was a success. I hope after the Unicorn Media acquisition is closed and the platforms are integrated, the company will provide the industry concrete evidence as to what's really taking place in the online video ad market, with real numbers on how it is growing.Disclosure: No positions"
1769072,41741,2013-10-24T12:08:36-04:00,,"Shares in Brightcove (NASDAQ:BCOV) have had quite a run so far this year, up nearly 50%, but the run is just getting started. We're approaching an inflection point, where the demand for online video services is really picking up. This and other major tailwinds will go a long way in driving top- and bottom-line growth for the company. While this year's gains have been impressive, the stock still remains below its $25 high following Brightcove's 2012 IPO.OverviewBrightcove is at the forefront of cloud-based solutions for publishing and distributing professional and digital media. According to the company, its flagship product released in 2006, Brightcove Video Cloud, is the world's leading online video platform. At the end of last year, the company had 6,367 customers in over 60 countries. The company stated in its 10-K:In essence, what the Video Cloud does is that it allows Brightcove's customers to publish and distribute videos online quickly and efficiently. Brightcove's technology and user interface allow for content management, format conversion, video player styling, distributed caching, advertising insertion, content protection and distribution to various device types and multiple websites. Brightcove's revenue model is based on the SaaS model.Key acquisition and customer sign-ups make for powerful tailwindsWhile there are a number of tailwinds for the company, first is the company's Zencoder acquisition in August of last year. Zencoder is a key acquisition for Brightcove as it was a competitor to Brightcove with its own cloud-based media processing service and HTML5 video player. Brightcove has been able to promote Zencoder as both a stand-alone offering as well as integrate it with its own Video Cloud product.Zencoder is unique that it can transcode video and audio files in the cloud via multi-screen delivery. It can do this at a rate of 10x faster than other cloud offerings. Zencoder also offers a complete adaptive bitrate solution for iOS and 99.9% of codecs supported. The Zencoder live cloud transcoding service looks like this:As you can see, the process is seamless and starts at the live event and goes through a streamlined process into the cloud and then viewed by consumers.The second tailwind is where Brightcove has been successful with a number of high-profile sign-ups. These include Viacom, Rovio Entertainment, Wall Street Journal, NY Times, AMC, NBCUniversal, Network Ten, Johnson & Johnson, Starwood Hotels, Discovery International, and many more. They have a proven ability to get customers interested, we look for this to continue. This is a testament to Brightcove's reputation and, most notably, that it's product is more than useful.Third, online video consumption is growing 30% Y/Y. This is driving online video and digital advertising growth. Last year, online video advertising grew 21% to $2.3 billion from $1.9 billion in 2011. Digital advertising is a much larger market and grew 15% to $36.5 billion from $31.7 billion in 2011. Brightcove operates right smack dab in the middle of the market.Fourth, online video mobile growth is growing even faster. Mobile devices now account for 23% of all web traffic. While online video consumption is growing 30% Y/Y, mobile video is growing 300% Y/Y.The good news for Brightcove is that its HTML5 is killing Flash on every platform. Furthermore, HTML5 advertising is ready to grow and this will allow Brightcove's customers to start monetizing its mobile traffic, which is one of the biggest challenges faced by content providers.Fifth, Brightcove's next generation video player is quickly gaining traction. Since March of last year, the video player has gone from operating on 25,000 websites to over 65,000 in May of this year. The video player was built from the ground up in HTML5 and offers most importantly - content protection for developers.Sixth, Brightcove just hired Thomas Nielsen as the SVP of Products. Prior to this, he was the CEO of RealNetworks and before that, he was an executive at Adobe and Microsoft. We see his hiring as a testament to the company's potential in the video network.Seventh, as of June 30, Brightcove's YTD average monthly video streams were 919 million. This is a 36% increase on a Y/Y basis. Furthermore, this was up from the 853 million average monthly video streams seen at the end of 1Q.Eighth, Brightcove has done a great job in incentivizing its sales force based on the revenues that they bring in. They're going after the bigger deals and deals that they can close the fastest. The sales team has also been able to upsell and been able to turn small deals into big deals. Management credits its strong sales team as the reason for having to raise earnings guidance twice over the past two quarters.Ninth, Brightcove now has its Analytics module, whereas prior, it relied on a third party. The Analytics module is integrated with the Video Cloud and allows Brightcove's customers to get a read on video views, engagement, geographic region, devices and platforms. It's a real-time system that Brightcove is continuing to innovate and add new features. In other words, as viewers are watching a video, it allows the content provider to know how the video is being watched and where it's being watched.Investment thesisIn looking at Brightcove, we see several things that we like. It's a rapidly growing company with revenues rising from $1.4 million in 2006 to $88 million last year. In 2Q, revenues grew 24% Y/Y. This year the company projects revenues of between $104 million and $106 million. Most analysts expect the company to come in on the high side as Brightcove has a history of beating estimates.And we think Brightcove is going to come in on the high side of expectations because its customer recurring dollar retention rate is now 103%. This is up from 88% in 2010. That, coupled with new business, will push the company's revenues and earnings higher. Furthermore, last year the company ended the year with a backlog of $53 million.On the company's earnings call, CFO Christopher Menard described the key to the company's retention rate:Source: Yahoo! FinanceAs you can see, Brightcove has beaten earnings expectations the last four quarters by an average of 39%. This year the company will likely come in at a loss of $0.15 per share compared to a loss of $0.34 last year. This is a significant improvement, but what has us really excited is that the company is forecast to turn profitable next year.We also like the fact that the company's business is geographically diverse. In 2Q, North American revenues accounted for 59%, Europe 24%, and the Asia-Pacific region 17%.By the numbersThe company's current gross margin is 67%, but we see that increasing to around 78%. The company has been doing a good job of trimming operating expenses from 78% of revenues in 2012 to 72% so far this year. Brightcove has brought down its R&D expenses, as well sales and marketing. The company's goal is to get operating expenses down to around 58% of revenues. If this were to happen, we could see 20% of revenues as operating income.We also like the fact that Brightcove isn't burning cash. The company has $30 million in cash and is actually throwing off positive operating cash flow (ttm) of $2.68 million. Levered free cash flow (NYSE:TTM) is even higher at $7.39 million.Brightcove is only trading at 3.93x sales and 6.6x book value per share.Where we could be wrongThe biggest competitor to Brightcove is Google's Youtube. It allows users to upload their own videos for free, but this is primarily the DIY market. On the company's earnings call, CEO David Mendels did a good job of explaining the competitive environment for Brightcove.Bottom lineIn June of last year, our fellow SA Contributor Dana Blankenhorn had a great article on Brightcove where he talked about the possibility of the company as takeover bait. We agree with his assessment that Brightcove has takeover potential and would fill a lot of holes in a company's product line.The real value in Brightcove lies in its technology and IP portfolio. Both of these also provide downside protection for investors. Dana Blankenhorn gave a two year window to June of 2014. We're quickly closing in on that window, but our window is slightly longer, as we feel that management isn't looking to sell the company and is intent on building the business. We see the company as turning profitable next year and earnings growing 25% annually over the next five years. We see shares of Brightcove staging a rally into next year, with upside to $25, for a gain of 90% from today's prices.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2026321,34421,2014-02-18T13:45:29-05:00,,"Brightcove (NASDAQ:BCOV) is a leading provider of cloud-based solutions for publishing and distributing digital video to internet-connected devices. The company was founded in 2004. It is based in Boston and operates globally, with offices in London, Tokyo, Paris, Barcelona, Singapore, Sydney, Seoul and most recently, Dubai. Jeremy Allaire, Chairman of the Board and a co-founder of the company, served as CEO until April 2013, when he handed the reigns over to David Mendels. Mr. Mendels had joined BCOV in 2010 as President and COO, after serving in executive positions at Macromedia and Adobe. Mr. Allaire was a principal at General Catalyst Partners (NYSE:GCP), which along with Accel Partners, were the two main early stage investors in the company. Both GCP and Accel have since sold their stakes. However, David Orfao, a Managing Director and co-founder of GCP, still sits on Brightcove's board.Brightcove's main product is Video Cloud, a service that allows customers to upload, encode, distribute and manage video content through a cloud-based application. Video Cloud improves video quality and minimizes file size. It provides customizable, full featured video players that support a wide array of operating systems, digital formats and devices. It also offers content management services that help users to analyze and monetize their video traffic. The finished product is usually distributed to users via content delivery networks, like Akamai and Limelight Networks.Video Cloud also offers live streaming services. It employs a multi-tenant architecture that enables it to serve all of its customers from a single software framework (with versions targeted to certain customer segments). This facilitates scaling the application as demand for the service grows.In August 2012, Brightcove acquired privately-held Zencoder, Inc. for $27.4 million in cash. Zencoder makes a highly-regarded cloud-based encoder (known as the Zencoder service) which prepares video content for distribution to a full array of viewing devices. At the time of acquisition, the Zencoder service had 1,000 paying customers, including PBS, Scripps Networks Interactive, IGN Entertainment and SmugMug. Zencoder is a scalable and secure platform with tools that allow customers to edit and manipulate a wide variety of video formats and generate very high quality video output. Zencoder has also developed an open source HTML5 video player, called HTML5.js, which is used by many websites, including Airbnb.com.At the time of acquisition, Zencoder, was losing money. Brightcove allowed Zencoder to continue as a standalone service, but it also planned to use Zencoder to enhance Video Cloud's capabilities. The company recently announced a new version of Video Cloud, called Video Cloud Live, which uses Zencoder to process live video content.On January 31, Brightcove completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Unicorn Media for consideration totaling $49 million, including 2.85 million shares of BCOV valued at $14 per share plus $9 million in cash to cover transaction and other costs. Unicorn has developed a cloud-based service called Once, which allows content providers to dynamically insert both customized programming and targeted advertising into on-demand and live video streams. Unicorn has been awarded 14 patents and has 20 patent applications pending for the technologies that underpin Once and related products. ESPN, NBC News and the Weather Channel subscribe to the service. Following the acquisition, Once is now known as Brightcove Once.Brightcove intends to integrate Once into its other service offerings. For example, it recently launched a targeted ad service for Google's Chromecast. Five executives of Unicorn have assumed key positions at Brightcove, including the heads of media marketing and technology. Brightcove is discontinuing most of its low-end Video Cloud Express offerings to concentrate on marketing to large media organizations in order to maximize the opportunity that it sees with the addition of Brightcove Once.When it announced the Unicorn Media acquisition on January 6, Brightcove reaffirmed its fourth quarter outlook and provide preliminary guidance for 2014. The company said that it expected 2014 revenues of $126-$130 million and a non-GAAP loss from operations of $9-$12 million. That loss included a loss attributable to Unicorn of $11-$12 million.The stock plunged 20% on the day of the announcement, closing at $11.59. It has since fallen another 19% and now stands at $9.37. Investors were disappointed for a number of reasons, as articulated in a Seeking Alpha article by Dan Rayburn on January 7. Besides the added dilution of the shares issued to Unicorn's owners - equal to an estimated 9% stake in BCOV - some investors have raised concerns about whether Unicorn can deliver. Mr. Rayburn pointed out that in the six years since its founding in 2007, Unicorn had only ramped up to $5 million in revenues. (On a conference call, Brightcove's management said that Unicorn did not pursue the opportunity to develop Once until recently.) Even so, Brightcove anticipates that Unicorn's revenues will rise 60%-80% to $8-$9 million in 2014.The expected 2014 operating loss for Brightcove also did not sit well with investors. Management had asserted previously that Brightcove would be profitable in 2014. Now, it anticipates that Brightcove will not become profitable until the 2015 first quarter.On top of this, the company's revenue growth is slowing. Total revenues increased by 45% in 2011, 38% in 2012, 25% in 2013 and management's guidance translates into expected 2014 growth of 15%-19% (or 6%-11%, excluding the Unicorn acquisition). Management said that the company faced some revenue headwinds in the 2014 first half, due to an expected decline in customer overage revenues and higher than anticipated professional services revenue in the last half of 2013. But it also indicated problems in sustaining demand in its 2013 third quarter 10-Q and slower industry growth than it originally anticipated. Given that online video still accounts for a small proportion of the total video market, we believe that this recent slowdown is temporary and that demand will pick-up over time, especially as new services like Brightcove Once are rolled out.Except for the revenue headwinds, it does appear that management is achieving its prior guidance of core business profitability in 2014. Excluding the $11-$12 million non-GAAP loss from operations for Unicorn in 2014, management expects to deliver non-GAAP operating profit of $0-$3 million from the rest of its business. That may be only a negligible improvement over 2013, but it does look like management has set a low bar for 2014 and this is reflected in consensus estimates. Excluding Unicorn, guidance for the base business is below historical improvement trends.Table 1Brightcove, Inc.Historical and Projected Financial Performance: 2010-2016($000s)Source: Company financial statements, 2013 Fourth Quarter earnings report and Lark Research calculations and estimates.Our projections, given in the table above, provide a framework for the level of performance that we think will be necessary for BCOV's stock price to recover the ground that it has lost. Our projections for 2014 are consistent with management's published guidance of $126-$130 million in revenues, a non-GAAP operating loss of $9-$12 million and expected shares outstanding of 32.1 million. Assuming that consensus estimates are based upon non-GAAP EPS, they are also in line with consensus estimates.Despite the first half revenue headwinds, Brightcove's 2014 guidance appears to be conservative. Excluding the negative initial impact of the Unicorn acquisition ($9 million in revenue and a non-GAAP operating loss of $11-$12 million), the guidance assumes net revenue growth of only 6%-11% for the full year and a slight improvement in profitability. Although revenue growth is slowing, the company has been making steady progress over the past few years in improving its operating efficiency.If the company fails to beat guidance in 2014, we believe that it must show tangible progress in non-financial measures, such as signing up new customers, to provide support for improved financial performance in 2015. Otherwise, its stock price will remain vulnerable and the company may be faced with the prospect of having to make drastic expense cuts to attain profitability on a more modest revenue base.Beyond 2014, our projection framework assumes a moderate pickup in revenue growth, to just below 20% in 2015 and 2016. Under our assumptions, higher gross margins and lower operating expenses would lead the way to non-GAAP earnings of $0.07 in 2015 and $0.48 in 2016. Our framework even shows Brightcove posting GAAP earnings of $0.14 per share in 2016.This is would be an impressive achievement, but it reflects expense ratio targets that are less aggressive that those suggested by CFO Chris Menard in a recent investor presentation. There, he hinted at fairly aggressive long-term targets for certain key income statement line items, including r&d expense at 13% of revenues, sales and marketing costs in the mid-30s (contingent upon an acceleration in sales growth) and general and administrative costs at 11%-12% of revenues, all of which are well below current levels. Mr. Menard would also like to see gross margins well into the 70s, but acknowledges the significant challenges in getting there. If the company were to achieve Mr. Menard's targets on a sustainable basis, its common stock would trade at a multiple of the current price.Valuation is always a challenge with early stage companies like Brightcove, especially in software. We think that BCOV fits the financial profile of a couple of software companies that we have looked at briefly: Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT). Both of these companies are considered to have good growth rates and their stocks trade at very high forward P/E multiples. By our calculations, Salesforce trades at 125 times next year's consensus earnings, Red Hat at 36 times. Both are well above the broader market's forward P/E multiple and have been for quite some time.In Brightcove's case, a near-term (i.e. 6-12 month) price target of $12 would equate to a forward P/E multiple of 170 times our 2015 non-GAAP estimate of $0.07 per share and 25 times our 2016 of $0.49 per share, as given in our earnings framework in Table 1 above. Under those performance objectives, a medium-term (12-24 month) target price of $15 is reasonable. This $15 2015 price target equates to a multiple of 31 times projected 2015 earnings. From the current price of $9.37, those two price targets would produce investment returns of 28% in 12 months and an additional 25% in 24 months for a two-year compounded annual return of 26.5%.If Brightcove is to achieve our performance targets, it must handle the industry's competitive challenges successfully. Clearly, Brightcove faces tough competition. On the one hand, some big video users operate as do-it-yourselfers, processing and managing their video streams in-house. This reduces the potential size of the market. Convincing some of them to shift to the Brightcove platform would be a big plus. On the other hand, Brightcove must contend with a plethora of start-up companies all vying for that big brass ring.As Mr. Rayburn pointed out in his SA article, Brightcove's competitors include Ooyala, mDialog, Yospace, Jivox, Blackarrow, Vubiquity and more than a few others. These are not shabby outfits. Blackarrow's backers include Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cisco, Motorola Mobility and Intel. Vubiquity is backed by the Carlyle Group and four other venture capital firms. Many of them already claim to have the capability to do dynamic ad inserts, but it is unclear whether their services are as robust as Once and therefore ready for rollout.Unlike some, we are not as troubled by the big price tags paid for Zencoder and Unicorn. It is obvious that the ability to do custom ad inserts in high quality live streaming video (or audio) for the broad universe of devices is the Holy Grail. We understand (from Brightcove management's presentations) that this is not an easy thing to do, especially in live video, where commercial breaks often occur randomly and at varying lengths. Logically, we think that it will not be easy for more than a few competitors to develop the same full-featured capabilities. If we are right, the patents should be valuable. If not, the services offered by Brightcove and its competitors will quickly become commoditized. First movers should have a big advantage. Brightcove's purchases of Zencoder and Unicorn are intended to keep the company at the front of the pack.Because we are generalists with limited industry knowledge, it is difficult for us to assess accurately Brightcove's market position. We are not alone. But we have made a few observations that give us some confidence: First, Brightcove is one of the few pure-play publicly-traded companies in this business. Its IPO gave it a cash stockpile and strengthened its financial position, enhancing its competitive position. Brightcove also has an impressive list of clients, including broadcasters, newspaper and magazine publishers, music publishers, major retailers and other businesses. Its customer list is bigger than any of the other competitors that we have seen. It is significant, we think, that one of the industry's rag sheets, streamingmedia.com, uses Brightcove to manage its video content. This helps to confirm the quality and strong market position of Brightcove's Video Cloud. In 2012, ABI Research named Brightcove the leading online video platform, ahead of Akamai and Ooyala.Still, there are signs that Brightcove's competitive position has been slipping. It is worrisome that Brightcove was not able to develop in-house offerings comparable in quality to Zencoder and Once, despite spending over $67 million on research & development over the past four years. The failure of Brightcove App Cloud, which was released in May 2011 and discontinued less than two years later, raises more questions about the effectiveness of its internal strategic planning, marketing and r&d efforts. To its credit, the company was able to spot both the deficiencies in its own offerings and the opportunities in the Zencoder and Once products, use its cash surplus to fill in its product line and add talent in key positions from these acquired companies; but this has come at a significant cost to shareholders.The endgame for Brightcove and its competitors remains in question. Unless Brightcove is able to build a strong, defensible and profitable position in online video platforms, it will probably have to broaden its product and service offerings over time, if it is to remain independent. It is also possible that Brightcove will eventually be acquired. Potential acquirers might include Verizon, Comcast, Adobe, Yahoo, AOL, Microsoft and other companies who see the online video platform as a way to enhance their core product offerings, such as internet traffic, web services or advertising networks.The stock is now below its February 2012 IPO price of $11 per share. From a technical perspective, it looks like it may be forming a base, after the big January sell-off, around the current level of $9.37. The stock has been able to hold this level recently, despite a modest amount of insider selling. The decline from the recent peak of $16.25 is within Fibonacci retracement parameters for the rally off of the stock's all-time low of $4.89 set in April 2013. This could turn out to be a successful retest of that low. If the stock stabilizes near current levels and eventually reclaims its 50-day (10-week) and 200-day (40-week) moving averages, it should begin to gain some momentum.The charts do not provide a compelling case for a long position in BCOV at this time, but we think that it would still be prudent for investors who agree with our thesis to initiate a small position in BCOV and scale into a full position over time as opportunities arise or when its performance prospects become clearer.With its forward guidance, Brightcove has bought some time - six months or so - to get its house in order. It has set expectations for an eventual return to modest growth. Sustainable profitability should follow soon thereafter. Once it gets its house in order and assuming that the economy remains in recovery mode, this should turn out to be a reasonably good investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

You buy smaller companies in hopes they can be sold to these big companies at a profit.Big tech companies buy smaller ones in order to add their features and grow their own base. Yammer was such a small company, despite the $1.2 billion Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) paid for it, and investors who bought into Yammer probably understood that from the start.I suspect Brightcove (NASDAQ:BCOV) is similar, despite its having gone public early this year, and its latest moves smell like it's sprucing itself up to take that Yammer-like plunge.Brightcove built its business providing back end support to media companies and other video producers. Its technology for this is App Cloud (two words), which marries HTML5 web development with cloud content services. A version of this, App Cloud Core, has now been released as open source in hopes of bringing mobile content developers into its fold.The company itself is focusing on iOS, according to TheVerge, seeing Apple's AirPlay as the key that can separate cable bills into their component parts for people, turning networks into apps. The open source play extends its reach into the Android space.But when you start playing so deliberately among technology giants, playing with key technologies like HTML5, mass media and public cloud development, I think it's wrong for investors to look at you strictly from a profit standpoint.And investors don't.What would you pay for a company whose sales are running toward $80 million/year (but increasing at nearly 25% per year) that has yet to achieve profitability? Or a development company that actually had to take out debt last year to leverage that equity - the current debt load is about three times cash on hand. Their most recent quarter showed a loss of 17 cents per share, but revenue beat by $2 million, about 10%, so that's good.Well, the public market gives that a valuation of about $431 million, which comes out to about six times trailing revenues.I don't think that's excessive.Assuming you see this Cambridge, Massachusetts company as takeover bait, as an important technology supplier at the center of where the big fish are seeking their next meal.This is a company that could bring you a surprising return at some point in the next two years, and if you're of a speculative bent you might want to put it on your radar. Failure to generate a sale, however, will not lead to a winning investment. That's just the way the game goes. You don't get to be a big fish by serving the bigger ones.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Its customer base is largely at the high end and includes household names in media and entertainment, broadcasting, and large corporations.Brightcove was founded and is managed very much as a technology company, with an on-demand and usage based business model. In the last two years it has added some new products that target smaller customers and provide for some level of self-service. Its latest efforts to address more technical elements of the multimedia applications that include video are a good example of how Brightcove tends to focus on technology innovation.Historical revenue growth has been slower than we originally thought. Heavy spending on sales and marketing is needed to drive sales but has resulted in substantial operating losses. Our intrinsic value estimate of $13 is based on a long-term model of moderate growth with rapidly improving margins.Management hasn't provided a target financial model in their IPO roadshow, so it's impossible to know if this is how the story will play out. It may instead opt to maximize growth and maintain high levels of spending.We first published on Brightcove in March 2010, when it was still a private company. Since then the rise of the tablet has only accentuated the demand for rich content like video and enabled a broad range of new applications and services. Brightcove has continued to grow and now stands in an even better position than it did back in 2010. It turned out that the decision by Apple to stop supporting Adobe Flash was another positive impetus to its growth.Video is very much the top emerging content type on the internet. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) knew it way back in 2006, when it paid $1.6B for YouTube. Cisco realized this a few years ago and has made it a top priority and an M&A focus with their acquisition of Tandberg. The proliferation of video-capable devices on the network like smartphones and Internet-connected TV sets has been underway for over a year now. Video is much harder to manage than the text, image and programmatic content. There are myriad formats, and it's hard to operate on digital video assets when compared to something like formatted text. Adobe made this clear when it spent $1.8M to purchase Omniture to bring online analytics capabilities to their own popular Flash technology, which was the de facto standard for video and animated content before Apple decided to not support it on their platform.Although even casual users of video are already aware of the many incompatible formats and challenges in supporting wide variations in network bandwidth and device types, the real challenge is applying video to interactions, actions and commerce. Video content needs to be clickable, active and trackable the same way that other types of digital content are today.Brightcove is a leading player in this space today after $90M in cumulative funding, a large roster of top-tier customers, and the earlier acquisition and bungling of its top competitor at the time, Maven Networks, by Yahoo in 2008 for $160M. Brightcove has faced down some serious competitive issues over the last few years (described in greater detail below) and from our perspective its position as a top video platform provider is its to lose.This report follows our standard approach to company analysis, beginning with the market opportunity and continuing through company background, management, positioning, business model, competition, opportunities and threats and finally, valuation.Market OpportunityAlthough precise estimates for the current size and growth rate of the online video market may be hard to come by, the overall figures follow a path already worn by the shift from print to online media. A decade ago, the $140 billion/year print advertising business, including classified advertisements and the yellow pages, started moving content online in earnest. The same is happening today with video and this is becoming increasingly clear to the broadcast and cable TV industries.Third party forecasts have been all over the map the past few years, as they have grappled with the timing of the shift to more digital video-based advertising. Most agree on the size of the US TV advertising market being near $70B per year. The online market is still nascent and highly fragmented but Google crossed the $1B annual gross revenue level in 2011 and will reach $2B in 2013. Google market share in the US is between 40% and 60% of online video content viewed. Google is still over 10 times the size of the next largest online video content provider (Hulu). So the current market is about $2B per year in the US and may be approximately twice that figure on a global basis.Most of the market research firms we looked at estimated the size of the market in 2012 to be near $8B. This suggests 40% growth, which is consistent with the 50% level of growth we have seen from market data.As an online video platform, Brightcove is not directly concerned with the business model that the content owner plans to use, so the size of the online video advertising market is only an approximate way of looking at the market opportunity for Brightcove.Many Brightcove customers are more interested in using video as a tool for driving business directly or wanting to brand their video content. These are much different applications than putting advertisements in videos. In fact, the migration of content from analog and digital TV formats to Internet-based video will push adoption of online management platforms irrespective of how the content will be used.In this way the video platform management space should develop similarly to others like data management, document management and more general content management tools. One aspect that is different is that with video there is a larger run-time component.As a rule-of-thumb we allocate 10% of the market for technology services like those provided by a video platform provider. So using the figures above we'd put the market size today in the $400M range and expect it to grow for quite some time in the range of 40-50% per year. This means that sometime in 2012 the market will reach the $1B/year level and IP video will represent about 15% of video content.Brightcove has submitted its own analysis of the market opportunity as part of its roadshow and by its own calculation its is going after a $2.3B opportunity today that will grow to $5.8B by 2015. This seems a bit silly for a company posting $64M in revenues in the last year.In fact, most of the opportunity is in the lower sections of the market that are more likely to be served by competitors like Google. Even using its own figures the SMB and ""long tail"" market for video content represents over $1.8B or 65% of the existing market.The $500M current market figure seems fairly accurate given the current number of players and its annual revenues. For example Kit Digital is just over a $200M annual run rate (not all of the revenue is video, but it's the lead offering). Brightcove is at a $75M run rate. The balance can be seen in other startups and internal efforts - in some cases using open source technologies like Kaltura.Summary Company InformationBrightcove was founded in 2004 and has grown to around 312 employees across its offices in North America, Europe and Asia. Brightcove has raised approximately $90 million from both traditional venture-backed funds like Accel and General Catalyst and strategic partners like AOL, IAC/InterActiveCorp and Allen & Company LLC.Brightcove has followed a partnering approach and integrates its services with those of adjacent technology product and service providers. It has built partnerships with popular website content management systems like Drupal, publishing tool builders like Adobe, online analytics tool providers like Google AdSense, advertising serving networks and online branding and advertising agencies.From a product standpoint the company has been viewed as a quality provider throughout its history, but there were many complaints of too-high pricing. In late 2009 the company addressed these loud criticisms with a lower end ""Express"" offering that does indeed meet the needs of most smaller organizations with a much friendlier $99/month pricing level.So far the company has not been very acquisitive and has grown organically. It did make one acquisition back in 2006 of a company called MetaStories, which was a small 10-employee firm with some publishing technologies for combining video with other elements to create a full content experience. The acquisition was early in the evolution of online content, but was done on favorable terms, from what we can tell. It's unclear how acquisitive Brightcove might be as the market growth accelerates.Brightcove continues to explore newer markets. It has been pushing ""TV anywhere,"" something that the industry has been moving towards with smartphones and Internet-connected TV sets.History: There's some interesting history behind the founding of the company. Jeremy Allaire had built a major success from the ground up with his brother with Allaire Corporation, which developed a leading web-based development tool called ColdFusion and was acquired by Macromedia (now part of Adobe) back in 2001. Allaire joined venture capital firm General Catalyst and appears to have formed his ideas for starting Brightcove while working with and serving on the board of Maven Networks, another video-technology-focused start-up in the Boston area. Allaire left to form Brightcove in 2004.Brightcove received its first funding of around $5.5 million through Accel Partners and General Catalyst Partners. Subsequent rounds of funding have yielded a net of approximately $90 million, the last round of funding occurring in mid-2008. The company has used some of that capital to develop the product, but also to expand globally and build the sort of technology and company platform that important corporate players require when signing six-figure contracts.Brightcove certainly has had a major advantage due to the role some of its strategic investors played in adding to its marketing and sales reach.Product: Brightcove is known for its high-end solution which is targeted toward professional media organizations and enterprises. These companies spend millons on their production capabilities and have extremely demanding requirements. Customers of this caliber typically spend low to mid-six figures for an online video platform solution like Brightcove. The feature set of a high-end online video platform is fairly daunting and covers all aspects of the video lifecycle from uploading to encoding, adding player templates, handling different types of streaming, providing analytics, integrating with different advertising technologies and platforms, supporting delivery networks and special devices like the iPhone, allowing secure management, scheduling, and very granular control based on many factors - all this with 24/7 support.As we alluded to earlier, this positioning made Brightcove a very expensive vendor and precluded smaller companies and most startups from adopting its technology. The situation persisted for some time and we know that it cost Brightcove some customers (although perhaps not a great deal of revenue.) Late in 2009 the company introduced its ""Express"" line that is targeted to small companies with 50 to 500 videos and a few solo users with budgets in the $99 to $499/month range.Brightcove is a Software-as-a-Service company, and its pricing is usage-based. So it's possible that bandwidth usage could add materially to monthly costs, even when on the low-end plan. It will always be important to make sure that a video business model is consistent with costs that are incurred from popularity. Without a business model a video that ""goes viral"" can be costly without an embedded business model like ""click-to-buy"" in the video. For example, music companies can reap millions in high-profit back catalog sales if a song in a viral video (like ""Forever"" recently) can be purchased with a click from iTunes or Amazon.com.The screen shot below provides a rough visual idea of the three main elements of solution coverage: uploading and organizing video content, publishing the content, and finally tracking and measuring video effectiveness after deployment.The Brightcove product is positioned as the most functional and well-integrated solution and now is seen as a fairly cost effective and easy-to-adopt platform. There are some competitive solutions out there which are covered in the section on competitors below.Fig 1: Brightcove Studio Screenshot after signing into trial accountBusiness Model and Margins: Brightcove can be thought of as an enterprise scale SaaS provider for modeling purposes. We'd describe its model as a combination of Salesforce.com plus Akamai since it does get paid by the user-month and also based on usage. Because of its customer set and relatively high-end solution, Brightcove needs to have a fairly high-touch model that demands investments in sales, support and marketing both locally and with physical offices around the world.The Express offering, however, is likely to be a more efficient way to convert new customers due to low entry cost, simple signup procedure and the availability of a free trial. All of these aspects tend to lower the per-revenue-dollar costs of sales and marketing.Management and Culture: Brightcove was founded by and is still largely run by software technology types. In addition to Jeremy Allaire, the senior management backgrounds are mostly from companies like Macromedia, Art Technology Group, Lycos and Adobe, although there are also some from major media firms.A scan of current employment opportunities makes it clear that the company is moving aggressively to build deep technology that works across many platforms and has as a foundation very strongly architected and implemented technology. Brightcove is in the media technology space but it is at the extreme technology rather than the media end from a management and culture standpoint.Partners, Suppliers and Alliances: In line with its mission to be publisher of choice for online video content providers, Brightcove has continuously strengthened its offering through partnerships and alliances. As a company that helps video content providers publish, manage, brand, monetize and measure content effectiveness, Brightcove has put in place partnerships with both established players as well as startups with newer technologies. It has built partnerships with popular website content management systems like Drupal, publishing tool builders like Adobe, online analytics tool providers like Google AdSense and Omniture, advertising serving networks and online branding and advertising agencies such as Ogilvy Interactive. Brightcove also supports almost any platform that can be used to deliver video, including devices like the iPhone and social networking services like Facebook. Brightcove continues to invest in strengthening its partnerships both on the technology and solution side of its business. It encourages developers and solution providers to exploit its platform and invests energy and resources in helping them be successful.Source: Forrester Research, Inc.Competition: Being in the broad-based online video content publishing business, Brightcove has competition from two fronts. The first is video hosting sites that provide everything in exchange for controlling the advertising revenue and paying out a portion of that. Google's (GOOG) YouTube is a perfect example of this model but there are many others including sites like Vimeo and Dailymotion. These sites are becoming more serious while still catering to casual user-created content. Several YouTube users are making $1M per year in advertising revenue and the company is going after more professional and high production content.More direct competition exists in the form of other online video platform providers like Ooyala which has a positioning and a strategy very similar to that of Brightcove's. There are a half dozen credible technology players in this space including Kit Digital (NASDAQ: OTC:KITD - $12.56), Kaltura, VMIX, Fliqz, and Twistage just to pick out some names from the industry view by Forrester Research.Currently, the pricing of Ooyala starts at $500/month, which is a higher bar to start with than Brightcove Express. Some vendors like Kaltura play the open source card and offer self-hosted solutions.Since we wrote the original report (and Forrester published the diagram above) Kit Digital has been by far the most aggressive competitor. Kit has grown heavily via acquisition to become the largest player in the segment and is staffed by a charismatic and aggressive management that is still somewhat unproven in the eyes of most institutional investors.From a revenue growth and margin perspective we believe that Brightcove is in the best position, but one or more of these competitors could be problematic if it decides to introduce powerful features and slash prices.Opportunities and Threats+ Online advertising will continue to expand and video, along with mobile, is the next major area of interest and growth. Video content owners are eagerly looking for ways to transition their content to generate online revenues as non-IP video viewing declines and jeopardizes $70B in advertising revenues alone.+ Businesses are beginning to see video as an important element of their online content strategy and all require online platforms to achieve their objectives.+ As business models and device types for video multiply, it puts complex demands on distribution which only a high end service like Brightcove can effectively deliver against.+ As a market leader with substantial momentum and a strong balance sheet Brightcove is in a position to make acquisitions that can consolidate related technologies and services to add to its growth.- Dominating Internet properties like Google (YouTube) have the reach and financial power to quickly disrupt lucrative markets in their favor.- Text-based advertising is still perceived at the most effective means of advertising with new avenues being opened up by social media and location based services.- Although Brightcove is a leader, many of its competitors have very solid offerings and could emerge with capabilities, pricing and/or partners that could alter Brightcove's revenue growth and/or margins.- Even though Brightcove has introduced the Express line, it still has a ""high cost"" image that precludes some potential customers from looking at them again.ValuationWhen we came up with a valuation in March of 2010 we had to base it on financials that were not known. At the time we estimated that the intrinsic valuation (IV) for Brightcove was $644M. That's 2x the proposed valuation of $300M based on the mid-point of the filing range.What's different? Here are the new factors in our updated IV estimate:The company is still spending ½ of every revenue dollar on sales and marketing. In order to make the investment attractive at all we've had to make some fairly bold assumptions about reductions in operating expenses over the next four years that the company may or may not be able to deliver.Our model supporting our IV of $13 is attached but it should be noted that this IV comes with a large degree of risk since most of the value accrues in 2016. This leaves the stock vulnerable to any ""risk off"" periods in the market which could easily put them into single digits even if it is achieving this plan.ConclusionBrightcove is well-placed to service the high-end professional and enterprise segment of the online video market rather than the small independent and amateur content producers. Its success in this market in the past 2-3 years has been noteworthy and its new Express product line is improving customer acquisition.The launch of the Flash-less Apple iPad, the ""tablet revolution,"" increasing penetration of video-capable phones, and the emergence of Internet TV makes the future bright for Brightcove. Investors will have to think long-term though since in the medium term the growth will be coming with high cost and continued operating losses.We believe that investors should regard our $13 IV seriously and avoid the stock at the high end of the proposed $10 - $12 range or above. If the deal comes quietly at $10 it's more worthy of consideration.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
350701,20875,2012-02-08T13:08:40-05:00,,"Yesterday, Brightcove (NASDAQ:BCOV) filed an amended S-1  as the company prepares to have their IPO in the coming months. The  company is looking to raise between $50-$60M from their offering and  estimates shares will be priced between $10-$12. After IPO expenses and  spending approximately $7M to repay an outstanding loan, the company  looks to net about $40M in working capital. Depending on the share  price, Brightcove would have a market cap of between $275-$300M, which  is about 5x 2011 revenue.While I saw lots of folks repeating the highlights from the filing in  their blog posts and simply cutting and pasting the numbers, I didn't  see anyone asking the questions that have yet to be answered regarding  Brigthcove's revenue or the size of the market they are in. It's also  clear that many folks only read the first few pages to the filing and  not the whole document as their are lots of data points that gives one a  lot to think about, and question. It's just another example of many  showing that too many blogs only care about publishing as many 500 word posts as possible  in one day, rather than actually telling a story, engaging a reader, or  trying to explain the impact a company could have on the broader  market.Brightcove had revenue of just over $63M in 2011 which makes them the  largest provider for online video platforms, sold direct to content  owners. Other video platform vendors selling direct to MSOs like Cisco,  thePlatform and Kit digital have more revenue than Brightcove, but  aren't selling into the same vertical with the same solution. Many  people want to compare a Brightcove to thePlatform or Kit digital, but  they are selling very different solutions and should not be compared to  one another.There are three kinds of online video platform (OVP) providers in the  market. Those that sell direct to content owners, those that offer  carrier grade solutions to MSOs and vendors that offer video management  platforms for enterprise customers who deploy video inside their  firewall. Brightcove has been going after the enterprise market as of  late, but most of their customers are still content owners and  publishers in the media space and I have yet to see Brightcove enter the  carrier and MSO vertical as of yet.But the real question is what's the breakdown of Brightcove's revenue  and how much of it comes directly from their SaaS business? Through  Brightcove's CDN partners like Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) and Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM), almost 9  billion streams went through Brightcove's platform last year. That's a  lot of bits and since the delivery of those videos are handled by a  third party, Brightcove pays the CDNs for those delivery services and  marks up the bandwidth to their customers. So one has to wonder what  percentage of Brightcove's total revenue comes from the re-sale of  bandwidth? Brightcove doesn't break that number out in their filing and  the company told me their could not comment on those details when asked.While there is nothing wrong with some of Brigthcove's revenue coming  from bandwidth, considering that the average cost per GB delivered  drops at least 20-25% each year, there is only so much of a markup  Brightcove can add on top of what they pay the CDNs. Some have told me  that it really does not matter as the percentage of Brightcove's revenue  that comes from the re-sale of bandwidth continues to decline each  year, but that's a bad answer. Just because it is declining doesn't mean  the number isn't material. I don't know what percentage of their  revenue is from bandwidth and I won't put a number out there as it would  be a complete guess on my part. But if the number was low, think single  digits, then my guess is that Brightcove would be all too happy to say  what it is.While Brightcove admits they will lose money in 2012 and even  possibly beyond, that's not what worries me. Brightcove is trying to  follow the Amazon mentality of ""get big fast' and that's why the company  has raised and spent so much money over the past few years. My biggest  concern is how quickly the market Brightcove is in will grow and what  the total market opportunity really is. While Brightcove gave out some  of those numbers in their original filing, they are so big that they are  hard to believe. Brightcove says that by their estimate their ""total potential market opportunity was approximately $2.3 billion in 2011, growing to approximately $5.8 billion in 2015"".Those numbers are far too big. If Brightcove's entire market  opportunity was $2.3B in 2011 and the company did $63M in revenue, that  means Brightcove only captured 2.7% of the market. That's not a lot.  Brightcove has some really interesting methodology on how they came up  with the total market size though, which you can read in detail on page  69 of the S-1 filing.  My other concern with any business like Brigthcove's is that R&D  costs are high. In 2011, 25% of Brightcove's revenue went towards  R&D, which is a lot. Also, while all of Brightcove's revenue comes  from one product and the company is working towards diversifying their  revenue, app cloud is an example, they have yet to do that to any large  degree.All of this aside, Brightcove does have a some positive things going  for them which gives them a legitimate shot at building a long-term  profitable business. For starters, Brightcove invented the market they  are in and to date, even with increased competition, has yet to fall  behind any of their competitors, They have lead the market for more than  five years and while being a first mover is not always a guarantee of  long-term success, so far, Brightcove has shown that they can continue  to be the leader.Brightcove had a total of 3,872 customers at the end of  last year of  which 2,571 of those customers were using the Brightcove  Express  product which costs between $99 and $499 a month. If those  customers  are all paying $250 a month on average, that means that about one third   of Brightcove's customers make up about 91% of their revenue, which is  very good. At the same time, no one customer makes up more than 4% of  Brigthcove's total revenue which is a nice balance. Another thing I like  is that in each of the last eight fiscal quarters, Brigthcove's  recurring dollar retention rate was at least 86%, and for all of 2011,  was higher at 93%, which is quite impressive.And finally, in order for any company to do well they have to have a  good management team that has experience in building and cultivating  their business, especially when it is still in the early stages of real  growth. Brightcove isn't even a $100M company yet so for them to really  get to the next level with their business, management needs to be laser  focused and take the necessary steps to make sure the growth happens. If  there is one thing I think Brightcove is very strong with, it's the  management team they have in place.Brightcove's CEO Jeremy Allaire is smart, he's easy to speak to and  reachable (even if you are not a member of the media) and he doesn't  have the arrogance a lot of CEOs tend to have, which can sometimes hurt  the growth of their company. You don't see Brightcove getting into  public spats with their competitors and the management team that Jeremy  has built at the company has a lot of experience in building and scaling  software companies in the past. That alone does not guarantee that  Brightcove will be successful, but it  sure helps gives them the  opportunity to make it possible and they are going to be closely watched  by a lot of other companies in the space who want to follow in their  footsteps.Disclosure: No position"
344081,22762,2012-02-06T13:38:04-05:00,,"By Anthony HaOnline video service Brightcove (NASDAQ:BCOV) will price its IPO between $10 and $12 per share, according to a new filing with the SEC.The company first filed for the IPO back in August of last year, saying it wanted to raise up to $50 million. Now, $50 million is at the lower end of its price range. If Brightcove sells the maximum number of shares (it’s set to sell 5 million shares, plus an extra 750,000 if demand is high) at $12, it could raise up to $69 million.The filing also updates Brightcove’s key metrics through the end of 2011. The company, which sells online video publishing and distribution services, says it had 3,872 customers as of Dec 31. Its revenue grew last year to $63.6 million (from $43.7 million in 2010), but it still showed a loss of $17.8 million. Thanks to plans to “continue to invest in the growth of our business and operations,” Brightcove says it expects to see losses until the end of this year at least.Brightcove also revealed ambitions beyond video when it announced its App Cloud last year, with its first commercial sale in September and general availability in November, according to the filing.Original post"
441231,22762,2012-03-18T22:51:25-04:00,,"By Kim-Mai CutlerBrightcove (NASDAQ:BCOV) may not have had the sexiest IPO in the recent wave of offerings, but the company’s return so far definitely beats Zynga and Groupon’s performances since their debuts. After launching its video platform six years ago, Brightcove went public just a few weeks ago on the NASDAQ by raising $55 million. The  company’s shares have climbed 80 percent since the offering to $19.86,  giving the company a market capitalization of $523.8 million.We caught up with chief executive Jeremy Allaire, who is now  positioning Brightcove as more than a video services provider. While the  company has been known for powering video players for premium brands  like The New York Times, Conde Nast and Macy’s, Brightcove is trying to  find a broader base of customers with a new suite of app development  services.Called App Cloud,  it’s a set of tools that helps brands and media companies build apps,  track engagement and layer in advertising. It means that Brightcove is  now competing with a ton of app service providers like Urban Airship, which handles in-app notifications, analytics providers Flurry and Apsalar, or tools provider Appcelerator.It is a cut-throat market, but what Brightcove does have are existing  relationships with premium brands and lots of experience in the  software-as-a-service model. Allaire said that thousands of companies  are in the developer trial for App Cloud, including organizations like  the U.S. State Department and cable channel Lifetime.“We saw that this problem of content apps on devices was going to be a  major problem so we built a second leg of our business on that,” he  said. ”Now we’re seeing customers like broadcasters, government agencies  and financial services companies.” There’s a free version for a single  user. Then there’s a paid enterprise version that starts at around  $15,000.Brightcove will need those extra clients to move outside of its core  base of media companies, all of whom are grappling with the new economic  realities of the web. The company hasn’t turned an annual profit since  its inception in 2004, as it spent on marketing and research and  development to grow customers. The company lost $17.3 million on $63.6 million in revenue last year.“In the last couple of years, we’ve been investing for growth and  we’re a recurring revenue business,” Allaire said, pointing out that  revenue grew 46 percent year-over-year in 2011. (The company’s net loss  also narrowed slightly in the same time period.)Virtually all of Brightcove’s revenue comes from the video product.  Allaire said the decline of Flash and the rise of HTML5 have  paradoxically helped the company. (Fun point to note: Allaire helped  create the Macromedia MX (Flash) platform while he was chief technology  officer at Macromedia.) The problem is that with many different browser  standards, it’s hard to make sure there’s good video playback across  different devices.“People thought HTML5 was going to be a panacea. But the reality is  that HTML5 creates a whole new level of complexity for publishers that  want to work across many platforms,” he said. “It’s been one of the  greatest sources of new business for us.”Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is also dealing with this issue, and recently released a browser test suite called Ringmark a few weeks ago to help mobile web developers check if their HTML5-based apps work on many different mobile browsers.Now with the extra capital, Brightcove plans to grow the side of its  business targeting app makers and is eyeing acquisitions. ”One of the  benefits of being a public company is access to capital, and we’ve  raised about $60 million so it certainly should be easier to do  M&A.” Allaire didn’t want to say what kinds of companies he’s  targeting though.He said that filing amid a wave very high-profile IPOs wasn’t too challenging for a company of his size.“Instead of retail investors that were interested in Groupon or Yelp,  we targeted mutual funds and firms that were interested in small cap  software companies. We were looking for a high-quality investor base.  It’s been a good process and overall, we’re happy with it.”Brightcove had raised funding from Accel Partners, General Catalyst  Partners, Allen & Company, AOL, The New York Times, Maverick  Capital, IAC and Hearst Ventures. Accel and General Catalyst each owned  26.4 percent of the company before the IPO.Original Post"
371411,24145,2012-02-16T10:21:56-05:00,,"Based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Brightcove (proposed BCOV) scheduled a $55 million IPO with a market capitalization of $290 million at a price range mid-point of $11 for Friday, February 17, 2012.BCOV is one three IPOs scheduled for this week (see our IPO calendar).SUMMARY BCOV provides an on-demand online video platform called Video Cloud for businesses. BCOV maintains it is the market pioneer and leader as of now.Sales for the year ended December 2011 vs 2010 were up 45% to $64 million from $45 million, and losses held even at $18 million.We're wondering how BCOV can be the ""market leader"" with only $64 million in revenue for the 2011 year. Either its market definition is tightly defined too small or it is assuming the market is entirely fragmented or something appears to be wrong with its business model, based on its loss rate.OBSERVATION In the 'competition' section BCOV conveniently 'forgot' to mention potential competitors by name, perhaps because their names might be Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), see 'competition' below. Other competitors in the same very approximate space might include Akami (NASDAQ:AKAM), Limelight (NASDAQ:LLNW), Kit digital (OTC:KITD) and Rackspace Hosting (NYSE:RAX).While BCOV may have been the 'pioneer' in the field, it looks like it is about to encounter big player competition, especially if the overall market is as big as BCOV suggests. We are not optimistic about BCOV's chances of getting to profit breakeven very soon.CONCLUSIONIn order to feel comfortable with BCOV we need to see better progress toward income statement break even, at least. BCOV, however, may get an initial 'pop' because it is 'cloud' oriented. 'Cloud' IPOs seem to be attracting investor interest like social networking stocks did in 2011.BUSINESS BCOV generates subscription and support revenue from the sale of an on-demand online video platform called Video Cloud. Video Cloud allows customers to publish and distribute video and other professional digital media across Internet-connected devices.POSITION IN THE MARKET BCOV believes it is the recognized online video platform market leader. In 2011, BCOV's customers used Video Cloud to deliver an average of approximately 743 million video streams per month, which BCOV believes is more video streams per month than any other professional solution.In December 2011, BCOV's customers used Video Cloud to reach over 177 million unique viewers on over 94,000 websites.BCOV maintains it pioneered the commercialization of online video platforms beginning with its first customer deployment in 2006, and has consistently released new features and functionality.TWO PRODUCT LINES Enterprise & Pro The first product line comprises premium product editions: Enterprise and Pro. The Enterprise edition provides additional features and functionality such as a multi-account environment with consolidated billing, IP address filtering, the ability to produce live events with DVR functionality and advanced upload acceleration of content.Customer arrangements are typically one-year contracts, which include a subscription to BCOV's platform, basic support and a pre-determined amount of bandwidth. BCOV also offers gold support to its premium customers for an additional fee, which includes extended phone support. The pricing for the premium editions is based on the number of users, accounts and usage, which includes video streams, bandwidth and managed content.Small l& Medium-Sized BusinessesThe second product line is the Express edition, which targets small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs. The Express edition provides customers with the same basic functionality that is offered in BCOV's premium product editions but has been designed for customers who have lower usage requirements and do not typically seek advanced features and functionality. Customers who purchase the Express edition generally enter into month-to-month agreements.Express customers are generally billed on a monthly basis and pay via a credit card, or they are billed annually in advance.NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS During 2010, the number of customers increased 185%, and during 2011, the number of customers increased 57%. Most of the increase was a result of 2010 being the first full year in which BCOV offered the Express edition of Video Cloud, which was introduced in November of 2009. During these periods, BCOV experienced an increase in revenue from Video Cloud, which made up substantially all revenue through December 31, 2011.As of December 31, 2011, BCOV had 3,872 customers, of which 2,571 used the Express edition of Video Cloud and 1,301 used premium editions of Video Cloud.In the year ended December 31, 2011, the average number of monthly streams was approximately 743 million, which represents 56% growth over the year ended December 31, 2010, reflecting increased viewership of BCOV's customers' video content.RECURRING REVENUE In the year ended December 31, 2010, the recurring dollar retention rate was 88% compared with 93% for the year ended December 31, 2011. This recurring dollar retention rate provides visibility into BCOV's ongoing revenue. BCOV did not calculate recurring dollar retention rate prior to December 31, 2009, in part because there were no renewals of Express customers prior to that date.BACKLOG BCOV's backlog consists of the total future value of committed customer contracts, whether billed or unbilled.As of December 31, 2011, BCOV had a backlog of approximately $43 million compared with a backlog of approximately $28 million as of December 31, 2010.Of the $43 million in backlog as of December 31, 2011, $37 to $39 million is expected to be recognized as revenue during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY In April 2011, BCOV was issued a U.S. patent covering aspects of publishing and distributing digital media online. Our latest innovation is the development and introduction of App Cloud.COMPETITION Unlike most IPOs, BCOV doesn't name its competitors, which we take as negative because they know who there competitors are.This is all BCOV says about its competitors, ""We will likely encounter significant, growing competition in our business from many sources, including portals and digital media retailers, search engines, social networking and consumer-sharing services companies, broadband media distribution platforms, technology suppliers, direct broadcast satellite television service companies and digital and traditional cable systems.""Perhaps the reason BCOV 'forgot' to mention their competitors is because it's highly likely competitors will include Google and Apple .Other companies in the same general space, broadly defined, include Akami , Limelight , Kit digital and Rackspace HostingVENTURE CAPITAL FUNDED Post-IPO this offering the two largest stockholders, Accel Partners and General Catalyst Partners will beneficially own 42.7% of BCOV's outstanding common stock.USE OF PROCEEDS BCOV expects to net $48 million, allocated as follows: $7 million to repay debt, balance for working capital.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

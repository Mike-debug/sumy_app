        The company has failed at selling expensive enterprise apps to big clients.
        It acquired two products, further complicating its product line and creating two customer tiers.
        Accord is holding onto its small stake, waiting for the company to decide which way to go.","This tiny company has been trying to sell big-ticket enterprise software to big clients. It has failed. Sales declined steadily from $23.7 million in 2014 to $10 million in 2019. Through Q319, the company was spending $4.0 million in operational expenses quarterly to win approximately $2.7 million in sales. The stock is down 98% from only two years ago. In the spring of 2019 it acquired two more products, which confused the product line even more and required the company to split its resources over three engineering platforms and two client segments. The germ of a resurrection is there, but it's unclear if the company can focus quickly enough to survive.Bridgeline Digital is an enterprise software company that sells marketing and sales applications for websites, intranets, and online stores. It includes marketing automation, content management, e-commerce, social media management, inter-site search, lead generation, and web analytics. Generically, this is referred to as “martech” (marketing technology). Bridgeline offers it as SaaS (software as a service) and self-hosted applications. The company’s internally-built “Unbound” products – marketing automation, content management, ecommerce, and insights – have been evolving since 2008, and are oriented to large clients doing $200 million to over $2 billion in revenues. In early 2019, the company acquired two new products, adding another content management system (OrchestraCMS) on the Salesforce.com platform and is oriented to large companies, and an in-site search product (Celebros) that runs on a third platform and is oriented to smaller clients. All this from a company with annual revenues of $10 million. See Timeline, Other Documents, People, and Cap Table.Martech is a large and still-growing market. Digital Commerce 360 concluded in a study on ecommerce, here, that “consumers spent $517.36 billion online with U.S. merchants in 2018, up 15.0% from $449.88 billion spent the year prior, according to a new Internet Retailer analysis of industry data and historical U.S. Commerce Department figures.” Someone has to sell the gold miners the shovels (the 50.9% that aren’t Amazon, anyway). The consulting firm Moore Stephens said in a study:“Last year [in 2017] … the combined market size of martech in North America and UK using adspend as a proxy for total marketing budget … was $34.3 billion. This year, the same methodology produces a market sizing of $52 billion …. the results point to a conceivable global market size for martech of $99.9 billion.Our takeaway: We think this estimate is high, but the worldwide market is still plenty big enough and the growth is real. The problem is that martech is not one market but a basket of sub-markets. Some target clients want some products, but rarely want all of them. Pitch the whole collection at once and the message becomes confusing. Pitch each feature individually and your marketing budget gets spread very thin. All enterprise software markets have this problem, which is why small companies are at a disadvantage: they can’t cover all the bases. See Competitors.Opportunities (External)The overall worldwide market is indeed big and growing. And will, so long as people continue to buy things online.There are a lot of small martech companies wanting to be acquired. This is good, if you are a public company and you want to grow by acquisition, as Bridgeline explicitly does. Ari Kahn, the CEO, said in the 12/31/18 earnings call that “there are over 5000 martech companies, many of which are too small to operate efficiently, but have excellent customer bases and technologies.”Threats (External)It is hard for a small company to compete in multiple submarkets all at once. A small company doesn’t have the engineering or support resources to keep up with evolving feature sets or the marketing dollars to compete in each submarket. There is a reason there are over 5,000 small martech companies wanting to be acquired.It is hard for a company to compete for big clients and small clients at the same time. Small clients don’t need what larger clients need and can afford. The sales channels are different. The pricing models are different. The support systems are different.Strengths (Internal)The Celebros acquisition has tapped into smaller clients. Bridgeline bought Celebros in early 2019 for roughly $1 million in cash and stock. Celebros is oriented to small clients with revenues under $200 million. It is a license product with a relatively short sales cycle (two months vs the Unbound platform’s four to six months, with another six months for implementation), which dramatically reduces customer acquisition costs. According to Mr. Khan in his 12/31/2019 earnings call, the client renewal rate is “over 95%.” That’s a strong pulse. In that same call he said, “…strategically, we want Celebros to be our primary new logo leader…” We think what he means is that his small company will be selling martech to small clients.The CEO has experience building through acquisitions. Mr. Kahn helped build FatWire through acquisitions. We also get the sense that he has an open mind and some good ideas of where to take the company, but needs more help than he’s getting.Weaknesses (Internal)The company is still pushing its losing products line. Bridgeline’s Unbound platform is a $400k recurring sale to large companies, but as mentioned it has a very long sales cycle, a long implementation cycle, and they are losing clients. One reason they are losing clients is because the clients don’t like the product. The software review site www.G2.com, which records and analyzes responses from actual users of products, gives the company’s Unbound platform – in their “Web Content Management and Website Builder” category – a satisfaction rating of only 3 in overall content, design, and platform. A primary competitor, HubSpot, has a satisfaction score of 99. Only 44% of Bridgeline users were likely to recommend, compared to the category average which was 80%. Bridgeline’s Net Promoter Score (NPS) is -73. This is really bad.The company’s product line is too broad for its size. Using the terms employed by the software review site www.G2.com, Bridgeline’s products map to one or more of these submarkets: Marketing Automation, Web Content Management, eCommerce, Content Management System, LeadGen, Social Media Management, and Web Analytics. A $10 million company cannot possibly keep up with engineering for eight products on three different technology platforms.The company’s acquisitions split their customer focus. The Unbound platform is for larger companies with more than $200 million in revenues. The newly acquired OrchestraCMS, bought for $5.2 million in cash in early 2019, is also aimed at larger customers (their showcase client for OrchestraCMS is $19 billion AstraZeneca). But according to Mr. Kahn in his 12/31/2018 earnings call, the Celebros product is aimed at a much smaller customer, $200 million and under. Clearly, Bridgeline was not thinking about client tiers when it made its two acquisitions. The company now has to sell in two different ways to two separate target clients.The company’s acquisitions will not lead to cross-selling. Mr. Kahn says (in his 12/31/2018 call) there is little overlap between their client bases for their three products (Unbound, OrchestraCMS, and Celebros), and says this means there is a big cross-selling opportunity here. There isn’t. OrchestraCMS sells to clients that already have Salesforce and are unlikely to need Unbound. Unbound clients don’t need OrchestraCMS, unless they drop Unbound and go with Salesforce. Celebros clients are too small for either Unbound or OrchestraCMS. Bridgeline will pick up sales from OrchestraCMS, but there is no synergy between products, just more complexity and overhead.The company is low on cash. As of the end of 2019, the company has $406,000 in cash, $1,086,000 in accounts receivable, and $1,963,000 in accounts payable. Mr. Kahn said, in his 12/31/2019 call, that he did not expect the company would have to do another equity raise, diluting shareholders. He also predicted that the company will reach breakeven by the end of 2020. We think this is optimistic.Bridgeline is in a tough spot. It has been competing in the wrong end of their market for years, trying to wear big-company pants and falling flat. Its stock was in the $67 to $108 range in mid-2018, crashed in November 2018, and has slid to the price it is today. It’s now having success with its small company offering (Celebros), but if it switches its focus away from the big clients its legacy revenues will melt away all the more quickly, forcing massive dilution – or worse – on existing shareholders.We think there is a way forward, but don’t see a clear plan from the company, yet.Until we do, we’re going to hold onto our token investment in the company, and wait a bit longer before buying more or selling it off.The germ of resurrection is the company’s success with smaller clients. We recommend the company make the switch to products for smaller clients and make that switch as quickly as possible. This means:We will continue to give management our input as a shareholder. We’ll share that input here. Stay tuned.If you support this course of action – or don’t – please let us know and tell us why.________________________All information in this company profile is from Accord Partners’ research using public sources, including SEC filings, the company’s investor relations department, industry analysts, conversations with company competitors, and public online posts by customers and employees.

The stock experienced a sharp decline in price in December after it reported an increase in profits and positive cash flow generation. Bridgeline Digital also announced it had won a major, multi-year multi-million dollar contract with a large franchise. Given that the stock had doubled in the month prior to the announcement, some profit taking was to be expected. However, the extent of the drop, and the fact that Bridgeline posted both profits AND positive cash flow generation, leads one to believe the drop was more related to the year end selling that was prevalent in many small cap stocks in December.A look at the Bridgeline Digital chart shows a stock ready for a nice rebound in January. After the selloff in December the stock found very strong support at its 200-day moving average at $1.43. A positive MACD cross yesterday is indicating the stock is ready to begin its bounce higher. A break if the 20-day EMA at $1.56 should set the stage for a recovery back to the $2 area. A 38% Fibonacci retracement of the December drop gives a first target of $1.82.As for the fundamentals of Bridgeline we need only look to their recent earnings report from December. As mentioned previously the company is profitable posting Non-GAAP adjusted net income of $268 thousand compared to $250 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2011. Cash generated from operations was $1.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $314 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2011. It is actually pretty rare to find small cap stocks trading under $2 that are both profitable AND generating positive cash flow. The cash flow generation is a sign of a healthy business. The renewed focus on their iAPPS business is paying dividends with iAPPS revenue up 37%, licenses sold up 25% and recurring revenues increasing 27%.The market has ignored the news that Bridgeline Digital signed a major contract in December. This multi-year multi million dollar contract will start to impact an already good earnings report in the upcoming quarter. Companies in the Bridgeline Digital sector trade at an average of 2-times sales making Bridgeline appear very undervalued. A move to $3 would give the company a valuation within the range of its peers making for some very nice upside for investors in 2013. They are profitable, generating cash and recently signed a large deal. There is much to like here.Disclosure: I am long BLIN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

2627165,48781,2014-11-03T14:30:00-05:00,"The 55% drop from the high in January implies that the recently muted revenue growth as a result of the ongoing business model transition will continue indefinitely.However, the inflection point has already been reached as “legacy” non-iAPPS revenue will soon be immaterial while iAPPS and subscriptions/licenses now account for 85% of revenue.The enterprise business could increase >2.5x to $50 million within the next several years; target on track as new bookings more than doubled in the mrq.A higher multiple is deserved due to the growing high margin, recurring revenue stream; since 4Q12 recurring revenue almost doubled to 29% of revenue and increased 50% in the mrq.The stock trades at a significant discount to its peers as well as two recent M&A deal comps.","Company overviewBridgeline Digital (NASDAQ:BLIN) helps customers maximize the performance of their mission critical websites, intranets and online stores with the iAPPS platform (and related services), a SaaS solution that unifies web content management, analytics, eCommerce, eMarketing and social media engagement. The primary vertical markets served are franchise/dealer networks, financial services, retail brands, health services and life sciences, technology and associations and foundations.The sharp stock decline implies that the challenges associated with the ongoing business model transition are permanentBLIN is down 55% from the high in January as the rapid decline of the ""legacy"" non-iAPPS business (revenue is down 73% to $0.5 million since 4Q12) is offsetting the otherwise impressive growth of the core iAPPS business, resulting in the temporary top line pressure shown in the chart below.While the FY14 revenue guidance of ~$24 million is roughly unchanged from the FY13 level, FY15 should be a breakout year as the almost $26 million backlog (a record) is expected to drive significant growth in recurring revenue. One of the largest shareholders and board member Michael Taglich (who along with his brother owns ~11.5%) clearly believes in the growth story as he purchased 300,000 shares in the open market since May 2014.Also overhanging the stock are two near and intermediate term risks. The first is the potential delisting from NASDAQ due to non-compliance with the listing requirement of a minimum $1 stock price. Although the deadline is 11/24/14, BLIN may receive an additional 180 day grace period, during which time the problem could be addressed through a reverse split.The second (and more of an ongoing concern) is the dilution from multiple equity issuances over the past year and a half (March 2014, November 2013 and June 2013) used to fund operations. While the burn rate is expected to continue in the short term, the growing recurring revenue stream can fund a larger portion of working capital requirements. For example, the majority of the >3,500 customers pay a monthly subscription fee (which often increases as additional recurring services are purchased) while the retention rate remains high at 84%.Turning back to the primary concern, the investor impatience with the business model transition is unwarranted as inevitable growing pains are to be expected (a point I have made in previous research focused on similar special situations). However, the inflection point projected by management almost a year ago is already here as evident by the recent quarterly results.In 3Q14, overall revenue increased 10% to $6.2 million as a 10% increase in the much larger iAPPS business more than offset a 44% decrease in the non-iAPPS business. As the contribution from the latter has almost become immaterial (the quarterly run rate is ~$500,000), investors should have an easier time assessing the ""clean"" earnings power going forward. Specifically, recurring revenue (SaaS licenses, annual maintenance and hosting) as a percentage of revenue almost doubled since 4Q12 (from 16% to 29%) and increased 50% in 3Q14. As shown in the chart below, iAPPS and subscriptions/licenses currently account for 85% of revenue compared to 63% in 4Q12. This continued growth should drive meaningful gross margin expansion (from the low 50s currently to the mid 50s), especially given the 70%+ licensing gross margins.This revenue growth, along with stable gross margins at 51% and a 5.5% decrease in OpEx, resulted in EBITDA improving from $(899,000) to $(336,000). Sales/marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue were ~200 bps below the average of 34% over the last eight quarters while G&A expenses were stable at the average of 18%. This has enabled R&D spending to triple to 10% of revenue since 4Q12 (and fund the development of the iAPPS platform) while keeping overall OpEx stable.The operating leverage from the highly scalable business model should result in positive EBITDA over the next 12-18 months as growth continues to ramp up while the first $8 million of net income (admittedly several years away) will be shielded by federal NOLs. This growth should be driven by a jump in new bookings, which more than doubled to $9.3 million in 3Q14 from $4.5 million. Management said on the 3Q14 conference call that the number of iAPPS licenses should more than quadruple by the end of calendar year 2014 to 10,000 from 2,300 just 6 months ago while the enterprise business could increase from ~$19 million currently to $50 million in the coming years. The plan to capture 40,000 licenses over the next several years is not even a reach considering the size of the total addressable market (~1.5 million locations in North America).The background of the founder and CEO Thomas Massie makes him uniquely qualified to lead the company during this growth phase. From 1991 to 2000, he founded and grew Focus Enhancements (a developer of proprietary video conversion chip technology) to a $230 million market cap. In the five years prior to that, he founded and grew Mass Microsystems (a developer of proprietary multimedia products) to a $75 million market cap. Assuming this successful track record continues (a reasonable assumption given the expected growth rate), BLIN falls in the sweet spot of the ""hockey stick"" growth chart (not so far to the left that growth is years away yet the market cap has not increased 5-10x and eliminated the opportunity).RisksRisks in addition to those discussed above include a decrease in the renewal rate, a long sales cycle (a sale in the core franchise/dealer vertical takes on average 365 days to complete) and intense competition (including from customers developing applications internally). Moreover, the steady M&A cadence that helped build the iAPPS platform may continue and result in additional dilution or goodwill impairments (goodwill from the acquisition of ElementsLocal in August 2013 was reduced by $626,000 in the YTD period).Valuation and price targetAs shown in the chart below, BLIN trades at a significant discount to its peer group.Two recent acquisitions at much higher multiples provide additional evidence that BLIN is extremely undervalued. Earlier this month, Progress Software paid 4.4x revenue for privately-held Telerik while Siris Capital Group paid 2.2x revenue for Digital River.The following workup highlights the valuation disconnect. Applying a 1.5x revenue multiple to the FY14E of $24 million produces a price target of ~$1.40. This is conservative for two reasons. First, this is a ~0.7x discount to the multiple Digital River received. Second, this ignores the revenue ramp-up expected in FY15 and beyond. My even more conservative target of ~$1.10 is based on only a 1.25x multiple applied to the FY14E. The stop loss should be placed below the recent low at ~$0.60.The upcoming 4Q14 earnings release (expected in 2-3 weeks) represents a short-term catalyst as management is expected to provide additional color regarding the FY15 outlook, which should reinforce the thesis that BLIN has passed the key inflection point.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4035050,102653,2017-01-08T10:28:40-05:00,"The company is improving its bottom line as seen in its gross margin at 59% for Q4 as well as a much improved adjusted EBIDTA.The only significant debt is $2.1 million with Heritage Bank, yet it is trading under 1X multiple of total yearly revenue.Bridgeline has ramped up its sales team, and results are already being seen, with new contracts over the last 6 months.The company has found a stronger foothold into the market place with its new software lines (Marketier, iAPPS Pro Series, iAPPS Enterprise).It has a strong chance of having a reverse stock split next month, and cash available is low, almost guaranteeing a dilution to shareholders in the coming months.","Bridgeline Digital (NASDAQ:BLIN) is a software and service company specializing in Web Content Management and Marketing Automation.Although BLIN has been around for over 10 years, this company has suddenly taken on a new face and a new focus. Its goal is to become a legitimate player in the Sales as a Service (SaaS) marketplace on the technology front.This transition started around a year and a half ago. Mr. Kahn was at an investment conference where Bridgeline was presenting. He realized that he once competed against these guys when he owned a large piece of FatWire. FatWire, under Mr. Kahn's leadership, later was sold to Oracle for roughly 4 times revenue for $160 million.After seeing that Bridgeline was making many of the same mistakes which he fixed at FatWire, he started his mission to retool BLIN. He first came on as chief operating officer. His main focus was to eliminate a large portion of the debt on the books, continue to get expenses in line with revenue to drive a positive adjusted EBITDA, increase the sales force to drive new revenue, and work on building BLIN from a service-based software company into a SaaS-based company. He was promoted to CEO in 2016 and has been moving the company forward at an accelerated pace ever since.I have been watching BLIN closely over the last several years and did not feel comfortable with its business model until around November 2015. Since that time, the company has done several things which makes me believe it is just 10-12 months from being cash flow positive and driving the SaaS revenue portion of its total revenue over 15% compared to the previous year.The good:The grass may not be as green as mentioned above, however, for BLIN. The bad:ConclusionBridgeline is not an investment for the faint of heart. Those who invest in this small and upcoming company with only about 700 common stock shareholders may have to wait a lengthy period of time to see substantial returns. As mentioned above, healthy SaaS companies trade at between 4X and 6X revenue. With BLIN currently trading at 0.8X revenue but putting all the necessary pieces in place to be profitable 12 months from now, I believe it will be close to bringing in $4.7-5.0 million in gross revenue quarterly, thus putting the company possibly around $2.50/share or higher by this time next year. Investing in BLIN is certainly risky, but if you look at their company as a long-term investment and believe in the management and in its game plan, you could be greatly rewarded in the months/years to come. I would encourage anyone considering investing in BLIN to review the last quarterly conference transcripts as well as examine the company's investor presentation from its November SEC filing.I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

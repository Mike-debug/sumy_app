4364128,103480,2020-08-04T09:53:27-04:00,"Blackbaud, the software provider to charitable organizations, continues on its pace of meager growth.
        Its fortunes coincide with the uncertain status of many non-profits across the U.S. that have struggled with a drop in donations.
        Blackbaud's already-low gross margins also declined in the second quarter.
        Blackbaud's valuation puts it in-line with software companies that are growing in the mid-teens.","Though as a general rule software companies have fared well this year, with remote-work oriented stocks surging and the others seeing only minimal and temporary disruptions to sales momentum, the ""vertical software"" companies that are unfortunately tethered to some of the COVID-19 impacted industry have been hit far harder than their peers. Falling squarely into this bucket is Blackbaud (BLKB), an ERP and CRM tool specifically designed for the needs of charitable organizations, non-profits, and religious institutions. Already a slow-growing and dwindling company pre-pandemic - whose recent expansion into religious organizations has only produced negligible new revenue growth - the vast problems wrought by the coronavirus on non-profit institutions due to the sharp downturn in donations has spilled over into Blackbaud. In falling ~20% year-to-date, Blackbaud is one of the only tech stocks to lose double-digit percentages this year. And despite its appearance as a value stock, I tend to view Blackbaud as a value trap.Here's the issue with Blackbaud: the company falls into no-mans land when it comes to its valuation. If you look at Blackbaud from a revenue basis the way most software stocks are valued, you'll find that it stacks up unfavorably next to companies that are growing at a faster clip than Blackbaud. But from an earnings basis, too, Blackbaud doesn't pass the sniff test. At current share prices near $65, Blackbaud has a market cap of $3.21 billion. After we net off the meager $30.5 million of cash balances and much larger $488.1 million of debt owed on Blackbaud's most recent balance sheet, Blackbaud's enterprise value is $3.67 billion. Versus Wall Street's FY21 consensus revenue of $912.3 million (which is exactly flat to the prior year, by the way - data from Yahoo Finance), the company's valuation sits at 4.0x EV/FY21 revenues.The problem is that puts Blackbaud's valuation multiple approximately on-par with several other software companies that are at least growing in the mid-teens:Of course, you may then argue that Blackbaud is a more mature and thus its earnings should be taken into account. But then look at Wall Street's consensus FY21 EPS target of $2.78, and we'd get to a P/E ratio of 23.4x for Blackbaud - again, a premium P/E ratio for a stock that isn't growing. We find, for example, that SAP (SAP) is trading at a similar ~23x P/E ratio despite consensus' expectations for 8% revenue growth and 16% EPS growth for the coming year. Poor fundamentals and an overly optimistic valuation are how I'd characterize Blackbaud. Investors should continue to steer clear of this name.Let's now dive into the details of Blackbaud's most recent quarterly update in more detail. Take a look at Blackbaud's growth below:Figure 1. Blackbaud Q2 revenue growthSource: Blackbaud Q2 earnings releaseThe good news is that expectations are already so low for Blackbaud that the company has at least been able to beat Wall Street's number. The company's revenue grew 2.8% y/y to $232.0 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $217.8 million (-3.5% y/y). The less optimistic version, however, is that revenue decelerated 80bps from 3.6% y/y in Q1, and organic revenue growth (stripping out the impact of acquisitions) was even weaker at 2.5% y/y. We note that the fact that consensus is calling for virtually zero growth in FY21 - with revenue of $912.3 million flat to FY20 consensus of $912.8 million - is especially dour because of the fact that FY20 is already a challenging, pandemic-impacted year for Blackbaud. Though consensus is typically calling for FY21 to be a ratchet-back year for many of the companies most severely impacted by the coronavirus, the same doesn't seem to hold true for Blackbaud. In commenting on the quarter's results, CEO Mike Gianoni noted that ""revenue for the quarter fell short of our original plan"". Tony Boor, the company's CFO, noted on the Q2 earnings call that he expects the demand environment to remain soft at least through the end of this year, driven by the difficulties that Blackbaud's end-customers are facing. Per his remarks:Management has also commented that it has empowered its sales managers ""to backfill sales positions with a focus on 2021 bookings."" While this carries the hope of added sales recovery in 2021, it also carries the connotation of weaker profitability in the near term - especially because new salespeople take several quarters to fully ramp to quota-bearing capacity, especially in a slower-moving vertical like non-profits.Blackbaud's profitability was already showing some cracks in Q2. The company's pro forma gross margins - already on the weaker side next to most software comps - fell 40bps in the quarter to 60.4%, from 60.8% in the year-ago quarter. Compare that to most other SaaS companies in the 70-80% range. This low margin also calls into question the validity of Blackbaud's ~4x revenue multiple in-line with software companies growing in the mid-teens, when Blackbaud carries not only a growth deficit to these peers but a gross margin deficit as well. Figure 2. Blackbaud gross margin trendsSource: Blackbaud Q2 earnings releaseCash flows in Q2 were also weak, driven by poor end-customer bookings. Year to date so far in 2020, Blackbaud's free cash flow has clocked in at $9.9 million, down -37% y/y. We note that Blackbaud is in a fairly critical cash position with only $30.5 million of cash on its books and nearly half a billion dollars in debt. Figure 3. Blackbaud cash flowsSource: Blackbaud Q2 earnings releaseBy Blackbaud's own math, the company ended Q2 at a net leverage ratio of 2.2x based as a multiple of EBITDA. While this isn't crazy for a typical industrial company, it's exceedingly rare for a software company, most of which are in a net cash position.Figure 4. Blackbaud leverage trendsSource: Blackbaud Q2 earnings deckBlackbaud's premium revenue and earnings multiples don't make much sense for a company that is showing lower growth, lower gross margins, and lower overall earnings potential than its peers. Given the challenging environment for non-profits, which may take several quarters or perhaps longer than a year to fully course-correct, I'd continue to avoid Blackbaud."

The company is worried about the short-term impact of the crisis on its financials but is continuing to invest in marketing efforts and product upgrades to tackle the conditions.For the second quarter, Blackbaud's revenues grew 2.5% to $232 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $218 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.85 was also better than the Street's forecast of $0.50.By segment, recurring revenues, which include software subscriptions, grew 3.7% to $216.3 million and revenues from one-time services declined 8.7% to $15.7 million.The market forecast revenues of $214.45 million for the third quarter with an EPS of $0.52, and revenues of $886.22 million for the year with an EPS of $2.04. The company did not provide any guidance for the upcoming quarter or year.During the quarter, Blackbaud announced several technology innovations geared to address the COVID-19 situation. It simplified its donation forms, allowing fundraising to expedite collection of donations and enabling organizations to quickly and easily create campaigns. It added new financial management capabilities, such as invoice payment schedules and bank reconciliation reporting to enable the transition to work from home. It announced a new integration between peer-to-peer fundraising and donor management solutions that simplifies the process of raising revenue and acquiring new supporters through pandemic-friendly virtual events and peer-to-peer campaigns. Blackbaud also realizes the need for added security and added additional fraud protection capabilities to its offerings without adding to the costs for its customers.Blackbaud has been helping organizations power fundraisers that directly fund critical research in essential equipment, including potential vaccine developments, low-cost ventilator production and methods to treat the virus and slow its spread. It is supporting private K-12 schools throughout the pandemic by helping them migrate their daily activities online and plan for the future of the classroom.Blackbaud is increasing its focus on driving sales effectiveness in the current environment. It has invested in its digital footprint to allow it to be more cost effective in its marketing efforts and to be more flexible in the current market conditions. The COVID-19 crisis is bound to accelerate the existing trends to drive adoption of modern cloud solutions in its market. It introduced new pricing and financing offers that are based on the changing needs of its customers. But Blackbaud accepted that the current uncertainty has created short-term challenges in building a pipeline and its bookings are falling short of budget expectations.Blackbaud's stock is trading at $55.34 with a market capitalization of $2.74 billion. It was trading at a 52-week high of $94.93 last October. It had fallen to a 52-week low of $38.22 in March.Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4342927,105400,2020-05-05T00:04:14-04:00,"Blackbaud has strong switching costs in a niche industry.Its past acquisitions have increased the debt burden for the company.Valuation appears cheap, but it comes with worse operating fundamentals and a risky outlook.","Blackbaud (BLKB) has underperformed the S&P over the past 10 years, with returns at 115% compared to S&P's 140%. This is mainly due to the company's deteriorating sales growth and margins. Blackbaud's acquisitive nature and large debt load also increase the risk for the company in the future. The company's valuation is cheap compared to its peers, but it also has worse operating fundamentals.(Source: Seeking Alpha Data)Blackbaud is the leading company powering the social good community. It has millions of users across over 100 countries, and 80% of influential nonprofits use its platform. By providing multiple software solutions like relationship management, payment services, and financial management, it has penetrated deeply into the niche fundraising and nonprofit market.Revenue has grown from $320 million in 2010 to 900 million in 2019, representing an 11% compounded revenue growth rate. This growth has been driven by the company's shift towards cloud solutions and acquisitions. Blackbaud has migrated its on-premises software to the Sky Platform, which provides more flexibility in scaling its business in this niche.(Source: Investor Presentation)Blackbaud has also been acquiring companies like Just Giving in 2017 and Alternative.ly in 2016. This has allowed the company to grow its total addressable market by roughly $4 billion. Since its revenue is $900 million in the latest fiscal year, penetration is less than 10%. As such, the company still has a long runway for growth. To further penetrate the market, Blackbaud would likely acquire and consolidate smaller companies, while strengthening its sales team.(Source: Investor Presentation)Having attracted nearly 80% of influential nonprofits, Blackbaud is likely to possess some form of switching costs. Being the leader in this space helps it create worth of mouth around its brand, which attracts more nonprofits that want to follow the leading standards.As these nonprofit customers integrate their systems of record with Blackbaud's platform, it creates stronger inertia when it comes to switching platforms. These companies generally do not want to risk lost data and productivity, which leads to service disruption. An imperfect data migration could lead to huge amounts of frustration and business risk that would cause any company to think twice about switching from Blackbaud. Nonprofit organizations are also sensitive to change, which might require budgetary reviews. Hence, switching from Blackbaud to a potential competitor with better features is unlikely.Large horizontal software companies like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) would also find it difficult to penetrate this market due to the relatively smaller deals. As such, they would not have the same focus and resources dedicated to meet the needs of this market. The strength of Blackbaud's switching costs is also evident in its retention rates, at 92% with a large customer base.Despite its developments and many acquisitions, revenue growth has been slow in the single digits for the past three years. Furthermore, gross margins have declined from 60% in 2010 to 53% in 2019. Operating margins have also dropped from 8% to 4% from 2018 to 2019. These thin margins make inorganic growth risky going forward.Due to past acquisitions, Blackbaud has $7.5 million of short-term debt and $460 million of long-term debt. With only $31 million of cash and about $20 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2019, it creates pressure on the company to settle these obligations in the future.One of the key strategies of Blackbaud is to increase its total addressable market. However, it might be better to focus on improving efficiencies in its existing operations to optimize cost savings to expand free cash flow. Once Blackbaud has de-risked the company, it might then make sense to strive for growth.(Source: Company's latest 10-K)Peer analysis shows that Blackbaud appears cheaper than the median EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA and P/E ratios. This is mainly due to its weaker consensus EBITDA margins at 18.1% compared to the median of 31%, and the smaller consensus revenue growth of 1.8% compared to the median of 5.4%. As such, the cheaper ratios are justified with weaker operating fundamentals.(Source: Atom Finance)In an economic downturn, the discretionary nature of donations might result in the shutdown of some nonprofit organizations, which could increase customer churn rate for Blackbaud in the future. Hence, it is important that it manages its cash flow carefully and reduces its acquisitive nature to ensure that a recession does not put the company at risk.According to TrustRadius, Blackbaud also faces competitors in this space that may lead to slower customer adoption on its platform. Some of these competitors like Salesforce have large resources to challenge Blackbaud directly. Although Salesforce is unlikely to challenge in a large way, it might steal some market share from Blackbaud's platform.(Source: TrustRadius)By targeting a niche category, Blackbaud has fueled its growth to become the leader in social software services. It exhibits strong switching costs from the company's high retention rates and will likely continue to generate cash flow from its loyal customer base.However, Blackbaud's acquisitive nature to grow the company has increased its debt burden. This might be risky for the company in the future if a longer recession takes place, as higher customer churn reduces its debt-paying capabilities. The valuation appears cheap compared to its peers, but Blackbaud also has worse operating fundamentals.Considering all the factors above, I would give this a miss at this point in time."
4347608,103480,2020-05-14T13:59:45-04:00,"Blackbaud's growth has been cut to near-zero as the coronavirus weighs on its business.
        Shares have lost about 15% after Blackbaud released first-quarter earnings results, and hopes for a recovery are dim.
        Blackbaud's cash burn continued to mount (rare for an older software company with limited growth), threatening its slim cash balances and heavy debt load.","Blackbaud (BLKB), a software vendor that specializes in CRM systems for nonprofits and charities, is in deep trouble. Even prior to the coronavirus, Blackbaud was struggling to grow its business and revamp its go-to-market operations model, especially in a crowded CRM space where the value of Blackbaud's niche versus more generalist and better-known solutions like Salesforce.com (CRM) aren't exactly clear. Shares of Blackbaud have been among the hardest-hit tech stocks this year, down more than 40% year-to-date. Blackbaud's losses only accelerated further after the company reported disappointing first-quarter earnings results, after which shares have skidded more than 15%. On top of waning growth, Blackbaud also saw its cash flow losses continue to bleed while the company was also forced to suspend its dividend, antagonizing investors even further.Resist the temptation to buy Blackbaud on the dip. In my view, this stock is a falling knife with an uncertain future. The key bearish drivers weighing on the company:In my view, it's an especially bad time to invest in B-list software companies that have no clear category leadership, even if there's a value argument to be made (Blackbaud trades at only roughly ~3x forward revenues, but no price will excuse the fatal combination of zero growth and bleeding margins). Steer clear and invest elsewhere.Let's dig into Blackbaud's most recent quarterly results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Blackbaud 1Q20 resultsSource: Blackbaud 1Q20 earnings releaseBlackbaud's revenues grew only 3.6% y/y to $223.6 million, marginally beating Wall Street's expectations of $222.0 million (+2.8% y/y) but decelerating by a sharp four points relative to Q4's growth rate of 7.5% y/y. Now, for any other software company, a simple four-point deceleration might be excusable given the incredible headwinds presented by the coronavirus, but for Blackbaud, it represents a halving of its growth rate. Management's commentary around the demand environment was equally dire. Per CFO Tony Boor's prepared remarks on the Q4 earnings call:Boor also noted that approximately one-quarter of Blackbaud's revenue comes from donation transactions, and that the coronavirus has had a ""sharp impact"" on donation volumes. In other words, Blackbaud is being pressed from two fronts: both from a challenging new customer acquisition environment, plus a slowdown in recurring revenue from its existing install base. We should note as well that, per Blackbaud's own acknowledgement, Blackbaud's failure to drive bookings growth in 2020 won't impact 2020 revenues as much as it'll impact 2021 revenue. Put another way, Blackbaud's current weakness will translate into sluggish growth throughout 2021, which means that investors are looking at a long timeline for recovery - if Blackbaud ever fully recovers at all.Some of this growth weakness might be forgiven if Blackbaud was able to make up for it with profitability gains, but unfortunately that's not the case. Blackbaud's pro forma pre-crisis gross margins were already at a large deficit to most SaaS software peers (Blackbaud is in the low 60s, while most SaaS companies are in the mid-70s and low 80s), but this quarter Blackbaud's gross margins fell a further 200bps to just 58.4%:Figure 2. Blackbaud margin trendsSource: Blackbaud 1Q20 earnings releaseLikewise, Blackbaud's pro forma operating margins also fell 150bps to 15.2%. We should note that, in spite of Blackbaud's mid-teens operating margin (which is far better than most other software companies), when we take into account Blackbaud's tepid growth rate and give Blackbaud a ""Rule of 40"" score of ~19 points (15% operating margins plus 4% growth), Blackbaud lags far behind.Perhaps even worse is the fact that, in spite of positive operating margins, Blackbaud's free cash flow losses widened to -$36.3 million in the quarter, a 61% y/y jump in FCF losses versus 1Q19.Figure 3. Blackbaud free cash flowsSource: Blackbaud 1Q20 earnings releaseUnfortunately, Blackbaud doesn't have much cash to spare. As of the end of Q1, Blackbaud had only $25.0 million in cash left on its balance sheet, plus a gargantuan $530.9 million debt pile. As I wrote in a prior article, Blackbaud relies on a revolving line of credit to bolster its low cash balances and continue running its business, but with profitability and cash flows on the decline, Blackbaud's access to credit may be shuttered.The pandemic is likely to inflict permanent damage on Blackbaud, as it has to the many charities and non-profits that Blackbaud leans on as customers. Even if Blackbaud does recover from the coronavirus, the fact that 2020 bookings are sharply down means that investors are looking at a low or zero-growth scenario as far out as 2021. With a suspended dividend, eroding margins, and an unclear recovery timeline, it's unclear if investors will be patient enough to continue holding onto this stock. Continue to avoid this name."

The company remains committed to growing its cloud offerings for the sector through product innovation, and this quarter was no different.For the third quarter, Blackbaud's revenues grew 5.4% to $221.4 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $220 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.56 was also better than the Street's forecast of $0.50.By segment, recurring revenues, which include software subscriptions, grew 9% to $205.5 million and revenues from one-time services declined 24% to $15.9 million. Blackbaud has been focusing on building a subscriptions-based offering and the decline in the one-time revenues was on account of this push.For the current year, Blackbaud expects to generate revenues of $880-910 million with an EPS of $2.11-2.28. The market was looking for revenues of $893.9 million with an EPS of $2.22.Blackbaud is working on establishing its presence in international markets given that one in four employees that it supports are outside of the US. To help employees located in various geographies successfully contribute to the social cause, it has expanded on the tie-ups with local and hyperlocal charitable organizations. Earlier this year, Blackbaud had announced the $157 million acquisition of corporate social responsibility software provider YourCause.Prior to the acquisition, YourCause already had partnerships with CanadaHelps.org in Canada and Charities Trust in the United Kingdom to help employees access these markets. Recently, it expanded its partner network by tying up with GiveIndia, one of the largest giving platforms in India.YourCause will help Blackbaud's corporate customers get access to GiveIndia's network of nearly 1,000 verified non-profits in India. Blackbaud is working to implement payment technologies on the platform so that donations will be processed through various options such as payroll deductions, credit card, UPI and Netbanking. Through YourCause, BlackBaud's Good Network now consists of hundreds of corporations and millions of employees in 170 countries.Besides growing internationally, Blackbaud is also driving growth in verticals. For instance, for the faith community, it announced the general availability of its church management software, Blackbaud Church Management. The intuitive and easy-to-use, cloud-based software allows users to easily look up a member, take notes against their names, check in attendees, pull a report, and take a look at dashboards. The platform is mobile-friendly and will help transform the day-to-day operations of churches by helping deliver a truly connected church experience. Since being launched, Blackbaud Church Management caters to churches in more than half of the 50 U.S. states. It helps these organizations with management of volunteers, bookkeeping, reporting, and analytics along with providing them access to simple workflows.I am a big believer in Blackbaud's capabilities to drive social change and have also tied up with the company to launch the Blackbaud - 1Mby1M Social Good Startup Challenge to encourage entrepreneurs with products that extend or complement Blackbaud vertical solutions.Blackbaud's stock is trading at $83.71 with a market capitalization of $4.2 billion. It was trading at a year high of $97.35 last month.

Nonprofits need specialized consulting, direction, and, at times, tools to manage their businesses effectively. Blackbaud (NASDAQ:BLKB) is one player that has remained focused on helping nonprofits reap the benefits of cloud technology.Blackbaud was founded in 1981 with a mission to provide software and services designed for nonprofit organizations to help these businesses establish strong relationships. It's the leading cloud software company that provides software, services, expertise, and data intelligence that helps empower nonprofit organizations and connect them to others to drive impact for social good.When I met with its CTO, Mary Beth Westmoreland, a few years ago, she helped highlight the key focus areas of the company. Blackbaud is empowering the growth of nonprofits by helping them realize the importance of data and analytics, workflow mobilization, and by building an ecosystem of openness. It has been focused on enabling innovation through the cloud so that people can develop something different and leverage the cloud to do more things.Today, Blackbaud's offerings include technology solutions for analytics, financial management, fundraising and relationship management, grant and award management, marketing and engagement, organizational program management, payment services, and social responsibilities.Blackbaud earns revenues through maintenance and subscription-based services for its software and by providing one-time services to its clients. Its recently-reported second quarter revenues grew 5.5% to $226.4 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $224 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.66 was also better than the Street's forecast of $0.55. Adjusted net income declined 3.4% to $31.9 million. The company attributed the decline to the continued investment in new sales representatives and a higher interest expense on additional debt funding used to finance the YourCause acquisition. It believes that the dilution of earnings is a short-term impact.By segment, recurring revenues, which include software subscriptions, grew 8% to $209.2 million. The growth help offset the 18% decline in revenue from one-time services and other sources. The reduction in one-time services revenues was primarily due to the company's continued push to migrate to a subscription-based revenue model.For the current year, Blackbaud expects to generate revenues of $880-$910 million with an EPS of $2.11-$2.28. The market was looking for revenues of $892.5 million with an EPS of $2.19.Earlier this year, Blackbaud announced the $157 million acquisition of YourCause, a corporate social responsibility and employee engagement software provider. Plano, Texas-based YourCause was set up in 2007 and has estimated annual revenue of more than $12 million. It offers a flexible and scalable software solution with a customer base ranging from Fortune 500 companies to smaller businesses. Its network of more than 8 million people have helped raise more than $245,000 in donations every hour and have delivered more than 30 million volunteer hours.Blackbaud plans to leverage YourCause's solutions for maximizing global social impact with its leadership in delivering cloud solutions for social good to help drive efficiencies and measurable outcomes across nonprofit companies globally.Blackbaud is driving growth by focusing on a four-point strategy. First, it's focusing on a vertical-focused model of delivering integrated and open solutions on the cloud. For instance, to cater to churches, it developed Blackbaud Church Management that helps churches to digitally transform their daily operations through a single connected experience.Its second growth strategy is of driving sales effectiveness. As part of this, it has simplified its sales structure to better enable its sales team for success. Its account executives now continue to lead the total solution selling by vertical, are focused on recurring revenue and driving more products for customer. It's also investing in hiring more sales team to drive market expansion.Its third strategy focuses on the expansion of the Total Addressable Market (TAM). The acquisition of YourCause will help with the initiative as the inclusion of Corporate Social Responsibility will help Blackbaud drive efficiencies across the organizations. The acquisition has helped the two companies add several new customers including names like the NHL Foundation and the Philadelphia 76ers. Blackbaud believes that its current TAM stands at more than $10 billion, and it will continue to evaluate other growth opportunities to further expand this TAM.Finally, Blackbaud is focusing on operational efficiency to strengthen the business and position it for long-term success. Besides sales investments, it's investing in building a more scalable operating model and in its internal infrastructure development to drive productivity within the organization.The market is pleased with Blackbaud's performance. Its stock has climbed nearly 3% since the result announcement. It's currently trading at $93.26 with a market capitalization of $4.6 billion. It was trading at a 52-week high of $105.7 nearly a year ago. It hit a 52-week low of $58.23 in December last year."

Under the Sample Size column heading a count of the number of prior forecasts with Range Indexes like today’s is indicated, along with the total number of all forecasts available from the past 5 years of market days.Thinking about the credibility of the current forecasts, the proportion of those similar prior forecasts that could produce a capital gain profit becomes a significant measure. It demonstrates the capability of the forecasters to be helpful to the wealth-building investor. Its proportion as a percent of the prior forecasts sample is in the column headed Win Odds.The Win Odds has an important impact on the Realized Payoff column next to it, where the NET gains of all the prior forecasts in the sample are reported. These results include the actual losses taken under our standard portfolio management discipline TERMD, applied to all forecast situations. TERMD sets the top of each implied price range forecast as a sell target for that single forecast. When first reached within the next 3 months’ closing market price that forecast position is closed so that the expanded capital can be immediately reinvested the following market day. If not reached in 3 months the position is closed and reinvested, regardless of gain or loss.The Risk~Reward Tradeoff map of Figure 1 presents upside forecast prospects to be pitted against actual prior worst-case downside price exposures during TERMD holding periods. The flavor of the prospective reward carrot, the column headed in the Figure 2 table as %Upside Sell Target, was muted there by the worst-tasting next-column experience headed Maximum Drawdown.That point is viewed as the most likely high-stress point to cause an untimely termination of the adventure. A termination then would be at the least productive, most damaging point. Instead, committing the discipline’s full 3-month time investment (but not beyond) might achieve potential recovery to profitability, perhaps even to reach the forecast sell targetBetween the target “cup” and the %Payoff “lip” serious adjustments to commitment enthusiasms can (and usually may) occur. They are indicated by the column headed Cred.Ratio where the Realized Payoff accomplishment is contrasted with the %Upside Sell Target offering.This more critical Reward~Risk comparison draws on the Win Odds (and its complement) to condition the Realized Payoff and the Maximum Drawdown as indicated in the Odds-Weighted columns.Figure 2’s rows provide all these important dimensions issue by issue for the more promising securities in Figure 1. They are accompanied by similar boldfaced measures of SPY to give a taste of “the market” as most frequently observed by the investing public.At the bottom of the table simple averages of the listed stocks offer comparisons of the group with SPY and with a much broader population of over 2,700 stocks and ETFs as measured on this day. The full population data often reveals overly optimistic sell targets and abysmal payoff results. In contrast, the population’s “top10” issues, ranked by their odds-weighted prior forecast histories, typically present annual rates of capital accumulation in the +75% to +90% range and even above, as they do now.Often the more attractive issues fairly quickly resolve their (for whatever reason) underpriced condition, producing a “speed” of capital gain which enriches the CAGR of a portfolio. A more useful condition to those investors whose situations face potential time-defined financial needs to be met by the portfolio sooner than it would likely be able to satisfy. An Active Investment Management strategy able to selectively shift capital into and out of such opportunities often is a solution to such needs.One tool to identify the presence of such opportunities, and to choose between them, is show in Figure 3.Figure 3The orientation of this map is like that of the Reward~Risk Tradeoffs in Figure 1; good is down and to the right, not-so is up and to the left. Items in the white Payoffs area at left have achieved average Win Odds by amounts less than 80 out of 100, and those in the extreme upper left corner may also have had negative % payoffs from prior forecasts at current RI-levels.Present market prospects, as represented by SPDR S&P500 Index ETF (SPY) at location [1] offer coming price change payoffs better than some Software stocks and less than others. But it does so at very high historical odds of performance in the next 3 months, based on its past 5 years’ price performance following forecasts like today’s.The more interesting alternatives here are those with high odds for a profitable investment experience, but with a better-than-market-index prospect. Best of the group in payoff prospect is MSTR at [4], but its profitability odds fall to only 2 out of 3. The odds for ELLI at [9] rise to 8 of 10, and MSCI at [2] has an almost 19 out of 20 history.Best odds in the group is Blackbaud, Inc. (BLKB), provider of software support to organizations seeking donations from supporting charitable donors. Its only caution is that the stock’s current forecast is so attractive (a low Range Index of 1) that in 5 years that has only happened 24 times – less than once in ten weeks, on average. But it has been followed by reaching its sell target each time, in about two months – 45 market days. A small, but powerful, credible sample.Perhaps best-known to investment professionals is MSCI, Inc.(NYSE:MSCI), a spin-out of Morgan Stanley which originated from the creation of price indexes for groups of market securities, used by analysts and money managers internal to the parent. The independent (?) company now offers investment decision support tools to the entire investment industry.More familiar to individuals may be LogMein (LOGM), a provider of internet cloud-based communication services assisting group meetings free of attendee re-location inconveniences, along with other communication services.Opportunities for near price-change capital gains appear to be better among less-well-known vendors of software and related services than for some giants, like Adobe (ADBE) or Microsoft (MSFT). The prospect for double-digit gains at a double-digit basis-points per day rate exist in BLKB, MSCI, and LOGM, making them attractive as buys in an Active Investment Management strategy such as TERMD."
4258005,35181,2019-04-30T11:18:28-04:00,"Blackbaud is one of the smallest wide-moat companies with annual revenues of approximately $850 million.Blackbaud has provided S/W apps to the ""social good"" community for more than three decades and is a good choice for socially responsible investors.Wide-moat, negative sentiment and future bullish prospects make Blackbaud an investment worth considering.Given initiatives to increase TAM and provide growth catalysts, the stock price is likely to double within the next 3-5 years.There are risks that investors should consider before making an investment in Blackbaud.","In this article, I would like to introduce readers to a unique investment opportunity in what may be the smallest company in the world with a wide economic moat, Blackbaud, Inc. (BLKB). Sporting annual revenues approximately $850 million, Blackbaud serves various ""social good"" niche markets including non-profits, foundations, arts and cultural organizations, educational institutions, healthcare, and most recently faith-based communities.Source: Blackbaud 2018 Q4 earnings call slidesBlackbaud has provided applications for the social good community for more than three decades with applications that enable organizations to increase their impact via software, services, expertise, and data intelligence. Blackbaud provides vertically integrated solutions for:Solutions are tailored both to the size and nature of the non-profit organization and include features such as:If you believe that your investment dollars have an impact on the world, or you manage money for clients with a bent for social good, then you should have a serious look at Blackbaud. This company has been in the business of social good for more than 35 years, helping clients handle more than $100 billion in non-profit activities. BLKB operates in over 50 countries and has client-base of more than 40,000 customers. Unlike other companies that ""Talk-the-Talk"", Blackbaud actually ""Walks-the-Walk"". In 2017, Blackbaud was listed on Fortune's ""Companies Changing the World"" list for 2017 as one of the six smaller rising stars.Blackbaud donates up to 3% pre-tax profit for activities such as:Finally, according to the company's latest filing:Blackbaud has many factors that I look for in a potential investment, the most important of which is a wide economic moat, a concept popularized by Warren Buffett. A wide economic moat makes it difficult for competitors to encroach on a company's market, making the investment less risky and allowing company management to focus on expansion rather than defending market share.The second factor relevant to this investment is a high level of negative sentiment which is adversely affecting the share price. Analysts perceive Blackbaud as a company with slowing revenues and vulnerable to big players in for-profit verticals such as salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM).The third factor is Blackbaud's bullish prospects. Analysts appear to be oblivious to the net benefits of Blackbaud's Software-as-a-Service [*SaaS*] platform, a transformation that was initiated in 2014 and is now nearly complete. The company is working hard to expand the Total Addressable Market [*TAM*] by acquiring companies and developing apps for adjacent verticals. And the company has formed a partnership with Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) which recently announced its new initiative in philanthropic activities called ""Tech for Social Impact Group"".Despite these very favorable conditions, there is one checkbox from my investment rulebook that I cannot tick, and that is to choose stocks that operate within a rapidly expanding ""wind at my back"" industry. An example of such a company is ServiceNow (NOW), the subject of my most recent article ""ServiceNow Is On The Road To Becoming A 100-Bagger"", which recently announced 37% year-over-year growth in revenues. Unfortunately, the ""social good"" industry grows in the single digits yearly, with a high level of variability based on world events. Despite the low industry growth expectations, I believe that Blackbaud is doing a great job of expanding its Total Addressable Market [*TAM*] (discussed later in this article) and is a reasonable substitute for a rapidly expanding industry, making Blackbaud an exceptional investment opportunity based on the other factors that I have identified (wide moat, digital transformation, negative sentiment and new initiatives). I also believe that the risk versus reward ratio is favorably slanted towards reward for this investment as most of the potential downside risks such as slow growth are already factored in.Non-profit organizations have unique needs depending on the cause and type of fundraising, which includes the management of fundraising events, accounting for and distributing donations, and allocating in-kind products and services from donors. Deep industry knowledge is ingrained in Blackbaud's products as a result of 35+ years' experience and a client base of more than 40,000 customers. The company provides software that fully adheres to and addresses the complex non-profit accounting legislation and regulatory standards both at the country and state level. The industry knowledge and experience result in an intangible asset that provides a competitive advantage over its peers.Blackbaud has the ability to offer comprehensive solutions across the entire suite of applications, from task automation and marketing to analytics and payment processing. In short, Blackbaud is uniquely positioned to provide unmatched breadth and depth to non-profit organizations without having to bring in additional vendors to fill gaps in functionality.Blackbaud is transitioning its client base to an all-encompassing cloud-based SaaS solution (90% complete). As a result, the company is experiencing high renewal rates that hover in the low-to-mid-90s, higher than top SaaS vendors such as salesforce.com, Inc. Furthermore, customers that select add-ons such as analytics have even higher renewal rates in the high-90s and in so doing creates substantial switching costs.Given the factors listed above, and the fact that Blackbaud is operating in a number of relatively small niche markets, insulating it from larger CRM vendors, Morningstar has classified Blackbaud as a company with a wide economic moat.The wide economic moat designation implies that it will be difficult for competitors to unseat Blackbaud from its position as an entrenched leader for years to come.Since late 2014, Blackbaud has been in the process of sunsetting approximately 26 legacy products, while migrating customers to similar SaaS apps on Blackbaud's SKY, which runs on the Microsoft Azure platform. The SaaS migration is approximately 90% complete and eliminates legacy, on-premises solutions.Source: Blackbaud 2018 Q4 earnings call slidesBlackbaud SKY has apps built around financial management, marketing, payments, and analytics. With one single log-on, customers can easily access a suite of add-ons in various verticals. The magic of cloud-based SaaS is that the environment is conducive to customers signing up for multiple products, resulting in an acceleration of revenues and creation of substantial switching costs for customers considering a switch to a competitor's product.This transition to SaaS has some known issues that most companies, including Blackbaud, have to deal with. One issue is revenues, which invariably take a significant hit as some customers are alienated when legacy products are retired. Another issue is that the company's margins become compressed and returns on invested capital suffer during the transition period. This is due to (1) increased sales and support resources; and (2) the need to support both on-premise legacy platforms and the new SaaS platform simultaneously. The additional sales and support resources help unlock cross-selling opportunities to existing customers while attracting new clients at the same time (existing clients usually take precedence over attracting new clients). These issues are predictable but often overlooked by analysts, and this translates into negative sentiment and suppressed share price.I would like to illustrate how far off the rails analysts can get by way of two examples, both being analysis published by Simply Wall Street in January 2019.Simply Wall Street statement:Rebuttal:Free Cash Flow [*FCF*] yield is calculated by dividing the FCF by the company's Enterprise Value [*EV*]. Simply Wall Street performed the calculation correctly, but the resulting conclusions are not correct and in fact extremely negatively biased.A chart of the FCF yield is presented below.Source: portfolio123.comAs can be seen from the above chart, the FCF yield is at a level not seen since early 2014. In 2014, the FCF yield was approximately what it is today, approximately 4.3%. Yet Blackbaud has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 stock index since 2014 as shown below.Source: finance.yahoo.comThis illustrates how bogus the statement made by Simply Wall Street really is. Blackbaud had a similar FCF yield in 2014 yet has significantly spanked the S&P 500 since then. Simply Wall Street's logic didn't work then and there is no reason it should today. The analyst did not even consider that the FCF is temporarily compressed due to the aforementioned transition to SaaS - i.e. supporting legacy and new platforms simultaneously along with increasing SaaS sales resources.For fun, I decided to plot the FCF yield for salesforce.com. I wasn't surprised to see that salesforce.com currently has an FCF yield of 2.2%, half of what Blackbaud's yield. And the last time salesforce.com had a yield above 4% was in 2009, when the stock price was less than 1/16th what it is today.The conclusion here is that there is no merit in the Simply Wall Street statement regarding Blackbaud's capacity to generate cash. Blackbaud has performed exceptionally well with equal or less FCF yield over the last five years. Additionally, salesforce.com has performed even better than Blackbaud with half the FCF yield.Simply Wall Street statement:Source: Simply Wall Street, Estimates for operating cash flow over the next two years.Rebuttal:Simply Wall Street is calculating ""expected growth"" in Operating Cash Flow [*OCF*] based on analyst estimates which do not consider margin compression due to SaaS transitioning. Therefore, the argument is flawed right out of the starting gate. But in any case, the more important factor is FCF, and FCF has been steadily climbing as the transition to SaaS nears completion.Source: portfolio123.comMy conclusion for this second example is that there is no concern with falling OCF. The analysis is based on a lack of understanding of the operating environment (compressed margins) and in any case, the important parameter is FCF which is in fact rising.Argument:Blackbaud has been suffering some share price turbulence as a result of the recent announcement by salesforce.com to buy out its independent non-profit salesforce.org. The purpose of this restructuring is to merge Salesforce.org with other existing internal (similar) non-profit operations in order to create a new ""non-profit and education"" vertical. This amalgamation will eliminate duplication, save on cost and provide a new vertical that focuses on non-profits.Rebuttal:I believe that the risk of salesforce.com encroaching on Blackbaud's wide economic moat is greatly overblown. In the words of one Morningstar analyst:Now that I have described the negative sentiment that is causing the Blackbaud stock price to be suppressed, let us consider Blackbaud's future which in my opinion is actually pretty rosy.The mix of legacy and SaaS offerings have had short-term damping effects on margins and returns on invested capital. Now that the customer base migration is close to complete, operating margins should expand by way of sales and marketing and other spending leverage.Customers committed to the Blackbaud Sky platform are likely to sign up for multiple applications, which will translate into higher revenue growth than in previous years, particularly when combined with expanded sales and marketing efforts.Apart from the SaaS transition, there are other bullish factors in play, including Blackbaud's recent initiatives to expand the company's TAM by more than $4 billion to exceed an estimated $10 billion. Included in this effort is the recent launch of ""Cloud Solution for Faith Communities"", which combines fundraising, marketing, payments, financial management and analytics with completely new Church Management capabilities. Blackbaud still has significant headroom for growth in every vertical with less than 10% overall revenue penetration on average, in spite of Blackbaud's wide moat status. This implies that there is a significant opportunity for growth.Source: Blackbaud 2018 Q4 earnings call slidesAnd let's not forget the recently announced partnership with Microsoft, which will likely be a significant catalyst for new business.Blackbaud stock currently trades at around $79 which is less than the fair price estimate of $87 recently provided by Morningstar. In my opinion, there is significant upside potential for patient investors, and the price surge will be fueled by revenue growth, improvement of operating margins and shift in market sentiment. Fasten your seatbelt because the next few years will be interesting if not exciting.Morningstar estimates revenue growth of approximately 9.5% CAGR for the next ten years. I believe that this figure is conservative and revenue growth will likely be 20%+ for a least 5 years. This prediction is based on the following factors:Operating margin will recover from the currently suppressed level and this, along with renewed revenue growth, will cause sentiment to swing positive and further drive up the stock price.Stock Price Prediction: BLKB will double in price to $160 within three to five years.While the long-term picture for Blackbaud appears to be quite rosy, there are several investment risks that investors should be aware of.There is an inherent level of cyclicality and/or unpredictability in the non-profit market that could negatively impact future revenues and stock price.Operationally, SaaS firms face security risks. Any failure to maintain data integrity, security, and uptime could lead to customers abandoning the platform.Blackbaud bolsters its wide economic moat and growth outlook by acquiring other companies. Company acquisition can result in overpayment and integration risk resulting in the erosion of shareholders' capital.The company maintains a fairly high debt/equity ratio of approximately 1.23. Rising interest rates could negatively impact profits.A Blackbaud investment has many positive factors, including a wide economic moat, a high level of negative sentiment and future bullish prospects. The company is working hard to expand its TAM by acquiring companies and developing apps for adjacent verticals.The negative sentiment surrounding Blackbaud is primarily due to the compressed margins and sales reset encountered during the company's conversion to a cloud-based SaaS offering. Once the transition is complete, margins should rebound and revenue growth will increase.Blackbaud has formed a partnership with Microsoft Corporation that will serve as a catalyst for future growth.Based on the positive factors identified in this article, a profit target of $160 has been set and is expected to be breached within the next 3-5 years.This proposed investment comes with risks, including the cyclical nature/unpredictability of the non-profit market, security risks involved with hosting SaaS solutions and risks involved with the acquiring of other companies. Investors must also consider the possibility and effect of rising interest rates given the company's relatively high debt/equity level.And by the way... rumor has it that Blackbaud is now backed by God!"
4335819,103480,2020-04-03T09:36:23-04:00,"Shares of Blackbaud have crumbled nearly 40% since the start of the year, reflecting lower confidence in the company's execution.Blackbaud's tepid single-digit growth rates may come under further pressure as its non-profit customers may churn to cut costs amid an expected decline in contributions.Blackbaud's operating margins have also been under pressure, with both GAAP and non-GAAP margins deteriorating.The company also owes a substantial amount of debt, which is not ideal in a cash-crunched macroeconomic environment.Blackbaud may also be in danger of tripping its leverage covenants if earnings continue to decline, which would limit the company's liquidity and possibly block its dividend.","The sharp, short recession that the coronavirus spread is expected to inflict upon the U.S. is also expected to put many non-profits into a difficult position. With trillions of dollars having been wiped from global stock markets, charitable giving is expected to decline as people tighten their belts.These trends are sure to have negative impacts on Blackbaud (BLKB), a verticalized software company that specializes in ERP and CRM software specifically for non-profits, educational institutions, and religious organizations. Shares of Blackbaud have been swept down by the market downturn, slipping ~40% year-to-date so far:Data by YChartsDespite masquerading as one of the only ""value"" stocks in the software sector, Blackbaud's fundamentals are already doing quite poorly even before the coronavirus hit. In spite of the company's recent expansion to religious organizations, Blackbaud's organic growth had already slowed down to the mid single-digits, while at the same time the company has been unable to reverse a decline in operating margins. On top of that, Blackbaud's cash position runs precariously thin, and given that Blackbaud is burdened by a relatively sizable load of debt, any continued decay in revenue growth and margins this year caused by the coronavirus will increase the company's risk of tripping its debt covenants.In short, Blackbaud's weak position will only be further threatened by the looming coronavirus recession. Investors would be wise to sit on the sidelines here and invest in stronger names.Blackbaud isn't exactly a new software company. The company was founded in 1981, and as a result of over-saturation in its space (which prompted to company to seek growth in expanding its product coverage to religious institutions), its growth rates have slowed down meaningfully. We'd expect, however, that for a company with such low growth rates, that Blackbaud would be able to raise its margin profile - sadly, this is not the case.Figure 1. Blackbaud Q4 revenue trendsSource: Blackbaud Q4 earnings releaseBlackbaud's revenue in the company's most recent quarter grew just 7.5% y/y to $237.8 million. On an organic growth basis that excludes the impact of acquired companies, growth was even weaker at just 6.7% y/y. Blackbaud has already been on a year-long effort to drive increased sales. Mark Gianoni, Blackbaud's CEO, commented on the company's Q4 earnings call on the effort to increase sales momentum and add headcount:Sadly, neither this increase in sales headcount nor the recent expansion into religious organizations has been able to meaningfully lift Blackbaud's revenue beyond single-digit growth rates. Blackbaud's revenue guidance for 2020 of $930-$955 million also implies just 3.3% to 6.0% y/y growth over FY19 revenues of $900.4 million, which isn't a range we can really consider impressive.The good news underlying this is the fact that most of Blackbaud's revenue is recurring - in FY19, 92% of Blackbaud's revenue stream was recurring, indicating that even in a period of relative uncertainty, Blackbaud should be able to hang on to the majority of its revenues. However, we should still expect higher-than-usual churn this year. Blackbaud provides software to non-profits both large and small, and many lesser-endowed non-profits that are getting squeezed out of donations this year may either go belly-up or cut down on their software expenses to conserve cash. Given Blackbaud's already-tepid growth rates, even its current guidance range of 3.6% to 6% growth in 2020 may be a high bar to achieve if existing customers peel off at a higher-than-expected churn rate. We would expect that for a company with such unimpressive growth that Blackbaud would be able to at least deliver some operating margin gains. But here we're wrong as well: pro forma gross margins in FY19 fell 170bps to 59.1%, from 60.8% in FY18 (already at a major deficit to most peer software companies with margins in the 70-80% range), while pro forma operating margins also fell 320bps to 16.8%, down from 20.0% in the prior year. Likewise, although Blackbaud maintained its positive free cash flow status in FY19, nominal FCF declined -17% y/y in FY19 to $124.1 million, while FCF margins slipped to 13.8% in FY19, down from 17.6% in FY18. For a supposedly stable, mature software company like Blackbaud, it's difficult to accept the company's across-the-board deterioration in profit metrics - especially because the jittery state of the markets has caused investors to focus much more heavily on tech companies' bottom lines. Figure 2. Blackbaud FCFSource: Blackbaud Q4 earnings releaseAlongside weak fundamentals, Blackbaud also sports a relatively feeble balance sheet position as well. For a company of its scale, Blackbaud operates with a relatively thin cash balance. As of the end of the fourth quarter, Blackbaud had only $31.8 million of cash on its balance sheet:Figure 3. Blackbaud balance sheetSource: Blackbaud 10-K filingBlackbaud additionally writes in its 10-K that its principal source of cash to run its business comes from operating cash flows. But as we've seen in FY19, Blackbaud's poor growth combined with deterioration in both gross and operating margins have caused a decline in operating cash flows. And that's before any pressure caused by the coronavirus, which may see margins and cash flow decline even further. In FY20, Blackbaud's operating expenses tallied up to $454.9 million. If we add back $85.7 million of depreciation and amortization costs, $58.6 million of stock-based comp, and $5.8 million of restructuring costs, the company's true ""cash"" recurring opex amounts to $304.8 million. Blackbaud's current cash balances, at about a tenth of its annual cash operating expenses, looks incredibly thin. That's not to mention Blackbaud's substantial debt load as well. As seen in the company's Q4 balance sheet above, Blackbaud owes a staggering $467.1 million in outstanding debt. Blackbaud's high amount of leverage, incurred in order to finance M&A that has produced little top-line growth, is one of the key risks that the company has noted in its 10-K:Figure 4. Blackbaud leverage commentarySource: Blackbaud 10-K filingWe're also concerned that Blackbaud is close to hitting the upper bounds of its 3.5x net leverage ratio required by its lenders. Blackbaud has a current net debt position of $435.2 million ($467.1 million of debt, less $31.9 million of cash) and its current net leverage ratio is 2.3x as shown in the table below, implying $189.2 million of EBITDA that Blackbaud's lenders allow it to count toward this covenant. Figure 5. Blackbaud net leverage ratioSource: Blackbaud 10-K filingHowever, Blackbaud has also noted in its 10-K (page 45) that average daily borrowings in FY19 were $537.3 million. This means that, assuming the same EBITDA, Blackbaud's typical intra-quarter net leverage ratio sits closer to 2.7x. Meanwhile, the company's profitability and cash flow have already been on a declining trend, and if any coronavirus impacts cause Blackbaud's margins to slip further, the company could be in danger of tripping its leverage covenant. A ~25% decay in EBITDA would immediately trigger that upper threshold - a very real scenario considering the uncertain macro environment. It should be noted that Blackbaud currently pays out a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, yielding about ~1% at today's share prices. However, Blackbaud's ability to pay dividends will be blocked by its lenders if the company's leverage ratio falls below 3.25x, as noted in the company's debt description in its 10-K. Given the sensitivity of Blackbaud's earnings power to the uncertainty of the coronavirus, triggering this threshold and forcing an end to Blackbaud's dividend may stir additional panic in the markets. Blackbaud's proximity to its upper leverage threshold also limits the amount of additional debt it can draw down in the very real possibility that its ~$30 million cash balance runs too thin. As of the end of Q4, Blackbaud notes that it has $209.6 million of unused capacity on its revolving line of credit, but its already-high leverage may prevent the company from drawing down on that debt when it's needed.Blackbaud is a fairly poor investment across many criteria: sluggish growth, deteriorating margins, and a debt-heavy balance sheet that may be in danger of tripping its leverage covenants. This is a company that's ill-equipped to handle the pressures of the coronavirus, especially if the expectation of reduced donations causes many of Blackbaud's customers to churn. Steer clear here and invest elsewhere."
4241226,21815,2019-02-14T16:44:47-05:00,"The company, like so many other software solution providers, is moving to the cloud and this process is well underway.The company has a leading market position, but it is suffering from slowing growth.In order to arrest the slowdown in growth, it is investing heavily but returns on that aren't really materializing before 2020.We think the shares are fully priced, for now.","Blackbaud (BLKB), the maker of software for non-profit institutions is yet another company that is in transition to the cloud. That should be welcomed, especially as it allows the company to improve its recurring revenues and cement its leading position in this space.However, growth has slowed down a lot and the company is increasing investing quite a bit, guiding operating margin a couple of points lower this year and predicting new revenue growth will not really materialize before 2020.So, while the company is the undisputed leader in the space and the shift to the cloud and the new initiatives are very welcome, we don't see compelling reasons to buy immediately.Here are the most important themes that we're going to discuss:Here is a longer-term overview which serves as a point of reference:Data by YChartsThere has been a considerable amount of growth and operational improvement, although, in GAAP, the latter has recently stalled or (in the case of net income) even gone backwards, we'll get to that below.Revenue growth is declining, but this is at least in part an optical effect from the shift in business model towards recurring cloud revenues. But that's almost done, just 10% of revenue is from on-premise licenses and the decline of that will accelerate to 25% this year (Q4CC):For this year, the company is expecting 5% organic growth, but that's still lower than the overall market (growing at 7%). This is simply the result of the change in business model, the migration from on-premise one-time licenses towards recurring revenues from the cloud.As a result, one-time services is dropping off dramatically and that will even accelerate to -25% this year. With the process well advanced, there is also less uplift (additional sales to newly migrated customers) and there are costs of migration and keeping double infrastructure (like servers).The change in the business model also has produced a 1% loss in retention, which is actually quite substantial given the single-digit growth. The company has a four-point strategy for increasing results, from the earnings deck:The company is investing in growth through various means. First, it is making a sustained effort to increase its own sales force, which has been growing at roughly 10% a year, but the company is doubling that effort to 20% growth.That only started to happen in earnest at the end of Q4, so the cost of that will emerge in H1 2019, and that shows in a decline in operating margins (see below) but not yet in increased revenues, most of which is not expected before 2020.The company has considerable ground to cover yet in its main markets:The company has three main TAM increasing initiatives which together increase their TAM by $4B:This deal with Microsoft has other advantages (Q4CC):Basically, they are leveraging their cloud and sales force, given the large ramp in their own sales efforts (see below), that seems like a smart strategy to us.Innovating and adding new segments have been made that much easier as a result of Blackbaud SKY, their cloud platform, as we have often described the advantages of the Swiss army knife business model of SaaS platforms here in the pages of SA.For instance, having already extensive solutions in place for K-12 educational institutions, it wasn't a big leap towards extending these to the higher education sector (Q4CC):With additional services like (Q4CC):Not only does the company develop new solutions, but it also acquires them, like that of YourCause (Q4CC):That acquisition could produce some small cannibalization as the company itself had a solution for some part of what YourCause can do, but the latter is much more sophisticated and broad based. Management argues it adds $500M to their TAM with $20-25M in additional revenue from them this year.Once again, it's integrated into the SKY platform which was pretty easy according to management. The platform is adding more revenue streams and has become a veritable Swiss army knife.One should also not underestimate potential network effects here (Q4CC):JustGiving, another new initiative has just been launched in Q1 in the US, but revenues this year will be modest.Data by YChartsGross margins should improve:Apart from the reduction in duplicate infrastructure, the move to the cloud has other benefits from a cost perspective (Q4CC):But the big investments in sales and R&D are likely to keep operating margins depressed this year, guided at 17%, quite a bit below recent numbers:In order to mitigate the impact of the new investments in sales and R&D, the company has also embarked on a program to drive sales effectiveness, that is, to increase the sales productivity (the second strategic pillar) and increase operational efficiency (the fourth strategic pillar), from the Q4CC:The free cash flow margin is pretty healthy and so is their balance sheet, although this is not without debt. The company has incurred debt several times for acquisitions and the free cash flow generation has allowed leverage to come back down after each:The company holds $30.8M in cash and equivalents and $387.1M in debt (all but $7.5M is long term). The company also pays a dividend and the yield is a modest 0.62%.CapEx is expected to be $45-55M, similar to last year and it will decrease after this year. Management confirmed a guess from an analyst on the Q4CC for the organic growth in 2019 at around 5-6% (excluding YourCause).Data by YChartsThe investments have led to a guided EPS decline this year, from $2.49 in 2018 to $2.20 (mid-point) this year ($2.21 is the average analyst expectation).There are lots of positives, most notably the shift to the cloud, with now 90% of revenues recurring and the dominant position the company has in the space.We also like the increased TAM, but this is requiring a considerable investment effort which isn't going to pay off before 2020 with EPS probably even declining a bit this year.Its cooperation with Microsoft for nonprofit resource management is a clever way to enlist the sales force of this giant, we hope more such deals are possible.As the shares are already not cheap, we see no reason to dive-in in the short-term, although they could still be attractive in the long run."
4289203,35181,2019-09-02T14:39:49-04:00,I am revisiting my buy rating from 4 months ago.Expenses are rising and I don't expect an equivalent increase in revenues this year.Fundamentals are so-so and the stock is overvalued.New applications are slow to be released.,"Back in April, I wrote an article on Blackbaud, Inc. (BLKB), giving the company a bullish rating. Four months have passed, and a new quarterly report filed. Since my original article, Blackbaud's stock has appreciated by 15%, and it is time to revisit that rating.(Source: Seeking Alpha)I have come to the realization that despite the positive initiatives that I identified in my first article, including Blackbaud’s transformation to SaaS, the new partnership with Microsoft (MSFT) and the Total Addressable Market (TAM) expansion, revenue growth is still only 5%.(Source: Blackbaud)Management has been ramping sales staff and plans to do more of the same for the rest of this year. This will obviously increase sales expenses and I’m not expecting to see improved performance from the increased staff for at least the remainder of 2019 or perhaps later than that.(Source: Blackbaud)Sales and marketing expenses have increased by 18% YoY, but revenue growth was only 5%. The general rule in SaaS-land is to limit the increase of sales and marketing expenses to revenue growth.Social good is not a “wind at my back” industry. In my opinion, Blackbaud's stock is overvalued relative to its peers, doesn’t meet the Rule of 40 and cash burn is a little high compared to its peers.In addition, the engineering side of the company appears to be a little slow for my liking. They are dragging their feet on the general release of the church management and higher education applications, as well as slowly moving away from legacy products to the Azure cloud-based architecture. This last issue implies higher costs due to duplication of infrastructure.Blackbaud's management has a history of making acquisitions until the leverage ratio (debt/EBITDA) approaches 3.5x, then they pay down the debt and repeat. This has worked out in the past, but the markets have been strong for the past 8 years. Balckbaud is now 2.7x leveraged.(Source: Blackbaud)This last year the UK market has been soft “on the giving front”, a phenomenon that was exasperated by Blackbaud's acquisition of JustGiving. Conditions have not changed and I expect the UK market will continue to be soft or worse with Brexit coming up.Finally, investors should expect higher expenses for the second half of the year, not only due to the hiring of sales staff but for IT spend as well, as indicated by the company management:In summary, the stock is overvalued, fundamentals are not great, engineering is too slow, costs are rising and the company is highly leveraged. For all of these reasons, I am changing my bullish rating to neutral. If you own stock, it is time to sell and run for the hills.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, a higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 88 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Blackbaud is above the trendline, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is higher than its peers', given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Blackbaud is overvalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.High-growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Although one might not consider Blackbaud to be a high-growth company, the intent to achieve a higher level of growth is there, as evidenced by the transformation to SaaS and aggressive sales hiring. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40 is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus profit adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40 calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available, (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition, and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin, others use operational cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor's perspective.Blackbaud's revenue grew by 5.1% for the most recent 12 months, down from 15% in January 2017. Part of the decline is a result of the shift to recurring revenue.(Source: Portfolio123)Blackbaud had a free cash flow margin of 16.6% for the most recent 12-month period.(Source: Portfolio123)Blackbaud's YoY revenue growth was 5.1%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 16.6%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 5.1% + 16.6% = 21.7%The Rule of 40 calculation comes out substantially less than 40%, I conclude that the company has work to do to bring growth and profitability into balance.As an investor, one wants to make sure that if a company doesn't score well on the Rule of 40, it is at least not burning cash. (Source: Portfolio123)In the case of Blackbaud, the SG&A expense is 48% of the total revenues. This means that Blackbaud is spending almost 50% of revenue intake on SG&A expenses. This is actually quite a good figure for a SaaS company.Another way to look at cash burn is to create a scatter plot that shows the operating margin/EV versus forward sales growth for SaaS stocks. The operating margin for my purposes is calculated as follows:Operating Margin = Gross Margin TTM - SG&A Expense Margin TTM(Source: Portfolio123)Blackbaud is sitting under the trendline, suggesting that cash burn is higher than its peers. The combination of lower gross profit margin and high SG&A expense margin is too much for a company with 5% annual revenue growth.I wrote my first article on Blackbaud four months ago. Since that time, the stock price has appreciated 15% and I now believe that it is time to sell. The initiatives that I identified in the first article have not improved Blackbaud's growth which was only 5% TTM. Blackbaud's fundamentals are not particularly good with the undershooting of the Rule of 40, and operating margin less than its peers. The stock price is also overvalued relative to its peers.I am expecting costs to increase for the remainder of the year, but we won't see an equivalent increase in performance. New applications are slow to be released and there is also the issue of duplicated IT infrastructure which increases costs.I am therefore changing my buy rating to a neutral rating."
4318422,103480,2020-01-23T09:30:00-05:00,"Blackbaud, the cloud-based software company dedicated to non-profits and educational institutions, has seen fundamental performance decline in FY19.
        In spite of this, shares of Blackbaud have risen ~30% since the start of 2019, matching the performance of the broader S&P 500.
        Blackbaud's growth has decelerated down to a mere ~5% y/y. In addition, the company has seen sinking operating margins.
        Blackbaud also maintains significant debt at a ~3x leverage ratio, a rarity among cloud software companies of its scale.","With the market continuing to march to new records, investors should take care to continually prune out the names that haven't seen fundamental performance live up to their increases in share price. Blackbaud (BLKB), in my view, falls squarely into this bucket. The cloud software company, best known for providing management systems and ERP solutions for non-profit institutions, religious organizations, and higher education, has seen both growth and profitability hit a dead end in 2019. In spite of these fundamental weaknesses, Blackbaud's share price has stubbornly lifted alongside the rest of the market, rising ~30% in tandem with the broader S&P 500 since the start of 2019:When I last covered Blackbaud over a year ago, I noted that the company's growth had slowed down into the high single-digits, and that lack of growth should disqualify Blackbaud from trading like a technology company. Fast-forward to today, and not only has Blackbaud's growth soured even further to the ~5% range, but its 2019 rally has also caused an expansion in its trading multiple. There's no reason for Blackbaud, in my view, to trade at a 36x P/E ratio or a 4.8x forward revenue multiple. It's important to note that not only has growth been in decline in 2019, but profits have eroded as well. In addition, Blackbaud maintains a high level of debt that makes the company's leverage look more dangerous as profits decline. Though the fact that Blackbaud generates positive EPS and trades at a low single-digit revenue multiple makes it appear like a value stock in the software sector, its poor fundamentals should justify an exclusion from your portfolio. For a company that has managed to hold on to its premium valuation multiple for so long, it's a wonder what kind of growth investors are pricing in. So far, Blackbaud has released three quarters of fiscal 2019 - and as seen in the snapshot below, Blackbaud's Q3 and YTD revenue of $221.4 million and $664.3 million, respectively, are up just 5.3% y/y and 5.6% y/y:Figure 1. Blackbaud revenue growthSource: Blackbaud Q3 earnings releaseSimilarly, Blackbaud's organic recurring revenue also saw just 5.6% y/y growth in Q3. This is a far cry from the growth rates that Blackbaud used to be capable of generating. As seen in the chart below, taken from Blackbaud's most recent investor presentation, the company generated a 19% y/y growth CAGR in recurring revenues through 2018:Figure 2. Blackbaud historical growthSource: Blackbaud Q3 earnings presentationCould it be that Blackbaud's disappointing growth is a function of the company's sales resources spreading themselves thin over too many products? Recall that last year, Blackbaud unveiled a huge new vertical expansion into church groups and religious organizations; CEO Mike Gianoni made a specific call-out on this expansion during the third-quarter earnings call:But why have grown rates decelerated versus last year, even as Blackbaud continues to push into new markets? Like many of its larger-cap software peers (namely Oracle (ORCL) and Salesforce.com (CRM)), Blackbaud's principal strategy for avoiding deceleration has been to acquire as many companies as possible in an effort to expand its TAM. But though Blackbaud has managed to grow its addressable market, its revenue growth has continued to remain underwater.Figure 3. Blackbaud acquisition timelineSource: Blackbaud Q3 earnings presentationWhile we are unsure whether Blackbaud's acquisitions and new market entries have been accretive to growth, we know for sure that one effect of Blackbaud's spreading thin is a hit to margins. Year-to-date in 2019, Blackbaud's investments into growth have driven major headwinds to profits. Here's a look at how pro forma profit metrics have fallen in the year-to-date:Blackbaud's CFO, Tony Boor, defended the margin declines as follows on the Q3 earnings call:Boor also added that relative to the 16.7% to 17.2% operating margin guidance that Blackbaud set out for the full year, the company plans to land on the ""low end"" of that spectrum due to heightened investments.This profit deterioration has had impacts on cash flow as well. Year-to-date free cash flow is down to $78.0 million, down -21% y/y:Figure 4. Blackbaud FCFSource: Blackbaud Q3 earnings releaseDeclining profits have also impacted Blackbaud's debt. It's important to note that most small/mid-cap cloud software companies of Blackbaud's scale typically carry no debt; Blackbaud is an exception in this arena. The company is shouldering a staggering $503.1 million in debt (up versus $387.1 million in the prior-year period).The company's weaker profits have had the effect of stretching Blackbaud's leverage ratio. As seen in the chart below, Blackbaud's leverage has hit 2.5x as of the end of Q3, well above the company's stated ""optimal leverage"" of 1.8x. Leverage has risen steadily since the beginning of 2017:Figure 5. Blackbaud leverage trendsSource: Blackbaud Q3 earnings presentationSagging growth, eroding profits, and ballooning debt - we have to wonder why the market is valuing Blackbaud at a P/E of 36x, a valuation multiple that would suggest growth is in full swing. Until we see Blackbaud deliver above-market revenue and earnings growth, the company's promises of TAM expansion and eventual margin recovery ring hollow, and I find it difficult to justify Blackbaud's premium valuation when its fundamentals are in such poor shape. Steer clear here and invest elsewhere."
4210601,103480,2018-10-09T05:38:09-04:00,"Blackbaud shares tanked more than 15% after announcing a guidance cut for FY18.The company slashed its revenue expectations by $26 million on the low end and $46 million on the high end, or a ~4% reduction.Given that half of FY18 has already passed, this implies serious deceleration in the back half of the year to less than 5% y/y revenue growth.The company is attributing the shortfall to a reduction in service revenues and transaction-based revenues in the UK.","Blackbaud (BLKB) probably couldn't have picked a worse time to lower its guidance forecast for the year. Sentiment on SaaS stocks has already hit lows for the year over the past several weeks - and Blackbaud added fuel to the fire by announcing that it would not be able to meet its revenue forecast for FY18. The vertical software vendor, which focuses on software solutions for non-profits, tanked more than 15% in after-hours trading, bringing the stock to its low points for the year:BLKB data by YChartsAt this point, shares of Blackbaud are down -18% year-to-date - horribly underperforming the broader software sector, which despite a bloody few recent weeks is still up for the year. In fact, shares of Blackbaud haven't traded this low since March 2017. The company's fall from grace may come as a surprise to some investors - after all, Blackbaud is one of the few SaaS companies that is nearing ~$1 billion in annual revenues. Its focus on non-profits, charities, and public sector institutions has made it quite a niche provider in the sector with limited competition. Up until now, many investors had considered it a ""safe"" stock in the software sector. So what went wrong?Part of it, in my view, is a less-than-clean transition into subscription-based revenues. Blackbaud, of course, isn't the only SaaS company guilty of this - plenty of ""legacy"" tech names were late in switching to cloud, even companies like Oracle (ORCL), for whom cloud is now a central pillar of its corporate strategy. But Blackbaud is one of the few application software companies that have truly failed to drive a massive stock rally and meaningful growth from its cloud transition. Adobe (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK), Tableau (DATA), and similar other names all struggled initially through a period of low growth and contracting cash flows, but ultimately emerged as fresh SaaS companies valued at higher multiples and growing tremendously. Blackbaud, however, has dragged its feet. Execution issues on the cloud side are partially to blame for the company's guidance reduction, according to the press release.The main question for investors now is: is it the right time to catch a falling knife and hope for a rebound in Blackbaud?In my view, Blackbaud will remain a ""dead stock"" in the penalty box for quite some time. It's not cheap enough to truly become a value play (we'll discuss Blackbaud's post-crash valuation shortly), nor is its growth trajectory exciting enough to stack it up evenly against the many other SaaS companies that have fallen from grace over the past few weeks.With the tumble in the NASDAQ, plenty of fallen angels - with much better fundamentals - are ripe for the picking in the software sector. Within this category, I'm partial to Red Hat (RHT), Dropbox (DBX), and Instructure (INST) - all trading at or near YTD lows. Any of these names will make for far better rebound investments than Blackbaud.Here's a look at Blackbaud's updated guidance range for FY18:Figure 1. Blackbaud FY18 guidance, October 8Source: Blackbaud investor relationsAs taken from the company's earnings release, the guidance reduction is attributed to three primary drivers:Loosely translated, the company's cloud transition momentum isn't going as well as planned and the reduction in on-prem revenues is eating into top-line growth, and plus there's a little trouble in the UK.This ~4% guidance reduction represents just 7.7% y/y growth over the company's FY17 revenues of $788.3 million, which also grew just 7.9% y/y from $730.98 million in FY16. The midpoint of Blackbaud's prior guidance range, on the other hand, would have implied 12% y/y revenue growth, which at least crossed the psychologically important double-digit growth mark.Figure 2. Blackbaud historical revenuesSource: Blackbaud 2017 10-KNote also that Blackbaud's latest revenue guidance represents a serious deceleration in the back half of this year. The company generated $417.8 million in Q1 and Q2, so the midpoint FY18 guidance of $849 million represents $431.2 million of revenues in Q3 and Q4 - which is just 4.8% y/y growth against 2H17 revenues of $411.6 million.The company's latest EPS range of $2.46-$2.52 (down 12% at the midpoint) also represents just 15% EPS growth over last year's EPS of $2.17, no better than the broader S&P 500 (so why pay a premium P/E multiple?) and almost all of it due to tax reform.Perhaps more than any other company, Blackbaud's deterioration in growth raises serious questions about the company having fully penetrated its addressable market. For a smaller SaaS company that's about to go public, with ~$150-$250 million in revenues, a small and well-defined niche is a great thing. It reduces competitive chatter and helps the company paint the picture that it's truly an expert. But as a company that is at a ~$900 million annual revenue run rate, it seems that Blackbaud has long outgrown its niche.In its second quarter release, Blackbaud grew revenues at 11.5% y/y. That's slated to get sliced down to under ~5% y/y, according to the latest guidance picture. As much as the company claims the causes of the guidance cut are ""one-time events"", the sequential deceleration looks more or less symptomatic of a company that has reached a saturation point.Thus far in its life (note the company was founded more than 30 years ago, in 1981), Blackbaud has largely stuck to one major product segment. Contrast that to Oracle, which is only four years Blackbaud's senior but has a software solution for just about every use-case imaginable. Blackbaud, on the other hand, has clung very tightly to its roots and resisted pivoting. Sure, the company has CRM, ERP, and a variety of other solutions - but they are all geared at a very limited market.Perhaps the most progress Blackbaud has made in recent times is its announcement of a new Church Management System, targeted toward religious institutions and the management of tithes. It's unclear how much incremental revenues this extension will bring in - but the product itself won't be generally available until sometime in 2019, so it can't help this year's growth rates.The main point here - the biggest risk in Blackbaud is that it simply has nowhere else to go. Until we see the company pick up its pace of innovation, single-digit growth will more likely than not be the new norm.One other important point to make is that, even despite the company's tumble, it's still not exactly a cheap stock. As shown in the chart below, Blackbaud is still trading at a 5.7x forward revenue multiple and a 28.4x forward P/E. Yes, that's lower than at any other point this year - but still not low enough.BLKB EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsOn a P/E basis, Blackbaud is still enjoying a ~10-point premium to the roughly ~18x forward multiple of the S&P 500 - this is despite the fact that its new revenue growth pace of ~5% and EPS growth pace of ~15% are hardly much better than the broader market. I'd much rather, for example, pay a slight premium and invest instead in Red Hat, which is still growing revenues in the mid-to-high teens:RHT EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThe post-guidance slide is a strong indicator that Blackbaud will underperform the markets for quite some time. Don't hold out hope for a rebound in this stock - it has neither the product innovation nor the sales execution/cloud transition to support a return to growth. There are far better downtrodden SaaS companies to invest in at this juncture, especially with the NASDAQ now down ~5% from highs."
4203796,103480,2018-09-03T22:56:02-04:00,"Blackbaud, a software platform dedicated to non-profits and government agencies, continued its recent trend of strong earnings performance.Despite slightly missing Wall Street's expectations, Blackbaud achieved a slight acceleration in revenue growth and GAAP EPS growth.Recurring revenues also saw strong 16% y/y growth, making up a larger percentage of the company's revenue mix.Still, a 6.3x forward revenue multiple and a 38x P/E multiple for a company with only so-so growth potential limits Blackbaud's upside.","Blackbaud (NASDAQ:BLKB) has always been a unique play within the software sector. For one, there's its interesting niche: enterprise software for the non-profit sector and various other public sector/educational clients. One would think that this is a very limited niche that wouldn't go very far, but Blackbaud has proven the market wrong - its revenue guidance for the current year sits at just under $900 million, making it one of the largest SaaS companies in the market. Clearly, non-profits need specialized software to manage their donations and keep track of their constituents.The company, however, seems to be reaching the end of its growth rope. Blackbaud saw accelerating growth this quarter, but not much - with the top line expanding at just 11.5% y/y, it's hard to say this company is still exciting, at least relative to other Silicon Valley companies that are seeing 30-40% y/y growth each quarter. As it's dealing with low revenue growth, the company has made the wise decision of focusing more on recurring revenue growth and on subscription revenues. This has worked to some degree - for each of the past several quarters, Blackbaud has seen its recurring revenue growth outstrip total revenue growth, leading to a higher mix of subscriptions.Still, however, it's hard to make a software stalwart like this ""new"" again. It will be difficult for Blackbaud to attain the high-flying valuation multiples of the rest of its SaaS peers given its growth deficiency, but at the moment, its valuation already seems rich.Despite good results in both Q1 and Q2, the company has only traded about flat since the end of Q1. I had surmised then that valuation would cap Blackbaud's upside; with the stock barely having moved since then, the story is still pretty much the same.BLKB data by YChartsA 6.3x forward revenue multiple is a fair price for any SaaS stock, but Blackbaud's lack of growth makes that valuation seem expensive. Its true hope lies on the EPS front - Blackbaud's 38x forward P/E might cruise into a more digestible multiple if it can continue its pace of 35-40% EPS growth.At the moment, however, in the absence of any major strategic changes or growth drivers for the company beyond executing on its current shift-to-subscription plan, I believe Blackbaud will be hard-pressed to continue the rally it enjoyed earlier this year. Sideways trading on this stock is likely to continue, especially if the market heads into a downturn and investors rotate from growth stocks into value names. Though Blackbaud is hardly a growth stock anymore, its ~40x P/E doesn't qualify it as a value name, either - which is why its lack of clean appeal for either the growth or value camp will limit its prospects. At best, Blackbaud remains a Hold.Here's a look at the company's latest quarterly results:Figure 1. Blackbaud 2Q18 resultsSource: Blackbaud Investor RelationsTotal revenues grew 11.5% y/y to $213.7 million, missing Wall Street's expectations for $213.4 million (+11.4% y/y) by a hair. Note, however, that Blackbaud was able to accelerate revenue growth by 120bps from last quarter's 10.3% y/y growth rate. When a company of Blackbaud's scale is able to accelerate growth at any rate, it should be treated as an achievement.Blackbaud has pinned some of its growth hopes on a new Church Management System designed specifically for religious institutions. Here's some further commentary from Michael Gianoni, company CEO, on the new module's capabilities:The Church Management offering is only available in an ""Early Adopter"" program for now; the full module will be generally available sometime next year. Still, despite Blackbaud's additional offerings from time to time, the company has largely been unable to stimulate growth beyond the low teens. Recurring revenues grew 15.8% y/y to $192.7 million, but at this point, a large portion of Blackbaud's revenue base has already shifted into recurring (90% of revenues this quarter, 3 percentage points higher than 2Q17), and the tailwinds from that effort will soon fade as it nears completion.On the profitability front, Blackbaud continued to deliver strength. Gross margins improved 100bps from the year-ago quarter, a function of management's decision to lower its reliance on one-time services, which carry a lower margin than software revenues. Pro forma operating income hit $45.2 million, representing a 21.1% pro forma operating margin - about flat to 2Q17's 21.0% operating margin. The company noted that it will still fall within its full-year guidance of 20.5-21.0% operating margins.Pro forma net income, meanwhile, jumped 29% y/y to $33.0 million, and pro forma EPS of $0.69 marginally beat out Wall Street's expectations of $0.67. It's worth noting that while ~30% EPS growth is impressive, in the context of a 38x forward P/E, it's more or less expected. Looking at Blackbaud's valuation on a PEG basis (P/E ratio divided by EPS growth rate) would yield a PEG ratio of 1.3x, a classic indicator of an overvalued stock (a ratio <1.0x is considered undervalued).The company's free cash flow results also left a lot to be desired, with FCF in the first half of FY18 growing just 15% y/y (though it's better than Q1's FCF, which was negative y/y):Figure 2. Blackbaud FCFSource: Blackbaud Investor RelationsAll considered, I don't find any compelling reasons to buy Blackbaud stock. The company is making a large push at expanding the ceiling of its TAM (total addressable market) by going after churches and religious organizations, but with the outcome of these efforts not fully visible until sometime next year when Church Management goes live, there is no near-term signal that Blackbaud can revive its growth.In my view, Blackbaud's exclusion from being either a growth stock or a value stock will limit its ability to rally much higher. At 6.3x forward revenues and a 38x forward P/E ratio, its valuation has already hit a near-term ceiling. Stay on the sidelines on this name."

The company says that its software 'has helped fundraising leaders across the country predict their best donors and uncover a gold mine of hidden prospects within their own databases.'Management is headed by founder and CEO Andy Reeher, who was previously VP Marketing at Deluxe Corporation and a consultant at the Core Group.Below is an overview video of Reeher's approach:(Source: Reeher Videos)Reeher's primary offerings include:According to a 2016 research report on donor management systems, the top services have relatively little in the way of feature differentiation. The market is fairly crowded, and customers have a wide range of choices between software suites.However, institutions are in greater need of maximizing their donor relationships due to increased competition for students, endowment, amenities, along with increased operating costs.Furthermore, while 20% of contributions are given online, 80% is still provided offline... the old-fashioned way. So, organizations are continuing to maximize their efficiency within limited budgets.Major competitive vendors that provide fundraising software include:The market contains numerous other vendors providing a range of functionalities at varying price points.Blackbaud disclosed the $43 million acquisition price via an 8-K filing but did not disclose other terms, nor did it provide a change in financial guidance.BLKB did say the transaction was 'funded primarily through borrowings under the Company's senior secured credit facility.'The company's debt as of December 31, 2017, stood at $429.6 million and cash and equivalents were $29.8 million.Given Blackbaud's credit facility limit of $700 million, the firm appears to have ample resources to have accomplished this transaction.Blackbaud acquired Reeher to bolster its benchmarking capabilities for internal team performance assessment.As the firm stated in the deal announcement,For the time being, Reeher will continue to operate as a standalone entity serving the higher education market.Blackbaud also has plans to integrate Reeher's internal benchmarking technology into its offerings to bring its internal benchmarking and assessment capabilities to its other markets, consistent with its social good focus.BLKB's stock dropped over 4% on the May 1 announcement but, later in the day, rebounded as the chart below indicates:(Source: Seeking Alpha)It seems investors were not overly impressed with the announcement, although the deal is a relatively small one for the firm, so I suspect it won't have a material effect on the stock over the longer term.This was a tuck-in transaction and indicates management's intention to bolster its offerings as it continues to expand its efforts to secure non-profit management software dollars in a competitive marketplace.Differentiation is key, and the deal makes sense from a strategic viewpoint. Blackbaud is using the rise in its stock price over the past several years to acquire capabilities with minimum integration risk and delay."
4216059,103480,2018-10-30T16:00:04-04:00,"Blackbaud reported Q3 results, beating Wall Street's revenue and EPS figures.The beat is likely resulting from the fact that Blackbaud cut guidance earlier in October, not due to a performance bump.In fact, Blackbaud's revenue growth fell into the single digits this quarter, decelerating four points from last quarter's growth. Organic revenue growth was also essentially flat at just 1% y/y.New product initiatives and a cloud transition continue to be speed bumps for Blackbaud.Because Blackbaud is no longer growing, we have to view the company's valuation from an earnings basis. At a ~30x forward P/E, Blackbaud is grossly overvalued relative to its prospects.","Blackbaud (BLKB), the legacy maker of software for non-profits and charities, is a perfect example of a tumbling tech stock that actually needed a serious correction. The company's gains over the past few years have been formed on a foundation of air: the company is no longer growing, new products are falling flat, and instead of using the growth slowdown to boost profits, Blackbaud's profit margins are actually shrinking. The company is touting its shift toward recurring revenues and a cloud-based billings model, but so far, we haven't seen any positive impacts to the company's results.Last quarter, Blackbaud announced a new offering for religious institutions called the Church Management system, which is expected to fully go live next year. Management noted in last quarter's earnings call that this product positions Blackbaud to ""deliver innovation in a market that's predominantly legacy point solutions software"". This growth, however, isn't coming quickly enough. Apart from this product, the company has made very few strides in expanding its addressable market. As evidenced by its deterioration into a single-digit growth rate, Blackbaud has quickly hit its saturation point, which even the new Church Management product may not be able to fix.Blackbaud just released Q3 results, and despite the slight recovery in Blackbaud's stock in after-hours trading, the company's performance is no better than before. Its beat to Wall Street expectations likely stems from the fact that Blackbaud guided down in October, warning that cloud transition issues and a revenue slowdown in the UK would impact its full-year revenue achievement.Like most tech stocks, Blackbaud is down heavily from its all-time highs - a decline that hastened after the company slashed its full-year guidance by ~4% on the top line. In July, Blackbaud hit a high of $120, and it's currently trading 45% below that. But unlike other tech stocks, I believe it will take much longer - if ever - for Blackbaud to reclaim these highs.BLKB data by YChartsHere's my thesis on the stock: because this company is no longer growing (8% top line growth makes Blackbaud no better than commodity or retail stocks), we can no longer really classify Blackbaud as a tech stock. Against technology and software peers, Blackbaud's valuation - at a ~28x forward P/E ratio and a 4.6x forward revenue multiple - appears cheap. Strip aside tech comps, however, and this is a terrible valuation to enter a long position at. The meager growth that Blackbaud does manage to post is inorganic (i.e., sourced from acquisitions). Net out the contributions from acquired companies, and Blackbaud's revenue growth is actually about flat. On the bottom-line front, Blackbaud has generated EPS of $0.75 in the year-to-date period. That's actually down from $0.79 versus the prior-year compare. Next year in FY19, analysts have a consensus pro forma EPS estimate of $2.71 - which is only 9% higher than $2.49 for FY18 (per Yahoo Finance).Why, then, should investors be willing to pay a 28x forward P/E ratio for a company whose earnings growth is either flat or below market? In my view, most of the October tech pullback was driven by overreaction and fear, but in Blackbaud's case, it's a long-overdue right-sizing of its valuation.The bottom line on Blackbaud: Don't bank on this stock to make a rebound. Stocks rally when either its valuation multiple expands or its earnings/revenue improve (in other words, either the ""P"" or the ""E"" part of the P/E ratio needs to rise). For Blackbaud, neither scenario seems likely: investors aren't to keen on paying premium multiples for a slow-growth stock, and Blackbaud's recent performance suggests that the sluggishness will persist.Here's a look at Blackbaud's full Q3 results:Figure 1. Blackbaud 3Q18 resultsSource: Blackbaud investor relationsRevenues grew at just 7.8% y/y to $209.5 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $205.5 million (+5.7% y/y) by about two points. Still, this represents a sharp three-point deceleration from 11.5% y/y growth last quarter. Note also that, as previously mentioned, much of this revenue growth was non-organic. Thankfully, Blackbaud discloses its mix of organic versus non-organic revenues, unlike most technology companies. This breakout is presented in the chart below:Figure 2. Blackbaud organic revenue growthSource: Blackbaud investor relationsExcluding the impact of companies Blackbaud acquired in the past year, revenue growth would have been just 1.2% y/y, or essentially flat. Blackbaud's core flagship businesses aren't accruing more revenues - what this tells us is that Blackbaud is neither acquiring net new clients nor upselling to its current installed base. Blackbaud's organic growth rate, in fact, is among the most disappointing in the SaaS sector.Recurring revenues are doing a little bit better, with ~5% y/y organic growth. Still, however, 5% growth isn't exactly enough to get investors excited about Blackbaud.As disappointing as revenues were this quarter, the bottom line probably fared even worse, with margin contraction across the board:Figure 3. Blackbaud margin trendsSource: Blackbaud investor relationsAs can be seen in the chart above, Blackbaud's gross margin pulled back 70bps to 54.5%. Blackbaud already suffers from one of the lowest gross margin profiles in the software industry, paling in comparison to peers at 70-80% gross margins. Making matters worse, Blackbaud also saw a 200bps contraction in operating margins to 7.5%, down from 9.5% in the year-ago quarter. The biggest culprit, aside from the gross margin contraction, is a jump and sales and marketing spend relative to revenue growth. Sales and marketing expenditure grew 15% y/y to $49.1 million, far faster than the ~8% y/y revenue growth that Blackbaud was able to produce. As software companies get larger, we typically expect sales and marketing expenses to go down as a percentage of revenues, not the other way around.As a result, net income in the quarter slid -13% y/y to $11.8 million (again, making us wonder why this company should deserve to trade at a premium P/E ratio when earnings are in decline). In addition, free cash flow for the first nine months of the year are also about flat to last year, while FCF margins of 15.7% are also down 80bps from 16.5% in the year-ago quarter:Figure 4. Blackbaud YTD FCFSource: Blackbaud investor relationsDecelerating revenue growth, contracting margins and earnings, and an unclear product strategy are obvious red flags working against this company's favor. Its guidance revision earlier this month correctly anticipated a major deterioration in performance, and the stock fully deserved the ~45% correction since July. Unlike other tech stocks, Blackbaud is unlikely to make a full recovery. Continue to avoid this stock - there are far better downtrodden software names to buy in the hopes of a rebound (names I particularly like at the moment are Docusign (DOCU), Box (BOX), Cloudera (CLDR), and Mimecast (MIME))."
4145300,103480,2018-02-09T15:31:43-05:00,"Blackbaud, the CRM software company dedicated specifically for non-profits and charitable organizations, has ramped up its profitability in FY17.In addition to beating analysts' top-line estimates in its Q4 earnings release, Blackbaud delivered ~50% net income growth in FY17.The company's revenue base is almost entirely recurring, putting a solid foundation underneath its earning.With a market-leading product for a tough-to-crack vertical niche, as well as ramping profitability, Blackbaud is also an extremely viable acquisition target.","Blackbaud (NASDAQ: BLKB), the non-profit centric CRM software company, is a perfect illustration of the benefits of a subscription-based model and recurring revenues. The company has long passed its growth phase and is now experiencing milder growth in the ~10% range (far below other SaaS peers that typically grow at 25-30% or more), but has begun to show its chops on the profit growth and free cash flow front.The tech industry - and Silicon Valley's software startup scene - often get a bad rap for being money-losing beasts. Even the largest pure-play SaaS company, Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), frequently gets lambasted by investors for its optically absurd P/E ratio (above 100); despite strong underlying cash flow built atop growing recurring revenues, investors still ask: where is the profit? Blackbaud, in 2017, has transitioned exactly to the profit-printing phase that investors want to see. Its 70%-plus mix of subscription revenues (and 80% mix of total recurring revenues) provides a strong foundation for repeat business on highly profitable contracts; regardless of its modest growth rate, Blackbaud's improvements in operational efficiency combined with safely contracted revenues speaks volumes for profit growth.The company's position certainly is ironic - it sells sales and fundraising software primarily for non-profit entities; yet Blackbaud itself has shown itself to be immensely profitable in its own right. While its high forward P/E ratio doesn't quite make it a value stock, it's in a strong position to deliver above-average earnings growth in the mid-to-long term. With a ~33x forward P/E and 6x forward revenue valuation (as shown below), Blackbaud isn't terribly expensive, either:BLKB PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsMore and more, Blackbaud is availing itself as a possible acquisition target. Certainly the software sector isn't short of opportunities for organic growth - most SaaS companies are growing at 30% or above just fine on their own, with underlying IT spending on software expected to accelerate in FY18 (according to industry analyst Gartner). But the larger SaaS companies - and software companies that are trying to pivot more toward SaaS, like Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) - are struggling to keep up with the growth rates of their smaller, lithe competitors, and are turning frequently to M&A to backfill some of their growth. Oracle in particular has been quite aggressive in acquiring best-of-breed vertical software vendors to gain access to new vertical markets. The company recently bought a construction software company, Aconex, for $1.2 billion to speed up its business with real estate developers and builders. Even Salesforce - whose consistent double-digit growth over the past decade has vaulted it to become the fourth-largest U.S. software company - is beginning to see deceleration in its flagship Sales Cloud hurt its growth rates. For either of these companies - or any of the larger software companies that are looking for ways to stay fresh - acquiring a vertical software vendor like Blackbaud would make perfect sense.Blackbaud, after all, is rare among software companies in that it actually generates profit - the core thesis behind this article. It becomes much easier to justify an expensive acquisition when the target will actually contribute to the bottom line, which is not a common feature in Silicon Valley dealmaking. Unsurprisingly, Blackbaud took a bit of a hit in February along with the rest of the tech sector and the broader market. Yet underlying fundamentals remains strong an its Q4 results show stable growth in its recurring revenue streams while delivering over-the-top profit and cash flow growth. Patient investors can reap outsized app reaction from Blackbaud for many years to come. Also notable is the fact that Blackbaud, along with its Q4 earnings, published an update to its 2018 TAM to $8-plus billion, up from a prior view of $6.7 billion. Based on the company's forward revenue guidance of $870-$890 million, it has only penetrated a small slice of this market, giving it huge potential as a standalone company as well.Here's a look at Blackbaud's results for Q4 and the full year, taken from the company's 8-K filing:Figure 1. Blackbaud Q4 resultsSource: Blackbaud 8-K filingRevenues grew 9.4% y/y to $217.0 million in the quarter. Again, Blackbaud's growth is not anything to write home about relative to other SaaS peers, but it's clear that the company has reached an impressive scale nearing a $1 billion run rate, most of which is recurring. Total revenues beat analyst expectations by $1.2 million, a respectable beat for a company with single-digit growth and a more or less predictable pattern of results.What is important to highlight, however, is that subscription revenues - Blackbaud's largest and most valuable stream of revenues - grew 24% y/y to $151.9 million, offsetting declines in services and maintenance revenues. In truth, because Blackbaud's subscription revenues carry the highest gross margin, the mix shift into subscriptions and the decline of the other revenue streams is actually a long-term benefit for Blackbaud's bottom line. Subscriptions represented 70% of total revenues this quarter, up from 62% in the prior year Q4.Also important to note is the fact that at $150-plus million in quarterly revenues, Blackbaud's subscription revenue stream alone is larger in a single quarter than most other high-growth SaaS companies' full years. Blackbaud's slower growth must always be taken in the context of its huge scale - very few software companies ever scale to the $1 billion mark before being scooped up by a larger player or a financial sponsor (recent examples of this would be names like Qlik, acquired by Thoma Bravo; or Netsuite, acquired by Oracle). As previously mentioned, Blackbaud's profitability growth for the full year has been particularly impressive (though it's also been helped by a one-time tax benefit stemming from the accounting adjustments related to the Trump tax bill). Full-year GAAP profits hit $65.9 million in FY17, up 59% y/y. Q4 pro forma EPS also beat analyst expectations by a penny.Blackbaud also delivered on the cash flow front, with both OCF and FCF exceeding its net income. Blackbaud's operating cash flows in FY17 grew 15% y/y to $176.3 million. Netting out $10.2 million of capex, the company generated $161.1 million in free cash flow, a sizable 20% margin of revenues and up 19% y/y. With robust growth in both net income and free cash flow that exceeded revenue growth, Blackbaud is a subtle reminder to tech investors that not all software companies are all about growth - at their more mature phases, companies like Blackbaud can turn their focus to minting huge profit margins.Guidance was equally robust, as shown in the summary below:Figure 2. Blackbaud FY18 guidanceSource: Blackbaud investor relationsThe company is pointing to revenue growth accelerating to 11% y/y, up from the 9.4% growth Blackbaud saw this quarter. Growth will be accompanied by further margin improvements and 30% and 23% y/y growth in earnings and FCF, respectively.Blackbaud continues to show investors what a lean, mature software company can deliver on the earnings front. With healthy profit and cash flow margins, a specialized suite of software products that addresses a highly desirable end-market, and a base of nearly all recurring revenues, everything about Blackbaud is appealing to a potential buyer - yet the company has enough merits to stand on its own as well.With the company relatively under penetrated in its addressable market (relying upon its $8 billion TAM estimate), and the fact that many non-profits remain paper-based and have yet to invest entirely in software and cloud solutions, Blackbaud certainly has a tailwind at its back to justify its projection of slight revenue acceleration in FY18. Investors would be wise to pick up on this company's advantages and buy it on the pullback."
4167933,103480,2018-05-01T09:11:39-04:00,"Blackbaud beat estimates with its Q1 results, showing growth that clung above 10% y/y for yet another quarter.Most impressively, the company generated 35% y/y net income growth, distinguishing itself as one of the few profitable companies in enterprise software. Free cash flow, however, turned negative.Blackbaud remains a strong performer in its niche, but in the absence of meaningful growth, its valuation multiples seem elevated.The company is at best a hold.","Blackbaud (BLKB), the enterprise software platform for managing charitable donations and running a non-profit organization, reported Q1 results that, in the heat of earnings season, got more or less overlooked. At a very high level, the company was in line with consensus expectations calling for 10% y/y revenue growth, but showed 10% upside to Wall Street's profit targets.Profitability has long been the mainstay of Blackbaud's investment thesis, as one of the few enterprise software companies at its scale to generate positive GAAP net income. Companies at the ultra-large spectrum of the software sector - like Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT) - obviously generate truckloads of cash, but it's difficult for small and mid-cap software firms to do so, primarily because of their focus on growth. Even Salesforce (CRM), the CRM giant that has reached a >$10 billion annual run rate, still only posts the occasional profitable quarter, like Amazon (AMZN). The focus is not on the bottom line.Blackbaud, however, showed 35% y/y net income growth this quarter, shining above its mid-cap software peers that are still dipping in red ink. Investors do have to ask themselves, though: is Blackbaud worth its premium valuation, even if it's profitable? Are there better profitable companies to choose from?For certain, Blackbaud has carved out tremendous strength in its niche of serving CRM and ERP capabilities to non-profits. The non-profit vertical is an extremely difficult market segment to capture, as these organizations have many specialized needs that make Salesforce's Sales Cloud, for example, unsuitable as their primary CRM. But with Blackbaud's growth slowing down to the single digits (the quarter will come soon when Blackbaud's y/y growth slips below the psychologically important 10% threshold), it's difficult to justify a growth-style valuation for this company.At best, Blackbaud is a hold, especially as the stock has rallied 11% year to date and beat most of its SaaS peers' performance thus far. Relative to its valuation, Blackbaud's financials are nothing extraordinary, and will likely be that way for quite some time.BLKB data by YChartsLet's run a quick check on Blackbaud's valuation to see where the company is trading against this year's guidance. At its current share price of $105, Blackbaud carries a market cap of $5.07 billion.The company also has $25.0 million of cash on its balance sheet and $467.2 million of debt, so the company's all-in enterprise value is currently $5.51 billion.Blackbaud has also currently guided to the following for FY18:None of these growth rates are particularly impressive. EPS growth of 30% is decent, but some of that is also fueled by buyback activity (though Blackbaud's buyback program isn't as aggressive as some other companies'). The company's zero-growth FCF scenario is also a little bit disappointing, and even that may be difficult to achieve, given that FCF saw compression in Q1 - we don't know if this trend is likely to continue into the following few quarters.Against its own guidance ranges, Blackbaud currently trades at:I was fine being long on Blackbaud when shares were in the high $80s/low $90s, but since then, the stock's rally has made Blackbaud's valuation untenable. A >6x revenue multiple is absurd for a company with only 10% revenue growth; likewise, >30x FCF is too expensive for a company expected to achieve flat FCF growth this year. The only metric in which Blackbaud might seem like a plausible buy is P/E, but on that front, Blackbaud's 37.3x P/E is still on a pro forma EPS basis (GAAP would put the company at a much worse ratio), and on a growth rate of 30%, Blackbaud's PEG ratio would still exceed 1.0x - a textbook definition of an overvalued company.Here's a look as well at Blackbaud's Q1 results. Altogether, while there were no red flags in Blackbaud's release, it certainly isn't exciting enough to make paying for Blackbaud's premium valuation multiple worth it.Figure 1. Blackbaud Q1 resultsSource: Blackbaud 8-K filing to the SECTotal revenues grew 10% y/y to $204.2 million, mirroring the growth rate Blackbaud saw last quarter. Subscription/recurring revenues showed a bit more strength, with 13% y/y growth in the quarter, but analysts were largely expecting it. Blackbaud's revenues were essentially in line with consensus expectations, causing no excitement on that front.It's also important to note that Blackbaud drove some of this growth through acquisitions. On an organic basis, Blackbaud reports that it saw just 5.3% and 7.2% total and recurring revenue growth, respectively. Given the fact that Blackbaud is running thin on cash ($25 million left on the balance sheet) and is already heavily drawn on its credit facilities, it's unclear whether the company can afford to continue fueling acquisition-driven growth.Blackbaud did manage an increase in its gross margins to 56.9% in the quarter, up 310 bps from 53.8% in 1Q17. It's important to note, however, that Blackbaud's gross margin is relatively poor compared to other CRM and ERP companies. Regardless of Blackbaud's niche, its software delivery method and business model should be roughly similar to other SaaS companies, yet its gross margin calls into question the logic of paying an elevated (>6x forward revenues) valuation multiple for the stock.The company's expensive discipline allowed the company to achieve earnings growth - as previously mentioned, net income grew 35% y/y in the quarter to $17.8 million. Pro forma EPS of $0.66 showed a 10% upside surprise to Wall Street's estimates for $0.60.The one truly glaring slip-up in the quarter, however, was Blackbaud's reversal into negative FCF. This was driven both by a pickup in capex as well as a contraction in operating cash flows. FCF slipped to -$1.1 million, a harsh swing from a profit of $3.5 million in 1Q17. Seeing as Blackbaud is already forecasting flat-to-no growth in FCF this year, the company has removed one of the biggest reasons for being bullish on the name:Figure 2. Blackbaud FCFSource: Blackbaud investor relationsIf you've been lucky enough to hold Blackbaud through most of last year's rally, now might be a good time to consider locking in gains. The company remains a solid, entrenched SaaS company within its niche, but I fear its lack of growth opportunities will severely limit Blackbaud's ability to expand its profits and free cash flow in the future. FCF has already started seeing a slowdown both in Q1 results and in implied FY18 guidance, so it's only natural that earnings growth may soon taper off as well.The market has no shortage of high-quality, profitable software names - Microsoft, Oracle, and Adobe (ADBE) are some good examples. Blackbaud's valuation, on the other hand, aggressively overestimates a company with a limited TAM and with hamstrung future growth opportunities. Though I've previously been supportive of the stock, at current valuations, I'd rather place my bets elsewhere."
3966690,24157,2016-04-20T15:35:06-04:00,"Blackbaud has exhibited impressive revenue growth but such growth is meaningless without profits to show for it.Lack of profits is nothing new either, and margins have only gotten worse over the long-term.Worst of all, BLKB's current valuation implies it will generate more revenue than its entire addressable market.","Providing software to nonprofits, education institutions, and foundations is certainly a noble business cause. But, as a for-profit business and publicly-traded stock, this company's investors are still expecting profits. Instead, they are getting misleading non-GAAP metrics that enable executives to earn large profits. Our call on Valeant (VRX) showed how dangerous it is to trust non-GAAP earnings because they cannot be used to cover true cash costs. For these reasons and more, Blackbaud Inc. (NASDAQ:BLKB) lands in the Danger Zone this week.Revenue Growth Is Meaningless Without ProfitsOver the past decade, Blackbaud has grown revenue at an impressive rate of 14% compounded annually. Despite strong revenue growth, Blackbaud's economic earnings, the true cash flows, have declined from $30 million in 2005 to -$200,000 in 2015, as can be seen in Figure 1. See a reconciliation of Blackbaud's GAAP net income to economic earnings here.Figure 1: The Discrepancy Between Revenue & Economic ProfitSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsThe decline in economic earnings coincides with Blackbaud's return on invested capital (ROIC). Since 2007, Blackbaud's ROIC has declined from 123% to 7% over the last twelve months. What was once a highly profitable business is no longer. Blackbaud's numerous acquisitions over the years, including Convio, MicroEdge, Smart Tuition, and Everyday Hero, have been nothing but a drag on profits, despite the additional revenue brought in.In addition to declining ROIC, which showcases Blackbaud's inefficient management of capital, the company's margins have been in a long-term decline. Since 2005, BLKB's after-tax profit (NOPAT) margins have declined from 18% to 7% over the last twelve months, as can be seen in Figure 2.Figure 2: Blackbaud Margins In Long-Term DeclineSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsNon-GAAP Metrics Mislead Investors and Misalign Executive IncentivesThe dangers of non-GAAP metrics have been made clear, yet companies still use them to ""better represent business operations."" How can a company better represent operations by removing a significant amount of operating costs? Below are the non-GAAP metrics that Blackbaud uses:In 2015, Blackbaud's non-GAAP operating income was 161% higher than GAAP operating income, and its non-GAAP net income was 171% higher than GAAP net income.The use of non-GAAP metrics has proliferated throughout the company's stated strategic goals. Blackbaud stated in 2014 as part of its five point growth strategy that it wanted to improve non-GAAP operating margins by 3-6 percentage points by 2017. However, as Figure 2 shows, NOPAT margins have only worsened. Even worse, executives are incentivized through non-GAAP metrics, an issue we've touched on before, and cover in more detail later in this report.Low Profitability Threatens BLKBBlackbaud operates in a niche market, one that focuses solely on nonprofit organizations. However, this niche market does not mean they are without competition. The declining trend in ROIC noted above does not bode well for the future. Blackbaud recognizes that it faces competition from software developers who provide customized nonprofit solutions, general customer relationship management developers like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), and large international organizations like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Each of these firms offers products for nonprofit companies. With a 7% ROIC, Blackbaud only bests CRM in terms of profitability, which is no great feat, as CRM has previously been placed in the Danger Zone. Figure 3 has more details.Figure 3: Comparing Blackbaud's ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsUnprofitable Market Stymies Bull HopesAs often is the case with software and cloud providers, bulls often tout scalability, recurring revenue, market share, or some other metric as reasons the company is poised to succeed. However, none of these metrics will matter if the market itself is unprofitable. Based on the data above, there is a clear trend that growing within the nonprofit sector has been detrimental to Blackbaud's business. Perhaps, there is a reason that Blackbaud is known as a leader in this niche market, as larger, more profitable competition has deemed its profitability prospects too low to devote time and resources.Adding trouble to bull arguments, BLKB's current valuation implies the company will achieve revenue nearly 150% higher than the all current revenue from Blackbaud's stated addressable market, which the company estimates at $6.3 billion. Read below to see how the stock's current valuation implies BLKB will generate over $9 billion in revenue.Acquisition Hopes Are Not Justification For ValuationWith Blackbaud operating in a niche market, and larger competitors possessing ample cash resources, it would seem likely that if a larger competitor wants to expand into this market, it would look to acquire BLKD or similar smaller competition. However, Blackbaud is not as attractive an acquisition target as many think.First, Blackbaud has large (hidden) liabilities that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers would initially suggest.After adjusting for these hidden liabilities, we can model a scenario in which Oracle purchases BLKD, something we would advise against per our Open Letter to Larry Ellison. Nevertheless, modeling different scenarios allows us to show you just how expensive BLKB is.Second, after we analyze how much the business might be worth to a potential suitor, we see that, even in the absolute best-case scenario, the stock is worth less, not more, than where it trades today.Figures 4-6 show the implied stock prices that Oracle should pay for BLKB to achieve different ""Goal ROICs"" assuming different levels of profit margins. There are limits on how much Oracle should pay to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or cash flows being acquired. For each scenario, we show the maximum price Oracle can pay and still achieve the ""goal ROICs"".Figure 4: Implied Acquisition Prices For Oracle To Achieve 7% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.The first ""goal ROIC"" is Oracle's WACC or 7%. Figure 4 shows the acquisition stock prices implied by different margin levels for Blackbaud post acquisition. While we think it is highly unlikely that Blackbaud's business would ever earn the same high margin as Oracle's existing business, we include it in our analysis to show the best case scenario. At 7% ROIC, this deal would be ""value neutral"", as the ROIC earned on the deal would equal Oracle's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Even in this ""best case scenario"", the most Oracle should pay is $52/share (16% downside).Figure 5: Implied Acquisition Prices For Oracle To Achieve 19% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 5 shows the second ""goal ROIC"" of 19%, which is the roughly ROIC implied by Oracle at $36/share, the price of the stock when we wrote our ""Open Letter to Larry Ellison"". In order to achieve a 19% ROIC, the most Oracle should pay is $12/share, and only if management is confident BLKB can immediately achieve Oracle's 28% NOPAT margin upon acquisition.Figure 6: Implied Acquisition Prices For Oracle To Achieve 23% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 6 shows the last ""goal ROIC"" of 23%, which is Oracle's current ROIC. Any deal that doesn't earn a return of 23% or above is bad for shareholders as it signals to the market that Oracle's ROIC will continue its decline. Assuming management no longer wants to drive down its ROIC, the most Oracle should pay for BLKB is $8/share (87% downside). This purchase price assumes BLKB can immediately achieve Oracle's 28% NOPAT margin. Any other margin scenario results in a negative implied stock price, which means, there is no positive value Oracle could pay, when including liabilities, that would earn a 23% ROIC.In each of the scenarios above, there are implications to Oracle's stock price. If Oracle aims to earn a 19% ROIC, which is the current ROIC implied by $36/share, investors can expect the stock to settle around $36/share. However, if management completes an acquisition that only earns a 7% ROIC, ORCL investors should expect significant downside. For more information, see the model in our Open Letter to Larry Ellison.Organic Growth Can't Justify Valuation EitherTo justify its current stock price ($62/share) via organic growth, Blackbaud must grow NOPAT by 21% compounded annually for the next 15 years. To put this scenario into perspective, based on current margin estimates, the company would be generating $9.8 billion in revenue 15 years from now, which is slightly greater than MasterCard's (NYSE:MA) fiscal 2016 revenue and $3 billion greater than salesforce.com's fiscal 2015 revenue. It is also greater than the current addressable market ($6.3 billion).In a more realistic scenario, where Blackbaud can grow NOPAT by 11% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth only $11/share today - an 82% downside.Failure to Reach ""Goals"" Could Sink BLKBBlackbaud laid out its plan for growth in pretty clear terms. Any failure to reach these goals could result in shares falling back to reality. One caveat is that if management is able to continue misleading investors with non-GAAP metrics, the moment of reckoning could take longer. Three of Blackbaud's keys to growth strategy are below:Given the past decade of operational deterioration, it seems unlikely that BLKB can meet these goals and the high expectations baked into the stock price.Insider Sales and Short Interest Remain LowOver the past 12 months 486,000 shares have been purchased and 138,000 shares have been sold for a net effect of 348,000 insider shares purchased. These purchases represent <1% of shares outstanding. Additionally, there are 2.3 million shares sold short, or just over 5% of shares outstanding.Executive Compensation Focuses On Wrong MetricsBlackbaud executives receive annual cash bonuses and equity awards for meeting business performance goals. Cash bonuses are awarded for meeting ""adjusted revenue"" and ""adjusted EBIT,"" which is another term for the company's non-GAAP operating income. Executives are incentivized to grow revenue by any means, such as acquisition, and then can achieve performance goal #2 by removing common costs, such as acquisition costs, stock based compensation charges, and integration costs. Similarly, executives receive equity awards for achieving ""adjusted revenue"" and ""adjusted EBIT as a percentage of adjusted revenue."" Misaligned executive compensation poses significant risks to Blackbaud's investors. We would much prefer executive compensation be based upon ROIC, which has a clear correlation between ROIC and shareholder value.Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic AccountingIn order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and a real shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to Blackbaud's 2015 10-K:Income Statement: we made $29 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $16 million in non-operating income (3% of revenue). We removed $22 million related to non-operating expenses and $7 million related to non-operating income.Balance Sheet: we made $244 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $41 million. The most notable adjustment was $139 million (21% of net assets) related to midyear acquisitions.Valuation: we made $507 million of adjustments that decreased shareholder value There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value. The largest adjustment was the removal of $482 million (18% of market cap) in total debt, which includes $73 million in off balance sheet operating leases.Dangerous Funds That Hold BLKBThe following fund receives our Dangerous rating and allocates significantly to Blackbaud Inc.Disclosure: David Trainer and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."

(NASDAQ:BLKB) is a software-as-a-service (SAAS) company which is the current industry leader in customer relationship management for the nonprofit, charitable giving, and education sector. The company offers a variety of services to its business customers and describes itself as the ""leading global provider of software and services"" designed specifically for this space. Blackbaud's customers use the company's software and services to help ""increase donations, reduce fundraising costs, improve constituent communications, manage finances, and optimize operations.""The short investment case is predicated upon three interrelated tenets:1. Unjustifiably high valuation/growth expectations2. Powerful competitive threat from Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM)3. Underappreciated customer retention issuesI recommend shorting the equity of BLKB above $60 per share (>~4x EV/2017E Revenue). My probability-weighted net IRR over a 15-month investment horizon is +18%.Company OverviewBLKB was founded in 1981 as a New York corporation and is headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina. It is a leading provider of software for the nonprofit market. The company's offerings include The Raiser's Edge, to manage constituent relationship management and fundraising activity; Blackbaud CRM, a Web-based CRM solution; eTapestry, a cloud-based donor management and fundraising solution; Patron Edge (for managing revenue generation through ticket sales), and others.Of all the company's offerings, the core products for the company are Raiser's Edge and Blackbaud CRM for donor management. BLKB's CRM solution is targeted at mid-market and large nonprofit organizations (NPOs) and aims to help them internally manage their constituent information. BLKB has made a number of recent acquisitions to expand the company' addressable market to include ""nonprofits, K-12 private and higher education institutions, healthcare organizations, foundations, and other charitable giving entities and corporations… [that] raise, invest, manage, and award more than $100 billion each year."" The company had ~35,000 active customers in over 60 countries at the end of 2015.Exiting the 2008 global financial crisis, the company experienced secular tailwinds from the recovery in the nonprofit spending market and the increase in nonprofit giving patterns as a result of the health in the overall economy. That said, 2015 was a strong year of outperformance for BLKB equity shares relative to the S&P 400 Software & Services Index, making 2016 a compelling time to enter a short position in light of fundamental conviction in deteriorating revenue growth potential and a rising competitive threat from CRM.Investment ThesisWhile BLKB is indeed the leading provider in the nonprofit SaaS space, the company's equity shares are currently trading at an unjustifiably high valuation. Growth expectations for the company are high and management will be hard-pressed to exceed market expectations. For instance, relative to a basket of comparable companies, BLKB's EV/Revenue multiples for both of the next two years (4.0x and 3.5x, respectively for 2016 and 2017) are higher than the median (3.0x and 2.6x, respectively for 2016 and 2017). Multiples of revenue are more useful valuation metrics for BLKB and peers given industry analysts' focus on sales due to the recurring revenue nature of these businesses.Unsustainable valuation multiples aside, sellside consensus estimates for revenue growth are in the ~15% range for the next few years. Given the competitive threat from CRM (detailed further below), it is likely the company will grow revenue only in the mid-to-high single digit percentage points over the next years. Even if this assessment proves overly bearish, it is apparent that both sellside equity research analysts and buyside investors (manifested through market valuation multiples on forward consensus sales estimates) have high expectations for BLKB to continue executing and hitting management guidance. This may prove difficult for management.Moreover, a central tenet of the short case for BLKB is that the company faces a powerful competitive threat from Salesforce.com. CRM has recently launched a not-for-profit line of business services to compete directly with BLKB's flagship CRM, the Raiser's Edge service. An assessment of the usefulness of Raiser's Edge and Salesforce conducted by industry insiders examined four key considerations and determined that Salesforce's product was overall superior to Raiser's Edge.While BLKB uses a direct sales model (new revenue driven by sales force head count additions), CRM has greater scale and may be able to cross-sell its NPO CRM services more easily using existing infrastructure and employees. Discussions with Salesforce's sales employees signal that CRM is growing revenues for their NPO product in the ~100% range y/y and that revenues may be in the nine-figure dollar range. This increased competitive threat has gone largely unappreciated by the market (as manifested by continued high valuation multiples) and it is likely that BLKB will face pressures in their core lines of business, especially as customers face a choice as their existing contracts end.Finally, BLKB faces customer retention issues which are underappreciated by the market. Since BLKB's early days, customers faced a variety of issues with the company's products. In particular, integration between BLKB's products was troubling for many; one research report from November 2006 details a college foundation facing difficulty integrating information entered into Raiser's Edge into the Financial Edge product. Since then, while the company has taken steps to resolve some of the issues customers experience, it is not clear that the overall customer experience has improved. This may be due to the long-term contracts the company enters with customers which, especially in the face of historically limited competition, do not provide ample incentive to create a top-notch user experience. Given the competitive threat outlined in the last thesis point, BLKB may be vulnerable to customer churn once contracts roll off over the coming quarters.Regarding BLKB's contracts with customers: ""Maintenance contracts are typically renewed on an annual basis. Subscription contracts are typically for a term of three years at contract inception with one year renewals thereafter."" Over the last years, the company has made an effort to transition maintenance customers from a perpetual license-based model to a cloud-based subscription delivery model. The company has been successful at growing subscription revenue's share of total revenue over the last decade, to where it comprises half of the company's overall revenue today. This share of revenue is expected only to grow over the next years (along with the company's service revenue stream), at the expense of traditional license and maintenance revenue.While this shift to subscription and services revenue has allowed the company to achieve a high degree of recurring revenues (resulting in an elevated trading multiple), it is important to note that the margins BLKB earns on subscription and services revenue are significantly lower than those they earn on license and maintenance revenue (~49% and ~17% versus ~89% and ~83%, respectively, in 2014) and that margins on subscription and services have been decreasing over the last years. Subscription revenue arrangements typically range from one to three years.Moreover, primary research I conducted on the value proposition of Raiser's Edge versus Salesforce and how likely users would be to stay with BLKB in light of the new competitive offering yielded compelling conclusions for the short case. The full list of responses received in conducting this diligence can be found at the end of this article.Furthermore, there may be reason to believe that the CRM space is a winner-take-all market; as such, Salesforce.com's entry into the nonprofit market does not bode well for BLKB. The low interest rate environment of the last several years has also allowed BLKB to raise cheap debt capital; as the interest rate environment/corporate credit cycle normalizes, the company's cost of capital will increase and it will become more expensive and challenging for management to issue debt to deal with the competitive threat posed by Salesforce.com. This is especially true given the extent to which BLKB is levered relative to peers (110.5% net debt to equity for BLKB vs. 14.9% net debt to equity for CRM vs. a net cash position for the median of peers).In addition to all of these points, there have been concerns raised regarding slowing ASP growth, stabilizing NPO tech budgets in core markets, industry high maintenance pricing, and little pricing power - all of which may merit further research and could contribute to the short investment case. Regarding ASP growth specifically: management at BLKB expects an impactful ASP uplift from the current transition of the company's flagship enterprise products (Raiser's Edge and Financial Edge) to cloud-based solutions. However, with Salesforce.com entering the competitive picture, this growth is not likely to manifest as strongly as expected.Below is the estimated range of outcomes for a short investment in BLKB equity shares at an entry price of $60/share. There is reason to believe that this is conservative; for instance, in the upside case, it is possible that when the market properly appreciates the competitive threat from CRM and the thesis points above, even a 2.0x multiple of 2017E revenue will be too high. As any analysis will demonstrate, there are several comparable companies which trade below 2.0x revenue.RisksRisks to the short investment case are several, but all have compelling mitigating factors. First, management could execute strongly on operations and generate revenue and earnings results that exceed Street expectations. This is possible, but as outlined in the investment thesis above, it is unlikely given the high expectations that the market is pricing in already for the company's revenue growth.The company could be the target for potential M&A activity. This is possible, though unlikely given BLKB's elevated valuation relative to peers. M&A potential has been discussed by numerous sellside analysts as long ago as 2007, with nothing having materialized yet.While CRM was a potential acquirer years ago, and while CRM does trade at higher valuation multiples than BLKB (which might make an acquisition of BLKB more attractive given accretion potential), the likelihood of a CRM-BLKB combination today is slim given CRM's entry into the nonprofit market themselves. Clearly, company management at CRM has chosen to compete with BLKB directly and build services for this market internally rather than acquire the company.Moreover, M&A interest from financial sponsors such as Hellman and Friedman (the private equity firm which took a controlling stake in BLKB in 1999) is unlikely as well given current valuations and limited platform synergies. In 1999, there were many potential global targets for Hellman and Friedman to consider which would offer substantial operational synergies. Indeed, under Hellman and Friedman's control, BLKB acquired several companies serving the nonprofit CRM space, several on the international front in the U.K. Today, given the consolidation that has occurred in the space over a seven+ year bull market, the number of targets for such platform acquisitions (and indeed the platform acquisition model itself, as manifested across a variety of industries) is not as attractive as it once was.Why Does this Opportunity Exist?The company, while covered by a number of sellside equity research analysts, has a sub-$3B market cap. Thus, a potential investment is not as scalable for larger institutions.While the timing of the investment thesis is difficult to ascertain, the risk/reward profile of the investment is asymmetric; there is some element of ""time-horizon arbitrage"" in play as well.It is sensible to execute an opportunistic short trade in BLKB's equity due to the compelling risk/reward offered at prices above ~$60/share. With limited upside given a valuation ceiling and significant potential downside from poor execution on the business model and the competitive threat from CRM, a short position may be warranted as part of a broad portfolio of asymmetric ideas.User Responses from Primary Research· ""Salesforce 100%.

4112064,103480,2017-10-06T09:25:49-04:00,"Blackbaud is the leading enterprise software vendor for nonprofits.Unlike other SaaS peers, Blackbaud is profitable and pays a dividend, at the cost of slightly lowered growth rates.Trading at approximately 5.5x EV/FTM revenues, the company is trading at a discount to the wider software industry.Its initiatives to boost pro forma operating margin to as high as 23% (up from 20.5% today), as well as some top-line growth, should begin to provide earnings support for valuation.The stock is a buy in the mid-$80s, where it has taken a dip from recent highs.","Blackbaud (NASDAQ:BLKB) is an extremely interesting software company, one that has the financial appearance of a traditional goods producer rather than a bona fide growth technology company.The company is growing revenues at ""only"" 15%, causing a valuation disconnect between Blackbaud and other software peers growing 20-30% or higher. But in return, Blackbaud offers profits. It generated $45 million of GAAP net income in 2016 (approximately 6% net margin). While this seems thin, recall that most software companies are in the red at around -30% or worse net margins.In addition, Blackbaud sports a 20% pro forma operating margin (operating income plus stock-based comp), which leagues better than high-growth software companies sustaining thick losses. Despite its slower growth, I believe Blackbaud more than compensates for it by proving its profitability potential - as maturing software companies should.Despite flying largely under the radar, Blackbaud is on the larger side of the spectrum of software stocks, at ~$800 million in forward revenues and $4.2 billion in market cap. While it’s no longer a star of the spotlight, toast-of-Silicon-Valley type of company anymore, Blackbaud is still an attractive value proposition for the selective tech investor. Its pole position in an extremely niche market (CRM and ERP software for the nonprofit vertical) that is largely underpenetrated by other software vendors has secured its path to both growth and profits.This is not a stock that’s going to take off like recently minted IPOs - rather, this is a stock to own for the long term as the company continues to harvest cash from profitable SaaS contracts like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). Its current 80x P/E ratio may seem nonsensical, but with both revenue and operating margins slated for improvement, the company can see rapid earnings acceleration.Given Blackbaud’s strong fundamentals and technology leadership in the nonprofit space (it’s used by over 35,000 organizations), I believe the company has surpassed the hump of software maturity and is on a stable, continued path toward growth. An EV/FTM revenue multiple of 6.5x (~$110) is a good price target to shoot for; the stock’s current trading levels in the mid-$80s signal a strong buy.Blackbaud, as previously mentioned, specializes in software specifically for nonprofit institutions. Unlike other vertical software applications (see my prior article on Model N (NYSE:MODN) here), I believe the nonprofit space is not entirely well covered by horizontal software providers such as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). The needs of nonprofits, while not more complex than an enterprise, are entirely different from a typical corporation. Fundraising and donor acquisition is an entirely different activity than sales and business development, thus, nonprofits need a different type of CRM system.(It might be prudent to note that Salesforce does have a CRM for the nonprofit vertical, but Blackbaud’s are generally more custom-fitted for fundraising activities, and have generally strong reviews).Blackbaud offers a suite of CRM products, including Raiser's Edge, Blackbaud CRM and Luminate CRM. The former, its flagship product, is intended for enterprise-level, large, nonprofit organizations. The latter, a general-purpose CRM for any size of nonprofit, is actually built on the Salesforce platform and features third-party integrations with outside applications via Salesforce’s App Exchange, highlighting the partnership between the two companies.While CRM is Blackbaud’s leading product category, it also aims to be a complete software solution for nonprofit organizations - a more effective strategy in this vertical rather than core enterprise, as nonprofits are less likely to have fully staffed IT departments that tend to procure the best-in-breed software application for every function. With simplicity being key to serving leaner-staffed nonprofits, Blackbaud is able to effectively cross sell its two other main product lines, an ERP system and BI tools.Blackbaud’s ERP system features solutions to manage vertical-specific needs such as grant applications and scholarship programs, and rolls them into a traditional ERP that handles accounting and budgeting processes.Blackbaud’s BI tools include donor acquisition solutions that allow organizations to build high-quality prospect lists with the highest probability of success, as well as data enrichment solutions that help manage and improve prospect data residing in the organization’s databases.Other auxiliary Blackbaud products include advertising and marketing software to design email communications and other marketing campaigns. Blackbaud also offers a fledging content management and student records software suite for K-12 schools, a possible pivot and diversification potential from Blackbaud’s main nonprofit vertical.Blackbaud estimates its total addressable market (TAM) at $6.7 billion, implying that it believes itself to be only 10% penetrated in its target market (based on FY16 revenues of $723 million).Blackbaud’s TAM can also be considered in terms of raw numbers of organizations it can sell to. According to Blackbaud, there are 1.6 million nonprofit organizations in the U.S. registered with the IRS, of which 1.1 million are 501(C)(3) organizations. Nonprofit giving totaled $370 billion (according to a third-party study in 2015) and grew at roughly 7% per year. This represents 2% of GDP.Nonprofits also employ 10% of the U.S. workforce.If we take Blackbaud’s market estimates at face value, there is a lot of room for the company to grow. Though its top-line growth may not be at a red-hot pace like other startup peers, Blackbaud has ample room in the market to continue landing new clients and expanding contracts.Blackbaud has also yet to make meaningful expansion outside of the U.S. - international revenues comprised only 5% of Blackbaud’s total top line in 2017.With a sizable revenue scale approaching $1 billion, investors should be comforted that Blackbaud is not overly saturated in its target market and still has plenty of breathing room to expand. Its slower rate of growth is indicative of a conservative management style - one that prefers to grow revenue along with margins - as it continues to fill its niche space.While Blackbaud no longer sporting the growth of an enterprise software startup, it isn't forsaking growth either. The following chart taken from Blackbaud's 10-K shows its segment-level growth since 2014:Blackbaud's GMBU and ECBU represent its ""General Markets"" and ""Enterprise Client"" segments, with the former serving emerging and mid-market organizations, and the latter large and complex nonprofits. These segments represent the bulk of Blackbaud's business, and the General Markets segment in particular led the way with 22% growth in FY16. Total revenues grew 15% to $730.8 million, putting the company on the larger side of the software sector, with a revenue base similar to that of Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) at $750 million and Tableau (NYSE:DATA) at $830 million.Subscription revenue grew 29% in FY16 to $429 million, approximately two-thirds of Blackbaud's revenue. The company is focused on transitioning its on-prem licenses to cloud subscriptions, which are recurring and carry higher margins. Maintenance revenues from on-prem licenses still account for ~$150 million of revenues, but are in decline.One key observation to note is that Blackbaud's transition to the cloud model may be causing some of its optical underperformance on growth, as one-time license deals bring more immediate lift to revenues. The cloud subscription model, however, sustains growth for longer periods.Earnings in 2016 grew to $41.5 million (EPS of $0.88), up from $25.6 million ($0.55) in 2015. Likewise, cash from operations grew to $153.6 million in 2016, up from $129.2 million in 2015. The fact that the company is able to sustain a ~15% operating cash flow margin while growing 15% is a rare feature in a software company.Blackbaud is forecasting revenue of $775-795 million in FY17, implying revenue growth of 7% at the midpoint. Growth has slowed down somewhat in the first half of 2017, with 1H revenues growing only 6.6%, but the company did deliver 120 bps of operating margin improvement - 1H17 operating margin clocked in at 8.7% versus 7.5% in the prior year period.At this stage in a software company's life, the key test for its viability is to turn its large revenue base (into which it has invested sales dollars and net losses for years) into profits. Blackbaud seems to be doing just that, with all earnings metrics showing continuous improvement as revenue growth tempers down to stable levels.As the market reaches for yet another high with each trading session, cautious investors are likely to seek value names to rotate a portion of their portfolios into. It's odd to think of a cloud software company as a value name, and there are few of them - Blackbaud is one.BLKB EV to CFO (Annual) data by YChartsThe chart above compares Blackbaud's EV to operating cash flow metric relative to other positive cash flowing software companies. While Blackbaud's revenue growth certainly isn't as impressive as Workday's (NASDAQ:WDAY) or ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW), its expanding profitability margins make it attractive, and thus the stark discount to peers isn't warranted.Given Blackbaud's firm grasp on a niche market in which it is a well-recognized leader and its ability to grow moderately and pursue profitability, the company should be able to find cash flow support for its valuation as the market seeks high-quality value names in technology."

The company has achieved success by building a competitive advantage through acquiring several competitors in the nonprofit and higher education spaces in order to become the only service that offers complete solutions to clients. Furthermore, BLKB is currently rapidly transitioning its services to a cloud format, further strengthening its competitive edge and positioning it for continued long-term success. Unfortunately, investors won't be able to fully partake in the company's profits because its extremely high valuation will limit shareholder returns at present growth rates and the significant debt burden will limit the company's ability to fund future growth projects and acquisitions.Competitive Advantages1. Dominant Position: BLKB's competitive advantage is primarily found in its wide array of integrated services, covering virtually every conceivable need in its sector for organizations of all shapes and sizes:Source2. Cloud-Based Services: The company isn't resting on its laurels either: by combining its uniquely dominant position in the nonprofit space with a transition to cloud-based services via Blackbaud SKY, BLKB is fueling new growth as the majority of revenue is now coming in through cloud subscriptions:3. Sector Analytics and Leadership: By using its years of experience and investments in IT, the BLKB has distinguished itself from competitors through leveraging its expertise in the nonprofit sector and implementing data and analytics services to further advise and enhance client decision-making and performance. Customer loyalty is greatly aided through the immense switching costs of leaving the industry's largest database and boasting decades of experience in the field.Risks1. Salesforce.com: Though currently a very minimal player in the nonprofit sector, salesforce.com's size and software capabilities could make it a threat in the future if it decides to directly compete with Blackbaud.2. Overleveraged Growth: By investing heavily in acquisitions and information technology, the company has taken on considerable debt: SourceIts current ratio of 0.68 reflects potential challenges that the company could face in meeting its short-term obligations if profitability falters from increased competition or data security breaches. Perhaps more concerning to investors are the limits that this enormous leverage places on investing in future growth and hiking investor returns.Valuation By commanding a P/E of ~90, BLKB requires enormous growth rates moving forward to give its investors acceptable returns. Though analysts project a high 5-year average growth rate (16.25%), the numbers still don't add up:Furthermore, the price to book value ratio of 16.9 presents an enormous premium for growth and is very high by both industry and company historical averages (6.8 and 11.1 respectively) while the 25.9 price to cash flow ratio reflects the challenges the company faces in distributing strong returns to shareholders at present prices.Investor TakeawayThough Salesforce.com could provide a future challenge, Blackbaud has for the time being mastered its market and its cloud-fueled growth should enable the company to continue to thrive and dominate its sector for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately, a high debt burden and sky-high valuations will prevent shareholders from experiencing a growth in invested capital commensurate with company profitability growth. I recommend passing on this firm until their valuation returns to more enticing levels."

While historical execution hasn't been superb, the company's new management team has made several strategic decisions that are starting to pay off. A lot of the heavy lifting of systems modernization was completed in 2015, and going into 2016, the company can focus purely on driving results.Moving To The Cloud, Both Internally And ExternallyLike many other historically on-prem software companies, Blackbaud is transitioning towards a subscription-based SaaS model. Given that its core customers don't turn over their systems very often, though, the company's percentage of license revenues has always been relatively small - this year, it will be merely one percent - so the company hasn't faced revenue and margin dilution of quite the same severity as some other companies that have undergone the transition. Subscription revenue is now over 50% of total revenue, and recurring revenue (including maintenance) is >75% of total revenue. (The balance is in professional services.)Over time, there's plenty of reason to expect existing on-prem clients to transition to the cloud-based NXT applications. These are built with a common UX called ""SKY"" and the standard goodie bag of features like open APIs for third-party developers, etc. The major benefit for customers is more frequent releases of incremental upgrades; for some color, there were over 300 releases of NXT in the second half of 2015, versus less than a hundred releases over the past three decades. All that said, nonprofits tend to move a little slower than commercial enterprises, so the company is in no hurry to push current (very profitable) maintenance customers to switch over if they don't want to.Internally, it's important as well - Blackbaud has been able to transition some of its IT personnel from maintenance work to developing new features/applications. Many applications historically had their own full technology stack even though many of the functions were common; these redundancies are now well on their way to being eliminated. The company's own systems have also been streamlined; they're down from 32 key systems to 8 over the past two years.The Branches Are Pruned; Will They Bear More Fruit?Speaking of redundancy, the same could have (and has) been said about Blackbaud's rather wide portfolio of products. In fact, a common investor misperception is that the giving market is fairly flat, making it strange that the company offers so many different products (such as three CRMs currently, down from more previously).This misses the fact that different segments of the market are very different. For example, a major university focused primarily on obtaining seven- or eight-figure endowments from a small number of high-profile donors have a very different set of needs than the local dog rescue that relies on small donations from lots of average Joes.The analogy management uses to describe the segmentation is SAP vs. QuickBooks - both are great products, but are obviously targeted to very different markets. It's worth noting that many of the smaller ""mass-market"" nonprofits often don't even have a full-time IT director, much less an IT organization; the person handling the technology might be a part-time volunteer wearing three other hats, so the name of the game is simplicity.Thus, while Blackbaud's recent actions to prune applications seem like the right move, the company will always have multiple products in the same vertical as a result of the breadth of organization types it works with.Growth Drivers: Crowdfunding, Payments, and InternationalWhile the company will likely continue to organically take share, with some additional growth from M&A, three of the growth drivers that I'm focused on here are the ones named above.Starting with payments: the company's integration of payments capabilities into its platform does two things. First, from the customer standpoint, it removes a lot of hassle around issues such as PCI compliance, and integrates easily with financial systems. Perhaps more interestingly from the company's perspective, though, it opens up a new business model it hasn't previously had. Transaction or volume-based fees charged for managing payments allow Blackbaud to grow revenues over time from the same clients. This looks to be a significant tailwind, as online giving has been growing 2-3x faster than the overall giving industry (at rates not dissimilar from e-commerce in general).One of the things that clients are eager to use this payments capability for is crowdfunding and virtual events. Virtual events like the Great Southern Crossing require less overhead than traditional charity events. As the company's head of product strategy, Charlie Cumbaa, explained at the December Investor Day:Particularly in light of the obvious social/mobile trend, this seems like a good approach; it's obviously not going to entirely replace traditional 5Ks and similar events, but it allows nonprofits to access the full spectrum of potential donors.Finally, while it's still early days, International is also a long-term opportunity. The company still has plenty of opportunities in the fragmented U.S. market, of course, but its International segment represents merely 8% of revenue. It would seem to be pretty easy to increase share in English-speaking countries like the U.K. and Australia (which was actually the home of the company's acquired everydayhero business). The company is also expanding into other European countries, as well as working on internationalizing products for potential future growth in emerging markets.ValuationClearly, there are things to like about Blackbaud. As I've discussed previously, the mindblowing performance of Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) demonstrates how much value can be created by providing best-of-breed software solutions in a highly fragmented market. Obviously, Blackbaud hasn't historically been managed anywhere near as well as Tyler, but with a new strategy and a seemingly deep management bench with veterans from much bigger software companies, Blackbaud does look like it's poised to deliver strong growth going forward.The problem is that I can't justify the valuation, no matter how hard I try. The company is targeting 20-23% non-GAAP operating margins in 2018, although it seems to be talking this number down (often reiterating its willingness to continue to make investments to drive growth). Longer term, while I think Blackbaud can drive operating leverage off the new common platform, I'm not sure it has the same pricing power as other SaaS companies catering to commercial buyers. Solutions are sold on an ROI basis, and nonprofits (at least the good ones) are strongly focused on keeping their overhead costs down so more of their revenue flows to the actual causes they support.Without the benefit of that sort of operational leverage, then, the multiples look like they've divorced from any sort of logical valuation reality, even giving the company complete credit for the high end of its target operating margin. The near-term revenue multiple seems very high in context of an organic growth rate unlikely to break the double digits over the medium or long term, and much more likely to grow at a high-single digits rate. Indeed, Blackbaud's target organic growth rate over the long term is 6-10%, and prior to the new strategy and new management, organic growth was in the low-single digits.I imagine you could construct a scenario to justify the valuation - a lot of acquisitions at really cheap prices - but neither of these look like they're going to happen. The company is willing to go up to 3.5x debt-to-EBITDA, but pro forma for the Smart Tuition deal, it will already be in the high 2s. And Smart didn't come cheap - at a net purchase price of just under $190 million and forward guided revenues of $40-50MM for this business, it was over 4x forward revenues. To give you an idea of how expensive the stock is, even if the company somehow got to $1 billion in 2017 revenues (probably outside the realm of possibility even at max debt capacity), and if it posted a 25% non-GAAP operating margin (also probably impossible) and you ignored the debt (which isn't insignificant), its current market cap is still 12x this wildly optimistic estimation of two-year-forward non-GAAP EBIT.The one bright spot is that Blackbaud's results should be substantially less exposed to downturns than most companies; even before the big push into the cloud, it did well in 2008-2009. Giving is obviously discretionary, but the platforms nonprofits need to run their businesses are not. The recurring nature of revenue is obviously one of the primary advantages of the SaaS model; perhaps this puts a floor under the company's trading multiple.Wrapping It UpI like Blackbaud, but its valuation doesn't make any sense to me here. Management has executed well over the past year, and I'm optimistic about business prospects going forward, but the company would need substantially higher organic growth potential (or much better operating leverage prospects) to even come close to justifying the valuation. I would be willing to own Blackbaud at the right price, but it may be a very long time before we get there."

Despite all of this good news, the disappointing services revenue numbers were enough to sink shares, as the company's high debt will likely force the company's fast-paced acquisition-led growth strategy to decelerate in the near future.SourceIn light of this, Analysts forecast the growth rate to decelerate to 10.2% over the next 5-years after BLKB averaged 17.56% growth over the past five. Given these assumptions, BLKB is only poised to deliver 4.75% returns at current prices, indicating that until there is stronger confirmation of organic growth across the business, the company appears to be overvalued at a ~86 P/E valuation multiple:SourceDespite its very strong moat, impressive growth record, and ongoing growth and brand-strengthening initiatives, BLKB's sky-high valuation multiple appears unwarranted. Unless the company can find ways to rapidly grow the business organically and ease investor concerns about the sustainability of its acquisition-led growth model, the company's shares have considerable downside risk relative to return potential."

Its performance continues to shine, with the top-line growing 15.2% y/y to $147m. Diluted GAAP EPS increased to $0.09 from $0.08 over the same period. In terms of analyst estimates, the company was in line with expectations, achieving diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.32.First quarter performance continues to shine, outlook remains intactThe double-digit top-line performance referenced in the earlier paragraph includes inorganic growth. Looking at organic top-line growth (which is a better assessment of company performance), or non-GAAP revenue, the figure increased 8.5% y/y, or 9.7% on a constant currency basis. The company's subscription-based model continues to thrive, with total subscriptions jumping 24.4% to $72.5m. BLKB's cash flow stability continues to improve, with recurring revenue increasing to a record 75.8% of the top-line. With charitable giving projected to grow mid single-digits in the following years, the company's TAM should expand in tandem. In addition, management expects its TAM to increase from approximately $5b currently to $6.5b over the next three years.The company has continued to release stellar products, evident from its ability to close sizable enterprise deals in 1Q. BLKB has also launched the Blackbaud Partner Marketplace, which features products for a wide variety of verticals, which enhance BLKB's solutions. As I mentioned in my earlier article, the company has continued its move to the cloud. Its newest cloud solutions have garnered hundreds of pre-orders, further signifying the demand for the company's offerings. As a result, the company's strong momentum should continue into the following quarters.FX headwinds will continueAs BLKB has significant international operations, the company is exposed to fluctuations within the currency market. In recent months, the USD has strengthened significantly vis-à-vis other major currencies, primarily due to the diverging monetary policy stance adopted by the Fed, compared to its central banking counterparts. Although the recent Fed meeting has reversed the appreciation of the greenback somewhat, it remains at elevated levels, according to CNBC data. Considering that Europe, China and Japan seem to have no qualms on continuing an expansionary monetary policy, the USD should see further appreciation as investors anticipate higher yields from the eventual rate hikes. Going forward, expect currency headwinds to continue acting as a drag on the company's performance.ValuationAs seen in the above DCF model, my assumptions remain unchanged. This is due to the fact that the company's performance continues to be in line with my expectations. Regarding margin expansion, the company has estimated that its back-office-rationalization initiative would result in a 600 basis point expansion over the next few years. However, I remain conservative in my projections, expecting EBITDA margins to expand 250 bps within the next 5 years. Since I last wrote on the stock, its valuation multiple has expanded from 26.5x to 28.3x. Although such a figure may seem high to some, it reflects investors' heightened growth expectations for the company. I believe that the valuation multiple will come down over the next few years, not due to a decline in the numerator (enterprise value) but due to an expansion of the denominator (EBITDA). Using said figure, along with a 9% discount rate (as the recurring portion of the company's revenue continues to increase), the model produces a fair value of $61 for Blackbaud, indicating a potential upside of 17% from current prices. Hence, I reiterate my bullish outlook on BLKB."

Well, consider the world the investor faces:In our opinion, that should cause us to be very cautious about overpaying for a company's growth.That brings us to Blackbaud, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLKB).Blackbaud provides fundraising software, accounting and management solutions to non-profits with about 13,000 Raiser's Edge customers, and 225 live on NXT, as it mentions in its recent conference call.With a P/E of 105.19 and a forward P/E of 33.42, BLKB has a one-year price-implied earnings growth rate of ~214%.

In that conference call, it outlines five growth strategies going forward.Our problem is that, in the past, it has enjoyed stellar growth in revenues. Yet it has failed to turn that revenue growth into growing profits for shareholders.Source: YChartsIf revenue growth doesn't translate into bottom line growth for investors, we gotta ask: what will?In a similar vein, its margins are unimpressive, the result of a nearly ten-year decline, with low ROA (3.29%), low operating margin (7.25%), low profit margin (4.42%).

Yet we think this price optimism presents more risk than reward to shareholders.

Investors may become disappointed, and we'll see its price appreciation slow or even decline.At least that'll bring its P/E down to Earth's historical norms, which may make it a great investment at those lowered prices. But right now, even if BLKB achieves the market's optimistic feat of growth, nothing will happen because the optimistic forecast is already priced in.In sum, we believe that, at current prices, BLKB represents too much downside, with too little upside for investors. Most stocks lose money, and most overpriced P/E stocks come back down to Earth by price slow down - not by earnings growth. With its lackluster profitability in the face of superb revenue growth, declining margins and high debt, we don't think BLKB will be any different."

As the company's total addressable market continues to grow, expect to see meaningful top-line expansion in the future. Blackbaud's diverse customer base within the non-profit industry, coupled with its subscription-based model will allow the company to continue generating stable recurring cash flows. As the company continues its move to cloud, this enhances the value proposition for its clients due to the undeniable advantages of cloud-based solutions. Profit enhancement initiatives and operating leverage should result in further margin expansion in the near term.Total addressable market continues to growAccording to NCCS, the number of non-profit organisations within the U.S. continues to grow at a healthy pace. In 2003, there were 1.3m of such organizations. Fast forward a decade later, there are almost 1.5m non-profits operating in the U.S. Furthermore, the company estimates that the number of non-U.S. non-profits is also experiencing healthy growth, with the current figure estimated at approximately 3m. In addition, Giving USA reports that $335b were donated to charity in the U.S. in 2013.Source: Giving USAAs seen in the above graph, the figure has grown from approximately $270b in 2008 to its current figure of $335b in 2013, representing a CAGR of 4.41% over the period mentioned. As the Blackbaud's total addressable market continue to grow, the company's top-line should benefit going forward. Furthermore, as Blackbaud is a large player within its industry, I believe the company is well positioned to capitalize on the growth of the overall market it serves.Diverse customer base and subscription-based model will continue to result in stable recurring cash flowsSome companies are highly reliant on a small number of customers, which exposes them to the risk of losing a significant portion of their revenue base when a customer deserts said company for a competitor. Although it is true that some companies are able to operate with a small customer base, this is only possible due to the company being able to provide a unique value proposition that ensures a high degree of customer stickiness. In the case of Blackbaud, its solutions are platform-based, which gives the company a sizable degree of customer lock-in as its clients, having already familiarized themselves with the company's platform, are unlikely to switch to a competing product. The risk of customer desertion adversely impacting the company in a large way is also reduced by the diversity of its customer base - amongst non-profits, the company serves many segments. These segments include education, foundations, healthcare, human services, amongst others. Considering the fact that most of the company's solutions are subscription-based, these factors result in a stable and recurring revenue base for the company. Going forward, I expect this to continue as the company further expands its customer base.Move to cloud-based solutions enhances value proposition for clientsInformed readers would know that cloud computing is currently a very hot industry, and with good reason. The cloud offers many advantages over traditional models, after all. Blackbaud has announced its intention to move its solutions onto the cloud. I believe this is a smart move, given the fact that apart from the convenience a cloud-based solution provides, many cost savings can also be derived by the user. Keeping in mind that the market Blackbaud serves - non-profits are focused on lowering costs so as to maximize the organisation's overall value-add to its beneficiaries, it is not hard to see why the move to the cloud is a smart one. Overall, this move to the cloud should provide Blackbaud's clients with an enhanced value proposition, allowing the company to better retain its clients. This seems to be working out well, as the company continues to report double-digit growth rates in its subscriptions in management's most recent earnings call.Profit enhancement initiatives and operating leverage should allow for further margin expansion in the near termIn fiscal 2014, the company announced its plan to embark on profit enhancement initiatives. These initiatives are a mix of utilizing scalable infrastructure, streamlining back-office operations through automation and optimizing processes. Normally, I'd be hesitant when a company announces such initiatives as these moves could impair revenue growth, in the case of Blackbaud, they seem to be working well. The company surpassed its non-GAAP operating margin target of 17.5%, achieving 17.8% in its most recent fiscal year while revenue growth was a healthy 12%. As detailed earlier, the company has been moving its solutions to the cloud, and I expect it to be able to derive significant operating leverage going forward as it costs incrementally less for Blackbaud to add another customer to its platform. Given the reasons above, I expect profit margins to continue expanding in the near-term.ValuationAs seen in the above DCF model, company revenues are projected to grow at growth rates of 10% to 3% throughout the 5-year projection period. This growth is not only supported by historical growth numbers, but can also be attributed to a growing total addressable market, as detailed in earlier paragraphs. EBITDA margins are expected to gradually expand from the current 16.5% level, to 19% by the end of the projection period. This expansion in margins is supported by the profit enhancement initiatives the company is currently embarking on, which have been proven to work, and the fact that the company's business model allows it to derive substantial operating leverage. The company currently trades at 26.5x LTM EBITDA. Using this figure, along with a 9% discount rate (due to the stable and recurring nature of the company's cash flows, derived from its diverse customer base and subscription-based model), the model produces a fair value of $56 for Blackbaud, indicating that the company is undervalued by approximately 20% at current prices. My outlook on the company is hence bullish - investors are advised to initiate a long position on the stock at current prices."
1677712,48501,2013-09-06T10:11:43-04:00,,"Blackbaud Inc. (NASDAQ:BLKB) provides business software and services to the nonprofit sector. The company provides end-to-end solutions that are designed to improve effectiveness and efficiency. The company's products are competitive in the market, which is reflected in its 15% 10-year average revenue growth rate.That said, I think Blackbaud Inc. has a competitive advantage because it specifically designs its products for the nonprofit sector. Competitors Sage, Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) don't focus on nonprofit firms. The company provides cloud computing services and mobile payment services, which also gives it a competitive advantage. Also, the nonprofit sector has a growth rate around the global GDP growth rate.I like Blackbaud's competitive advantage is gained through its diverse and deep product portfolio. The financial performance should act as a tailwind to the valuations. I estimate the intrinsic value at $34.02. I consider this an investment-grade asset and my focus is on asset allocation, instead of stop loss levels.Recent DevelopmentsBlackbaud announced the use of Microsoft's Windows Azure cloud services to connect The Raisers Edge mobile app to on-premises instances of the company's flagship Raisers Edge donor management software. Users of Raisers Edge are now able to spend less time in front of the computer and more time engaged in face-to-face contact.Anthony Boor, senior vice president and chief financial officer, has been named interim president and chief executive officer. Boor will also maintain his responsibilities as CFO. Boor now has more work than he can effectively handle.Blackbaud released Blackbaud MobilePay, a mobile credit card processing application that is integrated with the company's payment processing services. MobilePay should help drive revenue growth going forward.The company announced updates across its portfolio of nonprofit solutions and services.Business SummaryBlackbaud is the leading global provider of software and related services designed specifically for nonprofit organizations - the company's purpose is to power the business of philanthropy from fundraising to outcomes. At the end of 2012, Blackbaud had more than 27,000 customers spread over 61 countries.The company provides its solutions to nonprofit organizations in several ways, including on a perpetual license basis, a software-as-a-service basis, or a ""hosted"" software basis. The company provides a wide array of solutions that meet many of their customers needs.Blackbaud is organized into four operating units: the Enterprise Customer Business Unit (""ECBU""), the General Markets Business Unit (""GMBU""), the International Business Unit (""IBU""), and Target Analytics.The market for software-related services in the nonprofit sector is highly competitive and fragmented; certain areas of the market have low entry barriers. As the market matures and nonprofit organizations become more aware of the benefits of attaining specialized software, the market could become more competitive.Blackbaud faces competition from small companies, such as Sage, and large enterprises, such as Microsoft, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), and Oracle. None of these companies offer the tailored in-depth solutions that Blackbaud does - thus, Blackbaud has a competitive advantage in the nonprofit sector.That competitive advantage is playing out in the revenue growth rate. The 10-year average revenue growth rate at the end of calendar 2012 was 15.6%. Revenue has increased every year since at least 2003.For fiscal 2013, revenue should be about $500 million with an operating margin in the 13% to 17% range and a net income margin in the 8% to 12% range.For fiscal 2014, I expect revenue of $575 million with the operating margin expanding to the 15% to 20% range, and the net income margin in the 9% to 14% range. The impact of the Convio acquisition won't depress margins as much in 2014 as growth in higher margin businesses offsets the impact of the Convio acquisition.Blackbaud is a growth company that offers solutions to a market that is underserved by larger enterprises. The financial performance should act as a tailwind for the valuations.RisksValuationsI'm going to use multiple models to value the common equity shares of Blackbaud; I'll use discounted cash flow models and multiplier models. The average of the model's intrinsic value is the intrinsic value of the common equity shares. I'm assuming a sustainable growth rate of 6% and an adjusted required rate of return of 9%. The current share price is $36.77.Using the discounted cash flow model, I estimate the intrinsic value at $17.33, which makes Blackbaud overvalued. My EPS forecast for next year is $1.57, my justified PE is 20 and Blackbaud is trading at 23 times forward earnings, which means the intrinsic value is $31.97.I'll use the historic multiplier model valuations. The intrinsic value using the price/book ratio is $27.66, using the price/sales ratio is $31.36, using the price/cash flow ratio is $35.07. The average of those values is $31.36, which means Blackbaud is modestly overvalued. But, assuming the 15% 10-year average growth rate, the intrinsic value using this model is $36.07.Given the fact that this is a younger growth company, I'm going to exclude the first valuation metric from the intrinsic value estimate. Thus, the intrinsic value of Blackbaud is $34.02. I think the $31.25 level and below is an accumulation zone.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The margins for these two segments are the highest thus contributing more to the bottom line.Year-to-date performance and the fourth quarter acquisition of MicroEdge resulted in Blackbaud management updating full-year guidance. Yet, Blackbaud shares still trade at a high P/E ratio.","Blackbaud (NASDAQ:BLKB), a provider of software solutions for nonprofit organizations, reported 2014 third quarter earnings after the market closed October 29th. As described here, Blackbaud is positioned to grow as a company by 6% to 10% annually in the non-profit sector which is also projected to grow annually by 8%. Its third quarter results were solid. Revenue grew year-over-year by 13.1% and EPS grew year-over-year by 8.7%. Non-GAAP revenue growth was 7.3%. Its year-to-date metric for non-GAAP revenue growth is 6.9%.Acquisitions have played a key role in Blackbaud's recent history. The Convio acquisition in May, 2012 helped establish its subscription-based revenue model. Through the first six months of 2014, the subscriptions segment totaled $123 million in revenue. The third quarter showed continued growth at $67 million, up 28.9% from the 2013 third quarter. Subscriptions and maintenance represent recurring revenue. In the first nine months of 2013, these segments contributed 69% of Blackbaud's total revenue. For 2014, the year-to-date contribution is 71.8%. Because these segments contribute higher margins, this type of growth is key for Blackbaud. So, not only is revenue increasing but increased amounts are flowing to the bottom line. For 2014, Blackbaud had projected a non-GAAP operating margin of 17.6% with intentions of growing it to 20.5% to 23.5% by 2017. The third quarter non-GAAP operating margin tallied 19%.While Blackbaud delivered steady growth in the third quarter, its fourth quarter began with a bang. Blackbaud acquired MicroEdge, a cloud-based solutions provider for foundations, grant-making and corporate markets. Between the performance achieved already in 2014 and the addition of MicroEdge, Blackbaud increased 2014 full-year guidance. Full-year projected revenue is now $565 million to $570 million with a midpoint of $567.5 million up from a midpoint of $552.5 million. The range for 2014 annual EPS is now $1.25 to $1.29, up from $1.17 to $1.25. To further illustrate the impact of added business in the subscription segment, the updated revenue guidance increased approximately 2.7% while the updated EPS guidance increased approximately 5%.With growth and additions and increases, it is not necessarily surprising that Blackbaud's P/E ratio is inflated compared to the software industry's average. With full-year guidance increasing, Blackbaud's share price may establish yet another 52-week high beyond $42.23 set on October 29th. But, using the midpoint of the latest EPS guidance of $1.27 and the current 52-week high, the P/E ratio equates to over 33. Even though the company pays a quarterly $0.12 dividend, it is still reasonable for a long-term value investor to wait for a share price pullback or adjustment."

A CEO replacement, an office relocation, restructuring and a cost-reduction program followed in 2013.Blackbaud's execution on its strategic plans through 2017 is ""gaining momentum"".","""Corporate stewardship"" is defined as the use of a company's power to improve the lives of people. A London-based think tank named Tomorrow's Company believes companies operate in three contexts: a) global economy, b) social and political and c) natural environment. It makes this poetic observation:Should an investor purposely invest in companies whose corporate responsibility/morality/stewardship/citizenship aligns with his or her own? Does a company taking such a stand warrant an investor choosing it over another competitor?Consider CVS Health's (NYSE:CVS) decision to remove tobacco products from its shelves. For CVS Health, such products were contributing to revenue and removing them does introduce a level of risk. Yet, CVS Health chose to align its corporate vision on improving health and to differentiate itself in that way from its competitors. Opposite CVS Health removing a product and incurring risk, CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) recently announced the addition of a product that helps minimize risk. The rail transporter has an ongoing commitment to emergency preparedness for communities exposed to the rail industry. Its newest program is entitled CSX Operation Respond. The mobile information system provides first responders - firefighters, police, and emergency responders - with timely access to critical information about the content of CSX rail cars, especially hazardous material.Other than compiling a searchable list of keywords representative of corporate stewardship, there must be a way to find the best of the best at achieving stewardship. There may well be. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation Corporate Citizenship Center educates and supports businesses regarding citizenship. The center works with businesses ""dedicated to making a difference."" For the past 15 years, the center has honored excellence in corporate citizenship with annual Citizen Awards. For 2014, the nominations were narrowed to three finalists in each category in September. Winners will be announced in November at an awards ceremony in Washington D.C.The roster is filled with familiar names such as IBM, Wal-Mart, Johnson & Johnson, UPS, Microsoft and 18 others. For the first time, the center divided the Best Corporate Steward award into two categories - 1) Large Business and 2) Small and Middle-Market Business. This change opens the door to learn about lesser-known companies with stewardship values. Two of the three finalists, Blackbaud (NASDAQ:BLKB) and Constant Contact (NASDAQ:CTCT), are publicly traded.What is Blackbaud?Blackbaud does not just have a stewardship bend. It exists because of that golden thread. Blackbaud provides software solutions to non-profit organizations. It offers both cloud-based and in-house applications. From e-marketing to donor management to fundraising to ticket sales to payment processing, the Blackbaud solutions can manage business for all sorts of campaigns whether they be strictly online, for small organizations or global ones, or to benefit the arts or students. Its nomination for Best Corporate Steward Citizen Award reads:A Look BackWhether Blackbaud is deserving of the ultimate honor of Best Small and Middle-Market Corporate Steward will not be the subject. Rather, being nominated may well introduce the company to a host of stewardship-minded investors. Looking at Blackbaud's five-year share price history, one would classify it as a growth stock. The chart below displays, at its highest, a 360% rise in price from 2009's low to the most recent 52-week high.Likewise, the revenue trend in the following chart displays growth. However, net income and EPS have not followed suit. It is pertinent to note management guidance in 2014 and analyst projections in 2015 expect a rebound in profit margins.A deeper look at the revenue growth does not reflect steady growth. In fact, the spike upward in 2012's revenue is in direct opposition to the spike downward in net income. It should be noted that analysts expect a leveling off in revenue growth. This expectation is driven by industry projections and Blackbaud management input. In a September 12th investor presentation, the company published a future organic growth range of 6% to 10%. This is in line with the 8% compound annual growth rate projection for the non-profit sector. The addressable market in 2013 was calculated at $4.4 billion. It is forecast to be $5.9 billion by 2017.Explanation RequiredIt's natural to wonder what happened in 2012. Just as revenue peaks, EPS tanks. In January 2012, Blackbaud announced it would acquire Convio and its Luminate products. The transaction was completed in May 2012. Convio's revenue added to Blackbaud for eight months in 2012. Minus the revenue from acquisitions, Blackbaud's revenue increased 6% or $21.9 million.On the opposite side of the books, the cost of the acquisition definitely took at least a short-term toll on the bottom line. The chart below shows the $63 million increase in expenses from 2011 to 2012. So, total revenue increased nearly $77 million from $371 million to $447 million with $58.6 million coming from the subscriptions segment. Gross profit in Blackbaud's subscription segment increased $32 million. But, that gain was more than offset by the expense and negated any immediate benefit which is not necessarily unusual in such a situation.The acquisition of Convio was partially financed through long-term debt. Along with such comes interest payment obligations and debt payments. The acquisition required Blackbaud to increase its borrowing capacity which also resulted in costs.For the long term, however, the Convio acquisition is expected to be a gem. First, it jump-started Blackbaud's transition to a subscription-based revenue model. From 2011 to 2013, this segment doubled its revenue from $104 million to $213 million. And, already in 2014, the segment has contributed $123 million, up 23.5% from the same quarter in 2013. The EBITDA margins from this segment are high at 24.9%. The retention rate is expected to be strong at a minimum of 90%. In the next four years, the migration to cloud solutions is expected to go from 30% to 60%. This adoption is being driven by several factors that favor the customer including secure availability anywhere and any time without the headache of installing and maintaining an IT infrastructure.With the Passage of 2013By the end of 2012, Blackbaud had incurred $6.9 million in restructuring and integration costs specifically related to the Convio acquisition. It knew more was required and implemented a cost-reduction program in January 2013. By mid-February, the impact in the first quarter alone was projected to be an additional $5.8 million. However, when the year ended, the total charge for Convio integration was only $1.8 million. The cost-reduction program resulted in a one-time expense of $3.5 million.Also known by mid-February 2013 was that Blackbaud's CEO would leave by at least year-end. On January 23rd, the company released the announcement:By year-end, Blackbaud had incurred $2.4 million of incremental costs related to severance for the former CEO and search costs for a new CEO. On November 13, 2013, Blackbaud announced the appointment of its new CEO, Michael Gianoni.One factor of the cost-reduction program was the relocation of Blackbaud's San Diego location to Austin, Texas. The process started in 2012 when the decision was made to not renew the San Diego office space. While $175,000 of the expense was incurred in 2012, the majority, $307,000, of the total expense ($482,000) hit in 2013.The second factor of the cost-reduction plan included a headcount reduction. The workforce was trimmed by 135 positions throughout 2013. Severance costs were $3.2 million by the end of the year.As early as the first quarter reporting for 2013 in May, Blackbaud was sensing recovery.By year-end 2013, Blackbaud's general and administrative expenses had decreased nearly $13 million from $63.1 million to $50.3 million. The chart below highlights the rebound in profit margin.Standing in 2014 Blackbaud has 29,000+ active customers. At the end of 2013, its largest single customer accounted for only approximately 1% of its consolidated revenue. Blackbaud does have competition from software providers such as Ellucian, Abila (formerly Sage Nonprofit Solutions), FrontStream Payments, Bloomerang and Campus Management. However, it believes its competitive advantage is being a one-stop shop. It believes it is the only of its competition to offer a comprehensive suite of products on an integrated platform.Even though Blackbaud's suite of products fully covers the needs in its market, it believes there is still room for optimization and synergy. Besides Convio, Blackbaud has acquired 3 other companies, EverydayHero, Public Interest Data, and MyCharity, in the past 3 years. In the 2014 second quarter, it completed the acquisition of WhippleHill, a solutions provider for K-12 private schools. By the end of 2014, it expects to have completed the acquisition of yet another, MicroEdge, a specialist in philanthropic giving management. Its intentions in the next five years are to merge and integrate its base products and acquired products from a total of 19 products down to 9 best-of-breed products. While there will be an R&D expense related to such a project, the end result is expected to be larger profit margins by year-end 2017.On the back-office side, Blackbaud will continue to consolidate and improve internal processes and systems. Applications for sales automation, marketing automation and professional services will be ported to a single platform. Manual processes for travel and expense management, compensation and commission management and proposal to contract management will be automated. These operational improvements are also expected to contribute to larger profit margins. In the next three years, Blackbaud plans to improve margins by 3% to 6%.Blackbaud intends to pay for these improvements by using just over half of its operating cash flow. One quarter (~25%) of the cash flow will be returned to shareholders through either a dividend or its share repurchase program. Finally, the remaining 20% will be used to maintain Blackbaud's balance sheet by paying down debt and building a healthy cash balance.Through the second quarter reporting, Blackbaud's execution on its three-year plan is ""gaining momentum"":Regarding its drive toward operational efficiency:How Much Further?As Blackbaud stabilizes its footing and rebalances from its myriad of changes, its future potential becomes more reliable. The total addressable market is $4.4 billion. Blackbaud has captured 11.4%. The total addressable market is projected to grow to $5.9 billion by 2017. This represents an 8% compound annual growth rate. Blackbaud projects its revenue will grow 6% to 10% through 2017. If Blackbaud maintains its 11.4% share, its revenue would be $673 million.Blackbaud's non-GAAP operating margin projection for 2014 is 17.6%. Its strategy is to grow that margin to a range of 20.5% to 23.5% by 2017. The table below details various options (lowest-growth case, mid-point and best-growth case) for Blackbaud using this data:Relative to Blackbaud's 50-day moving average of $38.55, even using a 2017 EPS range of $1.64 to $2.11, the forward P/E ratio is high (ranging from 18.27 to 23.5). This suggests Blackbaud is overvalued at its current price. The software industry average P/E is 19.4 while Blackbaud's current P/E ratio is 52.44. This, too, suggests Blackbaud's share price may well have run ahead of a fair valuation. Growth or momentum stocks are often granted a higher P/E to accommodate the designation. Yet, even with analysts projecting five-year EPS growth at 19% annually, a YPEG valuation for Blackbaud equals just $25.46. Even the $0.48 annual dividend does not warrant being paid to wait while earnings catch up with the share price. Should the share price revisit the 52-week low of $29.42, the valuation gets more reasonable and attractive.SummaryCorporate stewardship may well be the golden thread that connects us all. Investors are certainly entitled to include corporate stewardship as an investment criteria. At the same time, investors are stewards of their personal investments. Probable growth potential, a reliable dividend, and dominating a niche market are enticing investment qualities. But, the share price shouldn't be ignored and already out of reach. Blackbaud may exist to service non-profits but it is reasonable for investors in Blackbaud to expect a profit."

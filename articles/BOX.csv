4379222,103480,2020-10-15T10:55:33-04:00,"Box recently hosted an investor day in which the company shared its viewpoint on the business through FY24 for the first time.
        The company expects to hit the ""rule of 40"" by FY24, which Box defines slightly differently than other companies: revenue growth plus FCF margin.
        Between now and FY24, Box expects to raise its rule of 40 score by at least five points annually, which may be a big upside tailwind for the stock.
        Shares of Box look incredibly modestly valued at ~3x forward revenues.","One stock that I've thought, for years, to be underappreciated by the markets is Box (BOX). The content management and collaboration software company has long been punished by investors for its slowing growth and the fact that it competes in a market versus high-profile competitors including Dropbox (DBX) and Google Drive (GOOG).But this year, as high-flying cloud software stocks have taken off and left Box in the dust, the valuation disparity has become even more pronounced. In my view, this makes Box a great solution to maintaining exposure to the cloud SaaS sector without risking overpaying in a stock that may reverse a lot of gains if market sentiment turns south again.Year to date, shares of Box are relatively flat, underperforming a ~6% gain for the S&P 500 and much more than that for Box's SaaS software peers.To me, I think the key driver for Box to achieve a valuation re-rating from investors is its consistent execution. In September, Box laid out its vision for the business through FY24 for the first time, and the company is pointing to aggressive free cash flow expansion targets driven by clear, actionable drivers. The fact that Box's valuation still sits so low now is a signal that the market is skeptical that Box can hit the numbers it laid out - even though we've already seen tremendous progress on margin expansion in the year to date.First, a quick update on Box's valuation - at the company's current share price near $18, Box trades at a market cap of $2.76 billion. After we net off the $271.9 million of cash and $70.0 million of debt on Box's latest balance sheet, we arrive at an enterprise value of $2.56 billion.For the next fiscal year, analysts expect Box to generate $845.4 million in revenue (per Yahoo Finance). This represents just 10% y/y growth, which I think is a conservative target given that Box expects to be at 12-16% y/y revenue growth in FY24 (more on that shortly). Regardless, against that revenue view, Box trades at just 3.0x EV/FY21 revenue - far below most other cloud software stocks, even those growing at just the low teens like Box.The bottom line here: investors who are willing to wait out Box's profitability execution have an opportunity to buy into a tremendous value stock. Despite all the criticisms levied against Box for playing in a competitive field, once installed, Box isn't going anywhere. A team's files that are neatly foldered in Box and afforded all the enterprise-grade security and data management tools that Box provides can't be uprooted to a competitor like Dropbox without some level of hassle and pain. That's why Box enjoys among the most reliable recurring revenue streams in the SaaS sphere, one of the early adopters of a ""land and expand"" business model.Stay long here and look to add to your position on any dips.As previously mentioned, Box has charted out a new growth plus profitability trajectory through FY24 (February 2023 through January 2024) that, in my view, can be a driver to increasing Box's share price over time as long as Box can execute to this plan.Box defines its ""rule of 40"" as revenue growth plus FCF margin (slightly different from many other companies that define it as revenue growth plus pro forma operating margin, but the concept is very similar). Last year, Box's rule of 40 score was rather low at 13%, but this year, the company expects to make a twelve-point improvement to 25% (driven primarily by FCF margin expansion, into which we'll dive into the drivers shortly). Over the next three years, as shown in the chart below, Box expects to add at least five ""points"" per year until hitting >40% in FY24:Figure 1. Box growth + FCF margin expectations over timeSource: Box September investor presentationNaturally, Box expects most of this progress toward hitting the ""rule of 40"" to come from free cash flow expansion. In the very useful chart below, you can see the profile at which Box is operating now (in the FY21 guidance column) versus where it wants to be in FY24. To me, the takeaway from this operating model is that Box expects a low-teens revenue growth rate to be its long-term baseline for growth (in other words, Box's growth has stabilized and hopefully won't decelerate any further), while the company hopes to drive 20+ points of FCF margin improvement and ~15 points of pro forma operating margin improvements through a combination of gross margin gains and operating cost efficiencies.Figure 2. Box FY24 target operating modelSource: Box September investor presentationLet's start with the growth piece first, however. To me, sustaining a low-teens growth rate through and past FY24 for Box is believable due to the sheer weight of Box's TAM. Box investors are aware that Box has faithfully expanded its product lineup over the years, most recently adding security tools like Box Shield as well as layering AI capabilities (Box Skills) over its entire product portfolio. The result is that Box - which began solely as a content collaboration company with a ~$15 billion TAM - now addresses a $55 billion overall market. This implies that Box, at its current ~$800 million annualized revenue run rate, is less than 2% penetrated into its overall market. So yes - while the competition from other vendors like Dropbox is fierce, this space does offer a large enough market to have multiple high-profile vendors.Figure 3. Box TAM segmentationSource: Box September investor presentationThe other point that Box wants to stress on growth is that its existing customer base already has plenty of room for upward revenue expansion. Box, which prices on a per-seat basis, notes that its existing install base has room for up to 7x seat expansions already (roughly translating to a 7x revenue multiplier if all those seats were filled). In other words, even if Box were to struggle to land any new clients, its existing ones already provide enough opportunity for revenue growth to get Box through at least FY24, if not even substantially further than that. And as I've previously mentioned, once Box is installed, it's difficult to rip out - so once a company has invested into the Box ecosystem, it's likely committing to it for a long time.Figure 4. Box expansion potentialSource: Box September investor presentationThe meat of Box's rule of 40 ambitions, however, are to come from the margin side. You can see in the chart below that Box has made tremendous progress in its free cash flow over the years, with the most significant leap expected to be made this year. At the time of Box's IPO, the company was famous for being a ""money losing house of horrors"" - and with pro forma operating margins and FCF margins at -44% and -39% back then, it's not difficult to see why Box earned that moniker.But in the five years since, Box has made tremendous profitability gains, with this year expected to deliver margin improvements in the mid teens:Figure 5. Box cash flow/operating margin improvementsSource: Box September investor presentationThere are two key drivers of Box's expected free cash flow gains. The first is on the gross margin side. We'e already seen this year that Box's investments into infrastructure will pay off from a unit-economics standpoint as Box continues to scale. In Box's most recent quarter (2Q21), the company achieved 180bps of pro forma gross margin expansion to 73.5%. Box believes that its gross margin profile will top out in the ~75% range, so it's already not a long way off from its ideal state.Figure 5. Box gross margin trendsSource: Box September investor presentationOf course, to hit a >40% rule of 40 score, Box needs ~25% FCF margins (versus this year's expected 15% margin) alongside its 12-16% revenue growth target. Roughly two of those points will come from gross margin expansion, but the remainder will come from operating cost efficiencies. Box has laid out clear drivers to get there as well:In my view, Box's goal of hitting a >40% rule of 40 score is a highly achievable target, especially given the margin progress that Box has made this year.If we do a rough and simple extrapolation into the future and apply a ~12% revenue growth rate for Box each year through FY24, then apply a 25% FCF margin on the resulting FY24 revenue, we'd get to a ballpark ~$270 million free cash flow target by FY24, meaning that in addition to trading at ~3x next year's revenue target, Box is also trading at <10x its future free cash flow potential. To me, Box has provided plenty of fundamental incentives to invest in this stock early on in its profit-acceleration plan. Stay long here."

Investors have to be patient for Box to evolve new use cases and product features. Box is pulling all the right strings to deliver outstanding results in the long run. Given the appeal of content storage and collaboration platforms, the subdued valuation makes the potential payoff from Box's current options attractive.Global Reach-Content Collaboration-Seat Expansion-Regulatory ComplianceSource: BoxBox offers cloud content collaboration and storage products for small and large enterprises. These products have a global reach. Demand for cloud content platforms has boosted Box's growth factor in recent quarters. Box has also gotten ahead of possible demand-side headwinds by adding security and privacy capabilities to its offerings. Box is experiencing sluggish growth in a market with relatively low growth due to market saturation. Players with these growth dynamics have to add new features to drive customer retention and engagement. They also have to explore cost-cutting measures to accelerate FCF growth. Box has set all initiatives to drive total shareholder return in motion.Going forward, Box is guiding for 10% revenue growth in FY'21. This will be driven by selling into its installed base. This strategy has limited upside in the short term. In the long run, Box has to deliver more growth initiatives for the market to rerate its growth factor.Platform-Cost Cutting-Product Updates-Margins-FCFBox has to keep evolving the capabilities of its products to retain customers and to drive upsell. Since Box's primary solution is content management, it has to be more creative when evolving its platform. Securing the downsides is just as important as securing the upsides.Securing the downsides involves investing in privacy and security capabilities to ensure compliance across all content sharing regions. Securing the downsides also involves investing in features to drive customer retention. Box has plans to introduce more features at BoxWorks Digital.Cloud software companies organize these conferences with doubts about the market's ability to understand the pace of innovation and ideas being shared. Going forward, these doubts will cease to exist. There will be more customers and developers demanding new features and solutions to accelerate their digital transformation initiatives.Securing the upsides requires the extensibility of its platform. In Box's case, since it has a primary solution that revolves around content management, it has to sit with top IT execs across multiple industries to work out scalable use cases for its offerings. This means Box will seldom wait for developers to create new solutions. This doesn't prevent it from offering tools to developers to explore new use cases for its products.FinancialsBox's gross margin is expected to improve due to its cost optimization activities. GAAP gross margin improved by 100 basis points last quarter. Box doesn't have any product to defund. Therefore, cost management will be more of a cost-efficiency drive. As the chart below explains, SG&A expense as a percent of overall revenue is improving.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Box has to achieve its business efficiency target, while growing ACV (annual contract value) by convincing customers to make more upfront commitments. The risk to this expectation can be hedged with access to external credit facilities to smoothen billings volatility. With time, deferred revenue will ramp to shore up cash flow. The improving cash flow trend is reassuring. The cash on its balance sheet is also attractive.Integrations-Partnerships-International ExpansionBox has to integrate and partner with other cloud platforms to drive usage and retention. While it is one of the best players in the content collaboration space, its leadership position will only be sustained by collaborating with other productivity and business continuity platforms. Management highlighted interesting collaborations during the last earnings call:On the macro front, Box will have to endure shorter payment plans from SMBs impacted by COVID-19. Box has the liquidity to stomach this short-term volatility. The dynamics between billings and margins improvement will keep more cash in the door. This will push the bulk of value creation to sales execs and product designers who need to keep experimenting until usability hacks drive better customer retention.Analysts-Momentum-Moat-Cash FlowSource: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha, peers include: Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), Atlassian (TEAM), and, Slack (NYSE:WORK))Box has a low future growth forecast and low valuation ratios compared to its peers. Companies in this spot are mostly in the middle of a turnaround or strategy revision. Box recently named three new directors to its board after Starboard's recent stake in the business. This indicates there is more value to be unlocked.Mispricing is created when the market underestimates a product, which is still a small percentage of revenue or capabilities that can drive more value. In Box's case, its industry-specific solutions have the potential to be a huge success. Helping clients across multiple sectors to create new business workflows and collaboration solutions could lead to more revenue-generating ideas. As it stands, the existing features have to evolve to address more complex IT workflows beyond regulatory compliance and document signing capabilities. As these capabilities evolve, Box's valuation will reflect its true potentials. In the meantime, investors should monitor new product updates.Source: AuthorThe most significant risk factor with Box is demand. Market saturation means cost-efficiency initiatives have to yield the expected outcome until it finds a lasting solution to revitalize growth.Financial risk factors will only be a concern if talent management cost is proving challenging to optimize. Macro risk factors will be fleeting due to strong demand for cloud collaboration platforms. Valuation risk factors will also be of little concern as Box is already trading at a depressed valuation compared to its peers.Investors have to wait for Box to keep evolving new use cases for its products. Valuation is attractive for investors that want to bet on the optionality that its solutions offer. Box has to keep working on new and existing features with the hope of driving customer retention and expansion.

The company's future growth will be driven by its ability to continue its land-and-expand model while innovating against larger competitors. Potential investors would have to pay 4.16 price-to-sales, which does not appear unreasonable based on Box's historical trading multiples.With the shelter-in-place situation, many companies had to allow their companies to work from home and build the infrastructure to support it. With these infrastructure investments, it is unlikely that companies would simply switch back to the old way of working once the situation improves. This shift will continue to drive demand for remote work solutions and cloud platforms like Box. Box CEO Aaron Levie highlights this from his experience: (Source: Box Transcript)Box has continued to expand its integrations with partners like Teams and Zoom, where usage has grown dramatically over the past few months. This would help the company compete against larger companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) who have been increasing their presence in this space.Box has also been launching multiple features such as automated malware detection and controls in Box Shield, Box for Slack integration and Box Connector for Okta Workflows. These improvements have helped Box increase its value proposition and retain its market leadership presence in cloud content management. (Source: Investor Presentation) Box is still in the early stages of capturing the full potential of use-cases within organizations. In most large organizations, Box has only penetrated roughly 10-20% of employees. As more companies go through an accelerated digital transformation, it is likely that Box will encounter more companies that will launch Box company-wide for all their employees. This increased conversions would then help to drive revenues at a faster pace: (Source: Box Transcript) Customers have also been adopting more of the add-on products launched by Box such as Shield. Customers that adopt at least one of Box's add-on products now represent about 54% of recurring revenue compared to 45% one year ago. As companies use more of Box's add-on products, it increases the inertia of switching content management platforms. Companies wouldn't want to risk employee friction in learning to use a new platform, which could lead to business disruption and lost productivity. The use of more add-on products would help Box retain pricing power in future years.The management initially set its sights on achieving $1B in revenue by fiscal 2022/2023. However, they have removed that deadline and created uncertainty on when they will achieve that goal. We expect growth to be roughly 10% for the next 5 years, driven by accelerating digital transformations and companies expanding their usage of Box to most employees.The company appears to be experiencing some operating leverage as sales growth slows. In fact, the company has experienced an improvement of non-GAAP operating margin by 11% year-over-year to 9.4%. We expect this figure to continue to grow to roughly 25% in 2024 as Box's growth in expenses slows down. (Source: Investor Presentation)Despite the more than 100% increase in stock price since March, the company's price to sales ratio of 4.16 is not trading at historical highs. For investors who believe in the long term prospects in the company, the current price of Box now appears fair. This is reflected in a price to sales ratio that is towards the middle of its trading range over the last five years.(Source: Seeking Alpha Data)However, Box faces intense competition in its space that may lead to slower customer adoption on its platform. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) offers free storage options with its Office Suites subscriptions. Even though Box exhibit a slight resemblance of customer switching costs, it is possible enterprises will choose to adopt free SharePoint and OneDrive solution instead of paying an additional vendor like Box.Another risk for Box could be extended downtime. If it happens, it would lead to business disruption and prevent enterprises from functioning and collaborating normally. This could lead users to lose faith in the platform and lead to increased customer churn. As such, Box has to ensure that it invests heavily to ensure that there is as little downtime as possible. The presence of this risk reduces the switching costs advantage for Box.Box has steady growth over the years and has room to grow due to acceleration in digital transformation. The company's switching costs could help maintain its competitive position against larger competitors as more companies adopt its add-on products. Box's stock price appears fair relative to its historical trading multiples. Hence, investors who believe in the long-term prospects of the company would not be paying a premium for the company."

Barriers to entry in the cloud content management market are low, and many of the areas in which Box competes evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies. Box faces competition from an array of technology providers, such as traditional cloud content management companies, newer mobile enterprise companies, simple file sync and share companies, and social collaboration companies. The company also faces significant competition from competing platforms developed for SaaS cloud content management.The company's primary competitors are Microsoft, Google, Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), and Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX). Box competes with its competitors based on enterprise-grade security and compliance, ease of user experience, price, customer support, and speed, availability, and reliability of its service. The company's ability to remain competitive depends on its ongoing performance in the areas of core technical innovation and product development.Box's first quarter fiscal year 2021 revenue came in at $183.6 million, up 13% from the year-ago period. The company's billings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 came in at $128.1 million, up 8% from the year-ago period. Non-GAAP net income per share in the quarter was $0.10, compared to a net loss per share of $0.03 in the year-ago period. The company's free cash flow in the quarter was $39.8 million, compared to $13.4 million in the year-ago period.The company delivered strong results in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 amid a challenging macroeconomic environment. These results were driven by remote work and digital transformation strategies of organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the COVID-19 pandemic still in action, Box's fiscal year 2021 results are expected to remain strong and resilient.

In addition, the company's KeySafe and Box Shield products offer better quality of data protection compared to many of the competitor products. Box global chief information security officer Lakshmi Hanspal said:These products are enjoying growing adoption in a continuously growing market. These products, plus the company's other solutions mentioned in the Growth Drivers section, will drive its revenue growth higher in the next five years.Box is a high growth company. In the last five years, its revenue has grown at a CAGR of 18.82%. I believe revenue will grow in mid-teens in the next five years. The company's trailing 12-month revenue is $716.9 million. If revenue grows at a CAGR of 15% in the next five years, its mid-2025 revenue will be $1,442 million, or $9.40 per share. In the last one year, the company's stock has traded between the price to sales multiples of 2x and 4x. Applying a price to sales multiple of 4x on the company's mid-2025 revenue per share, I get $37.60 as its mid-2025 share price. If the price to sales multiple rises more, the share price will also rise more.For improving the company's operating results, it is required that Box's customers renew their subscriptions upon expiration of existing subscription. Box's retention rate was high, although it has decreased over time. Retention rate may decrease due to many reasons, such as customers' satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the company's services, the performance of the company's partners and resellers, and the company's pricing vis-à-vis the pricing of competitors' products and services. If Box fails to drive retention rate higher, its revenue growth and operating results may be negatively impacted.Box sells its products to U.S. federal and state and foreign government customers, which is subject to additional challenges and risks. Selling to government customers requires significant time and expense, with no guarantee that these efforts will result in a sale. Government entities may have legal rights to terminate contracts with Box. The termination could occur due to a default or for their (government) convenience, which may negatively impact Box's revenue growth and operating results.Box is offering its customers the tools for digital transformation in these challenging and unprecedented times. Organizations are embracing digital transformation like never before, and this is an opportunity for Box to grow its revenue. I believe the company will be able to capitalize on this opportunity with its strong product portfolio and efficient management team. Box is a good business to own for the long term."
4371384,103480,2020-08-28T12:21:50-04:00,"Shares of Box rallied ~5% after the company delivered a very strong Q2 earnings print.
        The company's growth rates more or less held to the prior quarter, a testament to the resilience of its recurring revenue model amid a downturn.
        Probably the biggest highlight, however, was Box's tremendous improvement in profitability margins.
        The combination of balanced growth plus an enriched bottom line makes the case for a multiples expansion for Box's cheap stock.","For about as long as Box has been a publicly traded company, investors have been unsure about the stock. In its early days, Box (BOX) was derided as one of the poster children for the ""grow at all costs"" mindset and excess of Silicon Valley companies. More recently, investors have questioned Box's ability to grow amid fierce competition from the likes of Dropbox (DBX) and Google Drive (GOOG), and whether in the long run Box would be reduced to a commodity service.Yet Box's most recent quarterly results showed that these fears were overblown. Not only has the company managed to produce decent growth in the midst of a pandemic, but also used the opportunity to drive fantastic profitability gains. Box has proven that once it is installed in an organization, it becomes part of the infrastructure and is very difficult to rip out.Shares have rallied after the earnings release to the tune of ~5%:I continue to view plenty of upside for Box. The biggest driver here is the fact that Box has long been one of the (perhaps only) cheap value stocks within the enterprise software sector, but there are plenty of fundamental triggers for Box's stock as well:Then of course, there's the deep-value element of Box that lets us assume that Box is just waiting to be ""discovered"" to the point where it can rally and course-correct to a more appropriate valuation multiple - similar to what Salesforce.com (CRM) did in the same week as Box's earnings. At current share prices near $20, Box's market cap is $3.11 billion. After netting off $271.9 million of cash on Box's most recent balance sheet against $70 million of debt, its enterprise value is $2.91 billion. Versus Wall Street's FY21 revenue estimates of $839.7 million (+10% y/y; data from Yahoo Finance), Box trades at a mere 3.5x EV/FY21 revenue. Though it's no longer growing as fast as most peer SaaS companies, the fact that most software companies now trade at double-digit valuation multiples leaves plenty of headroom for Box to rise. Importantly, Box is a ""safe"" investment at a time when most tech stocks are trading at unsupportable all-time highs. To me, this is Box's time to shine.Let's now review Box's most recent results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Box Q2 earnings resultsSource: Box Q2 earnings releaseBox's revenue grew 11% y/y to $192.3 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $189.6 million (+10% y/y). And importantly, Box's revenue growth also only showed a minor two-point slowdown relative to 13% y/y growth in Q1. Many other software companies saw much worse deterioration. But perhaps even more important is that Box actually managed to accelerate billings growth. Box's billings growth rate this quarter clocked in at 9% y/y - no, this isn't a growth rate to write home about, but it was better than 8% y/y in Q1. As most software investors know, billings represents a better view of how companies' underlying sales trends are moving, because it captures deals signed beyond what will be recognized as revenue in the current quarter. Box noted that its strength in both revenue and billings was driven by existing customers expanding their relationships with Box - a testament to how sticky the platform is and how it can continue to provide increasing value over the customer lifecycle. Per CEO Aaron Levie's remarks on the Q2 earnings call:Box's biggest achievements this quarter, however, are o the profitability side. The company managed to drive a sixteen point improvement in pro forma operating margins from 0% in 2Q19 to 16% this quarter. When you add up Box's revenue growth rate of 11% to its pro forma operating margins, its corresponding ""rule of 40"" score of 27 puts it closer to that magical threshold of 40 than Box has ever been, and leaves us scratching our heads at Box's low valuation multiple.Figure 2. Box operating margin trendsSource: Box Q2 earnings releaseBox has seized the pandemic as an opportunity to hone in on profitability. The company has taken ""an ROI-based approach to spend"" across all components of the company, and especially on go-to-market efficiency. Now for the full year, Box is now committing to driving pro forma operating margins of 12-13%, one to two points better than its original outlook of 11% (representing up to ~$15 million of additional profit this year, at Box's current scale), which is substantially better than last year's operating margin of just 1%. To me, it's Box's continued improvements on profitability and its commitment to a growth-plus-margin mindset of managing the business will the primary driver in pushing Box's valuation multiple upward. On the product side, Box continues to reliably add new features and modules to its platform and cross-selling these products to its customer base and driving expansion revenue. Stay long here."

Without visionary, agile leadership, a company will ultimately stagnate.With that being said, Box has a strong customer base of 95,000 companies, including 69% of the companies in the S&P 500.And with that being said, abysmally, Box has a 104% retention rate, which is evidence of management that's unable to evolve its offering and continue to create value for clients.While I am somewhat critical of management, I find that the stock offers compelling value at its current valuation, though I am not a buyer.","Source: Box, Inc. - EventsAs we're well aware, the world is presently undergoing a digital transformation, which is being expedited as more people work from home. Box (BOX) is a cloud-based SaaS platform that provides a secure platform for content collaboration management (CCM). Box's goal is to make it possible to work from anywhere with anyone by enabling companies to securely share files, such as contracts and projects on which a team might be working within a corporation. Box integrates into the workspace as it is compatible with nearly 1,500 integrations including Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Salesforce (CRM), and Zoom (ZM).Here's a little video to dip your toes in the water:Box: Simplify how you workAs you watched in the video above, Box helps companies collaborate securely from anywhere.Alright, so that was the good... now for the bad. Regardless of how one might feel about Box or its products, the numbers do not lie.The company has failed to evolve its offering through value-added additional services and features, and therefore, its net retention rate is hovering at around 100%, which is utterly abysmal in today's world of Twilios (TWLO) (net retention rate above 130% consistently), CrowdStrikes (OTC:CRWD) (net retention rate above 120% consistently, and Fastlys (FSLY) (net retention rate recently above 130%).Software as a service is a winning business model because 1) it ensures that a company's, for example, cybersecurity department is always evolving, as the free market forces the company to which cybersecurity was outsourced to constantly evolve.In the case of Box, it has failed to evolve its offering and continue to aggressively add new value-added products for its existing customers, resulting in this low net retention rate.With all of this being said, the company does have a captive audience and trades at a reasonable valuation, and therefore, a case could be made for investment.So, let's check that out.Source: Box's 2019 Brand Overview SlideshowBox had 95,000 subscription-based customers in 2019, a 9% increase from the prior year (which only further highlights how inexcusable the 104% net retention rate is). Box remains useful to its clients and has demonstrated its ability to create value and efficiencies in the past.For example, Broadcom (AVGO) started using Box in 2014 to transfer portions of its workflows to the cloud and to introduce collaborative file sharing, which has saved Broadcom $10 million over the past five years. Box enables companies, in this case, Broadcom, to use tools such as Adobe (ADBE), Google, and Oracle (ORCL) to run its business more efficiently.As mentioned above, Box had a 104% net retention rate as of January 2020, which isn't a positive sign for the company, generally speaking. Net retention rate is defined as the amount of revenue generated on the existing customer base less downgrades and churn. Think of it as an indicator of how much customers like your product and how much customers are willing to be upsold on new products. The higher the net retention rate, the better, obviously...In this article, it was found that the median net retention rate was 110% for SaaS companies. Therefore, Box is below the median net retention rate.With that being said, the company continues to add to its services by making its product compatible with other platforms as well as incorporating new technology, such as data analytics.Source: Box's 2019 Brand Overview SlideshowThough Box shared this nice graphic at its investor day, the reality is that the net retention rate is currently only at 104%. Juxtapose this to companies such as Twilio and CrowdStrike (both approximately 120-140%), whose net retention rates are well above 110%, and we see that the company isn't performing well, which is being reflected in its share price.CrowdStrike's Net Retention RateSource: CrowdStrike's Dollar-based Net RetentionBox's business model focuses on expanding its platform over time so that it can rise above this lackluster 104% net retention rate by which it is currently vexed. As can be seen in the chart immediately above, Box has been expanding its services.Source: Box's 2019 Brand Overview SlideshowThe add-on services play an important role because it drives customers' spending (i.e., accelerates the net retention rate). Box has focused on being easily compatible with many integrations (as mentioned above). In addition, Box has an open API making it compatible with its customers' homegrown software.Now that we understand Box's business model, let's explore the company's plan to ""fix"" its net retention rate.Box estimates that there is a $45 billion market for content and collaboration, and as the #1 cloud content management platform, Box is well-positioned to capture this market. Box has spent $300M annually on marketing and sales over the past three years, and it targets increasing the productivity around this spend. This is a key factor for the improvement of the company's financials, as highlighted below.Source: Box's 2019 Brand Overview SlideshowBox's 15% increase in sales productivity will lead to not only stronger financials but also faster-growing revenues, which have basically stagnated as of late (relative to its peers). Increasing sales in the short term are vital for Box because the faster it can obtain a new customer, the sooner that Box will profit off them... granted the company can carry through with its plan retaining customers and increasing net retention rate through ""add-on"" products.Source: Box's 2019 Brand Overview SlideshowThis figure represents how Box is strategically focusing on acquiring customers, so it can reap the benefits in the future. Box focuses on cross-selling and upselling to build the customer's value early on so that margins will be stronger in the future. As can be seen below, Box has steadily decreased the costs to acquire new customers.Source: Box's 2019 Brand Overview SlideshowAs Box looks to expand its market, it will also focus on reducing the costs for new customers.In September of 2019, Starboard Value, a hedge fund, acquired a 7.7% stake in Box. In not so many words, Jeffrey Smith and Starboard Value are attempting to get Box out of the proverbial mud. That is, the company is currently spending a lot and growing a little... A toxic combination of the creation of value to be sure. In an interview in October of 2019, Starboard Value CEO Jeffery Smith said Box was a healthy company that is well-capitalized, growing with a good business, and capable of growing profitably while reinvesting in its business's growth.Source: YouTube.comThe company was profitable for the fiscal year 2020, but Starboard Value is working with Box to continue to cut operating margins to drive free cash flow. Jack Lazar, former GoPro (GPRO) CFO, was added to Box's Board of Directors as well as Bethany Mayer, who currently serves on the Board of Directors of Lam Research Inc. (NASDAQ:LRCX), Marvell Technologies (MRVL), and Sempra Energy (SRE). By adding experienced members to its board, Box will look to operate more efficiently.Source: Box's 2019 Brand Overview SlideshowAs the graph above illustrates, Box plans to grow revenue, while cutting costs. This approach accurately reflects how Box has been spending over the last three years to improve its services compatibility while increasing sales to create long-term customers. Box expects to see free cash flow rise as it reduces the outlays required to acquire new customers and as it ""adds on"" new value-added products to its customers' existing subscriptions.Source: Box's 2019 Brand Overview SlideshowAs can be seen above, Box has steadily increased revenues and projects a 12% annualized top-line growth rate through 2023. This appears achievable as revenue increased by 20% in 2019 and 14% in 2020.To determine a fair value for Box's stock, we will employ our proprietary valuation model. Here's what it entails:Now, let's check out the results.Assumptions:Using the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model, Box is currently valued at $28.50, which means Box is currently undervalued by 30% while trading at $20.I used a conservative estimate for Box's free cash growth because I wanted to leave room for executional error, i.e., revenue growth below our projected 8% rate. As mentioned above, Box expects to grow revenue at about 12% annually for the next three years, so 8% growth over the next 10 years should be attainable, especially since the cloud content management market is growing as are its current customers.Lastly, I calculate total expected return by growing free cash flow per share at the above-assumed growth rate, then applying a conservative price to free cash flow multiple on that free cash flow per share in 2030.I then take the target price in 2030 and the current stock price and create a CAGR, the results of which can be seen below:Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelAccording to our model, investing in Box today should beat the market for the long-term investor, as its expected return is higher than our 9.8% hurdle rate, the return of the S&P 500 over the last 90 years.Ultimately, the true measure of whether Box will grow in the future will be borne out by its net retention rate.It will identify whether the CEO and his management team are evolving the product they currently sell.Further, the bar is very low. They are targeting ""greater than 106% net retention rate"", as can be seen below.In sum, Box is a case study on what can go wrong when investing in ""as a service"" companies. That is, if management is not visionary, agile, and adaptive, the company can find itself spinning its wheels in the mud so to speak.With all of this being said, at $20 a share, I am bullish on Box and expect it to beat the market, with modest returns between 10% and 11% over the long run.As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow for more, and happy investing."
4335688,104952,2020-04-02T13:51:16-04:00,"Despite exceeding expectations in Q4 2020, Box still has a lot to do to improve its top-line growth and profitability.Box now has a fully ramped-up CCM suite that will strengthen its FY 2021 plan to drive growth and profitability through add-ons and expansions.Add-on bookings were up by 60% YoY in Q4 and represent 17% of total recurring revenue today.Completion of data migration and cost discipline initiatives will drive margin expansion.The company is committed to the ""rule of 25"", where it expects to finish FY 2021 with a combination of 25% in revenue growth and FCF margin.","Despite exceeding expectations in Q4 2020, Box (NYSE:BOX) still has a lot to do to improve its top-line growth and profitability. The company grew its revenue by ~14% YoY to $696.26 million in FY 2020, while the operating cash flow (OCF) margin dropped by ~250 bps to ~6.4%. In FY 2021, we expect the recently launched Box Shield and Box Relay to drive growth through the installed base expansion and price increases. Furthermore, the expected completion of hybrid hosting migration and cost discipline initiatives will drive margin expansion. The introduction of Shield and Relay in FY 2020 marked the completion of Box's shift to a full-fledged Cloud Content Management (CCM) player. Having developed a complete CCM suite that has given confidence to reach the 25% commitment in growth and FCF margin, Box is running out of excuses to not deliver in FY 2021.The completion of Shield and Relay in FY 2020 is a piece of good news to start the year. Box had experienced a sales execution issue at the beginning of last year, which we believe can be eased by having a complete CCM offering. Upon the completion of the CCM transition, we had initially expected the company to equally focus on new sales and the existing installed base to drive growth. However, the company's recent commitment to aim for a combination of 25% in revenue growth + free cash flow (FCF) margin by the end of the year means it will be focusing more on the installed base expansion. Overall, such a rule of 25 is a sensible move given its higher-margin approach to drive growth. There is solid upside potential on both metrics, given how well add-on and overall booking activities went in Q4.(source: Box's Q4 earnings call slide)As per the Q4 earnings report, Box will recognize 65% of its $768 million revenue performance obligation (RPO) in FY 2021, which is a good head start. Strong add-on bookings have also put the company in a good position to maintain the momentum in Q1 2021. Add-on bookings were up by 60% YoY and represent 17% of total recurring revenue as of today. Of all key top-line metrics, billings improved the most as it grew by 19% YoY. Much of that was driven by strong expansions and add-on bookings. The rule of 25 is also expected to have some positive ripple effects on other operating metrics such as retention rate, which has dropped by 600 bps over the last two years. Therefore, aside from being a higher-margin approach to drive growth, it will eventually improve overall stickiness.FY 2021 gross margin is also expected to return to where it was in 2018 upon the completion of data center migration. In Q4 2020, this activity resulted in a near-term 200 bps decline in gross margin. The migration will allow for a lower-cost way to deliver Box's cloud service, which will result in margin expansion in the long term. As per the management guidance in the Q4 earnings call, it is expected that the gross margin will reach 75% by FY 2023.Having developed a complete CCM suite that has given the confidence to reach 25% commitment in growth and FCF margin, Box is running out of excuses to not deliver in FY 2021. Over the last two years, growth and gross margins have declined by over 1,200 and 400 bps. Box's underperformance has given the impression that the problem may run deeper than a sales execution issue or an overall soft demand for a CCM solution. Last year alone, the longer sales cycle and challenge in EMEA seemed to be the byproduct of weak go-to-market planning and execution, wherein Box appeared to be spreading its resources too thin. Today, the US and Japan segments both contribute over 85% of total revenue while EMEA consistently struggles to contribute higher than 10% off the revenue. In that regard, we are pleased to learn that the company will scale back its activities in lower ROI regions.2020 will be a pivotal year for Box. As the CCM suite development is now fully ramped-up, there is an expectation that sales-related issues will be substantially diminished. The company also expects to reach $771 million of revenue in FY 2021. Furthermore, an ~11% expected YoY growth means a potential 900-1,000 bps expansion in FCF margin by the end of the year, given the company's commitment to the rule of 25.(BOX's FCF margin and Revenue growth. Source: stockrow)Given how Box has consistently under-promised and over-delivered on revenue over the last four quarters, it is quite likely that it will exceed its target 11% growth rate by 100-200 bps. FCF margin, nonetheless, will still more than double. Having more FCF will provide excellent optionality for Box. It can either reinvest the cash in high ROI projects or even potential buybacks, which the CEO did not rule out in the Q4 earnings call. Furthermore, the reduction in outside consulting spend as part of the cost discipline initiative is also likely to maintain the subscription revenue contribution at 96% or higher. Furthermore, Box will be executing these initiatives under the supervision of the incoming three new independent directors as per the Starboard agreement. As such we expect these key factors to sustain its valuation going forward.(Source: stockrow)With ~2.85 P/S, Box is quite cheap relative to its peers. Upon the successful move towards a healthy balance between growth and FCF margin, we expect its P/S to trade closer to that of Dropbox (DBX). Dropbox is the only stock with the balanced growth/profitability feature in its peer group, and therefore is a more realistic benchmark for Box. At the moment, Box is expected to trade at 2.65 P/S by year-end. With a hypothetical ~12% expected YoY growth and 13% FCF margin at the end of FY 2021, however, a valuation between 2.65 and 4.40 P/S (Dropbox's P/S) is within reach. Given the expected revenue of ~$779 million and the share count of 151 million, we set our target price at ~$18 per share."

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.A few years back, investors would get laughed at if they thought Box (BOX) would ever be a story about profitability rather than growth. Not long after Box went public in 2015 at $14 a share (barely below where shares trade now, in contrast to the wild gains seen by other software companies post-IPO), Mark Cuban famously called the company a ""house of horrors"" for the magnitude of its losses. But fast forward a few years later, and Box has shown us concrete proof that young and money-losing software startups can eventually build on their strong gross margins and ratchet back sales expenses as they mature in order to eventually deliver profits and cash flow.This profitability story was demonstrated clearly in Box's recent Q1 earnings release. In spite of strong results and a bullish outlook, shares of Box barely budged:Data by YChartsBack in March, I wrote that Box may have bottomed out in the low teens; since then, shares have soared to near-$20, doubling the market's gains over the same time period. In spite of Box's vast outperformance since hitting its March nadir, I still believe Box's combination of strong fundamentals and cheap valuation gives it ample head room to rise further.The biggest fundamental shift in Box's growth trajectory, of course, is the coronavirus - which for Box may end up actually being a long-term benefit, even if near-term sales are pressured. Many technology companies have come to rely more on remote work, with some like Twitter (TWTR) announcing that they would allow their employees to continue working remotely indefinitely. Such flexible work arrangements depend on strong cloud infrastructure and collaboration tools to work, which is exactly what Box provides. I have a similar view on Dropbox (DBX), which is also becoming a profitability story of its own: once teams start relying on Box and depending on all the information neatly organized in Box folders, it becomes an integral piece of software that's very difficult to rip out. In hard times and not, Box powers essential infrastructure for the modern office - and that's why Box may have higher revenue visibility than some other SaaS peers.In spite of these strengths, Box still maintains a very reasonable valuation. At present share prices near $20, Box has a market cap of $2.94 billion. After netting off the $278 million of cash and $70 million of debt on Box's balance sheet, we're left with an enterprise value of $2.73 billion.Box is actually one of the few companies to provide full-year guidance for the calendar year 2020, potentially a testament to the stability of its revenue stream and the company's visibility into it. For the current year, Box is planning for $760-$768 million in revenue, representing 9-10% y/y growth (this may be a few points on the light side, as Box generated 13% y/y growth in Q1). The midpoint of this range, by the way, is a hair higher than Wall Street's expectations of $763.3 million.Figure 1 Box FY21 guidance update Source: Box 1Q21 earnings deckIf we take the midpoint of Box's revenue range for the year, we arrive at a valuation of just 3.6x EV/FY20 revenues. This pits Box fairly favorably against other software companies expected to grow revenues in the mid-teens:Data by YChartsIn my view, Box will be able to flex its valuation up to at least 4.5x EV/FY20 revenues. This is in-line with where Dropbox is currently trading (I think Dropbox is also undervalued; a more appropriate multiple for Dropbox would be in the mid-5s) - though Dropbox is growing slightly faster than Box, Box's focus on enterprise and superior AI technologies (via Box Skills) also means it has less risk of consumer churn. Stay long here and continue to ride Box's upward momentum. Let's now dive into Box's latest quarterly results in more detail. Take a look at Box's first-quarter earnings summary below:Figure 2. Box 1Q21 resultsSource: Box 1Q21 earnings releaseSurprisingly, Box managed a meager acceleration in revenue in Q1, which is impressive given 1) Box isn't much of a strong grower anymore in the first place and 2) most companies reported deceleration thanks to the onset of the coronavirus. Revenues grew 13% y/y to $183.6 million, accelerating one point from Q4's 12% y/y growth rate and beating Wall Street's expectations of $182.1 million (+12% y/y) by a point. The company noted a number of marquee wins and expansions this quarter, both among public and private sector customers. Major wins in the quarter included Toyota's (TM) financial arm, as well as NASA, the USDA, and the National Bank of Canada. Dylan Smith, Box's co-founder and CFO, noted that the pandemic has done little to hamper demand for Box, a comment substantiated by Box's excellent Q1 results. This is a happy contrast to many other software companies, who have noted that the virus caused a lengthening of sales cycles and postponements of many projects. Per Smith's prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call:The only demand-side risk is the fact that Box's billings growth, at 8% y/y, lagged substantially behind revenue growth. Box had an explanation for this, however - in the wake of the coronavirus, many customers chose to switch to quarterly versus annual payment terms, which would optically shrink billings (but doesn't necessarily mean greater churn down the road). Smith noted that Box ""[has never] seen customers seek to reduce their contract durations to-date as they continue to view Box as a critical long term component of their IT strategy."" In spite of Box's stronger-than-expected revenue growth, the company has also committed to applying an ROI-based driven approach to marketing - that is to say, Box is no longer the ""growth at all costs"" company that it was in the past that earned it the reputation of being a ""house of horrors.""The chart below illustrates that point. As a percentage of revenues, Box cut sales and marketing costs by nine points. On top of a one-point reduction in general and administrative spend and a one-point improvement in gross margins, allowing Box to boost its pro forma operating margins by 1130bps from -1.9% in the year-ago quarter to 9.4% this quarter.Figure 3. Box profitability trendsSource: Box 1Q21 earnings deckBox also managed to deliver terrific free cash flow growth, up 3x y/y. Now when a company multiplies its FCF by this much, it would suggest some benefit from a billings or payable timing that is creating one-time favorability. In Box's case, this is partially true - the company noted that half of this year-over-year bump is due to timing of capital lease payments, but the other half is bona fide profitability improvement due to Box migrating its cloud infrastructure to lower-cost data centers. Figure 4. Box FCFSource: Box 1Q21 earnings deckBox's FCF guidance for the year implies continued strength down the road, calling for 25% in combined FCF margins and revenue growth. With 10% revenue growth in the midpoint of Box's plan, this implies 15% FCF margins - or $116 million in free cash flow. In a time of macro uncertainty and market volatility, Box's transition into becoming a highly cash flow positive and near-GAAP profitable company will resonate well with investors. Another big plus is the fact that, outside of customers opting for shorter payment terms, Box has noted very little negative impact from the coronavirus. Stay long here and ride Box's upward momentum."

This article discusses the implications for Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX) and Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX), and discusses their investment attributes.(Source: Reuters/Author)Box revenues have continued to rise over the last five years to $696 million. The company currently books a loss on those revenues of -$0.98 per share.Selling expenses have also risen from $314m to $420m over this time period, while R&D has also risen from $102.5m to $199.75m. The company had an operating income of -$139m.(Source: Reuters/Author)The problem for BOX is a slowing growth rate in annual sales, which is fighting with these other costs. Although revenues are increasing for the company, the growth rate of those revenues is steadily declining. 31% in 2017, to 20% in 2019 and 14.4% in 2020. This has created an average growth rate of 23%, but the overall trend is still in decline.The average growth rate in cost of revenue is 25%, whilst in Selling/General/Admin it is 7.8%.If we extrapolate the current revenues at 15%, we get the following EBIT results:(Source: Reuters/Box/Author)R&D costs have grown to $199 million in the fiscal year, so if the company wants to continue with current trends, then it needs to charge up its sales or the company will still struggle to make a profit in 2024.If BOX can get annual sales growth up to 20% then it could maybe see profit around 2022/3 at current R&D spend levels, but we also have to factor in interest and taxes.So, Box will need to see a boost in sales and one opportunity could be through its increasing R&D efforts.A recent press release from the company introduced new experiences to the platform with Collections, Annotations and enhanced integration with the Zoom video platform.Collections is aimed at organizing files and folders and Annotations is a means to provide mark-ups and texts to content; so both of these are not ground-breaking updates and are more window-dressing.One area where the company may see enhanced growth is through File Request and its integration into the Zoom platform. The company describes File Request as a, “safe and secure way to receive files and metadata from collaborators outside an organization or without a Box account.” This is a standard for the sector but it will bring new awareness to the existence of the platform.The company has shared data on its experience with the recent work from home arrangements, which the company boldly describes as, “The Future of Work.” This is a hopeful claim because the work-from-home agenda was forced on companies and many will revert back to their original habits, but at least the technology does now exist for companies to implement more flexible working and outside collaboration if they wish.By integrating into the Zoom platform, this will allow the company to piggyback on Zoom’s recent user growth with collaboration tools and at least ensure a bounce in sales for coming quarters.(Source: Box)The company is also pushing strong integration with Slack (NYSE:WORK) and Microsoft Teams (NASDAQ:MSFT), with the latter also having video conferencing abilities.Recent fourth-quarter earnings showed a 12% Y-o-Y growth and this gives some hope that the company can get back towards the 20% revenue growth level when the lockdown boost translates to the income statement.In the recent fourth-quarter earnings, the company released full-year FY21 guidance of $771.0 million to $777.0 million - which was in line with my 10% growth figure of $765.9 million for 2021.Box also noted in the recent earnings release that cash flow was declining: “Free cash flow in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 was $0.0 million. This compares to positive $21.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.”Another headwind for the company is in debt levels, where long-term debt to equity is currently 5.5x and this will be an obstacle when the company finally gets to profitability. As the company expands, it is seeing increases in property, plant & equipment costs.Despite this, BOX is currently selling at 3.6x sales, so at a 15% growth in earnings, then enterprise value could still double by 2025. This could improve further by achieving a more generous P/S ratio.Another company in this space is Dropbox which boasts more than 600 million registered users across 180 countries. Dropbox currently trades at a similar valuation to Box with a forward P/E of 24x, but with a higher price-to-sales of almost 5x. Dropbox had positive free cash flow in the recent quarter of $25 million.The company also has the benefit of a much lower long-term debt of 0.18x. Q-o-Q sales in Dropbox were also higher at 18%. In this sense, Dropbox seems to be the under-appreciated stock in this sector.The company is seeing revenues grow at an average of 29% per year, which is higher than its rival, but there is still a decline from 30% to 19% last year. At current growth rates, the EBIT in Dropbox shows healthy growth potential to around 4x its current level.(Source: Reuters/Dropbox/Author)Dropbox turned its operating margins around in 2019, which are now close to positive, and this gives the company an edge in the near term, with Box still at -20%.(Source: MacroTrends)With the move towards home working and collaborative working tools, we saw Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) step up their moves in the video room space to tackle Zoom and it’s possible that Dropbox could find itself a takeover target.A company such as Salesforce (CRM), which has a $154bn market cap, compared to the $8bn of Dropbox, could see the business as a viable addition to its current Salesforce Files collaboration suite. Salesforce trades at 9x sales, so it would be an opportunity to take advantage of a healthy valuation when markets may still see volatility. The cause of another stock drop in the near term would likely be another virus spike and the collaboration tools space would be a beneficiary once again.Dropbox is now a profitable, and growing business, whilst it has 600 million users that Salesforce could tap into for its existing products. At current growth levels, Dropbox could see an Enterprise Value almost 3x where it is just now.At current prices, there is still room for both of these companies to grow and the move to home working, although temporary, will have some lasting benefit to sales in this arena. The final word will come down to the quarterly revenues because Dropbox currently has an edge in earnings growth and is better positioned financially to take advantage. For Box, the popularity of Zoom could be the game-changer it needs in sales but I would want to see it deliver this beyond the lockdowns.At present, I would be long Dropbox as I see it having the best potential for near-term returns. The company has a growing business, with a smaller debt load than its rival and the current market cap could make it a takeover target. The recent lockdowns have brought the attention of the big technology companies to the sector and many will be devising strategies on how to tap into a new way of working that could become more common. Another return of the virus in the fall/winter could propel both companies closer to my EBIT estimations, but at present, Dropbox has the cash flow edge to capitalize."

Box (BOX) is one of the stocks that has rallied to new highs without the company seeing any real benefit from the pulled forward shift to the cloud. Last December, my investment thesis highlighted how the cloud content management stock was tired and as the recent rally plays out Box is likely to fade again.While Box talked a big game about digital transformation, the company doesn't generate anything impressive to back up the claims. For the April quarter, revenues were only up 12.6% while guidance for FY21 ending in January was basically in line with analyst estimates at $764 million.CEO Aaron Levie made this statement about digital transformation on the FQ1 earnings release:People need to realize that massive Microsoft (MSFT) generated 14.4% revenue growth in the last quarter with $13.3 billion Commercial Cloud business growing 39% in the quarter. Box only generating slower growth at this stage in its business development remains a major disappointment.Box generated some solid margins and cash flows in the quarter. The company guided operating margins up to between 11% and 12% from 9% to 10%. The cloud company should earn around $0.50 for the year, which places Box in the odd position of generating better profits following the virus without the revenue boost.The stock valuation here isn't outrageous at $3 billion. The company guided to FY21 revenues of $764 million, placing the valuation at about 4x sales. Most cloud stocks trade at double those multiples now, but most cloud stocks have far faster revenue growth. The stock trades at about 40x EPS growth which again isn't inspiring with slow revenue growth.The biggest worry likely to hold back the stock is that Box continues to face pressure from Dropbox (DBX). The competitor hit 18.0% growth in the March quarter and continues outgrowing Box since they've both been public.Data by YChartsEven Dropbox isn't hitting business out of the park. The company, more focused on consumer and SMB customers in comparison to the enterprise business of Box, slightly cut revenue guidance for 2020 to $1.89 billion. The guidance assumes only 14% growth for the year in comparison to less than 10% for Box.Ultimately, neither company has the type of growth common in the cloud space. The combined revenue bases are only $2.5 billion, yet the cloud content management companies have growth more similar to large-cap tech stocks.The key investor takeaway is that Box beat analyst estimates for FQ1, but one should've expected far more out of the company for FY21 guidance. The cloud content management company still can't gain any major traction and appears set on expanding margins over growing market share.The stock is likely to rally considering the break to new highs, but Box isn't an appealing stock to own long term. The company consistently underperforms and will likely face more competition from the tech giants as the business grows to larger annualized revenues worthy of their attention. Use any rally to sell Box."
4333022,104608,2020-03-19T12:19:28-04:00,"Box reported Q4 revenue, margins, and EPS all ahead of expectations.Management provided initial FY21 revenue growth of ~11%, which was pretty close to expectations at the time.The stock has traded down ~30% since reporting earnings and with valuation now under 2x forward revenue, the stock seems to be attractive.","Box (BOX) reported a good Q4 quarter with revenue, margins, and EPS all above expectations. Even though the stock initially traded up over 10% on the days following earnings, the stock has since traded down nearly 30% since their pre-Q4 release levels.Management provided guidance that was close to what expectations were, though I believe these initial estimates are slightly conservative given the current fears in the global economic environment. Q4 revenue grew 12% and management is expecting FY21 revenue growth of ~11%, which is pretty consistent considering the company is quickly approaching a $1 billion run rate.One of the more interesting comments management made during their earnings call was the target of reaching a Rule of 25 in FY21 and a Rule of 35 in FY23. While these targets are under the tech standard of Rule of 40, they do imply improvement in the combination of revenue growth and free cash flow margin over time.Data by YChartsThe stock has traded down nearly 40% over the past few weeks as the market has experienced quite a bit of volatility. However, Box's downtrend seems to be a bit overdone with the stock now trading ~1.5x forward revenue. Historically, the stock has traded above 2.5x forward revenue, which makes it appear somewhat cheap at current levels.With management's guidance assuming similar growth in FY21 as Q4, investors could potentially see upside if guidance ends up being conservative. In addition, the company has the potential to expand margins throughout the year given a more stabilized revenue growth trajectory and ability to better leverage their operating expenses.The stock now trades under $11 a share and under 2x forward revenue, which to me seems like a good buying opportunity.Revenue during the quarter grew 12% to $183.6 million which was nicely ahead of expectations for ~181.5 million. While revenue decelerated slightly from the 14% growth seen last quarter, the company continues to have 95%+ of their revenue as recurring, which makes that stream highly visible and valuable for investors concerning confidence around long-term growth. I believe over time, the company's high contribution of recurring revenue makes the revenue streams more insulated from extreme volatility.Source: Company PresentationOne of the more impressive metrics during the quarter was large deals >$100k in revenue, with the company signing 112 of these during the quarter. The increased larger deals shows the company’s ability to move up the market to larger companies and/or companies who are willing to spend more on Box’s services. Over time, the company should be able to continue this trend of larger deals, which also tends to be stickier. In addition, larger deals also help the company's reputation, as larger enterprises tend to not implement software from unrepeatable sources, thus, the more large enterprises that use Box could help the company's perceived reputation.Billings growth during the quarter improved to 19% (up from 10% last quarter) to $282 million and was above expectations for $265 million. Part of the reason for the big billings growth was due to some renewals happening earlier than expected. Nevertheless, the strong billings growth is a testament to the company’s longer-term revenue growth strength. Billings growth remains one of the most important metrics for Box as they sign multi-year contracts that defer the revenue over several quarters. Even though this figure can be somewhat volatile, investors typically look for growth that is near the revenue.Source: Company PresentationGross margins during the quarter came in at 71.5%, down from ~73.5% in the year-ago period. While gross margins are likely to remain above 70% given the company's software-centric structure, leading software companies have gross margins closer to 80%+.Operating margins for the quarter came in at 6.7% and were above expectations for 4-5%. As the company is better able to leverage their operating expense base, investors are surely looking forward to margin expansion and anything short of that over the next several quarters could be viewed as disappointing.The better than expected revenue during the quarter led to EPS of $0.07, which was better than expectations for $0.04.Source: Company PresentationFor Q1, the company expects revenue of $183-184 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.04-0.06, which both seemed to be pretty similar to expectations.For the full year, management expects revenue of $771-777 million, which was near consensus expectations for $773 million and represents growth of ~11%. Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to be ~9-10% for the year, which appeared to be well above expectations and led to EPS expectations for the year of $0.38-0.44, nicely above expectations for ~$0.30.In addition, during the Q4 call, management noted they are targeting a Rule of 25 in FY21 and a Rule of 35 in FY23. While these targets are under the tech standard of Rule of 40, they do imply improvement in the combination of revenue growth and free cash flow margin over time.Even though the stock initially popped over 10% in the days following earnings, the volatile market has pushed BOX down nearly 30% from their pre-Q4 earnings levels. Investors have been quick to push down higher-valued software names in this market sell-off as the ""risk-on"" approach seems to be fading a bit as economic worries have increased in recent weeks.Q4 revenue and EPS came in above expectations though management's initial FY21 guidance seemed to fall a bit short of heightened expectations. Nevertheless, it seems like the company is poised for a potential beat-and-raise year and guidance could be somewhat conservative given the uncertainties in the current global economic environment.Data by YChartsManagement provided initial FY21 revenue of $771-777 million, which was pretty close to expectations for $773 million and represents growth of ~11% for the year. While the full year revenue growth implies a consistent deceleration from the 12% seen in Q4, I believe the initial guidance could end up being conservative as management likely did not want to get ahead of themselves around the potential coronavirus risks.With a current market cap of ~$1.45 billion, cash of ~$200 million, and debt of ~$40 million, this gives BOX a current enterprise value of ~$1.30 billion. Using the midpoint of management's initial FY21 revenue guidance of $771-777 million gives us an FY21 revenue multiple of ~1.5x.While there are many fears in the current market around a potential economic slowdown, I believe Box's software subscription revenue model partially insulates their business from extreme volatility. In addition, the company has historically traded above 2.5x forward revenue, meaning the recent pullback could provide a good buying opportunity.Many of the software companies that are growing revenue ~15% tend to have better operating margins and cash flow, which is why BOX continues to trade below these companies. ~1.5x forward revenue multiple is not expensive, in fact, some could say this is rather cheap.Risks to Box included increased competition from larger players in the market. In addition, the extreme market volatility we have seen in recent weeks tends to hit small cap stocks pretty hard. If Box is not able to rebound within a few quarters, we could see the company burn through their liquidity rather quickly and need to utilize external sources for additional cash."
4333260,103480,2020-03-20T11:36:05-04:00,"Shares of Box have declined a precipitous ~33% since the beginning of the year, despite improving fundamentals.Collaboration stocks like Zoom have rocketed in the wake of the coronavirus, but file sharing companies like Box should see a slight uplift as well.Billings accelerated sharply in Q4 to +19% y/y, fulfilling the CFO's promise that back-half 2019 billings would make up for a slowdown in Q1 and Q2 that pummeled Box's stock.Go-to-market efficiencies have also driven Box's operating margins higher, an important signal in a market that is hyper-focused on tech companies' bottom line.","Since the coronavirus began to dominate all market headlines, some collaboration stocks like Zoom (ZM) have been obvious winners. Defying a historic pullback in the rest of the market, investors banking on the work-from-home trend pushed shares of Zoom up more than 2x since the start of the year.It's easy to forget that there are plenty of collaboration technology companies, however, that make working from home possible outside of Zoom. Box (BOX) is one of these companies - it's through Box that we can access our work files through the cloud. Unlike Zoom, however, shares of Box have peeled back ~33% since the start of the year - despite indications that its fundamental business is turning around.Data by YChartsInvestors shopping around for bear market bargains should give a second thought to Box amid a favorable combination of improving fundamentals and a cheaper valuation. Box shares have been falling even before the coronavirus began, due to investors' concerns that billings were slowing down and the company was losing relevance against heavy competition from the likes of Google Drive (GOOG) and Dropbox (DBX). And while we can't argue that prevalence of that competition, we do want to showcase the fact that - as Box's management has promised - Box managed to achieve a resurgence in billings in the back half of FY20.What we now see in Box is a sturdy recurring-revenue business with a strong, Fortune 500 installed base that is unlikely to see much revenue deterioration amid wide macroeconomic pressure. In addition, though Box's growth has certainly slowed down over the past several years, we should acknowledge that the company has driven massive operating margin improvements and is FCF positive - which are far more important indicators in a jittery market.Stay long here and use the pullback to buy.Take a look below at Box' most recent quarterly results:Figure 1. Box 4Q20 earnings resultsSource: Box Q4 earnings release Revenues grew 12% y/y to $183.6 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $181.5 million. Perhaps even more impressive, however, is the fact that Box achieved its promise of billings revitalization. Calculated billings in Q4 grew 19% y/y to $281.9 million, accelerating nine points over Q3's billings growth rate of 10% y/y. In the first half of FY20, Box's billings had only grown in the single digits.Figure 2. Box billings trendsSource: Box Q4 earnings release Key to driving Box's billings growth over the past several quarters has been the prevalence of add-on products. Part of what distinguishes Box from its better-known competitor Dropbox is the fact that Box comes with a set of enterprise-grade features and upgrades. As CEO Aaron Levie commented on the Q4 earnings call, these products have been instrumental at deepening customers' usage of Box:We should also consider the fact that Box is purely a subscription business - unlike many other software companies, the company doesn't rely on any one-time license deals. This means that Box's revenue visibility in a tricky coronavirus-impacted year is fairly high, and the company should see minimal disruption from the global shutdown in economic activity.Immediately post-IPO, Box's biggest criticism was that the company was burning cash hand over fist as it employed a ""growth at all costs"" mindset. That thinking has changed, however - in fact, Box has begun to prioritize profitability even before the onset of the coronavirus.Levie commented that Box has ""implemented a more stringent ROI based approach to all areas of the business in order to significantly improve our balance between growth and profitability."" We can see the results of that pivot in focus in Box's results. Q4 pro forma operating margins jumped 150bps to 6.7%. In particular, we note that sales and marketing expenses (which for Box is the largest component of operating expenses, similar to virtually every other SaaS company) dropped four points as a percentage of revenues. Box's operating margin gains in Q4 would have been even higher if we strip out about two points of non-recurring costs on the gross margin side related to a data center migration. Figure 3. Box operating margin trendsSource: Box Q4 earnings releaseWe note that Box's improving profitability puts the company in a stable position to survive the near-term economic crunch. Box has $195.6 million of cash on its balance sheet and $40 million of debt. And while operating cash flow was slightly down in FY20 as Box invested into infrastructure, it remained positive.Figure 4. Box OCF trendsSource: Box Q4 earnings releaseBox has also noted that for FY21, the company is targeting revenue growth plus FCF margin of at least 25%. With revenue guidance clocking in at 11% y/y growth, this means that Box is planning for 14% FCF margins in FY21 - or roughly $109 million, based on the midpoint of Box's revenue ranges. Needless to say, this is an important indicator for investors that have shunned small-cap stocks under the fear that many don't have enough liquidity to survive the year with capital markets effectively shut off. At present share prices near $12, Box trades at a market cap of $1.74 billion. After netting off the $195.6 million of cash and $40 million of debt on its balance sheet, the company has an enterprise value of $1.58 billion. Here's how that stacks up to Box's latest guidance:Figure 2. Box guidance updateSource: Box Q4 earnings release Box is guiding to FY21 revenues of $771-$777 million, representing a growth range of +11-12% y/y. Given that Box exited Q4 at a Billings growth rate of +19% y/y, this certainly seems like a forecast with a few points of opportunity on top. Nevertheless, at the midpoint of Box's given range, the stock is currently trading at a clearance rack valuation of 2.0x EV/FY21 revenues.Last year, when Box traded in the high teens, its valuation multiple clung in the high 3x/low 4x range. Given all the evidence that Box has both revitalized its billings growth and is laser-focused on margins and cash flow, we should expect a rebound in Box's beaten-down shares."

The stock has traded down ~5% over the past few weeks as investors have come to realize that revenue growth is decelerated and the lack of strong growth from billings and remaining performance obligations was somewhat disappointing.Revenue came in at $177.2 million, growing 14% and was better than the company's guidance and consensus expectations. However, growth during the quarter was lower than the ~16% revenue growth level seen during the first half of the year. In addition, billings growth of 10% and RPO of only 5% was lower than anticipated with net revenue retention rate declining to 105% during the quarter.While management raised their full-year guidance slightly more than the Q3 beat and was ahead of expectations, I think investors are waiting for either revenue growth or operating margin expansion to become more profound before the stock starts to outperform.Data by YChartsEven with the stock down ~5% since reporting earnings a few weeks ago, there were not enough positive takeaways from the company's recent earnings to change my neutral-minded opinion on the stock. Yes, valuation does remain pretty cheap at ~3x forward revenue, but valuation is cheap for a reason. Revenue growth decelerated for another quarter and Q4 guidance does not imply any acceleration.Investors seem to be waiting for the company to put up a quarter or two of strong growth trends before valuation starts to expand closer to the 4-5x forward revenue range. While I think this is possible over the long term, I remain on the sidelines for now with the stock ~$17.50 and will wait for a better opportunity to get in the name.Revenue during the quarter grew 14% to $177.2 million which was nicely ahead of expectations for ~174.5 million. Even with the revenue beat, net revenue retention rate came in at 105%, down from 106% last quarter. However, given the company's software-based revenue stream, over 95% of their revenue is recurring, making it highly visible and valuable for investors as it gives them increased confidence in future revenue growth potential. I believe the continued strength in the recurring software revenue will maintain some level of strength within the investing community, but as revenue growth naturally decelerates given the law of large numbers, investors will start to turn their attention more towards margins and profitability.Source: Company PresentationThe company continues to have some challenges with their sales execution as demonstrated by net revenue retention rate getting slightly worse in the quarter. Paid users during the quarter grew 11% to 13.2 million and while this growth figure continues to decelerate, the average revenue per user has remained pretty stable. Investors like to see the number of paid users grow, which indicates the company has been able to expand their customer base. But arguably even more important, the average revenue per user, or ARPU, has been pretty flat, meaning while the company is gaining more customers, the average customer spend has not grown. Investors love to see companies not only expand their customer base but also be able to up-sell their existing user base.Billings growth during the quarter improved to 10% (up from 6% last quarter) to $171.9 million and was pretty close to expectations. While the improvement in growth is directionally the right way to go, investors typically expect software companies to provide guidance and expectations that they are able to beat. Billings growth remains one of the most important metrics for Box as they sign multi-year contracts that defer the revenue over several quarters. Even though this figure can be somewhat volatile, investors typically look for growth that is near the revenue.In addition, remaining performance obligations grew only 5% during the quarter, which seems to be pretty minimal growth for a company that continues to expect 10%+ revenue growth.Source: Company PresentationGross margins during the quarter came in at 70.7%, down from ~73.6% in the year-ago period. While gross margins are likely to remain above 70% given the company's software-centric structure, leading software companies have gross margins closer to 80%+.Operating margins for the quarter were essentially breakeven compared to -5% in the year-ago period. Even as the company has seen their revenue growth slow down a bit, their operating margins are still floating around breakeven. This is partially why the stock trades at a lower multiple compared to Dropbox (DBX) because their revenue growth is slowing down, yet their margins are not expanding as quickly as anticipated.Over time, operating margins should expand as the company slows revenue growth in favor of achieving some operational efficiency and scale. While this could still come to fruition, investors have expected a little more from the company.The better than expected revenue during the quarter led to EPS of -$0.01, which was similar to expectations.Source: Company PresentationQ4 guidance includes revenue of $181-182 million in addition to non-GAAP EPS of $0.04-0.05. Both of these guidance targets were slightly above expectations.For the full year, management is now expecting revenue of $693.7-694.7 million, which was raised slightly more than the Q3 revenue beat and up from previous guidance of $690-692 million. Revenue growth for the year represents ~14-15% for the year. Non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year is now $0.01, narrowed from the company's previous range of $0.00-0.02.Valuation has continued to pull back over the past several months as investor's expectations seemed to be little changed and have accepted the new norm of slower revenue growth. Since reporting earnings a few weeks ago, the stock is down around 5%. The slowdown in revenue growth has not been met with an impressive operating margin expansion, which is typically expected when revenue growth starts to decelerate.Even though Q3 revenue came in ahead of expectations, the billings growth and remaining performance obligations remained somewhat muted. Full year revenue was raised slightly more than the Q3 beat, implying Q4 revenue guidance ahead of expectations. However, I don't think investors are expecting a blow-out quarter that could send the stock up significantly.Data by YChartsManagement's recently revised guidance of $693.7-694.7 million implies ~14-15% revenue growth for the full year, with Q3/Q4 revenue growth being the lowest of the year. Revenue growth during the first two quarters was ~16% and Q3 was ~14%, meaning Q4 growth is probably near the Q3 level.With a current market cap of ~$2.55 billion, cash of ~$200 million, and debt of ~$40 million, this gives Box a current enterprise value of ~$2.4 billion. Given we only have one quarter remaining in FY20, investors should start to look at FY21 and FY22 to better evaluate the company.Assuming revenue growth slightly decelerates in FY21, which I believe investors are already expecting, we could see growth of ~13%. If FY20 revenue comes in at the high-end of management's guidance, we could see FY21 revenue of ~$785 million, which would result in a FY21 revenue multiple of ~3x.Many of the software companies that are growing revenue ~15% tend to have better operating margins and cash flow, which is why BOX continues to trade below these companies. ~3x a forward revenue multiple is not expensive, in fact, some could say this is rather cheap. However, with revenue growth not appearing to accelerate within the next few quarters, it is tough to believe the company's valuation could expand too much from here.With valuation remaining somewhat compressed, I think the stock could be stuck in a range-bound trading pattern until the company is able to break out of their revenue growth slowdown. Once investors are able to see revenue growth accelerate or remain stable on top of margins starting to show some meaningful expansion, it is difficult to believe the stock will be a big winner from here.Box remains a leader in the cloud collaboration space and has over 70% of the Fortune 500 companies as their customers. While there remains a long path ahead for the stock to return to a great investment, I think valuation has reached a near-term high and until the company reports another strong quarter, with the stock trading ~$17.50, I would be hesitant to put more money in the name."

After a string of poor quarters caused by a push-out in billings timing that had investors concerned that Box would start showing decaying revenues, Box has pulled out ahead of a challenging first half of FY20 and is on the path to normalization. With billings growth hitting double-digits again this quarter, and with revenue growth still solidly in the mid-teens, shares of Box have rallied broadly since the third-quarter earnings report:In my view, the Box rally still has plenty of steam left to go. While Box - as an ""older"" SaaS company with only middling growth prospects - isn't exactly a great candidate for a huge breakout rally like some of its newer IPO counterparts, the stock still has plenty of catching up to do in order to hit a more normalized valuation. As such, just as sentiment is beginning to turn around for this stock, it's a good time for investors to review the bullish case for Box. To me, that bullish case rests on a few key drivers:Investors would be wise to keep riding out the Box recovery rally, especially with most other tech stocks lingering at dangerous all-time highs. Stay long here and use any near-term dips to buy.Here's a look at how Box performed in the third quarter:Figure 1. Box 3Q20 resultsSource: Box 3Q20 earnings releaseRevenues grew 14% y/y to $177.2 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $174.7 million (+12% y/y) by a comfortable two-point margin, and the same beat spread at which Box beat last quarter's results.Of course, the biggest and most important result from Box's quarter is missing from the income statement, and that's Box's billings performance. Box grew billings at 10% y/y this quarter to $172 million, accelerating four points over last quarter's 6% y/y billings growth rate and fulfilling CFO Dylan Smith's earlier promise that Billings growth rates would recover in the back half of FY20, after grinding to a surprising halt (+1% y/y) in Q1:Figure 2. Box 3Q20 billingsSource: Box 3Q20 earnings deckBox's CEO, Aaron Levie, also noted an important shift in Box's sales strategy going forward on the Q3 earnings call. Consistent with how Box has been driving a lot of revenue growth from attach-on products, the company will turn its focus to driving expansion deals within the existing installed base. While Box will still certainly go for new business, this shift makes it less susceptible to losing deals against competitors. Per Levie's remarks:Box's focus on expansions has already started turning strides for the company's profitability. Pro forma operating margins rose nearly five points y/y to end the quarter at approximately flat:Figure 3. Box pro forma operating marginsSource: Box 3Q20 earnings deckNote that operating margins lifted in spite of a temporary headwind to gross margins, due to a planned data center migration. Pro forma operating expenses actually fell seven points as a percentage of revenues. When Box's migration headwind fades, operating margins can tick even higher. Box may never be an exciting, high-growth SaaS company again - but these results as well as Box's future sales direction shows that the company transitioning to a steady, sticky subscription product with lower customer acquisition costs and a relatable stream of high-margin revenues. Box is gradually shifting into its maturity phase, and soon the company's growing free cash flows can support its stagnant valuation. Stay long here."

FQ4 guidance that wasn't so impressive.The company doesn't have the growth and operating leverage to justify owning the stock.The stock needs a catalyst for gains with billings and deferred revenues trending down while costs are still too high.Box isn't a buy until a catalyst for faster growth materializes.,"As my previous research highlighted last year, Box (NYSE:BOX) was an appealing stock to own around these levels. The cloud content management company is a bargain value for the sector, but Box hasn't solidified a rebound in the business to warrant investors rush into the sector just yet.On the trading day prior to Thanksgiving, Box ended up 11.5%. The market got excited as the content management company raised numbers for FQ4, but the major problem with the company wasn't resolved with a revenue growth rate in the 10.5% range.For FQ3, revenues grew 13.6%, but both billings and deferred revenue dipped far below revenue growth. Both of these measures are indications of future growth, and billings dipped to only 10% growth.Source: Box FQ3'20 presentationThe one positive is the billings growth rate improved from a 6% rate in the prior quarter. The trend definitely improved, but the company needs billings to start exceeding the revenue growth rate, considering quarterly revenues are only $172.5 million. The size and scale of Box isn't large enough for investors to be satisfied with growth rates in the 10% range.The competitive space with Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) is even more complex as both companies face decelerating growth. Analysts only expect the later to generate 14.6% revenue growth in FY20, so the company isn't exactly stealing market share.In general, analysts predict each company generating terminal growth rates in the 10% range. As discussed with Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), a similar growth rate can reward shareholders, but the company needs a dominant market position like Quicken and TurboTax in the financial software space for such growth to work for shareholders. The competitive dynamics between Box, Dropbox, and some of the tech giants in the cloud space could prevent a rewarding scenario for shareholders.The biggest issue with Box facing decelerating growth and a slower base growth case than when the company came public a few years ago is that investors need to grasp the expense side of the equation. A prime example is FQ3 where operating expenses were 71.0% of revenues, while gross margins were slightly lower at 70.7%.Source: Box FQ3'20 presentationThe sales and marketing expense at 42% of revenues is a prime area of concern. Highly valuable businesses don't usually require such extensive sales expenses to acquire and retain customers. These high expenses and the fact billings are down at only 10% growth when the company cut the percentage of revenues spent on sales and marketing is a large negative signal.The company is now in the tricky position of needing to spend in order to fend off Dropbox and other competitors while also starting to generate profits and cash flows. Box is the relative bargain in the sector compared to Dropbox and in relation to most other cloud software stocks because investors aren't convinced the company has the catalysts for sustainable long-term growth.Data by YChartsAt 3.3x EV/S estimates, cloud stocks don't come much cheaper. The market clearly doesn't believe these two companies can sustain growth rates in excess of 10% with a few hundred basis points of leverage each year or the stocks would trade at double these EV/S multiples.In the last quarter alone, Box improved operating margins by 4.6% percentage points. The lack of billings and deferred revenue growth suggests an inability to mirror solid revenue growth with operating leverage.The key investor takeaway is that Box is a tentatively buy here below $20. The stock has the right financial dynamics for a meaningful stock gain, but the market dynamics are troubling. The sector is having too much difficulty growing when the scale of both businesses would suggest faster growth is possible.For now, the stock appears tired until Box generates a catalyst for long-term growth."
4295966,105334,2019-10-10T15:26:10-04:00,"Guidance on revenue and FCF margins upped, focusing on tweaks to the GTM strategy.Execution remains a question mark.Product announcements focused on product updates to Box Shield and enhancements to Box Relay line of products.Multiple is lofty, especially relative to growth.Expectations are high following the raised guidance; I see little reason for shares to rise from here.","Box (BOX) recently upped its guidance on revenue and FCF margins out to FY23 from its estimates put out a year earlier. The increased revenue and free cash flow growth will be delivered by a combination of a) a new go-to-market (GTM) strategy focusing on the acquisition of higher value customers, driving product sales to existing customers, as well as increase sales productivity, and b) product enhancements to the ""Box Shield"" and ""Box Relay"" line of products, along with added integrations with vendors.All of this sounds great, but Box management has yet to show that it can consistently meet pre-set expectations having missed past targets. A new chief revenue officer (CRO) and a fresh approach to drive sales will help, but Box needs to start delivering on some lofty expectations. Though there is no clear under/overvaluation versus peers that can drive a solid narrative, its disappointing growth numbers have not disparaged the market - PEG remains at ~88x.In sum, Box holds a market-leading position in the $45B Cloud Content Management market, but competitive intensity remains high, and so does the multiple. I see little reason for shares to appreciate from here, especially with expectations raised following the latest guidance raise.Box's latest FY23 targets were recently raised at its investor event, with updated goals of reaching 35% in Revenue and FCF margin, up from ~16% in FY20. Management also upped the guidance on revenue growth (FY23E of 12%-18%) and operating margins (FY23E of 15%-20%) by a combined 250bps from its previous target of a combined 30% growth in both these metrics.Source: Box Investor PresentationPer the new CRO Mark Wayland, key tweaks to the Go-to-market strategy for Box Products will allow the firm to transition and achieve its raised FY2023 targets.The first change (""volume and velocity"") will see renewed management focus on chasing deals and customers in the $100k+ bracket with an aim to increase the number of such deals by 30% in the next two years. The rationale for chasing this group of investors is to open up up-selling opportunities. Historically, this set of clients are twice more likely to adopt newer products than those in the $50-100k deal size (only one-third of this segment currently buys add-ons).Source: Box Investor PresentationThe second component of the strategy is to up sales productivity by 15% by 2021 and then gradually higher afterward. This would be driven by three things: a focus on selling into the installed base rather than chasing large deals outside of the customer base; targeted sales enablement to quickly ramp new sales reps, and sales training with an increased focus on performance management. While this has been a Box theme for a while now, execution has been found wanting with customer acquisition cost improvements slowing down and productivity gains across US, Japan, and EMEA showing mixed results.Source: Box Investor PresentationFinally, Box intends to steadily increase net retention by focusing on up-sell opportunities. 28% of new product sales in 1H20 came from add-on sales. Management is targeting 50% of the sales to come from this segment by the end of FY23.Source: Box Investor PresentationWhile the raised guidance is promising, Box has had a history of missing guidance, and hence, execution remains a big question mark. Notably, there has been chatter of elongated sales cycles as competitive intensity in the space picks up, and this remains an additional overhang on expectations. It is tough, therefore, to trust guidance at face value, with management not having a track record to fall back on - management acknowledged as much on the call:Nonetheless, product innovation has been strong - the newly announced product updates and features were strong. The most significant of these was the added capabilities woven into the ""Box Shield"" product. With a focus on security to drive sales into the regulated market space, new Box Shield features include a) threat detection capabilities based on context-aware alerts that can flag off suspicious user activity and b) classification-based security policies that restrict user access and control based on user settings.Source: Box Investor PresentationAdditionally, Box will be integrated with Splunk's (SPLK) cloud-based monitoring system, which will allow Box Shield to deliver alerts within the Splunk app. Box Shield will be available both as a stand-alone product and part of the Digital Workspace and Digital Business suites by October 29th and as a Splunk integrated product in the near future.Enhancements were also announced in the Box Relay product range with expanded integrations with existing vendors such as Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Slack (NYSE:WORK), and Microsoft Teams (NASDAQ:MSFT). The availability timeline for clients is as follows: Adobe integration will be available next year, Slack integration will be available later in the year, and Microsoft Teams functionality will be available in public beta by the end of the year.Source: Box Investor PresentationBox aims to pitch both products as part of their broader ""Box Suites"" strategy, which aims to reduce sales friction and make it easier for customers to subscribe to add-ons into the organization. This follows on from the encouraging statistics around revenue retention (retention from Core only customers versus those with 2+ add-ons stands at 95% vs. 125%), which indicates that add-ons create a stickier sale lead to higher realized revenues.Source: Box Investor PresentationA relative valuation exercise throws up mixed trends - and makes it tough to gauge whether Box trades at a premium or discount definitively. On Price to sales, Box trades at 3.8x, much lower than the 5.2x for Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), and 14.1x for Twilio (NYSE:TWLO). A similar trend is reflected in EV/Sales as well. However, from a cash flow perspective, Box trades at ~43x vs. 18.1x for Dropbox. Meanwhile, its comparatively lower growth metrics could be the swing factor - Box is valued at ~88x PEG despite forward revenue growth of ~15%, which pales in comparison to its peers. For a firm that is part of a $45B Cloud Content Management market, revenue growth of 15% seems disappointing. Though some of the new initiatives are promising, most of the positives are likely already priced in and following the lofty guidance update, it is hard to see Box re-rating from here.Source: Seeking Alpha"
4294622,105400,2019-10-02T13:10:58-04:00,"Box has fallen roughly 32% from its 52-week highs.The company has grown to become a leading cloud content management platform among large enterprise companies.However, Box is overvalued by roughly 40% based on my estimates.","Box Inc's (NYSE:BOX) stock price has fallen roughly 32% from its 52-week high, mostly due to multiple adjustments and lackluster growth. The big drop in share price is warranted given the number of large companies that are competing in the cloud content management space. Box is likely to face increasing pressure to achieve profitable growth in the near and long term with its platform. At $17, it is also overvalued with a potential downside of 40% based on my valuation estimates.(Source: Google)Unlike Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), which targets individual users and small-to-medium businesses, Box goes for large enterprise customers. So far, Box has achieved success for its cloud content management solution with 69% of the Fortune 500 customers. Its revenue has grown at an average rate of 23% over the past 5 years but has slowed down to 16% in the most recent quarter. (Source: Q2 FY20 Investor Presentation)Box has been trying to move beyond the commodity cloud storage business and become a major content collaboration and enterprise content management platform for large enterprises. By supporting workflow processes and creating integrations, Box is able to create some switching costs for its solutions. This has allowed Box to enjoy low churn rates of roughly 4.2% and high net retention rates of 106%. (Source: Q2 FY20 Investor Presentation)Box also benefits from the inertia of large enterprises from switching content management platforms. Companies generally do not want to risk lost data and productivity which leads to business disruption. An imperfect data migration could lead to huge amounts of frustration and business risk that would cause any company to think twice about switching from Box.Box has been finding ways to ensure more integration and collaboration features to entrench users on its platform. It has integration capabilities with over 1,400 applications such as Microsoft, Google as well as key productivity tools from Salesforce and Slack. Box also works hard on being a neutral provider such that almost all types of files work on its platform. Furthermore, Box also has add-on modules such as Box Relay and Box Shield that provide customers with deeper AI and security capabilities that further provides stickiness to its platform.(Source: Q2 FY20 Investor Presentation) However, Box faces intense competition in its space that may lead to slower customer adoption on its platform. For example, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) offers free storage options with its Office Suites subscriptions. Large companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are also in this space and could easily expand its services to cover those of Box. Even though Box exhibit a slight resemblance of customer switching costs, customers who adopt AWS as their cloud infrastructure would be likelier to subscribe to other services on the same platform rather than paying for two cloud vendors. Alphabet is also in the office suite space and I believe that companies are likelier to consolidate among these leading companies rather than pay extra for Box.Another risk for Box could be extended downtime. If it happens, it would lead to business disruption and prevent enterprises from functioning and collaborating normally. This could lead users to lose faith in the platform and lead to increased customer churn. As such, Box has to ensure that it invests heavily to ensure that there is as little downtime as possible. The presence of this risk reduces the switching costs advantage for Box. To value the company, I used a DCF model with the following assumptions:1) Revenue growth at 15% for the next five years, then dropping to 2% in perpetuity starting from the year 2025. The relatively moderate growth rates in the first five years reflect Box's competition in its cloud content management space. However, Box specializes in this space and has 69% of Fortune 500 companies as its customers. As such, it is likely to be able to experience some growth within this space even with high competition. 2) Operating margin of 20% from 2024 onwards. Enterprise software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. However, 20% is generally lower than the average software company. This reflects the potential price competition between Box and larger companies that offer free cloud storage within their office suites. It is also likely to take some time for Box to reach this 20% operating margin due to their current negative operating margin of -20%.3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate Box will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) Box has an initial weighted cost of capital of 9.14%, which drops to 8% in the terminal year. The higher cost of capital reflects the higher risk of Box having negative cash flows and losing money. However, once the company achieves profitability and higher free cash flows, the risk should be reduced as reflected in the lower cost of capital.(Source: Author Creation using Box financials)The value I derived for Box is roughly $2.4B for the entire company. This represents a 40% downside from its current price. As with all DCFs for high growth companies, my point estimate valuation of $10.30 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against similar software companies. (Source: Author creation using Seeking Alpha data)Compared to other software companies, Box is cheap on both Price/Sales and EV/Sales multiples. However, most of these software companies also have stronger growth rates like Twilio and Workday. Potential investors have to decide if they believe Box is worth overpaying for on a discounted cash flow basis. Box is actually much cheaper when compared to other software companies. Investors who want to build a position in Box has to believe in the management's execution in sustaining much higher growth rates while keeping strong pricing power."
4305198,104099,2019-11-10T15:40:27-05:00,"The shares are down nicely since I started writing bearish pieces on this name. The problems I identified in earlier articles linger.The market remains optimistic about this name, in spite of growing evidence that rising sales don't translate into profits. We investors are compensated by profits, so that matters.In my previous articles, I suggested longs replace shares with call options. I assess that advice and offer another ""options as alternative"" trade.","I’ve written two skeptical articles about Box, Inc. (BOX) on this forum, where I outlined my reasons for avoiding the name. The recommendations have worked out well enough, because since my first bearish piece, the shares are down about 33% versus a 7% gain on the S&P 500. In my second piece, I characterized the stock as merely “ridiculously expensive, and no longer morbidly expensive."" The stock is down about 6% since then, versus a gain of 4% for the S&P 500.I want to look in on Box again at this point, because the risk of ownership is much lower now than it was initially. In other words, what may have been a terrible investment at $25.20 may be a great investment at $17. I’ll make this determination by looking at the financial history here, and will look at the stock as a thing distinct from the underlying business. I also want to assess whether the ""switch to calls"" advice I offered earlier worked out or not, so I'm going to explore the results of my earlier calls to switch to calls.In one way, the financial history here has been impressive, given that revenue has grown at a CAGR of ~23% since 2015, and demand for the service seems to be as robust as ever since revenue in the first half of FY 2020 was about 16% higher than the same period in FY 2019. Unfortunately, that’s where the good news ends in my view. In spite of ever growing sales, the company has failed to turn a profit. Worse, in my view, is the fact that there seems to be nothing in the offing that will cause a turnaround on that score. In fairness, net loss declined by $1.66 million in the first half of FY2020, on a $46.8 million increase in revenue. If huge sales growth barely budges the needle, it prompts me to ask, “what will it take to make this consistently profitable?”Also troubling in my estimation is the continued dilution investors have suffered over the years, as share count increased by fully 3.5% in the first six months of FY2020, and just under 5% in the first half of 2020 relative to the same period a year ago.The bright spot is the capital structure in my estimation. The company has a cash hoard that is about 5 times the level of debt outstanding and represents ~18 months of net losses. For that reason, I think there’s little reason to worry about a credit or solvency crisis here anytime soon.In sum, I think the financial problems that I identified in my previous two missives on this name are still present. The company can't seem to generate net income in spite of very impressive revenue gains, and shareholders have been diluted fairly dramatically over the past few years in my view. On the bright side, there's little risk of a credit or solvency crisis anytime soon.Source: Company filingsI’ve said it so often that I can foresee a future date, many years from now, that I might start to grow bored of the phrase “a great company can be a terrible investment, and a troubled company can be a great investment.” The idea is that we must judge the stock as a thing distinct from the actual underlying business. Although Box is financially troubled in my estimation, it still may be a great investment if we can buy the shares at a discount to their worth.There are a few ways that I measure whether the shares are trading at a discount to their worth. The one thing all of these approaches have in common is that they're all trying to answer the question of how optimistic or pessimistic the market is about a given name at a given time. If the market is optimistic (i.e., if investors are paying ever higher prices for the company's future cash flows), that's a bad sign in my estimation. The reason for this is the fact that at some point a company will make a misstep. If the market expected perfection, that disconnect between expectations and reality will cause the shares to fall.One of the first things I look at is the ratio of price to some measure of economic value (earnings, free cash, etc.). On this measure, the shares of Box Inc. remain very expensive in my view, trading at just under 60 times free cash flow.Data by YChartsWhen I first wrote about this company, 33% ago, I was concerned that the shares were trading at the exact same valuation. The price has dropped about a third, and the shares are trading at the same multiple, so there's been a huge drop in free cash flow. Thus, in my view, the shares are as expensive now as when I first encountered this stock, in spite of the 33% drop in price.In my previous articles, I recommended that shareholders who insisted on remaining long sell their shares and buy call options. The reason for this is that, in my view, calls offer much of the upside at far less risk than shares. It’s worth assessing the impact of this advice, to see if it's still worthwhile trying to convince bulls to sell their shares and buy calls as proxies.At the time I published my first article on the name, the shares were trading around $25, and I suggested that investors who remained long sell their shares and buy the January 2020 calls with a strike of $25. These were bid-asked at $2.60-$2.95. My thinking was that for ~12% of the capital at risk, the investor would enjoy much of the upside from the stock. On the day the calls expired worthless, the stock was down ~22% to ~$19.50. In this instance, the “switch to calls” approach worked in my view because the results for the call holder were objectively less bad than for the stock holder. If the investor held the shares, they lost about $5.50 per share. The calls represented a loss of ~$2.95.I made the same recommendation in my second article here, when the stock was trading for just under $18 per share. I specifically recommended the December Box calls with a strike of $20, which were bid-asked at the time at $1.10-$1.20. The shares have flatlined since my second article, so the calls are currently bid-asked at $.15-$.25, representing a loss of $1 per share. As of this writing, the shares have also dropped by about $1. So in this case, investors in both instruments have lost an equivalent amount. In my opinion, the benefit from calls remains, though. The investor controls the same number of shares with much less capital deployed. This offers diversification benefits and allows the investor to invest with far less capital and therefore far less risk.Although I only have a sample size of two in this document, I think calls as replacement for shares makes sense for shareholders in this dividend free stock, so I’ll recommend the approach again for investors who remain long in spite of my very compelling case against Box Inc. At the moment, I think the March 2020 Box calls with a strike of $17 represent the best value. They are currently bid-asked at $1.70-$1.90. Just like with my previous recommendations, these calls give an investor most of the upside with only 11% of capital at risk. The investor can diversify into something else with the remaining 89% of their wealth not tied up in the stock.I think Box Inc. remains a troubled business because it can’t seem to manage to translate rising sales into rising earnings. At the same time, the market remains as optimistic about the shares as ever (i.e., it's still willing to pay $60 for $1 of next year's cash flow). For that reason, I strongly suggest that investors continue to avoid this name. That said, for people who remain optimistic here, I recommend call options in lieu of shares. These offer much of the upside as the shares at a fraction of the price. In my view, risk minimization is critical, and paying 11% for the same upside is by definition a lower risk trade."
4294381,48711,2019-10-01T11:46:24-04:00,There is a large activist investor who owns Box stock.Starboard Value is known to acquire positions in companies with the sole purpose to explore strategic alternatives and maximize shareholder value.There is now a more likely possibility that Box could be acquired in the next 12 months.There is greater than a 75% chance thatprospective Box investors can earn at least a 25% annual return selling Box putoptions.,"Recent DevelopmentsBullish ViewActivist hedge fund Starboard Value recently disclosed a 7.5% stake in cloud storage company Box. Shares of Box surged 12% in response to the news. Starboard Value is known to acquire positions in companies with the sole purpose to explore strategic alternatives and maximize shareholder value. There now appears a more likely possibility that Box could be acquired in the next 12 months, given Starboards large stake in the company. Even if Box does not get acquired, the downside in Box shares appears mitigated given that a prominent activist hedge fund owns a large stake and will actively look for ways to increase shareholder value, whether that be through an acquisition or not.Bearish ViewOn Friday, JP Morgan downgraded Box stock and maintained their $15 price target on the stock. Analyst Mark Murphy cited increasing competitive pressure and decreased customer spending as the reasons for the downgrade. Murphy noted that the volume of paid user adds was 50% lower this year than the past two years.M&A ChatterSoftware giants such as IBM, SalesForce, and Oracle have been on spending sprees lately and could be on the short list of potential acquirers given their large cash hoards and logistical synergies.Prominent venture capitalist Fred Wilson who was an early investor in Twitter said this back in 2011,In the last 2 years, Salesforce acquired Tableau for 15x revenue and Mulesoft for a roughly 10x multiple. Moreover, IBM acquired RedHat for about a 10x revenue so a 5 -6x projected multiple for Box stock seems conservative and prudent for this example.Putting a 5x multiple on Box's current revenue of $655 million yields a fair market value of $3.2 billion, or ~$22.41 per share. If an acquirer were to pay 6x sales, that would imply a $3.9 billion valuation or $26.88 per share for Box stock. I would not be surprised if Box were acquired somewhere in the range of $20 - $25 per share, given recent tech M&A multiples and everything I have heard from investment bankers about M&A valuation data in the tech space. Who knows exactly when Box will get acquired or for how much? The pressing issue for Box investors is how to capitalize on their holdings while waiting for an upside catalyst that may or may not happen. It is evident that there is upside in Box stock and the downside seems to be mitigated given the large activist investor whose main purpose for owning the stock is to explore strategic alternatives that will maximize value for Box shareholders.Two Ways to Generate Income While Waiting for an Upside CatalystSelling Puts: A Means to Generate Income Waiting on an AcquisitionBox shareholders or potential investors can earn monthly income by selling puts to enter their position. If you were going to buy the stock anyways, might as well get paid to do it. Warren Buffett did this when he bought Coca-Cola stock back in the early 90's, selling large amounts of put contracts on Coke stock.A put option gives the buyer the right to sell their shares at a fixed price. Conversely, a put seller is obligated to buy their shares if they sell a put option at a given strike price. Given Box's favorable upside (activist investor and potential acquisition target), put selling is a great way for prospective Box investors to earn income by patiently waiting to buy the stock. There are two main risks with this strategy. 1) On the unlikely chance Box shares plunge a put seller is obligated to buy the shares at a fixed price. Say a put seller sells one of the Oct 18 $15 put contract. The bid price is currently $0.25 so the seller would collect $25 (each option contract is equivalent to buying or selling 100 shares of the underlying stock). Say Box stock drops to $14 by October 18th, then the put option is now worth $1.00 or $100. ($1 x 100 = $100). The seller keeps the $25 in premium but is facing a $75 loss. (+$25 - $100 = -$75).If Box's stock stays above $15 by October 18th, the put seller will keep the $25 in premium. The logic in selling puts is that a put seller is getting paid to assume the risk of buying stock that they would have bought anyways. In the previous example, a put seller is getting paid $25 to assume the risk of buying 100 shares of Box stock at $15, a roughly 6% discount from the current price of $15.96.Based on implied volatility levels and current interest rates, there is a 75% chance of success for sellers of the Oct 18th $15 puts. The breakeven price for this trade is $14.75 ($15 strike price LESS the $0.25 collected). There is a 75% chance that Box stock will NOT fall below $14.75 by October 18th and the put seller will keep their entire premium. Given a prospective investor who was planning on buying shares anyways, why not collect income while waiting for a better price?Example: the October 18th $15 puts are currently selling for $0.28. The bid price is $0.25 and the ask is $0.30. When selling puts, I prefer setting a limit sell to open order somewhere between the bid and mid-price. When selling options, the closer you set your limit order to the ask, the higher the premium you will collect but the lower the chance of getting your order filled. Conversely, the closer you set your limit order to the bid, the higher the chance of getting your order filled and the lower the amount of premium collected. When selling options, you will always get your order filled (assuming you have the available funds for the order) at the bid and less often at the mid-price.Trade Example:For this example, I will assume that a prospective investor is willing to buy 700 shares of Box stock at $15. An investor would need to invest $10,500 to buy 700 shares of Box stock. The capital requirement on this trade is the total amount invested less the premium collected - in this case 7 contracts sold x $0.25 bid price = $1.75 x 100 = $175. So, the capital requirement is $10,325. $10,500 - $175 premium.Return on CapitalThe return on capital is the premium collected divided by the capital requirement. In this trade, the return on capital is 1.69% before commissions. Some brokers charge $1.75 per contract traded; some charge a flat fee plus a fee per contract traded. Schwab charges $4.95 + $0.65 per contract traded. I use Schwab and would be charged $9.50 in commissions for this trade. The return on capital after fees would be 1.6% (($175 - $9.5)/$10,325)). The October 18th puts expire in 22 days based on the date of this writing. To get our annualized return we divide 365 by 22. 365 divided by 22 equals 16.59. We then multiply our return on capital by 16.59 to get our annualized return. In this case, the annualized return selling the Oct 18th $15 Box puts is 26.55%. Given the current volatility levels of Box stock and risk-free interest rates, there is a 75% chance that Box stock will close above the breakeven price of $14.75 for sellers of the Oct 18th $15 puts. See diagram below.Investors should consider selling out of the money put options and/or enter a long position in Box stock for three main reasons:Time will tell if Box ends up getting acquired. Even if they do not, there appears to be positive risk adjusted returns for Box investors in the future. Given the markets frothy valuation levels and uncertainty surrounding trade disputes and macroeconomic headwinds, income strategies on stocks with positive near-term catalysts like Box are a good bet."
4294383,104608,2019-10-01T11:24:45-04:00,"Box reported an improved Q2 with revenue growing 16%, above expectations, though billings growth remains mild at 6%.Management raised full year guidance at the midpoint lower than the Q2 beat, implying revenue growth could slow down.Valuation appears tempting at ~3x forward revenue, though the recent 20% run-up has me on the sidelines for now.","Box (BOX) reported a better Q2 than Q1, though performance was still not strong enough to reinforce a long-term bullish stance. Despite the stock initially trading down post-earnings, Box has rebounded quite significantly and is now up over 20% since Q2 results were released. While the stock's recent performance is rather impressive, I do not believe the fundamentals fully back the 20%+ increase in recent weeks.Q1 revenue was strong, growing 16% to $172.5 million and was above consensus expectations for ~$170 million. However, billings growth remains pretty meek at 6% and management raised guidance by less than the Q1 beat, which could mean they are expecting some sort of revenue deceleration or slowdown during the remainder of the year.After management eliminated their $1 billion in revenue goal by FY22 last quarter and lowering guidance, investors quickly sold off the stock, which ended up being down ~30% in between Q1 and Q2 earnings. While Q2 was somewhat a step in the right direction, the company still has some issues to address before the stock should be allowed to re-rate higher.Data by YChartsDespite the stock performing exceptionally well since reporting Q2 earnings, I think the stock could end up taking a breather after investors re-evaluate results and look ahead to the next quarter and remainder of the year. Valuation remains well below software peers given somewhat slower revenue growth, lower billings growth, and break-even operating margins.I think the stock is currently trading at a premium compared to where it should be and with shares currently around $16, I think shares could remain range-bound for the next several weeks.During Q2, revenue grew 16% to $172.5 million, keeping pace with the 16% growth in Q1. Revenue during the quarter came in above consensus expectations for ~$170 million as the trend of 16% growth seems likely to continue. Box’s revenue stream is very valuable in that ~97% of their revenue is recurring, given the software-based stream. This recurring and highly visible revenue stream is valuable for investors as it gives them increased confidence in future revenue growth potential.Source: Company PresentationManagement appeared to be a little more confident in their revenue growth, noting strength in their go-to-market strategy and improved sales productivity. During the quarter, deals >$100k grew 36% compared to the year ago period, demonstrating Box’s ability to retain high profile clients and increase their overall spend. In addition, add-on product attach rates reached 80%+ across the deals >$100k, meaning once a larger customer purchases products, they are likely to become a recurring customer.However, billings growth remained uninspiring at 6% growth to $172.9 million. Although this came in slightly ahead of expectations, 6% billings growth for a company looking to grow revenue ~16% does not add up. Billings growth remains one of the most important metrics for Box as they sign multi-year contracts that defer the revenue over several quarters.Source: Company PresentationGross margins during the quarter ticked down slightly to 71.3% compared to 73.7% in the year ago period. I think the company’s 70%+ gross margins are healthy, though some leading software companies have 80%+ gross margins. Despite the lower gross margins, Box was able to reduce S&M expense to 41% of sales, down from 45% in the year ago period. This helped lead to a non-GAAP operating margin of 0.3% during the quarter, nearly 5% better than the -4.4% margin seen in the year ago period.Operating margins should start to expand over time given the company has slowly seen their revenue decelerate. Box is at the point in their lifecycle where they should start to focus on profitability rather than pouring money into revenue growth. Yes, growing revenue is important, but now that revenue has decelerated below 20%, they should start to focus more on expanding margins and delivering EPS growth.EPS for the quarter was $0.00, which was slightly better than consensus expectations for a loss of ($0.01). The revenue beat combined with a positive operating margin led to the slight EPS beat. I would expect over the next several quarters for margins to expand and EPS to start to reach a consistent positive level.Source: Company PresentationQ3 guidance includes revenue of $174-175 million in addition to non-GAAP EPS of ($0.01) to $0.00.For the full year, management is now expecting revenue of $690-692 million, up ~$2 million at the low-end compared to the previous guidance of $688-692 million, despite the ~$3 million revenue beat during Q2. Revenue growth for the year represents ~14%, implying revenues are likely to slow down a bit in Q3 and/or Q4. Non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year is $0.00-0.02, a positive metric as this implies some level of operating margin expansion.Valuation has remained compressed compared to some of the other faster-growing software names in the market. The main reason is Box has seen their revenue decelerate over the past few quarters without seeing consistent positive non-GAAP operating margins. This is a challenge for almost all software companies as making the transition from focusing on revenue growth to expanding margins is difficult.Given management’s raised guidance was simply from raising the upper end, this could imply decelerating revenues for the remainder of the year. Billings growth of 6% during the quarter remains lower than where it should be, which is why the stock continues to trade at a discount compared to faster growth software names.Data by YChartsManagement’s recently revised guidance of $690-692 million implies ~14% revenue growth for the full year. Revenue growth through the first two quarters is ~16%, meaning we would need to see ~12% growth in Q3/Q4 to get to the full year guidance. With a current market cap of ~$2.35 billion, cash of ~$200 million, and debt of ~$40 million, this gives Box a current enterprise value of ~$2.2 billion. Assuming revenue reaches management’s guidance range, this implies an FY20 revenue multiple of ~3.2x.I think revenue could ultimately come in higher than guidance and potentially reach $700 million for the year. Even at ~15% revenue growth, similar growing software companies trade at higher multiples given better profitability and better billings growth.If we assume revenue growth remains relatively consistent ~14% in FY21, we could see FY21 revenue of ~$790 million, giving us an FY21 revenue multiple of ~2.8x. While valuation remains pretty compressed, I think the stock could break out of the lower valuation if they put together a few solid quarters of revenue growth and margin expansion.Box remains a leader in the cloud collaboration space and has over 70% of the Fortune 500 companies as their customers. While there remains a long path ahead for the stock to return to a great investment, I think valuation has reached a near-term high and until the company reports another strong quarter, with the stock trading ~$16, I would be hesitant to put more money in the name."
4294465,104952,2019-10-01T18:17:07-04:00,"For roughly ~$2.8 billion, Microsoft can secure a leading position in cloud ECM space by taking over Box.Box has faced a rough 2019 so far. There were early signs of a demand-related issue in Q1 and Q2.Box's strong ECM product will be a much more interesting offering when bundled with Microsoft's other enterprise-focused products.","We believe that a future takeover looks more likely for Box (BOX) than ever considering its recent outlook. One positive thing in Q1 was the 16% YoY revenue growth. The downside outlook was the downgraded full-year revenue guidance to $688-692 million, which was lower than the previous estimate of $702.06 million mostly due to the longer sales cycle.:Billings growth was also a concern, given it only increased by 1% YoY. Besides, the management also lowered its Q2 guidance to $169-170 million from the previous estimate of $170.89 million.In Q2, we saw how Box recorded a revenue of $172.55 million to beat its revenue guidance and maintain its over 16% YoY growth rate. We also learned how the ongoing long-sales-cycle issue still seems to plague the company, which is obvious enough through the fact that a lot of large deals did not close as well as the previous year:All that aside, Box is still one of the most innovative tech companies with a competitive offering in the cloud ECM space. This fact alone could prop up the baseline narrative of a potential takeover by any of the other large-cap, cash-rich, and traditionally enterprise-focus companies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), or Salesforce (CRM).(Source: Box's Q2 earnings call slide)Given Oracle's strong commitment to focus on the cloud ERP space with its Netsuite acquisition in 2016 and Salesforce's recent move into the BI market with Tableau takeover, that leaves us with Microsoft as a potential buyer. With the introduction of Box Relay, Box GxP Validation, and Box Shield, the company has also strengthened its offering in the last few years when it comes to enterprise usability, security, and compliance. As a result, in terms of product, Box is by far the most competitive enterprise player versus Google Drive (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL), Dropbox (DBX), and even Microsoft OneDrive in recent times. OneDrive, which we initially believed would be a dominant enterprise player given its access to Microsoft's enterprise sales force, has instead leaned closer towards the consumer/professional individual side of the business recently. OneDrive, for instance, launched Personal Vault feature and an additional 50 GB storage size which targets individual users around the same time as Box Relay's launch announcement in Q1 2019.OneDrive's lack of enterprise focus despite Microsoft's strength in enterprise in recent times would mean either of two things: 1) it faces considerable challenges in its enterprise product development, or 2) it realizes that the opportunity cost to enter the ECM market is high, given it can always rely on its low-hanging-fruit, the 365 Office users, for growth. Either way, it is a good thing for Box, which can fill in the gaps to achieve synergies with OneDrive if it decides to pursue the potential takeover opportunity.For a company like Microsoft to acquire Box, it should not only be for the market share and product but also the revenue and cost synergies. On the cost side, for instance, Box can reduce its data center spending by sharing the data center with Microsoft, allowing Box to cut back on its data migration spending. The CFO, Dylan Smith, believes that the ongoing migration will adversely impact Box's gross margin until at least the first half of FY 2021.Another big issue Box seemed to be facing in Q2 was the fact that its 10% net expansion rate experienced a drop from 12% rate in the past four quarters, which the management claimed happened due to a lower renewal rate from one large customer. However, other recent large customer churns might also impact the lower net expansion rate, as we later discovered that the proportion of Fortune 500 companies in Box's customer list has decreased from 70% in Q1 to 69% in Q2:(Source: Box's earnings call slides. 70% fortune 500 in Q1 vs 69% fortune 500 in Q2)Overall, we saw early signs of a demand-related issue in Q1 and Q2, such as the decreasing net expansion rate in Q2 and longer-than-anticipated sales cycle in Q1. Realizing revenue and cost synergies can gradually solve these problems. For instance, Box takeover would mean that Microsoft can serve the demand for a more enterprise-ready ECM product from its 365 customers. With that in mind, Box ECM solution bundled together with Microsoft's Office 365 or its other enterprise products becomes a more interesting offering, which is expected to generate a higher net expansion rate and overall revenue.(Source: stockrow. Microsoft, Dropbox, and Box's SG&A to revenue)The other area where Box-Microsoft combination can directly create value is in sales and marketing. Over the last few years, we found that Box seems to have not managed this part of the cost structure well enough. Much of these sales and marketing expenses are due to the high commissions and increased headcounts. Despite its declining trend, Box spends the highest SG&A expenses relative to revenue compared to Microsoft and Dropbox.For a cloud software company like Box, the combination of its rule of 40 scores, product, and target market would affect its valuation. At the moment, Box trades at 4.15 TTM EV/Sales, which is a slight discount to Dropbox's 5.38. Similarly, Box trades at a discount at 3.76 P/S to Dropbox's 5.39. In the end, we learn how the market tends to assign a better valuation to Dropbox.While Dropbox is the faster-growing and more profitable company than Box, we also believe that the market tends to value Dropbox's consumer-focused more than Box's enterprise-focused approach. Box also trails behind Dropbox in terms of rule of 40. Box's 18.1% YoY revenue growth added to its levered FCF margin of 21.32% means it scores just little over 39% or slightly healthy. Before any takeover was to happen, it is essential for Box to improve both its overall growth and operating margins. Considering the outlook, the only reason for Microsoft to consider acquiring Box would mostly be a strategic one. Given Box's $691 million revenue estimate for its FY 2020 and assuming a consistent 4.15 EV/Sales, Box would have an Enterprise Value of $2.8 billion. Paying at least that much plus some acquisition premium, Microsoft would secure a leading position in cloud ECM space through the market share combination of Box and OneDrive while also put pressure on both Google and Dropbox."
4292393,104183,2019-09-19T00:03:31-04:00,"The SaaS bellwether has had a difficult time creating value for shareholders, as high costs challenge profits.Less-than-stellar performance of the stock has prompted renowned activist investor Starboard Value to take a stake in the company.Valuing Box is difficult with the lack of earnings, creating all the more reason for investors to focus on growth rates.","Box Inc. (BOX) has managed to rebound following reports that Starboard Value has taken a 7.5% stake in the company. Activist investors have been out in full force across a variety of sectors since the vacation days of August ended, and this represents a great opportunity for Starboard to shine a light on the various issues plaguing Box. No official letter or drawn-out statement has been put forth by Starboard yet, so we have very little to go off of in terms of how the fund wants to spur change at Box; however, it prompts investors to look under the hood and figure out what needs to change at the company in order for the stock to perform with some consistency.Source: Wikimedia CommonsIt was announced just a few weeks ago that Starboard Value has taken a 7.5% stake in Box, and investors should recognize that this isn’t Starboard’s first rodeo. The company has launched activist campaigns in the tech sector before, notably in Yahoo, Symantec and AOL. The next step for Starboard is getting board seats, which will be key, as the fund can then actually have influence in the direction of the company.Box’s response to the public was that it doesn’t comment on the conversations it has with investors; however, the company also stated that it is committed to engaging with its stockholders. It’s a very neutral response, handcrafted by a public relations team. What investors should recognize is that at some point in the short term, likely before the year is out, Starboard will unveil a plan or a strategic action. Additionally, when Box goes to report Q3 earnings, management will likely be asked questions by analysts in relation to the nature of Starboard's stake.Box’s value proposition is clear, but the execution on creating value for shareholders has been less than effective. By now, investors know that businesses operate at a more rapid pace today than ever before, creating a significantly higher volume of data, which needs to be stored. Additionally, employees are changing the way they work, with the need for collaborative effort continuing to increase. With the help of solutions like Box, the end effect of higher productivity is valuable to corporates all across the world. As a testament to the quality of its product, Box is used by nearly 70% of Fortune 500 companies.Source: Investor PresentationBox specifically provides a “seamless and secure” internal and external collaboration platform on the cloud and utilizes both machine learning and artificial intelligence to fulfill the needs of its customers. Security is also of the highest integrity for the company. Then, with such a great business model, why has the stock struggled and what needs to change? After all, the company has identified a $40 billion target market that has a high recurring revenue rate, likely 95%+. Not many public companies get to point to that kind of an opportunity.First, guidance following fiscal Q1 for Box was weak. The shares fell 11% following the Q1 reporting, as the company reported that closing deals with larger clients is taking longer than expected. Guidance for the remainder of the year was lowered. The FY 2020 guidance for revenue was set at $688-692 million, which was about 5% below the mark of consensus estimates at the time.The company reported fiscal 2020 Q2 earnings just over two weeks ago, with revenue at $172.5 million and an operating loss of $36.3 million. Revenue is on track to be growing at 5-year CAGR of +23%, so there is absolutely growth present; however, the Q2 YOY revenue growth rate was lower at +16%. The operating loss is nearly in line with the 2018 operating loss of $37.2 million, but it is a lower percent of sales, which does show a small improvement (25% versus 21%). What I think is rather disappointing is that billings are only growing at 6% on a YOY basis.Competition has also played a major role in the company being able to grow from here. Microsoft (MSFT) also offers a top-notch solution, as do Google (GOOG) and Dropbox (DBX), among others. New products have been one way to combat the competition, and clearly, Box has aimed to increase the number of offerings it has for over a decade now. The more high-quality products Box can offer, the more large-client deals this company will close, which translates to higher revenue. Yet, it's the combination of lower billings and high operating costs that are preventing this company from turning a profit, let alone one that's substantial enough to reward shareholders with.Source: Investor PresentationRPO, or the remaining performance obligations, are key in understanding Box. These are contracted sources of revenue that haven’t yet been recognized as revenue, and thus, are excluded from quarterly earnings, as the services have not yet been rendered. This is essentially another term for deferred revenue, backlog, or pipeline. The company expects to recognize roughly 67% of its RPOs over the next twelve months. The total amount of RPOs is $641 million, for which 67% is $429.7 million. That's a clear path to high revenues, and as these come in, it gives the company the opportunity to solidify its position in the market. Yet, if operating costs continue to be as high as they are, the RPO and corresponding revenue growth doesn't do much. It's my opinion that the market would rather this company turn a profit than see an acceleration in the top line.Source: Investor PresentationThat's why I think Starboard has become a large shareholder. Cost cuts need to start happening at a more accelerated pace. With every business, there is room for leaning out, some more than others. Starboard, like many activist shareholders, are experts at finding areas within a business that costs can be cut, and I expect that message to be relayed to the market in short order. While some operational efficiencies are starting to come through (non-GAAP operating expenses improved 6 points YOY), this company won’t be profitable on a reasonable timeline unless the strategic direction changes.This is a difficult question to answer given the negative earnings and negative operating earnings profile; however, I think we can look at the valuation in two ways: EV/Sales and in an acquisition scenario. On an EV/Sales basis, the stock trades at 3.3x versus an industry average of 3.2x. To the technology sector broadly, which trades at 2.6x sales, you could make the argument that Box is overvalued, but it’s difficult to see, especially with the top line growth that Box is currently putting up. If this stock traded at 5x or 6x EV/Sales, then there’d be cause for concern, but that’s not what you have here.Given that really only one multiple - EV/Sales - is applicable in valuing the company, we can’t value this company using traditional metrics or methodologies like a discounted cash flow model. They will paint a negative picture of the company or return an “N/A” error, as many of the inputs themselves, like operating income, are negative. So, how does Starboard find the conviction to go long Box, and how do investors from this point on find that same conviction? After cost cuts are made, I believe Box could very well be an acquisition target.When we think about Box’s core issue right now, it’s not retention rates of customers or the technology itself, but it’s rather a problem of high costs during a period when growth is high. That’s an accretive option to a potential acquirer, especially an older tech company that doesn’t put up double-digit revenue growth rates anymore. I think, too, there’s a large suite of potential acquirers for Box. Even the better-performing large-cap tech companies, like Microsoft and Google, can serve as potential acquirers for this business and take a clear #1 position in this market.In an acquisition scenario, Box is conservatively worth 20-30% more than it is today. A standard acquisition premium would have to be paid, especially given that the top-line itself is growing at a current pace of +16% YOY. Box deserves a significant premium because of its intellectual property and the depth of its current client base, which creates a high percentage of recurring revenue. I'd be surprised if, in an acquisition scenario, the shares didn't receive a premium of at least 20%. Yet, the largest headwind to this potential premium is the lack of profitability, for which the company needs Starboard to assist.Source: StockChartsTrue to the nature of tech companies, Box has a clean balance sheet, which means that there is no related headwind to a potential acquisition. Leverage is often a limiting factor in an acquisition scenario. Debt is minimal, and management sits with a net cash position, which opens the door to all sorts of exciting possibilities for investors, including capital return and even Box pursuing small acquisitions itself.However, the inability to generate an operating profit has left the company with both negative operating cash flow and negative free cash flow. Most will tell you to ignore this at this stage in the company’s life cycle, and to focus on the revenue growth as well as the market opportunity; however, they fail to recognize the components that are currently driving revenue and the structural issues that are actually affecting this company, such as poor cost management.Investors can have the confidence now that activists have hit the shareholder registry for Box. Starboard Value is one of the top names in the activist world with the power to create real change at the company. While we know relatively little about Starboard's intentions, we can reasonably say that change is coming to Box, potentially for the better. I expect the stock to be range-bound until the market receives more information as to the short-term direction of the company."
4289536,102646,2019-09-04T10:44:47-04:00,Dropbox and Box were the pioneers in the cloud storage industry.The companies have struggled as the industry has been saturated.I explain why Box is a better buy than Dropbox at these levels.,"A few years ago, Box (BOX) and Dropbox (DBX) were among the best-known technology companies in their world. The two companies had pioneered a new dimension in data storage and content sharing. As a result, their respective CEOs were idolized in the technology industry. The two companies went public in 2015 and 2018 respectively and earlier optimism has faded. At its peak, Box and Dropbox had market valuations of more than $4 billion and $16.82 billion respectively. Today, the companies are valued at $2.1 billion and $7.4 billion.Dropbox and Box began as cloud storage companies. With their desktop and mobile apps, people could save their documents and files and access them from everywhere. Along the way, the two took different paths. Box decided to place more emphasis on corporate clients. While the storage remained being the core product, the company expanded its offerings with products like Box Relay, Box KeySafe, Box Governance, and Box Shuttle. In fact, when you visit Box’s website, it is difficult to believe that storage is the core product. In the most recent earnings call, Levie reiterated that the goal of these additional services was to disrupt the content management industry he believes is worth more than $40 billion. According to Box, it serves 69% of all companies in the Fortune 500 list.Dropbox on the other hand has focused mostly on individual users. As of the most recent quarter, the company had more than 500 million registered users. Of these 13.6 million were paying customers. This was a higher number than the 11 million that the company reported in its S1 filing. From the 500M, the company believes that it can convert 300 million users to become paying customers. Like with Box, Dropbox has been on an aggressive move to attract more corporate customers. This has seen it buy HelloSign, as it attempts to create a more holistic platform for corporates. It has also been developing more corporate apps like Dropbox paper. It has also been boosting its integrations by partnering with companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Slack (WORK), Zoom (ZM), and Google (GOOG).In the most recent quarter, Box had revenue of $172.5 and a net loss of more than $36.23 million. Dropbox on the other hand had revenue of $401 million and a net loss of $21 million. In this quarter, the revenue growth for the two was 16.40% and 18.37% respectively. In 2019, 2020, and 2021, investors expect that Dropbox will generate revenue of $1.65 billion, $1.89 billion, and $2.1 billion. Box on the other hand is expected to generate revenue of $690 million, $776 million, and $881 million respectively. The table gives a brief comparison of the company’s statements.Source: YchartsSaturated IndustryBox and Dropbox are not undervalued companies. The two have an EV to EBITDA margin of 37 and 17 respectively. Investors are giving the company a premium valuation because of the low churn rates and the predictable cash flows.In the past decade, the two companies have introduced the world to the world of cloud storage and online collaboration. As a result, most people who previously did not have a way to store, access, and share their files rushed to create accounts with these companies. Along the way, other companies moved into the industry. Apple (AAPL) developed iCloud, Amazon (AMZ) developed Amazon Drive, Google developed Google Drive, and Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled OneDrive. In Asia, companies like Alibaba (BABA), Tencent, and Baidu developed similar products, and in Russia, Yandex developed a similar product. In New Zealand, Kim Dot Com also developed Mega, which gives users 50GB for free. Further, companies like Slack (WORK) too are attempting to disrupt the communication and storage industry.The challenge for Dropbox and Box is that the larger companies like Google and Microsoft offer their products as part of a suite. This lowers the cost to the end user. For example, a Business G-suite subscription costs $12 per month. This comes with an unlimited subscription to Google Drive. In addition to this, this service comes bundled with additional services like business email, photos, hangouts and shared calendars. Microsoft’s OneDrive on the other hand comes bundled with Office 365. As such, an Office 365 Home costs $10 a month and comes loaded with 6TB of OneDrive data, Office applications, and other tools. Also, as I wrote recently, my company is increasingly using Slack for collaboration and some file storage.Dropbox and Box fans will argue that this level of competition has always been there and the companies have managed to succeed. They argue that these small companies will continue to use their brands to attract more users. This is indeed the truth. However, another truth is that it is impossible to expect that these companies will continue to experience the historic growth rates. This is simply because most people who want to have a cloud storage platform already have them. Personally, I use Google Drive for most of my personal work and Microsoft OneDrive for my work-related tasks.Way ForwardBox and Dropbox are each trying to achieve growth by increasing their focus on the enterprise customers. These customers tend to be more reliable. This means that they rarely cancel their subscriptions and they tend to pay a higher price of the subscriptions. Box has been doing this for years and has been developing products like Governance and Relay.In recent months, Dropbox too has been trying hard to get more corporate clients. It is this reason why the company recently unveiled the ‘new Dropbox’, which is now a unified workspace connecting many services like G-Suite, Zoom, and Slack among others. The company also acquired HelloSign, a company that competes with DocuSign (DOCU) in the e-signature industry.Still, investors have not been pleased especially after the most recent earnings season. In the past one month, the stock prices of Box and Dropbox have dropped by 9 and 23% respectively. The two are trading near their all-time lows.So, what should investors do? While Box is still making losses, I believe that there is value in the relationships the company has made. The company’s products are used by more than 95k companies, with a good number of them paying more than $100k per year. Part of the reason why Box is still making losses is that it depends mostly on direct sales. As such, the company spends more than 50% of all its revenue in sales and marketing. With the company being relatively priced, I believe that the existing customer base presents important value to a bigger company like Salesforce (CRM). At the current market value of $2.1 billion, an acquiring company would be able to make a good return within a short period by creating synergies in the sales and marketing department. Indeed, Salesforce once considered acquiring the company as shown below.Source: Business InsiderAs for Dropbox, I believe that it is relatively risky to invest in it for two primary reasons. First, most of its paying customers are individuals, which increases the risk of churn. Second, the recent launch of ‘new Dropbox’ appears to have been launched too late. It was launched at a time when similar workspaces have been there for quite some time. Finally, as mentioned before, growth in the consumer storage will continue to slow mostly because of saturation. Therefore, I believe that investors should avoid Dropbox for now."
4288645,103480,2019-08-29T10:37:35-04:00,"Shares of Box have tumbled more than 8% to new 52-week lows after reporting Q2 results. It's also down more than 20% since last quarter.
        The company's top and bottom line, however, came in above Wall Street's expectations.
        Contrary to expectations, revenue growth remained at its 16% y/y pace and didn't decay from last quarter.
        Even more significantly, Box managed to grow billings again, after coming off a flat Q1.
        Box remains a bargain-basement stock trading under 3x forward revenues.","By now, we shouldn't be surprised when storage SaaS company Box (BOX) tumbles post-earnings. There hasn't been any positive associations with this name for over a year, and after reporting Q2 results, Box fell to new 52-week lows. Hurt by both a difficult competitive environment against rivals like Dropbox (DBX) - which is facing its own struggles - as well as slowing global demand for IT investments, Box has seen its growth rates skid from the mid-30s a few years ago to the mid-teens now. As a result, the stock has remained stuck in the penalty box for over a year:While Box's recovery may be slow, I still believe this stock to be one of the best value names in the software sector. Box's storage solutions have proven to be incredibly sticky products, and it's a pain for organizations to migrate all their files to a new cloud storage provider once they're locked in. This provides Box with a remarkably sticky revenue base, as evidenced by its strong 106% net retention rate (only 4% of customers are churning, while the existing installed base is growing at 10% on average):Figure 1. Box retention metricsSource: Box 2Q20 earnings presentationAdd-on products have been key here. In addition to low churn, Box's add-on modules such as Box Relay and Box Shield have seen improved adoption, as customers beef up their subscription packages with deeper AI and security capabilities. This has allowed Box to grow its revenue base while keeping operating costs down. Box - once known to be a freewheeling, cash-burning monster - has tapered down its sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues alongside its slowing growth, allowing the company to dramatically improve operating margins. This quarter, Box hit positive pro forma operating margins - despite a loss in the year-ago quarter. The key message here: Box may no longer be the most exciting or fastest-growing company in the SaaS space, but it's certainly a steady one. As long as Box can reliably continue to grow its revenue base in the mid-teens (driven primarily by add-on products, as well as new business from the ~30% of the Fortune 500 that isn't currently on the Box platform), it can capitalize on its strong gross margins to drive operating leverage and boost profits and cash flow. At present, shares of Box trade far below typical SaaS valuations. At the company's post-Q2 stock price of ~$13, Box has a market cap of $2.0 billion. If we net off the $201.5 million of cash on Box's balance sheet and add back $40 million of long-term debt, we arrive at an enterprise value of $1.84 billion.Versus the midpoint of Box's FY20 revenue guidance of $690-$692 million, Box trades at a mere 2.7x EV/FY20 revenues. Figure 2. Box guidance updateSource: Box 2Q20 earnings releaseWe note that Box is also trading about one turn cheaper than Dropbox (DBX), its slightly faster-growing rival that is also currently struggling due to a worse-than-expected customer reaction to a pricing change. At such a low valuation, however, this means that Box is also about 25% cheaper than its closest competitor.In my view, Box remains a solid long-term recovery play, even if the short-term fluctuations may be painful to bear. Box's recovery in billings growth rates and its ability to maintain high expansion rates, coupled with improving margins and cash flows, makes it a good hedge in a turbulent stock market environment that has punished high-flying stocks with strong growth, but poor margins and even poorer valuations.Now let's parse the details of Box's latest earnings results. The Q2 summary is shown below:Figure 3. Box 2Q20 earnings resultsSource: Box 2Q20 earnings releaseRevenues grew 16% y/y to $172.5 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $169.5 million (+14% y/y) by a comfortable two-point margin. Contrary to expectations that called for a deceleration in Box's growth rates, the company managed to retain its pace of growth from the last quarter.The good news continues. Recall that investors' biggest issue with Box's Q1 results was the fact that its billings growth grinned to a halt last quarter, clocking in at a mere 1% y/y. The company faced a difficult prior-year comp in Q1 that was expected to linger into Q2 - and in the end, the company was able to match its promise of hitting billings growth in the mid-single digits, clocking in at 6% y/y:Figure 4. Box billings trendsSource: Box 2Q20 earnings presentationBox continues to expect billings growth rates to normalize in the back half of FY20 and return to revenue growth levels, hopefully implying that revenue growth will no longer see deceleration. As previously noted, Box's recovery in billings and revenue performance was heavily supported by the success of attach-on products, which CEO Aaron Levie noted had an 80% attach rate in the company's six-figure deals. Add-on products, particularly Box's AI and content recognition capabilities, are also what differentiate Box from Dropbox's more consumer-oriented product portfolio,As Box's growth has slowed down relative to prior years, the company has also rightly shifted its focus to profit expansion. It has pushed on the largest operating lever that most SaaS companies have - sales and marketing expenses. With Box's top-line growth slowing, it no longer has to keep aggressively expanding the size and coverage of its sales teams; as such, the company's sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues have dropped to 41%, four points lower than 45% in the year-ago quarter. Coupled with a one-point reduction in general and administrative expenses, Box managed to improve pro forma operating margins to 0.3%, up an impressive 470bps relative to -4.4% in the year-ago quarter. We note as well that it's unusual for Box, as well as any SaaS company that's not a large-cap, to generate positive margins in any quarter other than the fourth.Figure 5. Box margin trendsSource: Box 2Q20 earnings releaseBox's pro forma EPS clocked in at breakeven, a penny better than Wall Street's expectations of -$0.01. In addition, the company's YTD operating cash flows of $20.8 million are up 21% y/y, while YTD free cash flow of $17.6 million are up 80% y/y, driven by lower capex outlays:Figure 6. Box cash flowsSource: Box 2Q20 earnings releaseInvestors have yet to change their perception of Box. Many are still thinking of Box as a growth stock, and are thus penalizing the company's relatively lower revenue and billings growth rates. Viewed from a value angle, however, Box looks much more attractive. The company has a steady customer base with add-on products constantly driving expansion revenues, while a heightened focus on the bottom line has allowed Box to move past breakeven operating margins and grow cash flows. With shares trading at such a low valuation relative to the rest of the SaaS sector, it's a good time to get in on Box at the ground level and wait on a rebound."
4272921,104099,2019-07-01T08:03:36-04:00,"Box Inc. represents a textbook case of what happens when the market becomes too optimistic. If your beat is insufficiently great, you'll still be punished. Tech investors should take note.Although I think there are some positive signs here, I think the shares are overpriced relative to the underlying business.I think call options represent the best trade off of risk and reward. Call owners get (most) of the upside at far less risk. Take advantage of this asymmetry.","Over the past year, the shares of Box Inc. (BOX) are down about 30%. This price action is different than what we see from most (hushed tones) SaaS businesses, so I was intrigued. I thought I’d look in on the name and decide whether there’s value here or not. I think this company represents a textbook case of what can go wrong when expectations are too optimistic. In its most recent earnings announcement, for example, the company managed to beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines, but the shares fell because revenue growth was “only” 16% year over year (!). In my view, owning the shares here makes no sense, but I will suggest that people who are long this story switch to calls. I’ll go through my reasoning below by offering a brief introduction to the firm for those who are less familiar with it, by looking at the financial history, and the stock itself. I’ll conclude with a discussion of the options I’m recommending.Box is a cloud content management company that helps customers securely manage their content while allowing them to securely and easily access this content from anywhere. Customers can collaborate on content with people both within their organisations and without. The company is based on the (reasonable in my view) philosophy that content is more powerful when it’s accessible, secure, and easily shared. In addition, the company provides industry specific content management for those sectors that require very specific content requirements as a result of regulatory regimes and the like.As of the end of the most recent fiscal year, the company serves just over 64.5 million registered users, 19% of whom are paying users. The company serves 92,000 organizations in 24 languages. Interestingly, one customer represents ~11% of the company’s revenue. I’ll admit that this level of concentration makes me nervous.A quick review of the financial history here reveals that this is obviously a growth company. Over the past several years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 23% . The growth in revenue is obviously intact, as revenue in the first quarter of this year was 16% higher than the same period a year ago. As was stated earlier, this was somehow a disappointment to Wall Street.High revenue growth isn’t the only relative positive here, though. Free cash flow has increased from $7.3 million in Q1 2018 to $13.4 million in the same period in Q1 2019, which I consider to be a very encouraging sign. Finally, this company, unlike many of its SaaS peers, actually shows a positive correlation between revenue and net income. Many of the other businesses in this space have the remarkable habit of losing more money the more they sell. Box doesn’t seem to be afflicted by this strange condition, as net loss is generally declining as revenue increases.Finally, I think it’s worth noting that stock based compensation is growing quite fast. Both the number of employees and the compensation per employee has grown at a CAGR of 11.3% and 30% respectively over the past five years. This is an extraordinarily generous company to work for.Source: Company filingsThe positives aside, this company remains unprofitable, though, and I can’t get past that. The stock will need to be trading at a very reasonable valuation to allow me to buy at these levels. Unfortunately, it’s not trading at a reasonable valuation.I think the performance of the stock should be instructive to investors. In my view, when you pay 150 times free cash for an investment, any investment, things will eventually work out badly. This is the case here. For example, 12 months ago, the company was trading for ~115 times free cash and the shares have dropped by ⅓ since then.Source: GurufocusI’d say of the current valuation of ~55 times that the stock is now only “ridiculously expensive” and no longer “morbidly expensive.” In any case, the valuation would be enough to keep me away if this were a massively profitable enterprise. As it stands, I can’t recommend the combination of continuing losses trading at a massive premium.While I don’t like the stock at these levels, I’ll admit that there are some compelling reasons to buy the shares, in addition to the reasons I already mentioned about growing revenue and free cash flow. In my view, successful investing is largely about achieving a given result with as little risk as possible. For that reason, while I think the shares are excessively priced at these levels, I think it reasonable to suspect that the crowd may drive the shares higher from these levels. For that reason, I think call options as a proxy for the shares makes the most sense as they represent far lower risk than actual share ownership. Calls will help the user benefit from a rise in price, at a much lower cost, and thus much lower risk. At the moment, I think the Box December calls with a strike of $20 represent the best risk-reward here. They last traded at $1.15, and are currently bid-ask at $1.10-$1.20.So, if the shares manage to turnaround and rise from here, the investor will capture most of that benefit. If the shares swoon, it will be troublesome to lose $1.15 of value, but in my view $1.15 is far less than what investors would lose in the shares themselves. So, in a sense, calls represent the “least bad” way to invest in Box in my view.While I think there are some positive signs here, like the growing free cash flow and revenue, the continued losses plus excessive valuation causes me to avoid this name. That said, I think the market may have gotten ahead of itself on the downside, and therefore calls might be a good choice at these levels. In any event, for those who are interested in profiting from this company’s fortunes in future, I think call options represent the best possible choice. Investors won’t be giving up a dividend, and will get exposure to this name at much lower risk."
4268284,103480,2019-06-05T09:30:00-04:00,"Shares of Box fell to fresh 52-week lows after the company reported Q1 earnings results.
        Though Q1 revenues and EPS beat Wall Street's consensus, revenue growth weakened to an all-time low of 16% y/y, four points worse than the prior quarter.
        Box also cut its full-year revenue forecast, while its Q2 outlook calls for just 14% y/y growth.
        Despite the fundamental slowdown in Box's business, the company is becoming a margin expansion and FCF story.
        Box's valuation of ~3x forward revenues is among the cheapest in the software industry.","For the past year, cloud storage and collaboration company Box (BOX) has only had bad news to share with the market. Earnings releases are typically fraught with landmines, and this quarter was no different: though Box came in ahead of expectations for Q1 results, management made a surprising cut to the full-year forecast while pointing to its slowest-ever growth rate in the upcoming second quarter. Unsurprisingly, shares of Box tumbled sharply to new 52-week lows. The stock also isn't far off from the $14 price at which it went public four years ago:Does Box have a shot at recovery? In my view, Box has become an even greater bargain. I've been a longtime bull on this name, and while I'm disappointed with the top-line deceleration, as well as evidence of lengthening deal cycles and competition, I remain fundamentally bullish on Box's stock for the following reasons:Let's expand on the last valuation point and do a quick check on where Box is currently trading. At Box's present share price around the ~$16 mark, the company trades at a market cap of $2.29 billion. If we net out the $231.4 million of cash and $40 million of debt on its balance sheet, we arrive at an enterprise value of $2.10 billion. Here's how that stacks up against Box's latest guidance view:Figure 1. Box guidance updateSource: Box 1Q20 earnings releaseVersus the $688-$692 million in revenues that Box expects to generate this year, the company trades at a valuation multiple of 3.04x EV/FY20 revenues, among the cheapest multiples in the SaaS sector, and one of the only bona fide value stocks in the group. This guidance outlook was one of the reasons that Box shares sunk on the earnings release - it represents a two-point reduction from Box's initial FY20 view of $700-$704 million (+15-16% y/y), and is below Wall Street's consensus of $702.1 million. Note that before Box had released any guidance at all for FY20, Wall Street had expected 20% y/y growth to $732.8 million. Being in the situation of chasing guidance estimates down is never a good predicament to be in, but in Box's case, the company's slowdown in growth has also accompanied a massive tumble in valuation, creating a decent risk-reward opportunity for investors who can stomach a few volatile quarters. A critical catalyst for Box to re-ignite revenue growth, apart of continually landing new customers, is to sell in add-on products to its existing install base. Box management reported that add-on products saw 57% y/y growth in Q1. Because add-on sales cost very little incremental sales dollars to close, this revenue stream is also incredibly margin-accretive. Box's suite of add-on products are also an important distinguisher versus rivals like Dropbox (DBX), Microsoft OneDrive (MSFT), and Google Drive (GOOG):Figure 2. Box add-on productsSource: Box Q1 earnings deckThe bottom line on Box: not all hope is lost. Box's new low price captures the company's revenue downside, and investors have an opportunity to secure a position in a category-leading SaaS company at bargain-basement prices. My year-end price target on Box is $21, representing a valuation multiple of 4x EV/FY20 revenues (more in-line with historical multiples) and 31% upside from current levels.Let's dive deeper into Box's first-quarter results, which were far more positive than the company's Q2/FY20 guidance update:Figure 3. Box 1Q20 resultsSource: Box 1Q20 earnings releaseRevenues grew 16% y/y to $163.0 million, the company's slowest-ever revenue growth pace and a four-point deceleration from last quarter's 20% y/y growth rate. However, Box did come in one point stronger than Wall Street's consensus of $161.4 million (+15% y/y). Box's top-line weakness was even more evident in the compression of its billings growth rate to just 1% y/y. As a SaaS company that signs multi-year deals and defers the revenue over multiple quarters, billings growth is the far more important indicator of overall future growth trends, and unfortunately this metric hit a huge snag this quarter:Figure 4. Box billings trendsSource: Box Q1 earnings deckDylan Smith, Box's co-founder and CFO, chalked up the billings slowdown to the following reasons on the Q1 earnings call:Essentially, Box had reaped the benefits of several large deals in the prior year as well as a one-tine developer fee, creating a difficult Q1 compare, while failing to upset another large deal that was up for renewal this cycle. The tough billings compares will begin to subside in the second half of FY20. Fortunately, however, the company is taking actions to address its sales slowdown. Box is in the midst of searching for a new global sales head, reporting to Box's COO. In addition, the company has begun ramping up sales of Box Relay, a new workflow automation tool. As previously mentioned, Box's stack of add-on products like Relay have driven tremendous growth for the company and represent completely greenfield, tertiary revenue opportunities while also acting as differentiators against Box's competition.And though the sales slowdown in disappointing, it's counterbalanced by the fact that Box drove tremendous operating margin growth through a reduction in sales expenses as a proportion of revenues:Figure 5. Box opex trendsSource: Box Q1 earnings deckAs seen in the chart above, Box reduced sales and marketing expenses to 43% as a percentage of revenues, down six points from the year-ago quarter - helping to shrink pro forma operating losses to -$2.0 million, representing a pro forma operating margin of -2% and a five-point improvement from -7% in the year-ago quarter. This operating margin improvement would have been even two points better had Box not faced a temporary gross margin headwind due to a data center migration. Overall, Box's pro forma EPS of-$0.03 came in well ahead of Wall Street's consensus of -$0.05. It's worth noting as well that Box nearly doubled free cash flow to $13.4 million this quarter, up from $7.4 million in 1Q19 and representing three points of FCF margin expansion. Even as Box's sales growth decelerates, Box is becoming more of a profitability/FCF story - which is a huge turnaround for a company that was once chastised for heavy losses and large cash burn. Box is living proof that the SaaS model works for disciplined companies: though losses may be heavy upfront while the company focuses on driving growth through expanding sales teams, the company at maturity can drive margin gains as its revenue scale begins to dwarf sales expenses.Figure 6. Box FCF margin trendsSource: Box Q1 earnings deckDespite near-term headwinds in Box's sales momentum, the company remains both a technology leader in the cloud collaboration space (with add-on products like Relay showcasing Box's continued innovation in the category) as well as a positive free cash flow generator. In my view, these counterbalancing factors are more than sufficient to merit a bullish take on a SaaS company whose valuation has eroded to ~3x forward revenues. We note as well that Box, especially as an FCF-positive SaaS company, remains an attractive takeover target for either a corporate or private equity buyer at low valuation multiples.Look for a buying opportunity in this stock and take advantage of the market's fear."
4277087,35181,2019-07-24T12:53:50-04:00,"Box is a leader in the highly competitive cloud content management market segment.Revenue growth has been in decline for several years, and with lower guidance this year, the stock price has taken a hit.The company fails on the Rule of 40, gross profit margin is falling, and SG&A expense is too high.For these reasons, I have assigned a neutral rating for this company.","Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX) is a leader in the highly competitive cloud content management market with a platform that allows secure access, storage, and sharing of content on the cloud. BOX has more than 95,000 paying organizations, and the application is offered in 24 languages.(Source: Box)While Box grew revenues by 19% in the last year, there are several negative factors, including a low score for the Rule of 40, declining gross profit margin and high SG&A expense relative to sales. The declining profit margin is likely a result of increasing competition plus longer and more expensive sales cycles. I don't see the situation improving this year. For these reasons, I assign Box a neutral rating.Box has had a rough 2019 so far. The last two quarterly reports in March and June were not received well by shareholders, with the stock price dropping 18% and 8%, respectively, amidst lowered guidance. The company hired new sales staff in 2018 with plans to hire more this year and has recently hired a new Chief Revenues Officer (CRO). Box is also introducing new functionality to the platform in an attempt to increase retention rate and cross-selling.While the above are positive factors for the company, I don't expect to see any real results from these initiatives this year. And, given the competitiveness in cloud content management, I think it is prudent to see how the new products perform before considering an investment in Box.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation. Relative valuation is a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.It seems logical to me that high-growth companies should be valued more highly than slow-growth companies. To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value (EV)/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 75 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"" also provided by Portfolio123.The reason for using analysts' estimates is because SaaS stocks tend to make a lot of acquisitions which can muddy the results of the scatter plot. The analyst estimates account for these acquisitions, and the estimates are updated frequently. This makes for a cleaner chart. The sales estimates, unlike EPS estimates, are usually quite accurate for most SaaS companies, except that they tend to be a little on the conservative side.I use an exponential best-fit trend line as it appears to be more appropriate than a linear trend line for this application. As sales growth goes up, the valuation goes up exponentially. The trend line was calculated using MS Excel. I consider the stocks sitting above the trend line to be overvalued, while stocks lying under the trend line are undervalued.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Box is positioned below the trend line, suggesting that its EV/forward sales are lower than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Box is undervalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.A rule of thumb often applied to software companies is the Rule of 40. This metric helps SaaS companies balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's revenue growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has balanced growth and cash flow resulting in financial health.In 2015, Box had an annual sales growth of more than 80%. But since then, growth has fallen steadily and now sits at 19% for the most recent trailing twelve months (TTM).(Source: Portfolio123)Box's free cash flow margin TTM had been improving, going from negative 55% in 2016 to positive 8% now.(Source: Portfolio123)Box's YoY revenue growth was 19%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing twelve months was 8%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 19% + 8% = 27%Since the calculation comes out much lower than 40%, I conclude that Box is not in a good shape financially.Another bone of contention that I have is Box's gross profit margin, which has been steadily decreasing since 2016 and now sits at 78.5%. 78% is not bad, but the steady decrease is a bit disturbing. I believe that this phenomenon is likely due to increasing competition and change of product mix towards cloud content management, which tends to be longer and be more expensive. The lower gross margin makes it more difficult for Box to get back to becoming a high growth company.(Source: Portfolio123)As an investor, you want to make sure that, if a company doesn't score well on the Rule of 40, it is at least not burning cash. Unfortunately, Box is, in fact, burning cash. You can tell by examining the SG&A expense relative to sales. In the case of Box, the SG&A expense is 92% of the total revenues. This figure is quite high for a company growing revenues of less than 20% per year.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)Given that Box doesn't meet the Rule of 40, has declining gross margin, and is burning cash, I have to give this stock a neutral rating.Box is a leader in the highly competitive cloud content management market segment. Revenue growth has been in decline since 2015 and is now 19% form the most recent twelve months. I don't expect to see business picking up this year as new product introductions will take time to catch on, and new sales staff need to be trained before they can hit the street. Box fails on the Rule of 40, and this is made worse by very high SG&A expenses. The gross margin is falling, likely due to competition and longer sales cycles. For these reasons, I have to give Box a neutral rating. It is worthwhile checking back at the end of 2019 to see if the new applications are gaining traction.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"
4236173,67473,2019-01-29T06:39:40-05:00,"Greenhaven Road Capital is a long-biased, concentrated hedge fund. We invest only in our very best ideas – typically 15 long positions or less and a handful of opportunistic short positions.Generally avoiding commodity-based companies, we look for businesses with strong cash flow, normalized earnings, and long term growth horizons.Includes detailed analysis of the fund's positions in KKR, BlueLinx, Fiat Chrysler, Box, SharpSpring, Etsy, Yelp.","Original PostGreenHaven Road Capital commentary for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018.Dear Fellow Investors,The fourth quarter was not a profitable one for the partnership. In fact, statistically, it was the least profitable we have had in several years. For investors in the Long-Term Class, returns were approximately -20.7% for the quarter and -10.5% for the year. You may take some solace in the fact that the Russell 2000 was down -22% for the quarter and down -11% for the year.As I have written before, if we want to have the opportunity for significant up quarters, we have to be able to tolerate significant down quarters. We will not get the ups without the downs. Over time, there should be more ups than downs, but there will be both. Despite our Q4 2018 returns, the fund has still outperformed major indices over the last three years, five years, and since inception (eight years). Given the embedded valuations of our holdings, I like our prospects. What goes down can also go up. Our portfolio is stocked with companies I believe have high insider ownership, strong products, attractive valuations, and asymmetric return profiles. While paper losses were incurred in the short term, opportunities were created for the long term.Given that down periods are an inevitability of investing in a concentrated, long-biased fashion, the question is: what do I do during these periods of rapidly declining markets? The simplest solution would be to just time the market. Sell when prices are high, sit out the entirety of the declines, and buy shares right at the bottom just before prices begin their rebound. Sounds good to me. Unfortunately, I don't know how to time the market effectively, nor am I aware of any person or computer that has consistently done so. Inevitably, market timing leads to underinvestment. Portions of the downside are often avoided, but so are the recoveries. Given the positive expected values of our investments over the long term, trying to predict the daily movements of the market is not likely to improve returns. As a result, little effort is devoted to it.Where, then, is effort focused? I try to balance three competing forces during these periods of high volatility and rapidly declining prices. The first is a desire to be a long-term shareholder and just hold tight. Even the highest- quality companies like Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) have each had multiple 50%+ drawdowns during their decades of heroic returns. Only those able to endure the pain of such declines actually participated in the 100X+ returns that ultimately were realized by the holders. Doing nothing is far harder than it sounds but is often richly rewarded in the equity markets when you hold a portfolio of companies with high insider ownership, recurring revenue, operating leverage, and the ability to grow with no additional capital.The desire to just hold conflicts with a recognition that volatility creates opportunities. In a period where the average stock in the Russell 2000 is down in excess of 20%, there are hundreds of stocks down 30% or more from their recent highs. A stock that declines 33% has to gain 50% to recoup those losses. Buying fundamentally sound businesses that have sold off for non-fundamental reasons can be a very profitable endeavor. The second competing desire is thus to upgrade our portfolio. Have all of those companies' prospects really diminished by so much so quickly? When my wife hears ""risk off,"" she wants to start stuffing money in our mattress and assume the fetal position - yet in reality, ""risk off"" is shopping time for the value investor. In my past few years of research, I have periodically remarked, ""I would like to own that someday at a better price."" Well, for several companies, ""someday"" came during the fourth quarter. I looked at more companies in greater depth in the fourth quarter than I had in the prior two years.Nearly 90% of stocks in the Russell 2000 were down in the fourth quarter. The overall market was down 12 days in a row at one point. Any ""risk"" taking was met with immediate short-term losses. The final competing force is a desire to survive. I don't mean that I have an intense desire to give into panic, sell everything, and hide under the desk. The fund is my largest investment by orders of magnitude comprising a very, very significant portion of my liquid net worth. I want to invest for decades. I want to be thoughtful about the risks we are taking and make sure that we are disproportionately rewarded. I want to seize opportunities, but to survive markets that can be irrational for long periods of time requires not betting the farm, spreading risks, and seeking asymmetric opportunities where the upside is substantially higher than the downside.Hopefully you just read the previous passages and said to yourself, ""shouldn't the desire to hold, the desire to take advantage of opportunity, and a thoughtful assessment of assumed risks be in place at all times?"" They should be… and they are. Our course of action in the fourth quarter resembled that of every other quarter. While the result was more negative, the process and philosophy were exactly the same. We do not have a new strategy. A portfolio built with a five-year time horizon was not completely tossed because of the volatility of the 64 trading days of the fourth quarter. Rather, we completely exited one position as the original thesis appears to be wrong (more on that later), made some adjustments to existing positions, and initiated three new positions, all with different but I believe highly asymmetric return profiles. If I could recreate the asymmetry of the opportunities available to us in Q4 every quarter, we would all benefit enormously. The seeds of future returns have been planted.During the quarter, we initiated a new position in KKR & Co. (NYSE:KKR), an alternative asset manager founded 42 years ago. Under the leadership of Henry Kravis, the firm has evolved from a single buyout fund to a 1,200- employee asset management firm with offices all over the world. I believe KKR has all of the attributes of a great business.High Insider Ownership: The firm is 40% owned by employees.Recurring Revenue: The fund is increasingly focused on ""permanent"" capital. Currently, 9% of capital is permanent and 80% has eight-plus years of duration at inception.Operating Leverage: Incremental margins are exceptionally high in the asset management business, as compensation is the primary variable cost incurred with each incremental dollar of profit.Aligned Incentives: In addition to 40% insider ownership, the firm has more than $10 billion invested alongside clients in KKR funds. Further, more than half of the KKR AUM is eligible to be charged performance fees. Employees do well when clients do well. Shareholders do well when employees and clients do well.Secular Tailwinds: The alternative asset management industry is growing at approximately 12% per year. I believe that the recent declines in public equities will do nothing to slow pension funds, and others that need to show a path to 8+% annual returns, from allocating away from fixed income and towards private equity - there is no end in sight. Assets have flowed disproportionately to the larger firms, and KKR is taking share within private equity, growing assets at 19% per year since 2004.Runway for Growth: KKR has enormous opportunities for growth, particularly in several large markets such as real estate and infrastructure, where the leading players' AUM is 19X and 10X, respectively, the size of KKR's.Under-earning / Investing in the Future: While KKR has been in business for over four decades, the vast majority of its currently funded strategies have been operating for less than one. Infrastructure; energy; U.S., European, and Asian real estate; Tech and Health Care Growth; Private Credit; and U.S. and European Lending are all less than 10 years old. The economics of a strategy can get substantially better over time. The first fund in a strategy is typically smaller and used to build a track record, and its first year is typically a money-losing period as early management fees often do not offset fundraising expenses. If all goes well, there will be some incentive fees, but the amount is often on the small side because the fund is on the small side. The economics get progressively better as a larger second fund is layered in around year four and potentially an even larger fund is layered in around year eight. Eventually, there can be both sizable management and incentive fees from multiple funds in a strategy, with economics that continue to improve as funds age and grow in size. Given the young age of so many funds at KKR, there is the potential for significantly improved economics over time.Differentiated: KKR has the strongest balance sheet of any of the publicly traded PE firms in terms of cash and investments as a % of total market capitalization. This provides downside protection, but also allows KKR to seed funds and provide additional capital to close deals. The firm also has a Capital Markets group which allows KKR to syndicate deals, reduce cost of capital, and optimize monetization strategies, improving returns and likely generating $500M+ in profitable revenue. KKR is one of a handful of private equity firms that can do ""mega deals"" because of their access to capital on the balance sheet as well as the services of their Capital Markets group.We began purchasing shares in the low $20s and ended purchasing shares in the high teens. What did we get for our money? As of the end of Q3 2018, the firm had $195B in assets under management, and an adjusted book value of $16.68 per share.Let's spend a minute on the balance sheet since it is a large part of the investment thesis. KKR's balance sheet as a percentage of equity value is the highest of any publicly traded asset manager, a fact which is often ignored by sell side analysts as it is easier to compare firms on a P/E basis. KKR uses these internal funds to aggressively seed new funds and invest in existing funds. The asymmetry for the KKR investment is created because of the downside protection provided by the balance sheet and the long duration of the capital it manages.KKR's balance sheet has three attractive components: cash ($2.9B or $3.50 per share), investments ($10.2B or $12+/share), and unrealized carried interest ($1.7B or $2 per share). If you are adding up these totals as we go, you get $17.50 on a $20 stock. Sound too good to be true? Well, there are some liabilities and some ""other assets"" so the stated book value per share is $16.68 per share. In addition, these values are all as of September 30th, before the market swoon. Q4 saw large marked-to-market losses on KKR's investments including the largest holding, First Data Corp. (FDC) (14% portfolio weight as of 9/30), which was down 31% in the quarter. The private companies, which are valued using a mix of public company comparables and discounted cash flows (DCFs), presumably fared far better than First Data Corp. Declines in investment value have a secondary effect of also negatively impacting the unrealized carry. The balance sheet has multiple inputs that we cannot estimate with great precision, but when I back out the parts of ""other investments"" that we don't want to own and make estimates for the impact of the decline of the public markets, there is still north of $13 per share in balance sheet that I am happy to own - in fact, more than happy to own. I personally view the investments on the balance sheet as significantly preferable to cash. Employees own 40% of the company; they also own 40% of these investments and have a track record of compounding capital at high rates. This is their capital, and their incentive compensation is driven off of the returns of the funds in which this capital is invested. It is not unreasonable to believe that the balance sheet investments can compound at double-digit rates (with no fees) for the foreseeable future invested alongside KKR managers.For a company with over $13 per share in attractive balance sheet assets, we also get $195B in assets under management (AUM), almost $60B in dry powder (funds that can be called and added to AUM), and a franchise that is growing market share in an industry that is growing. The firm is lengthening the duration of the capital under management, as well as growing total assets. KKR raised $39B in gross capital in 2017 and should have exceeded this number in 2018 (to be confirmed when the final numbers are released). Even with the number of ""young"" funds the company is currently nurturing, they have still generated after-tax distributable earnings of $1.65 in 2016, $1.66 per share in 2017, and are on pace for $2 in 2018. Ex balance sheet, we are paying sub-4X depressed earnings that should grow. The beauty of KKR is that both components of valuation can grow: the investments and the earnings stream.Earlier I mentioned that KKR has grown AUM at a compounded annual rate of 19% over the past 13 years. While there is some lumpiness in incentive fees, management fees are very stable and growing. The setup is reminiscent of our previous holding of Fortress Investment Group (NYSE:FIG), whose balance sheet was ignored during volatile and ""risk off"" periods (link to our thesis).At the KKR investor day (link to presentation), the company laid out a series of reasonable assumptions (slides 22-23) to double earnings and book value in five years as well as reasonable valuation frameworks (slides 239-246) to derive a $40 stock price as of the July presentation date. Now, there are a lot of ifs and assumptions in here, but I consider it to be a very reasonable path to doubling earnings and book value, and with a little multiple expansion from today's very low base, there is a path to a triple or better in less than five years. I can sleep at night because of the protection provided by the balance sheet, but I dream about the growth in AUM and earnings power that may likely come. In my opinion, this is a fantastic business that became very attractively priced as the market ignored the balance sheet, growth prospects, and earning power of the company. Thank you, Mr. Market. Volatility does have its benefits.In the fourth quarter, we invested in the building products distribution company BlueLinx (NYSE:BXC) for the second time. When we initially invested, the thesis (presented in our Q4 2017 letter) was that were shares were cheap due to non-fundamental factors, including the forced sale of 70% of the company by a private equity fund that was at the end of its life. Despite being a long-term oriented investor, I sold the shares relatively quickly for a substantial gain. I had more faith in the discount to asset value (land) at which the company was trading than I had in the ongoing building products distribution business, which is low margin and cyclical: not my favorite combination. In addition, BlueLinx was subscale relative to competitors and I just thought there were better places to put our capital. Thus, as the valuation gap closed and future returns became less about assets and more about the business, we sold.In March 2018, shortly after we sold the shares, BlueLinx bought its competitor Cedar Creek, which had significant overlap in product lines and geographies. The acquisition created much-needed scale, taking the 10th and 11th largest building distribution companies and combining them to become the 6th largest in the nation and the 3rd largest east of the Rockies. The market loved the deal, which was financed with debt, and sent BXC shares from the high teens to the low $40s in a matter of days as analysts clamored over the potential earnings growth. As stand-alone companies, BlueLinx generated $44M in adjusted EBITDA in 2017 and Cedar Creek generated $60M, so just by combining the two and not issuing any shares, the pro forma company would generate more than twice the EBITDA per share. Even more interesting to forward-looking investors, management showed a path to $50M in cost savings by closing facilities, reducing redundant overhead, and improved purchasing enabled by the larger scale. With the cost savings factored in, on a pro forma basis, the combined BlueLinx + Cedar Creek + cost savings would generate more than $150M in cash per year. After paying interest on the debt, taxes, and CapEx, the company estimated the combined entities would generate $75M in excess cash flow per year. With 9.3M shares outstanding, this is more than $8 per share in free cash flow. Even at $40 per share, this translates into a 20% free cash flow yield to the equity, IF the savings could be realized.At its core, BlueLinx is a self-help story about realizing the benefits of an acquisition. Is $50M in savings realistic? It represents a 1.5% improvement in the gross margin and looks very achievable. In fact, it may be conservative. There have been several positive data points since the March acquisition. For example, at every turn management has reiterated this cost saving goal and their ability to achieve it. In fact, on the last quarterly call, in addition to reiterating their confidence, management stated that they were ahead of schedule in terms of realizations, and under budget. Other data points include the CEO of Cedar Creek deciding to join BlueLinx as COO, relocate his family to Atlanta, and tie his entire bonus to the realization of the cost savings. The company has consolidated more than 10 out of 70 facilities and management has made several open market purchases of stock. Collectively, these data points are all incrementally positive.So, what drove the stock from $42 on September 12th to $21 in early December? There are certainly macro concerns about housing, which fared very poorly during the ""great recession."" As a distributor of building products, revenues are clearly tied to construction activity. If one believes that housing starts are going to be depressed for the next five years, BlueLinx is not a stock to own.However, there is a strong argument to be made that there are demographic tailwinds to housing over time. Single-family housing starts in the United States bottomed out in the recession at just below 450,000 per year and have increased to approximately 850,000 in 2018, nine years later. It is estimated that just over 1M single-family homes per year are required to accommodate population growth and replacement from fires, floods, termites etc., so we have been under-producing new houses for the last decade. The surpluses from before the great recession have been absorbed. Can new housing starts pull back for six months or a year? Absolutely. But with the 10-year bond ending 2018 at a multi-month low and unemployment sub-4%, single-family home starts remaining around 850,000 does not feel wildly optimistic.In 2018, virtually all housing-related stocks sold off, it was just a question of how much. For a housing bear, BlueLinx is an interesting target. The company does not screen well for computers, there are no sell side analysts or consensus estimates, and the historical numbers don't capture any of the potential cost savings described above. As a result of the Cedar Creek acquisition, which has the potential to be wonderful in the long term, current debt has increased dramatically and large one-time expenses are being incurred to close redundant facilities and merge operations. Many of the machines may not factor in the qualitative attributes that attract me. Short interest increased dramatically in the fourth quarter as the BXC price declined. Score one for the machines.BXC short sellers likely focus on the headline debt figures. Following the Cedar Creek acquisition, BlueLinx balance sheet has almost $600M of debt between a $179M term loan and a $415M asset-backed loan (real estate and inventory). On a trailing 12-month basis, the company has generated $80M of adjusted EBITDA. In other words, the stated debt is more than 7X the trailing EBITDA. Neither machines nor humans like low margin, cyclical business with minimal debt coverage.Let's take a minute and look at the balance sheet more closely. There is more than $400M in inventory and $285M in receivables against the previously mentioned $594MM in debt plus $153M in accounts payable. The company is in the process of closing more than 10 distribution centers (out of 70). They have not guided to any reduction in inventory, but it certainly would not surprise me to see the inventory decline and thus reduce the level of the asset- backed loan. There is also an opportunity to shift dollars owed from the asset-backed loan to accounts payable, effectively letting vendors provide more financing. Will the money still be owed? Yes, but it will likely improve how the company screens. The company is also selling two newly-closed redundant facilities that are expected to fetch in excess of $25M. Further, just operating the business will reduce the leverage. The asset sales, inventory reduction, vendor financing, and cash generation from the business should reduce the asset-backed loan by well over $100M (and possibly significantly more) in 2019. While the headline debt appears high, given all of the offsetting and liquid assets - and with the receivables and inventory - the risks of distress are far more remote than the debt to EBITDA coverage ratio would imply.The third factor likely driving the decline in the BXC share price was exposure to the price of lumber, which is volatile and can be driven by macro fears about future housing demand as well as different trade policies. I am by no means an expert in the lumber market and I don't have a view on where it is headed. Over the course of the third quarter, the price of lumber effectively went straight down: a once-in-every-four-years type of move. The fear was this would lead to depressed earnings. Even though the company only carries about 30 days of inventory of commodity goods like plywood, they were losing money on sales since they had paid higher prices for the inventory but were forced to adjust their customer prices to market prices. Management spent a disproportionate amount of time discussing lumber prices on their conference call as investors were clearly focused on it. From my perspective, lumber will go up and down over a three- to five-year timeframe, but it will not be the driving factor in the success of the BlueLinx business or our investment. Machines and investors focused on quarterly earnings can obsess over commodity prices. The company just weathered a once-in-five-years negative move in lumber; this should not be our focus.Yes, BlueLinx's fortunes are in part tied to new house construction, but the non-cyclical ""self-help"" earnings improvements and the nature of the balance sheet provide downside protection. In a softer new home building market, the company would reduce inventory, thus reducing debt levels. In addition, the company can continue to do sale leasebacks of owned properties. If housing starts were to go down 20%, BlueLinx would likely remain profitable and continue to reduce debt. Bankruptcy is far more remote of an event than a simple historical debt/EBITDA calculation would indicate. This is not to say that the share price cannot decline (this was an $8 stock not too long ago), but I believe that on a risk adjusted basis, there is substantially more upside than downside embedded in the prices, even factoring in the cyclicality and debt.Carved into the Mount Rushmore of special-situation investing is Joel Greenblatt, author of ""You Can be a Stock Market Genius,"" former manager of Gotham Capital (which returned over 40% annually for almost two decades), and professor of the hardest class to get into at Columbia Business School. I believe BlueLinx has many of the attributes of a Greenblatt special situation: no sell side analysts, moving parts, insider buying, distorted financial statements, and asymmetry. Perhaps we should not be surprised that the godfather himself was rumored to have attended BlueLinx's annual meeting. I suspect that he approves of BXC. If housing is stable, there is a clear path to a triple. If housing improves or the savings come in better than expected… Thank you, Mr. Market and your machine friends.During Q4, Greenhaven invested in Radisson Hotels AB (STO:RADH), a Swedish-listed equity that provides ownership in the European operations of Radisson Hotels. In August, a deal was announced for Chinese conglomerate Jin Jiang to acquire a majority stake in RADH. Without muddling this letter with all of the game theory and intricacies of Swedish takeover law, when we bought our initial shares at 36 kroner, there was a virtually guaranteed forthcoming offer of 35 kroner to all shareholders and reasons to believe it could be substantially higher (3% downside/20%+ upside). When we bought our second and larger tranche of shares, the price was at just over 40 kroner, keeping pace with Jin Jiang's revised offer of 40 kroner/share with the possibility of a substantially higher bid (1/2% downside/20% upside). In early January, Jin Jang came back with a final bid of 42.50 kroner, which was not as high as I believed possible but generated a double-digit return for Greenhaven with very little risk and in just a few weeks. I would invest in this type of situations - less than 1% downside for significant upside - all day every day if I could. We have reinvested the capital into a new position to be discussed in the next letter.Any confidence that I had in predicting how a Chinese conglomerate would navigate Swedish M&A law was made possible by Brad Hathaway of Far View Capital, in which the Greenhaven Road Partners Fund is invested. Brad presented Radisson Hotels at a Partners Fund dinner early last year, long before Jin Jiang and Greenhaven Road became attracted to the opportunity.Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) - We can add Fiat Chrysler to the long list of companies whose short-term stock price movements bear little relationship to the current operations or future earnings of the company. FCAU stock declined 15% in the quarter despite announcing the long-anticipated sale of the parts division, which contributed roughly 10% of EBITDA for 30% of the value of the company… despite announcing strong U.S. unit volumes every month during the quarter (+15%, +16%, +17%)… despite unveiling the Gladiator, a new Jeep pickup truck (a white space product) that has gotten rave reviews and will likely generate strong margins and profits when it goes on sale in 2019).Going forward, FCAU will have a very strong balance sheet post-sale of the Magneti Marelli parts division. Net of cash, the stock is trading sub 2X EBIT after taking share last year with the new Ram pickup and continued growth in Jeep. I had hopes for a tender offer of shares after the Magneti Marelli sale. That has not yet materialized, but the sale is not expected to close until Q2 2019. Despite all of the negative headlines, the U.S. auto market actually grew in 2018. There has been a prolonged pause in the share price of FCAU, but there has been robust growth in earnings power and net cash on the balance sheet. Fundamentals will matter again. The Agnelli family controls this business. They have a generational timeline, not a quarterly one. Eventually, the gap will close between price and value, and when it does, we are not playing for a 5% move.Radisson Hospitality AB - Discussed above.Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX) - was a new position last quarter (link to our Q3 letter). The combination of very low churn (sub 5% per year), a large attractive customer base (69% of the Fortune 500), a pipeline of new very high margin products to sell into this base of customers, and an undemanding valuation provides an interesting set-up for acquisition or long-term compounding.SharpSpring (NASDAQ:SHSP) - This SAAS business sells marketing automation tools, acquiring customers at a fraction of their expected long term value (LTV/CAC > 6) with a flagship product that is growing well in excess of 40% per year and a long runway for growth.Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) - This is a healthy two-sided marketplace with improving economics driven by pricing changes that will better monetize the existing traffic. Management is investing in growth, improving the user experience for shoppers and the tools for sellers. We trimmed our position during Q4 because it is the highest multiple stock in our portfolio as well as the most susceptible to multiple compression. Etsy is also one of the best businesses that we own and is carving out a nice position as an alternative to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).The fund remains short ETFs targeted at short-term traders, a bond fund where the underlying interest rates received relative to the risk assumed do not pass my common-sense test, and two indices. One of the benefits of the volatility is that the persistent, across-the-board upward march of all stocks has ended and we now have a far better environment for short selling. While we will undoubtedly remain a very long biased fund, it would not surprise me if we added a few shorts over the coming quarters.I make it a practice to inform the partnership of significant new purchases in these letters. I want you to have a sense of what we own and why we own it, thus providing context to our historical and future returns. I tend not to highlight when we exit a company. However, in the case of Yelp (NYSE:YELP), I think it is instructive. Yelp was a top five position for multiple quarters and I spent a fair amount of time in the previous letters explaining how I thought a tweak to their business model - getting rid of one-year contracts for advertisers - would increase trial of their product and ultimately grow their base of advertisers. The thesis passed a common-sense test and, in fact, the company was experiencing growth on a year-over-year basis as well as on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Given the operating leverage in the Yelp business model, I was quite excited by the possibility of sustained growth.What happened? When Yelp reported their quarterly results, their paying advertiser accounts did not grow. They had 194,000 paying advertisers on June 30 and 194,000 on September 30. Not growing for one quarter is not a reason in itself to sell an investment we entered with a three- to five-year time horizon. However, in the context of a company that just made trying the product easier, it was disconcerting to see no growth at all in the number of advertisers. Management cited some operational issues that may in fact reverse themselves, and exiting maybe an over-reaction, but I just could not get over the fact that the advertiser count stayed flat despite the term changes and the activity of Yelp's sales force, which totals over 3,000 people. So even with easier selling terms, three thousand salespeople could not grow the number of advertisers. It took that many people to just replace the advertisers that were leaving. Again, the issues at Yelp maybe temporary, and the Yelp valuation is not demanding, but 3,000+ salespeople running around, meeting business owners, and making phone calls to sell a more consumable package ending that quarter with a net result of no growth in advertisers does not give me cheery thoughts. Ultimately, the thesis that changing the contract terms will have great long-term benefits for the company may be true, but in the intermediate term, there are real product and execution risks.We expect to have K1s ready by the first week of March. If you have any questions in the interim, please reach out to Ally (investorrelations@greenhavenroad.com). For our tax-paying LPs, the K1 should not be a major event as realized gains were largely offset with realized losses.The headlines around us are dire. Our government is not functioning, literally not functioning, as we continue to experience the longest government shutdown in our nation's history. Just about every financial headline is negative. We have the seemingly contradictory narrative of ""interest rates are rising; this is going to kill the economy"" as well as ""interest rates are falling because the economy is weakening."" Of course, implied by both of those headlines is that the economy is currently strong, but that is rarely explicitly stated.The fourth quarter saw the return of the +2% or -2% day in the market with the S&P 500's average daily move exceeding 1% per day. In reality, the fortunes of the companies we are investing in are not rising and falling by 1% per day. The future cash flows of Box are not declining by 1%, 2% or more because of a single tweet emanating from the White House. My job is to make sure we do not conflate negative short-term results with a broken process.In my opinion, there are macro headwinds and multiples may compress, but there are also great companies like KKR that that will adapt and prosper. We only need to find a couple a year and hold on through the noise. Just as I ended the last letter - as volatility arises, I will attempt to take advantage of the opportunities it creates. We will continue to invest with a long time horizon, and we will continue to invest like it is our own money - because it is. Thank you for the opportunity to grow your family capital alongside mine.Sincerely,Scott MillerEditor’s Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4275166,104608,2019-07-16T09:19:09-04:00,"Box reported revenue and EPS above expectations, but narrow billings growth and reduced guidance sent the stock down.While management reduced full year guidance again, investors could see this as being the low point of the company's troubles, with upside yet to come.Valuation remains compressed at 3x forward revenue but appears to be a good buying opportunity given lowered expectations across the board.","Despite reporting revenue that was higher than expectations, Box (BOX) continues to struggle with billings growth and management eliminated their $1 billion in revenue goal by FY22. Even after lowering guidance after last quarter's earnings report in what was seen as resetting expectations, management again lowered their guidance.Although only down ~5% for the year, Box is down nearly 30% from recent highs seen in late February, before they reported Q4 earnings and guidance. With the stock trading at under $18, Box has one of the lowest valuations in the software market. The surprising reduced full year guidance in addition to Q2 guidance coming in lower than expected left investors with many questions over the long term viability of the company.For Q1, revenue grew 16% with EPS loss of $0.03, both ahead of expectations. The weak part of the quarter was billings only growing 1% and management reducing full year guidance. While the company did provide some longer-term thoughts, Box has an opportunity to re-shape investors mindset on the name and actually see the stock work out over the next few quarters.Data by YChartsWith the shares trading near the 52-week low point, I believe now is a good time to remain optimistic despite the several near-term problems that are seen at the surface level. Valuation has reached a recent low point and when looking at peers, valuations looks to be reasonable and does not currently price in a strong performance. Now is a great time to sharpen your pencils around this name and look to hold on to the stock for the next few quarters while the company slowly rebuilds and regains momentum.During Q1, revenue grew 16% to $163 million and was ahead of consensus expectations for $161.5 million. While revenue growth did decelerate compared to last quarter's 20% growth, the positive thing was it did come in ahead of expectations. One thing Box does have going for them is the high concentration of software-based revenue, with ~97% of revenue recurring. This is very helpful for an investor's mindset as this revenue stream often comes at higher margins and increased visibility.Source: Company PresentationBillings growth remains one of the most important metrics for Box as they sign multi-year contracts that defers the revenue over several quarters. During Q1, billings saw growth of only 1% with deferred revenue up only 15%. This makes it very challenging for Box to see future revenue growth if their billings growth is essentially flat. Combined with the reduced guidance, this was one of the biggest reasons the stock traded down so much after earnings.Management did provide some commentary on their billings expectations such as noting Q1 had a lot of multi-year prepays and a reduction from a single large customer. For Q2, the expect billings to return to mid-single-digits growth and for the second half of the year, billings should track closer to revenue growth (Source: Company Presentation).Source: Company PresentationWhile gross margins did tick down slightly compared to last year, they remain healthy at over 72%. The software nature of the business naturally leads to higher gross margins than a majority of companies. What remains shocking to me is the 43% S&M expense margin, which seems very high considering the company struggles to grow 10% a year. Typically we see high-growth companies spend 40%+ of revenue on S&M in order to maintain their revenue growth status, often well above 20%. This is not the case for Box and could start to be weighing on investor's opinions of the long-term viability. Over the long-term, management guided to 6-7% operating margin, compared to -2.5% in FY19.This led to Box reporting an EPS loss of $0.03, which came in ahead of consensus expectations for a loss of $0.05. I believe over the next few quarters, Box will be able to slightly improve their revenue growth and margin performance, leading to a breakeven or even positive EPS quarter.Source: Company PresentationManagement provided Q2 guidance that came in below consensus expectations, with revenue expected to be $169-170 million in addition to an EPS loss of $0.01-0.02 for the quarter.Even more disappointing, management lowered full year guidance the quarter after the ""reset"" guidance to lower expectations for the year. Management now expects revenue of $688-692 million, representing growth of ~13-14% and was well below consensus expectations for ~$700 million. In addition, billings growth is expected to remain compressed, with FY20 guidance implying only ~9% growth for the year.In addition, management backed away from their previous long-term target of $1 billion in revenue exiting FY22 as the company looks to shift to a more balanced growth and profitable operation. While I believe this is the right strategic decision for the company, it leaves investors unsure of what future growth will be and how quickly Box will be able to report consistent profitability.With the stock currently trading ~3x forward revenue, there is plenty of room for their multiple to expand. While revenue growth is likely to remain compressed over the next few quarters, we could start to see the company become more profitable.I believe the stock remains in a good trading range to pick up some shares as investors have seemed to keep this name in the penalty box. This remains a ""show-me"" story where investors will wait for Box to report improved revenue and billings growth in addition to margin expansion. I also believe if Box is able to achieve the ""Rule of 40"" over the next year or so, investors could push the stock much higher as the balance of growth and profitability returns to a more normalized level.Data by YChartsBox remains a leader in the cloud collaboration space and has over 70% of the Fortune 500 companies as their customers. While there remains a long path ahead for the stock to return to a great investment, investors have kept the name in the penalty box over the past few quarters and it will likely stay there until they report an impressive, over the top quarter.Right now, with shares trading under $18 and near 3x forward revenue, it appears to be a good time to build up a position as there appears to be more upside than downside. With the newly lowered guidance and reduced long-term expectations, the stock appears to be pricing in moderate success over time. For a company growing revenue around 30% only a few quarters ago, it is not impossible to see them returning to high-growth and re-attaining their premium multiple."
4246688,103480,2019-03-06T10:16:48-05:00,"Shares of Box fell nearly 20% after reporting Q4 results, marking one of Box's worst quarters in history.The company missed revenue expectations in Q4 and offered a downbeat outlook for FY20, citing weakness in EMEA.Billings growth also slowed down to the mid-teens.While Box's slowing sales growth is certainly a disappointment, look to the company's improved profitability and FCF as stabilizing factors.Box is a buy under $20.","Box (BOX) is simply a stock that many investors love to hate. Throughout its relatively short lifetime as a public company, Box has been attacked for just about every factor imaginable: high losses, commoditized product, and now, slowing sales growth. The stock's advancement over the past few years has been rocky as a result - now, after reporting Q4 results, shares of Box have plummeted about 20%:Data by YChartsTo be fair, Box is down due to a number of legitimate, worrying conditions. Competition is a big one, with Dropbox (DBX) still achieving much faster growth rates than Box despite being at a far larger scale, and companies like Microsoft (MSFT) bundling its OneDrive product alongside other Office and Dynamics tools. In addition, Box missed revenue estimates in the fourth quarter (a rarity for public SaaS companies), while blaming both weakness in EMEA as well as an elongation of sales cycles for its lower-than-expected revenue outlook for FY20:Figure 1. Box FY20 guidanceSource: Box earnings releaseBox's revenue outlook of $700-$704 million (+15% to +16% y/y) represents a sharp deceleration from FY19's 20% y/y growth, and a huge step down for a company that has barely seen revenue growth slip into the teens. Analysts, conversely, were expecting much higher revenue growth at $732.8 million, or +20% y/y. Yes, investors were right to sell off Box post-earnings: but was the selloff overdone? At current share prices, Box has a market cap of just $2.80 billion, and after netting out $217.5 million of cash and $40 million of debt, the company's enterprise value sits at just $2.62 billion. Against the midpoint of Box's FY20 revenue guidance, Box trades at a valuation multiple of just 3.7x EV/FY20 expected revenues.We can see, from the chart below, that Box has rarely traded at a sub-4x multiple (outside of the market crash last Fall that weighed heavily against all technology stocks). Over the past year, a revenue multiple between 4-5x has been more the norm. Data by YChartsI believe Box's valuation has hit a relative floor, and continue to believe that it's an attractive M&A target at its present cheap price. Companies like Microsoft and Salesforce (CRM), which have technical integrations with Box software but little of their own presence in storage and file management, are strong contenders. We've seen over the past year that low-valued SaaS stocks like Apptio (APTI) are frequently snapped up by acquirers or PE firms, especially if they have attractive margins and limited losses. Box achieved positive FCF in both Q4 and FY19, which increases its appeal to buyers.Beyond the possibility of M&A, there are plenty of organic opportunities for Box as well. Each quarter, Box continues to make advancements to its product. Over Q4, Box announced compatible integration with Google Drive (GOOG), allowing users to access and manage Google Sheets and Google Docs from within the Box interface. These types of integrations, similar to Box's OneDrive integration, open the door for selling into customers that already have Google as a large portion of their file storage architecture. In addition, Box also opened up its Box Skills platform to third-party developers, allowing for greater development of AI capabilities within Box. Recall that Box was praised highly at the Sohn Investment Conference last year for its advances in AI. The bottom line on Box: while it's true that the company's deceleration trends are disappointing, we look to Box's low valuation and sustained product advantages to support the bullish case for this stock. Box is now a value play, and it's a stock that has shown a tendency to bounce back from prior losses relatively quickly. Box is a buy anywhere under $20 - my one-year price target on the stock is $24, representing 4.5x EV/FY20 revenues and approximately 23% upside from current levels.Let's take a look at Box's results in the fourth quarter and some of management's commentary around the numbers:Figure 2. Box 4Q19 resultsSource: Box earnings releaseRevenues grew 20% y/y to $163.7 million, decelerating one point from last quarter’s 21% y/y revenue growth rate. Wall Street, on the other hand, had expected $164.2 million in revenues, or about 30bps higher in growth rates.Billings, too, came in rather poorly. Box posted total calculated billings of $237.7 million, up only 16% y/y. For several quarters now, Box’s billings growth has come in several points below revenue growth. For most SaaS companies, this is one of the clearest indications of impending deceleration.A couple more sour notes to digest. Box has typically touted growth in the number of large deals each quarter, but in Q4, the company only managed to close two deals in excess of $1 million, versus a whopping nine in the year-ago quarter. This metric, of course, is subject to wild fluctuation, but it’s still an indication of Box’s overall slowdown, especially with large clients.On the bright side, however, Box saw growth in the number of >$100,000 deals, while the number of >$500,000 deals remained flat. It’s worth noting as well that Box’s churn rate this quarter clocked in at 4.3%, 20bps lower than 4.5% in the year-ago quarter - which is a small comfort in the wake of otherwise softer deal metrics. Aaron Levie, Box’s CEO, offered the following qualitative commentary on this quarter’s sales challenges on the Q4 earnings call:In my view, the weakness in EMEA may be a short-lived one. With the UK still experiencing a messy Brexit, many companies in the region are still hesitating on large capex and purchasing decisions. Once the smoke clears, we may see some deals re-enter Box’s pipeline, potentially lifting growth rates later in FY20.While Box’s results on the top line weren’t completely inspiring, bottom-line results fared much better. Pro forma operating margin rose to 5% in Q4, a full ten points higher than -5% in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenues, Box’s cost of sales and marketing dropped to “only” 45.0% of revenues, far less than 56.9% in the year-ago quarter. So while it’s disappointing that Box’s revenue came in below plan, at least the company’s reduction in sales costs is a defensible justification for the slowdown.Figure 3. Box operating margin trendsSource: Box earnings releaseNote also that Box hit pro forma profitability for the first time this quarter. Pro forma net income hit $8.5 million this quarter, or $0.06 per share - a huge $0.04 beat over expectations of $0.02 in the quarter.While there’s certainly plenty of risk to Box’s fiscal 2020 results due to a weakening revenue growth trend and lagging billings results, I believe the stock’s massive pullback to sub-$20 has effectively made it a value stock worth betting on. To counteract the sales weakness seen this quarter and in the coming year forecast, we have two counterbalancing factors: first, EMEA may only be temporarily knocked off course due to geopolitical uncertainties, and second, Box has purposely pulled back on sales and marketing spend in order to improve profitability.Overall, Box looks like a bargain at <4x revenues. Stay long here."

The company offers cloud services and allows its customers' employees to work safely and efficiently from anywhere. The company works with many applications currently used by large corporations and has attracted more than 90k customers by offering solutions its competitors do not. With more and more enterprises spending money on the information and technology space, Box should continue to grow rapidly.Box's shares have pulled back from highs and recently rebounded off of lows.Data by YChartsThe whole market reached a new low during the rapid selloff that peaked on Christmas Eve, and much like the rest of the market, Box has since recovered. However, the business fundamentals seem to be improving to the point that it should continue higher than its recent trading levels.The high was reached when news came out that Chamath Palihapitiya pitched Box as his best investment idea. For those who aren't familiar with Chamath, he has quite the successful history of investing in the tech space. At 28, in 2004, Palihapitiya was the youngest vice president of AOL, heading its instant messaging division. In 2007, he joined Facebook (FB), which was then a little more than a year old. Palihapitiya worked at Facebook to increase its user base. Palihapitiya made investments on the side while still employed at Facebook, including in Palantir, Pure Storage (PSTG), Playdom which was acquired by Disney (DIS), and Bumptop bought by Google (GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). He currently runs his own fund called Social Capital, which continues to make investments in the tech space. Based on his successful track record and inside knowledge of the industry, it is safe to say he really has an edge. So once he pitched the idea of Box, its shares instantly popped higher.Currently, shares offer an interesting value. While growth seems to be decelerating, it is based on the law of large numbers. The company has grown revenue from $303 million in 2016 to a potential run rate for $610 million. This is 100% growth in two years.Source: 10-QThe company has a strong balance sheet with $200.1 million in cash and $40 million in debt, leaving it with a positive cash position of $160.1 million.The company can continue to make tuck-in acquisitions that will help it acquire new customer relationships as well as new technology offerings. In fact, the company has been acquiring small start ups such as Progressly and Butter.ai. Progressly had a team of 12 and the company offered a workflow product that will be integrated with Relay, a similar product from Box. Butter.ai connects marketing campaigns with work related apps for live up to date information and feedback. This lets the user know if something they are marketing actually has an effect with a specific customer, or if it is achieving the goals they had hoped for.What is nice about the acquisitions is that they are small in nature, with both aforementioned companies raising less than $10 million in seed funding. They have a small staff and are easily integrated. The company is purchasing new technology that enables its business model to be better than competition and does it with a low cost method. This shows smart use of capital by management.Furthermore, the company is making strides in its financials.Source: Analyst DayThe company is still not generally profitable, but investors should be okay waiting as it should get there soon. As we noted earlier, free cash flow is more important at this time. The company should be able to continue to fund its operations without taking on more debt. Shares offer a compelling value to investors looking for a company that offers technology infrastructure to enterprise clients.As Box continues to launch new products and cross sell to its customers, revenue should grow.Source: Investor PresentationThe more solutions the company offers, the more intriguing it becomes to potential customers. Selling a company on integrating and investing in a whole new platform is not an easy pitch. The company has to make a large investment in training and implementing the product for employees. The return on investment must be worthwhile, and it's of greater benefit to offer more solutions to the customer. As we can see below, this has been working well.Source: Sohn PresentationThe company continues to reach more and more customers in the Fortune 500, solidifying its position in the market.The company has seen acceleration in larger deals so far in FY19 which is a positive as growth isn't slowing down.Source: Analyst DayLarger deals means large adoption of platforms and greater synergy. It also increases the likelihood the customer will stay with Box longer.Not only does the company earn new business, it generates even better customer retention. Source: Analyst DayWhile Box already has low customer churn, the more it offers to its customers, the more protection the company has. This also protects it from competitors having any advantage over its offerings.What is more interesting is that the company could easily be acquired. With a market cap of only $3.4 billion, a large player like Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM), or Salesforce (CRM) might be interested in adding this company to their portfolio. Since many of the customers are overlapping, they would be able to further seal their current customer relationships. If the company continues to generate positive cash flow, it could become of more interest to an acquirer.I recently added Box to my portfolio on the pullback. The company deserves a spot in a growth investor's portfolio, as the company has yet to fully reach its potential. Whether as a potential acquisition target or a growth story, the share price should see continued price appreciation. Once the company shows consistent and positive earnings, we could see a rapid rise in the share price. As the company continues to compound earnings, we could see a great return on investment. In the meantime, the company should continue to add value to its brand with small tech acquisitions. This will continue to add great talent with product innovation all at a low price. Should the fundamental story change at all, then investors must revisit the thesis. In the meantime, any purchase below $25 a share should offer positive long-term returns for those willing to wait."
4319292,35181,2020-01-27T13:17:10-05:00,"Revenue growth has been in decline for several years and the company fails on the Rule of 40.The gross margin is falling and SG&A expense is too high. In all probability, these parameters will not improve this year.I can't find a good reason to be bullish at this time.","Six months ago I wrote my first article on Box, Inc. (BOX) entitled ""Box: Stay On The Sidelines This Year"". As you may be able to guess, I gave Box a neutral rating and the stock price gain since publication is -3.5%, much less than the performance of the S&P 500 which was 9%.Now I am back to revisit this company and I have to say, the problems I identified in my last article are still present, including the decline in revenue growth, failure to meet the Rule of 40, falling gross margin and SG&A expense is too high.(Source: Portfolio123)I have to apologize for the lack of originality on my part as I have given this article the same title distinguished by ""Part 2"". This pretty much captures my sentiments for this stock. The company performance is lackluster and there are many better opportunities out there so I wouldn't get too fixated on this stock. My rating for Box remains neutral.Just for the record, the declining gross margin and high SG&A expense can be partially explained by the ongoing data center optimizations.I will look forward to seeing some improvement in margins after the completion of this optimization project perhaps at the beginning of next year.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.Box's annual sales growth rate is 16%, down from the five-year growth rate of 37%.(Source: Portfolio123)Box's free cash flow margin TTM is 8%. The free cash flow has been positive since mid-2017.(Source: Portfolio123)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40 - some analysts use EBITDA and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the software company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In Box's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 16% + 8% = 24%The calculation comes out much lower than 40%, indicating that Box has a lot of work to do in order to achieve a healthy balance between growth and profits.When a company like Box fails the Rule of 40, I like to examine the company's SG&A expense margin. In the case of Box, I am concerned by the high margin (see below). Note that the SG&A expense margin includes R&D in the graph below.(Source: Portfolio123)The SG&A expenses are 90% of the total revenue. This is quite a high margin for a company that is growing revenue by only 16% annually.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated Y-o-Y sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated Y-o-Y sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Box is sitting well below the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is very undervalued relative to its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate.The Sales/EV multiple tells me that the stock is quite undervalued, but my value assessment changes when I substitute next year's earnings estimates for forward sales.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The results shown on this second scatter plot suggest that Box is actually overvalued based on next year's earnings estimates.Box is a leader in the highly competitive cloud content management market segment. Annual revenue growth has been in decline since 2015 and is now 16%. Box fails on the Rule of 40, and this is made worse by very high cash burn as measured by the SG&A expenses. The gross margin is falling and will likely remain low for the remainder of the year due to data center duplication.The stock price is very undervalued based on the forward sales multiple, but slightly overvalued based on next year's earnings estimates. Also, the stock price isn't showing any signs of life. For these reasons, I have to give Box a neutral rating."
4230651,104952,2018-12-29T13:24:33-05:00,"Box and Dropbox represent two ends of the spectrum in the file and content management cloud software market. Both have very different business models and visions.Owning both stocks provide investors with various kinds of upsides in the cloud software market. In addition, DBX gives investors exposure to emerging markets through its geographically-diverse customer base.Both stocks are good long opportunities. BOX's $399 million revenue is expected to grow 2.5x by 2020. DBX has $1.1 billion revenue and is relatively undervalued with EV/sales of 7.5.","We believe that many investors misjudge the nature of Box’s (BOX) and Dropbox’s (DBX) businesses. In particular, many believe that these two are substitutes. Apart from the big differences in the fundamentals, we also think they are closer to being complementarities than substitutes. This is why owning both stocks provide investors with access to a diverse set of growth opportunities.We have been users of both BOX and DBX since 2010. We used them both in the 500-plus people US-based technology organizations we have worked for. We’ve never thought of BOX as a file-sharing platform as much as DBX a content management platform. We feel that each company has taken a unique direction since its early days, and as of today, we’ve noticed that each has been consistent and successful in executing toward their respective direction.Fundamentally, we think both are valuable growth stocks. BOX is an enterprise content and management company that could potentially serve through its core product as an internal wiki or knowledge base for any large organization in the world.(Source: Box 2018 Q3 Earnings Call Slides)DBX, on the other hand, is more of a natural file-sharing company. Led by its founder Drew Houston, who created its first ever prototype when he was a student at MIT, DBX builds a very sophisticated file-syncing and sharing system for individuals and small teams with a core focus in collaboration. Another unique thing about DBX is it plays well with third-party business applications through seamless integrations leveraging its very open API ecosystem.(Source: Dropbox 2018 Q3 earnings call slides)This is where things get interesting. BOX doesn’t make significant money from small teams or individuals. They are pretty much the “Salesforce of File-Sharing.” DBX, on the other hand, is a very consumer-focused cloud software company. By looking at BOX’s quarterly report, we can obviously see how BOX is a very enterprise-focused company:Likewise, DBX’s quarterly report indicates that it is at the other end of the spectrum:DBX’s revenue as of 2014 was only $600 million. As of 2017, it has grown by 80% to $1.1 billion. This is the power of the self-serving user acquisition model. Instead of having to pay sales commissions and recruit high-paying salespeople, DBX concentrates its user acquisition activities around online marketing to convert retail individuals and small teams through its website. Due to its simple consumer-focused application, DBX also doesn’t need to spend on training and other onboarding costs.(Source: Author. Comparison of DBX’s and BOX’s Revenue and SG&A expenses)BOX converts the majority of its users offline through enterprise sales processes. This is the strategy that most enterprise cloud software companies such as Salesforce (CRM) or Microsoft (MSFT) use. BOX’s revenue also has grown very well since 2015. With $399 million of revenue as of 2017, it has achieved almost 85% growth compared to the base year 2015.We think that there are pros and cons of each business model. Enterprise-focused BOX will have to invest a lot in developing a robust enterprise sales process early on. However, as it reaches a certain critical mass, the switching cost will increase significantly for each of its clients. As of 2018, BOX is very close to achieving this stage.(Source: Author. BOX income statement 2016 - 2018)We’ve observed that BOX has recently turned cash flow positive in 2018 as both its gross profit and operating cash flows have improved significantly since 2016.(Source: Author. Business fundamental comparison between BOX and DBX)DBX enjoys a very strong revenue growth through cost-efficient and scalable online self-serve channels. Yet, as individual customers are more price sensitive, user churns through future product upselling will relatively be more challenging to combat. Another plus in the DBX model includes its exposure to global customers, which both gives it exposure to emerging markets and reduces the entry barrier if it decides to roll out a similar enterprise model to BOX in any overseas market in the future.Looking at DBX and BOX comparable small-cap cloud software companies, we think that DBX is very undervalued based on its P/FCF of 22.48 despite its 35% YoY growth in the last three years. We think that this is due to its relatively high market cap. Based on DBX’s core customer segments, which are primarily individuals and small businesses, we think that Xero (OTCPK:XROLF) serves as a good comparable company. Xero is a tax and accounting software company, much like Intuit’s TurboTax (INTU), aimed for small businesses. Xero is valued at a much higher premium with 79 P/FCF ratio.(Source: Author. Market valuations for small cap cloud comparables of BOX and DBX)That being said, as expected, investors have more conviction that DBX’s sales will continue growing faster than BOX, given its higher EV/sales of 7.54 compared to BOX’s 4.23. This indicates our thesis earlier that BOX has to invest early in developing its sales process as a smaller cap enterprise cloud software company before reaching the phase where it can scalably convert new key clients and achieve higher premium on its valuation. As BOX has recently turned cash flow positive in 2018, we think that BOX will achieve such process by FY 2019. This is further supported by analysts’ estimations of $608 million and $733 million for BOX’s revenue by the end of FY 2019 and 2020, respectively.Our thesis strongly points out both BOX’s and DBX’s potentials to be two strong additions to any growth-oriented portfolio. Two companies represent the different end of a spectrum in the file and content-sharing cloud software market. BOX provides investors with major exposure to the domestic enterprise content management market with future stable revenue driven by acquisition of big clients such as Symantec, Coca Cola, and Walmart. DBX provides investors with exposure to file sharing, collaboration, and productivity market for small businesses and individuals worldwide. Partially, this also creates exposure to emerging markets. In terms of valuation, we think that both companies are very strong fundamentally, while the market valuations indicate that both are interesting long opportunities today."
4230414,26891,2018-12-27T13:56:13-05:00,Box has not been immune to the market's decline.Annual sales growth remains impressive and cash flows are growing.The company is cheaper than many of its cloud-based peers.,"Box (NASDAQ:BOX) stock was on fire earlier this year, rallying more than 55% from $18 in early March to more than $28 less than two months later in mid-May. Those gains have since evaporated, dropping Box back down into the high teens, currently nearly $16.Now sporting a market cap of just $2.35 billion, why is there no love for Box?The fourth-quarter selloff is a major contributing factor. After hitting $30 in June, Box has been slowly trickling lower. That’s not too surprising given its monstrous two-month run that we pointed out at the top of the article. However, shares are down about 35% so far this quarter and to me that presents an opportunity.Why is Box a good opportunity? In short, as companies continue to increase their reliance on cloud computing, Box continues to provide solutions for them. After the company beat on earnings and revenue expectations for the third quarter, Box CEO Aaron Levie made several important comments on the company's November 28th conference call:Based on commentary from other companies, like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), enterprise cloud spending isn’t seeing a hiccup. In fact, it seems to be gaining momentum.Last quarter the company turned in revenue of $155.9 million, up more than 20% year-over-year (YoY). Box still lost 6 cents per share during the quarter, but that came in a penny ahead of expectations.With three quarters of fiscal 2019 in the books, analysts expect 20.3% revenue growth for the year. In fiscal 2020, expectations call for 20.4% growth. If Box can maintain a ~20% annual sales growth rate and begin to turn a profit, investors will surely push this name higher. Some of the numbers from last quarter suggest that it’s possible, given that add-on services and larger deals are working their way through the pipe.Box now has 90,000 paying customers around the globe. In the last quarter, Box closed 57 deals worth $100,000 or more vs. 40 in the same period a year ago. That’s good for a 42.5% increase. Further, it closed 11 deals worth $500,000 or more vs. just five in Q3 2017, and it closed three deals worth $1,000,000 or more last quarter vs. just one for Q3 2017.In other words, Box continues to land larger contracts, helping to drive top-line growth. What about the bottom line, though?The company’s 6-cent-per-share loss was a solid improvement from the loss of 13 cents per share in the same quarter a year ago. For the year, analysts expect a loss of 16 cents per share and in fiscal 2020, call for earnings of 2 cents per share.Source: Author, from company dataLet’s throw a party, right?Maybe those numbers aren’t too exciting, especially when looking at the immense profitability of other well-known mega-cap firms. But Box’s move to profitability comes after the company already made its way into generating positive free cash flow as well as sustaining 20%+ annual sales growth. While decelerating, the company’s growth rate is still impressive, particularly as margins and cash flows are now drifting higher.That’s the kind of momentum we like to see. If Levie & Co. can keep this work up, Box should see its stock price elevate over time, provided that the market doesn’t completely fall off a cliff.Because Box is set on growth mode and not profit mode -- like most cloud stocks -- we will not value it on a P/E basis. Instead, consider that the stock trades at 3.7 times current revenue. That’s less than half the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio that Salesforce trades at and cheaper than Splunk’s 8 times current revenue. It’s also vastly cheaper than Workday (NYSE:WDAY), ServiceNow (NASDAQ:NOW) and Twilio (NYSE:TWLO). Based on free-cash flow (P/FCF), Box is the second-cheapest name, just behind Salesforce.While that doesn’t make Box cheap compared to a name like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), it does make it cheap compared to many of its cloud-enterprise peers. That wouldn’t make Box attractive on its own, but in combination with its major metrics moving in the right direction -- net income, revenue and free cash flow -- the stock looks like a reasonable risk/reward for a speculative position.The company’s integration with Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) G Suite could pay dividends going forward too. Not only are many users familiar with Google’s G Suite, but it can create a large number of add-on revenue opportunities for Box.Lastly, with its sub-$2.5 billion market cap -- albeit after a severe beating in the market -- Box should be looked at with some M&A potential. Realistically, this is more like a sub-$3 billion enterprise if and when we get a market-wide rebound, but if a larger buyer is interested, Box is certainly attainable. While management has expressed a disinterest in M&A in the past, does not mean it cannot come to fruition in the future. I do not want to buy Box -- or any other stock -- with M&A as a leading catalyst for my ownership. But it’s a nice cherry to put on top.With $200 million in the bank, no short-term debt and just $40 million in long-term debt, Box is a relatively lean company that has solid growth and a reasonable valuation within its industry. At today’s prices, that makes it a buy for me."
4218559,67473,2018-11-06T05:44:25-05:00,"Greenhaven Road Capital is a long-biased, concentrated hedge fund.  We invest only in our very best ideas – typically 15 long positions or less and a handful of opportunistic short positions.Generally avoiding commodity-based companies, we look for businesses with strong cash flow, normalized earnings, and long term growth horizons.Includes detailed analysis of Greenhaven Road Capital's positions in ETSY, FCAU, SHSP, TRIP, YELP, EVI, BOX.In the third quarter, the partnership had positive net returns of approximately 3%, which brings year to date returns in excess of 12% net of all fees and expenses.","Original PostGreenhaven Road Capital commentary for the third quarter ended September 31, 2018 discussing the good and the bad business problems.Dear Fellow Investors,In the third quarter, the partnership had positive net returns of approximately 3%, which brings year to date returns in excess of 12% net of all fees and expenses. Individual returns will vary by investor class, so please check your statements. This marks our tenth straight quarter of positive returns. Let me assure you, this is not by design.In fact, if this past quarter had ended a few days later, our modest gains would have turned into losses. I am looking for out of favor and misunderstood companies with a multi-year time horizon. As a concentrated, long biased partnership, we will have down months, quarters, and years. The returns should not be linear, but with a little good fortune, over time we can continue to compound our capital at attractive rates.There are good businesses and bad businesses. Similarly, there are good business problems and bad business problems. Bad business problems include disadvantaged cost structures and overcapitalized competitors who can sustain years of losses in the pursuit of market share. Good business problems include the inability to satisfy demand. In an ideal world, we would short bad businesses with bad business problems, which will eventually be priced in by the market, and own good businesses with good business problems.One of the ""good problems"" is undermonetization, which can take many forms but is essentially some variant of undercharging or not taking full advantage of an existing customer base. For example, ad-supported companies can undermonetize by showing users fewer ads than customers/viewers would tolerate. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) does not monetize WhatsApp despite its hundreds of millions of monthly users and almost $20B price tag.The beauty of undermonetization is that there is typically a relatively simple ""fix"" that only requires tweaks to existing product offerings and/or pricing. Such changes typically are not capital intensive and have less execution risk than would come with launching new products or entering new markets. When pairing the ""good problem"" of undermonetization with a good business that has operating leverage, the results can be quite compelling as the incremental revenue easily converts to incremental profit.Initially, focusing on undermonetizing companies was not intentional. However, as I have reflected on our portfolio, the theme is certainly recurring. If TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) can monetize 2% rather than 1% of their website traffic, our investment should work out quite well. If Yelp (NYSE:YELP) can better monetize the efforts of their existing sales force by offering more flexible contract terms that encourage trial and generate more advertisers with higher lifetime values, our investment should work out quite well (see below for further commentary).If Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) sellers do not revolt and accept the new 5% commission rate instead of the former 3%, our investment should work out quite well. Again, these are tweaks to existing structures. Etsy will continue with the same shopper traffic, the same pool of sellers, and the same exact cost structure - just a few lines of code should increase earnings and revenue dramatically.When undermonetization is addressed in a business with operating leverage, we should see accelerated revenue growth and expanding margins. Given that improving growth and improving margins are catnip for many investors, the third driver of returns, multiple expansion, can work for us as well. Now, not all undermonetization is good or easily fixable, but as internet companies mature, I expect undermonetizing companies will continue to be a fertile hunting ground for new investments. While not the traditional altar for a value investor to pray to, the manner in which improving monetization can flow through the income statement is compelling.Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) - I have said in the past that I look for investments where the valuation makes sense. In my opinion, Fiat Chrysler has reached that point again. The company has transformed itself from a company suffering under the burden of enormous debts that could only think about debt repayment to a very well capitalized company. Fiat Chrysler is currently generating over $100M per week in cash.At the end of this year, their net industrial cash should exceed $2.50 per share. On top of this, after the end of the quarter, the company finally announced the impending sale of their parts business, Magneti Marelli, which will add another $4+ of net cash when it closes early next year. So adjusting for the sale of the parts business, FCAU has approximately 40% of its market capitalization in cash.Today, FCAU trades (ex cash) for less than 3X forward earnings. If we assume that they can achieve their five-year plan, shares ex-cash are trading for less than 1X 2022 earnings. Typically, these valuations only show up for sick and dying businesses.In contrast, Fiat Chrysler's U.S. sales were up 15% Y/Y in September and are up 6% year-to-date. The company also has several product introductions in the pipeline to introduce new models in categories where their brands have not been represented. Of particular interest are the new three-row, seven-passenger Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Jeep Scrambler pickup truck that will be introduced next year.Yes, Fiat Chrysler is a cyclical and capital intensive business, but it has been structured to allow for variability in revenue. At the company's recent Capital Markets Day, management provided guidance that the company could remain profitable even if U.S. auto sales dropped as low as 10M cars. U.S. new car sales dipped to 9M in the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, so it is reasonable to expect the company to remain profitable in nearly all but the most draconian scenarios. The question is - how profitable? Fiat's Chairman is not a novice capital allocator. He makes the pilgrimage to Omaha. He finally has real levers to pull at FCAU.How might this play out? There are all indications that the company would like to restore their dividend. It would be interesting to see how FCAU was valued based on a dividend yield. They could easily cover a €1/$1.14 per year dividend - apply a 5% yield to that and you have a $22+ stock. It would not surprise me at all if Elkan initiates a combination of a tender offer and/or buyback to take advantage of the stock's price as I believe he is inclined in the very short term to try and walk the valuation up to be in a stronger position to effect a merger with another OEM to realize the enormous potential synergies.These options have never been available to him, now they are and I think they will be utilized in 2018, hopefully to dramatic effect. As a result, I have layered a small short-dated out-of-the-money option position and an in-the-money option position to allow the fund to profit disproportionately should this scenario occur. I do not purchase options as a regular practice and 90% of options expire worthless, so this cherry on top may disappear, but the opportunity well outweighs the cost. Given the company's current valuation, known catalysts, and orientation of the Chairman, I continue to like the set-up.Etsy - As previously discussed, Etsy has announced a significant price increase to a commission rate of 5%; when combined with the payment processing fee of 3%, the net result is a take rate of approximately 8%. Fortunately, this pales in comparison to the current Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Made rate of 15%. The value proposition to sellers of being able to reach 20M + buyers for a listing fee of 20 cents and only paying the 8% upon a sale of an item remains very compelling.SharpSpring (NASDAQ:SHSP) - SharpSpring has become a Top 5 holding through a combination of price appreciation and the purchase of additional shares over several months. SharpSpring is a SaaS (Software as a Service) business that provides marketing automation software primarily for digital marketing agencies who utilize their technology to run sophisticated digital campaigns that include web pages customized based on a visitor's historical activity.Purchasing SharpSpring's software gives a customer licenses for use with up to three clients. The software is also white-labeled so that an agency can present it with their own branding and can upsell if they choose. With this model, SharpSpring has an attractive LTV/CAC ratio typically greater than 6.In English, that means that for every $1 they spend acquiring a customer, that customer will generate $6 in lifetime value. The right way to run this business, in my opinion, is to spend every available dollar on sales and marketing to build the customer base, not worrying about short-term profitability. SharpSpring management agrees, and recently executed a convertible debt offering to access additional resources for marketing.SharpSpring operates in an oligopolistic market with three primary competitors: HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), Act-On, and Pardot (by Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)). HubSpot is the largest competitor and in a difficult competitive position relative to SharpSpring. HubSpot has a large customer base paying in excess of $30K per year versus SharpSpring charging less than $5K per year. HubSpot cannot easily slash prices 75% to compete on price, and given the near-parity of the offerings, offering a ""stripped down"" version is also not viable. These dynamics have driven adoption and market share gains for SHSP, particularly among smaller agencies.SharpSpring has benefitted from multiple expansion, but also has executed well. Product revenue grew 40% in their last reported quarter. In a more recent press release, the company announced a record number of new customers in Q3 while maintaining marketing efficiency (their LTV/CAC should remain above 6). There is a very long runway for growth for SharpSpring.The company will benefit from secular tailwinds in an industry growing over 20% per year. There is also a history of acquisitions in the space at premiums to where shares trade today. SharpSpring came to my attention through a conversation with Jeremy Kahan of North Peak, a manager the Partners Fund is invested with.TripAdvisor - TripAdvisor remains the dominant travel research company and maintains the largest installed base for travel apps. The company continues to make progress on their in-destination business for local tours and activities, and has been optimizing ad spending on the hotel business to improve profitability. We continue to hold the shares as it is entirely plausible that TripAdvisor can improve their monetization rates on the $1.3+ trillion in travel spend it influences.The company has announced but not rolled out a new version of the site, which features a personal travel feed that makes it easier to plan and book travel while putting an emphasis on friend and influencer recommendations when available. Like any major overhaul, it has the possibility of improving the experience and economics… or not. Time will tell.Yelp - We discussed Yelp in detail in Greenhaven's Q2 letter. The initial indications are that the transition away from one-year contracts and toward more flexible, ""cancelable at any time"" commitments has gone well. As management said in their quarterly letter to shareholders (Link):There remains the possibility of increased traction of new offerings, improved monetization, operating leverage, and multiple expansion.EnviroStar (NYSEMKT:EVI) - Given SHSP's strength and EVI's price declines, EnviroStar was replaced in the Top 5 during Q3. This remains a very large holding for our partnership, and there continues to be progress. The company has announced five acquisitions so far this year as they continue to execute their buy and build strategy. EVI will not screen cheaply for several reasons, including deal costs, which depress current year earnings, and a larger infrastructure, which depresses short-term margins.As EnviroStar scales, we should see operating leverage and margin expansion as this infrastructure is spread over a larger base of business. As discussed in past letters, there is also a dynamic where acquisitions made late in the year immediately increase the fully diluted share count but only contribute a partial year of revenue and earnings.While short-term earnings may be understated, the long-term potential of EnviroStar remains compelling as they create value with the ability to acquire assets at 5X EBITDA using a stock currency that is in excess of 15X EBITDA. When paired with the ability to improve the acquired companies and a current balance sheet that can accommodate significant debt, this flywheel can turn for a long time.There are a lot of ways to invest. There is a more quantitative method driven by particular ratios such as price to book, price to earnings, and return on invested capital. The investment I am about to describe is driven far more by the qualitative. For such investments, I often gain conviction through a synthesis of my life experiences and hypotheses about the future. To provide the context for our most recent investment, let me lay out three life experiences. They are somewhat disjointed, but are important pieces to the puzzle.The first relevant experience occurred when I was in business school. After the first semester, students got to choose courses that we thought would be interesting, so I signed up for a class called ""Managing a Multinational Organization."" I had previously managed a small company, and was intrigued by the prospect of pulling back the curtain on what managing a multinational company would look like. It was one of the best classes I ever attended… but it does not appear on my transcript.I walked out of the class after 20 minutes and vowed to never try to manage a multinational company myself. The issues of a small company are dramatically magnified when dealing with different languages, cultures, customer preferences, labor laws, regulations, etc. A large enterprise is exponentially more complex than a small business and requires special skills and tools.The second relevant experience came from my time in an operating role at Acelero, the education services company I helped found. We were looking at selling a technology-based product to Head Start programs, but selling this type of product was not something we had done before, so we tried to pick the brains of the smartest entrepreneurs in the space in order to shape our sales and marketing strategy. One day we were able to meet an individual who, in our opinion, had ""cracked the code"" in the education space, having grown from two guys in rented office space to eventually being acquired by a public company.When discussing how to sell in the education space, he said that their sales strategy hinged on identifying what motivated the customer, and addressing those motivations. This is pretty basic and common sense, but, he then went on to say something that proved to be incredibly insightful. To paraphrase:In regulated industries, compliance can drive hundreds of billions of dollars of purchases just because the product checks a box for regulators and allows everyone to keep their jobs.The third life experience also occurred at Acelero. When we first started, we had a paper checkbook in the filing cabinet. We ran payroll monthly using a bookkeeper. It was as low tech as you could get. As we added a few employees, we graduated to Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) where we could phone in our payroll.For a period of growth from 10 to 100 employees, we used a boutique PEO (professional employer organization), and when we crossed 100 employees, we switched over to ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), which was the provider of choice for larger companies. Over time, we did far more than issue paychecks with ADP as their data and systems integrated with our health insurance provider, our retirement plans, and our corporate learning tools.Unfortunately, we grew to hate ADP. We hated the (lack of) service, we hated the pricing, and we hated the user interfaces. However, we stayed with them year after year after year because they were integral to running our finance department, and the complexity and risks of changing payroll providers and interrupting all of those integrations were too high. Removing ADP as the center of this ecosystem felt like the equivalent of attempting a brain transplant - the integrations kept us captive as they created a very significant barrier to exit. We stayed not because we were happy, but it was too hard to leave.So to summarize, my past experiences gave me an admiration for the complexity facing large enterprises, a recognition that - particularly in a regulated industry - purchase decisions are often driven by compliance, and an appreciation for how integrations between vendors for critical systems can effectively lock in a customer. Recently, these experiences, coupled with two other themes that have been running through my research process, laid the foundation for a new investment.The first theme, discussed above, is companies that are ""undermonetizing"" can be attractive investments. The second theme percolating is also an obvious one: data is today's gold, and it is unlikely that companies will, on average, spend less on accessing, sharing, and protecting it. There is real career risk in skimping on data, and data management and cybersecurity have significant tailwinds for the next decade or longer.None of these experiences or themes are blindingly brilliant, but collectively they are the underpinnings for our investment in Box, Inc.Box started 13 years ago out of a USC dorm room as an online file storage company, effectively offering a cloud-based hard drive to store computer files. Today, there are multiple companies that will allow a user to store a virtually unlimited number of files for a nominal amount of money, or even for free. Online file storage is a ""bad"" business as there is little value add and it is effectively a commodity. The founders of Box realized that commodity storage could be a race to the bottom, so relatively early on, they began to focus on the enterprise customers (larger companies), and particularly companies in regulated industries.For large companies in regulated industries such as healthcare or defense, storing information is easy: compliance is the tricky part. Large companies need to control who can access files, and with whom the files can be shared both externally and internally. There needs to be a log of all activity surrounding the file. Who opened it, when and where did they log in from, etc.? There are file retention policies to be enforced. While Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Drive may work for a small business, the compliance needs of an enterprise quickly strain the functionality of Google.Do you want your health records stored on a free Dropbox account your doctor got by sharing the email address of 5 friends? If you run a defense contractor with 150,000 employees, do you want them using a hodge-podge of Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), Google Drive, and OneDrive? Large companies need more robust data storage solutions. They need the ability to share content internally and externally but also to have controls and records of how that sharing occurred. They need the ability to lock files. To gain a sense of the robustness of the Box offering, it is worth perusing this feature comparison datasheet (linked here).Over the last decade, Box has built a customer base of over 87,000 companies with over 10M users that store their data on Box servers, including 69% of the Fortune 500. Box has integrated with 1,400+ applications so far, including Google Suite, DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), and Slack. The products and integrations allow files stored with Box to be ""the source of truth,"" which means that while other applications can access files stored on Box, all of the changes are made and kept on the Box version where the security and sharing protocols can be applied. These integrations make it less likely a customer will leave Box, and diminish the chances that a direct or adjacent competitor could create a copycat product.The robustness of Box's current product suite and the lack of credible alternatives has led to very low churn rates: retention is 95%. Because of the addition of new products and the sales of additional seats, we can expect the core base of customers (before any new customer adds) to spend more this year than they did last year. In fact, Box's net dollar retention is running at approximately 108%, so even if no new customers were added, and with some attrition, we would still expect revenue to increase at least 8% before factoring in sales to new customers.Box has a very sticky product, and a large customer base. There is the potential to further monetize the customer base by selling a lot more product and services to the existing base to take advantage of being the holders of critical data. Box is sprinting at this opportunity. The company is spending over $100M a year on R&D. While meeting the compliance use cases of large enterprises is complex, it does not require this level of R&D spending.Box is aggressively building a robust pipeline of new products for release over the next two years, designed to improve how people work with and share information, the security of information, as well as applying automation and machine learning. Here are a couple of links to provide a sense of the future products and how they take advantage of Box's unique position and how far Box will be from a simple file storage company.Box Shield (video linked here) Box Skills (overview video linked here).Box recently added a new board member, Kimberly Hammonds, and in the press release she said,I feel the same way.I have not seen Box written up in any of the traditional venues like SumZero but it was presented by venture capitalist CEO Chamath Palihapitiya at the Ira Sohn conference. He argues that Box is a way for individuals and companies to benefit from the improvements in AI (Artificial Intelligence). Over time, Box customers (who are generally larger and have more types of data spread across more users than customers of other solutions) inevitably will want to apply artificial intelligence to their data.In fact, they will likely want to apply AI solutions from multiple vendors. Box is application agnostic and will be able to integrate with all of the major AI players including Google, IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Amazon. Thus, by storing files on Box, companies will have both the security they need and also the flexibility to work with multiple vendors to access and mine their files in different ways. Typically, when I hear a buzz word like AI, a combination of words like vaporware, hype, and short come to mind.In the case of Box, at this point only the expense of creating this functionality has been realized as these integrations have been built and are being tested but have yet to launch. The ability to apply the best AI offerings to data stored on box represents a free call option that could be another barrier to exit that generates revenue and is buzzworthy enough to generate multiple expansion.Box is missing one characteristic that I value: high insider ownership. Box was started by four college-aged friends with limited personal resources. Their first round of funding came from Mark Cuban. Eventually, as the company pursued developing for and selling into the enterprise market, they raised hundreds of millions of dollars in several rounds of financing. As a net result, the co-founder CEO owns approximately $70M in stock and the co-founder CFO just north of $20M. So while collectively they hold less than 5% of the company, they do have ""skin in the game"" and are not simply hired hands.Box operates in a massive market that they refer to as ""Cloud Content Management"" and size at $45B per year. I think no matter how we define it, it is likely growing and worth multiples of Box's current revenue. Last year, Box generated operating cash flow while spending roughly two-thirds of revenue on sales and marketing and product development (54% and 20%, respectively). Over time, a company's value should approximate the rates of return that they can get when they reinvest capital.As discussed before, with a customer base of 87,000 companies, it is easy to see a very high ROI on new product development. I am typically skeptical of sales and marketing spend as it can be a sugar high to drive short-term growth. However, with customer retention rates running in the above 90% and net dollar retention running well above $100, Box is actually probably not spending enough on sales and marketing. There is a slide on page 88 of their investor day deck (link) that shows revenue growth by cohort.It is beautiful. Several different years of customer cohorts have been compounding revenue growth well in excess of 20% per year. Now, marketing effectiveness may deteriorate over time, but the last two years have seen CAGR's of 24% and 20%, and there is still a largely untapped international opportunity as the U.S. constitutes 76% of revenue.All of the above paints the picture of a high-quality business with a bright future. Companies like this are rarely optically cheap. We are currently buying shares at just north of 4X next year's sales, which one could argue is cheap relative to many SaaS peers, (Dropbox and DocuSign have valuations twice as rich) but certainly is not on an absolute basis. I think one of the greatest risk factors here is multiple compression, particularly if growth slows.However, given the product pipeline and sales pipeline, I don't think the slowdown is imminent. In the long run, Box has the opportunity to continuously improve their business through a virtuous cycle of retaining customers and improving monetization. Product improvements lead to greater value add, which leads to greater utilization, greater lock in, lower churn, and higher revenue per user. Revenue growth and margin expansion are highly probable, with multiple expansion a possibility. No additional capital is required to grow.There is a long runway for growth, and multiple opportunities for additional products to be sold into a large and attractive customer base. Continued revenue growth of 20%+ for the foreseeable future, coupled with operating leverage and a very valuable customer base, create an interesting set-up.We ended the quarter with limited short exposure. The fund remains short ETFs targeted at short-term traders, a bond fund where the underlying interest rates received relative to the risk assumed do not pass my common-sense test, and two indices as very modest hedges.In September, we held Greenhaven's annual meeting in New York City. It is a special night for me, as I get the in-person opportunity to share context on the health and direction of the partnership, enjoy the company of our limited partners, and to say thank you. At the meeting, I spoke about three operating principles that have guided the firm over time. The first was to go slow and recognize that doing nothing is usually the right course of action. The second principle is to only pursue the ""Hell Yeahs.""If something does not really excite me, we will leave it to others. The final operating principle is that design matters. How we organize, who we invest with, and how we spend our time are the most critical decisions. The primary filter for all design choices is, ""can it help improve returns?"" This may sound simple, but it is very different than how most large hedge funds operate.Also at the meeting, we gave a small set of gifts to the limited partners in attendance that included the book Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts by Annie Duke. Annie Duke has an interesting background, awarded a National Science Foundation Fellowship to study Cognitive Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.She was also one of the top poker players in the world for two decades, winning over $4M in poker tournaments and a lot more elsewhere. She was also part of a group of players who helped each other improve their decision making. The group was led by a player named Eric Seidel, who has over $38M in tournament winnings.I think this book is well worth reading as it is a nice summary of probabilistic thinking and how to apply it. At the core, many of our investments are, in my estimation, asymmetric. There is a chance we may lose money, but there is a significant chance at a large profit, providing a positive expected value.When I say design matters, and who I spend our time with is important, I mean it. Under the umbrella of the Partners Fund, I am going to convene Annie Duke and the portfolio managers of the funds the Partners Funds is invested in. As I wrote in the invitation to the managers,The day with Annie Duke will be followed by a day of idea sharing among the managers. I don't know exactly what will come of these gatherings, but in my experience, good content and good people are a promising formula. While I believe our best chance at generating returns are with an investment committee of one, I am also keenly aware that the best chance of success will not be acting entirely alone. Rather, our best chances for success will be from the combination of the right limited partners, the right managers in the Partners Fund, and the right outside resources. The Annie Duke day will be another stop on that journey.We have a healthy economy and a portfolio of companies that have the opportunity for revenue growth, margin expansion, and multiple expansion over time. As volatility arises, I will attempt to take advantage of the opportunities it creates. We will continue to invest with a long-time horizon, and we will continue to invest like it is our own money - because it is. Thank you for the opportunity to grow your family capital alongside mine.Sincerely,Scott MillerEditor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

(NYSE:BOX) is set to publish its Q3 Earnings Report on Wednesday, Nov. 28, after market close.Box is a direct competitor to Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), and provides a cloud content management platform that enables organizations of various sizes to manage and share their enterprise content from anywhere or any device. The company's software-as-a-service platform enables users to collaborate on content internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data protection, security, and compliance features.BOX has been an intriguing name since its public debut back in 2015. Since then the company's revenue has grown at an impressive annual rate of 32%. Yet due to increasing competition, Box's rate of growth has cooled off in recent times, reaching just 20% in the second quarter. And that's despite secured strategic partnerships with the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), among other giants. The management has been investing in ways to grow and to continuously improve the platform. But with downbeat billings growth, there's now the fear of the company throwing good money after bad.Box's CFO, Dylan Smith, sold 15,000 shares in a transaction that occurred on Sept. 10. The shares were sold at an average price of $24.71, for a total value of $370,650. According to the transaction, Smith now owns 1,169,274 shares in the company, valued at $28,892,760.54.A number of hedge funds and other institutional investors have recently made changes to their positions on the stock.

4225729,22148,2018-11-30T17:59:03-05:00,Box trades at multi-year lows around $18.Short-term billings weakness won't last as Box closes more large enterprise deals at year-end.A cloud software stock shouldn't trade at an EV of 3.3x FY20 sales estimates.,"Following along with the tech stock collapse over the last couple of months, Box (BOX) has fallen to yearly lows and below initial trading levels after the 2015 IPO. The cloud content management stock has an EV down to $2.5 billion despite consistent 20% revenue growth. The move toward larger enterprise deals should further separate the company from competitors and reinforce my long-term investment thesis.Image Source: Box websiteOver their four years as a public company, Box has consistently run into issues where the market is concerned by growth mostly reflective of the volatile bookings numbers.The stock is trading mostly sideways following solid FQ3 results probably due to billings growth of only 10%. The company has volatile customer pre-payments and doesn't push for customers to meet worthless quarter end deadlines for payments.Box even forecasts billings to surge to mid-20% growth in FQ4 showing how quarter-to-quarter numbers are meaningless. The market will quickly shake off the current weakness when that print hits. For this reason, investors should focus on consistent revenue growth.Since going public, revenue has consistently grown at rates above 20%. The stock hasn't fared so well in the process.When these two lines don't match, typically the stock is a bargain due to misconceptions by the market. In this case, the market appears to not understand the consistent, recurring revenues of the cloud software company.Considering all the fears inherent in the low stock price, the market fears Box losing customers to Dropbox (DBX). Going forward, the key data points for the content management company are customer expansion and retention rates showing the company's progress with moving upscale on large enterprise deals. In the last quarter, Box saw churn remain below 5% with plenty of customers expanding deals so that the net retention rate was 108%.Source: Box FQ3'19 presentationThis scenario ensures that new customers add to growth vs. replacing lost customers. The better number was probably the growth in deals greater than $100,000.These deals signal that larger corporations are utilizing Box. The company promotes enterprise class security and compliance products and verification of those believes should show up in these larger deals.The bigger enterprise deals will separate Box from Dropbox that competes more in the small business area.The combination of the growing revenue streams reinforced by larger deals adds up to no reason for the stock to trade at recent lows. The forward EV/S multiple is at the recent lows. The stock trades at about 4.0x FY19 sales and a much lower 3.3x FY20 revenue estimates of $735 million.The key investor takeaway is that the market wants the cloud content management company to grow at faster rates, but the stock is now far too cheap for the actual 20% growth rate. Use the weakness to own Box below $20.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4202760,103480,2018-08-29T06:11:59-04:00,"Box shares crashed yet again after posting so-so Q2 results and disappointing Q3 guidance.Looking at Box's results, however, the print wasn't too bad. Box managed to sustain revenue growth above 20%, nullifying fears that the company would continue to decelerate.We're still waiting on the back half of the year to provide the billings recovery that Box's CFO, Dylan Smith, hinted at last quarter.Meanwhile, Box has also improved operating margin by five points this quarter, a huge improvement for a company once said to be a ""house of horrors"" due to its steep losses.Box remains a cheap SaaS stock trading at just 5.3x forward revenues.","Quarterly earnings releases are never a good event for Box (BOX). The file storage and collaboration company has, yet again, seen a sharp correction after posting Q2 results. As usual, Box didn't fail to meet Wall Street's expectations this quarter - in fact, Box beat consensus estimates by a comfortable enough margin. Investors, however, looked ahead to the Q3 guide and decided good wasn't good enough.As a result, shares of Box plunged more than 7% in after-hours trading, continuing the stock's recent choppy trading pattern. Shares are still up for the year (we can thank the boss of Social Capital for praising Box's AI capabilities at the Sohn investment conference this spring for those gains, most of which has still been sustained) - yet, I still believe Box to have tremendous upside left. I've been long on Box for quite a while, and see no red flags in either the company's most recent results or its guidance outlook for Q3. In fact, Box actually raised its full-year outlook by $2 million at the midpoint, now implying a respectable year-over-year growth range of 20% for FY19. We're still hoping for Box to recover in the back half of this year. Part of the lack of enthusiasm in both this quarter and last quarter's results owed to a noticeable slowdown in billings. Billings growth in both quarters was 17% y/y, three points slower than revenue growth - a troubling sign for most SaaS companies, as it implies potential revenue deceleration. Box has already seen growth tumble from the high 20s/low 30s last year to just over 20% this year, so investors aren't happy at the possibility of further deceleration. Note, however, that Box's CFO Dylan Smith had alluded to stronger billings in the back half of this year on last quarter's earnings call:In an optimistic scenario, this means we have good news later in the (fiscal) year to count on for a stock rebound. Other than this, the core elements of Box's bullish thesis still remain very relevant:Stay long on Box and use the temporary downbeat environment to keep adding shares.Here's a look at Box's quarterly results:Figure 1. Box 2Q19 resultsSource: Box investor relationsTotal revenues grew 21% y/y to $148.2 million, surpassing Wall Street's consensus target of $146.6 million (+19% y/y) by a comfortable two-point margin. Note that one of the big commotions last quarter was due to the fact that Box's growth slipped below 20% (by 10bps, to 19.9% y/y) for the first time in the company's history. This quarter, with the one-point acceleration to 21% y/y growth, Box has eased fears that it's in a long-term decelerating trend. As previously noted, we're still waiting for a recovery in billings growth. Box has typically posted billings growth in excess of revenue growth, but in recent quarters, billings growth has lagged behind revenue growth. This quarter, billings hit 17% y/y growth to $162.8 billion. Still, however, the nominal dollar volume of billings still outpaced that of revenues, indicating that Box still added to its deferred revenue backlog.Figure 2. Box 2Q18 billingsSource: Box investor relationsNote that Box Skills is still in private beta, though the company has extended its beta group this quarter. When Box Skills become generally available (""GA"" in software lingo), it should be able to provide further tailwinds to billings and revenue growth. Meanwhile, Box still managed to win some big-ticket clients in the quarter (including major film studio Lionsgate (LGF), camera company Canon, and the City of Atlanta) and ended the quarter with 87k paying clients.On the profitability side, Box continues to march higher, reversing its history of being a loss-leading company. Most notably, the company was able to drastically slow down its sales and marketing spend, which only expanded 5% y/y to $77.0 million. Sales and marketing costs consumed 51.9% of revenues this quarter, 770bps lower than 59.6% in the year-ago quarter.This reduction in sales and marketing spend brings up a critical point: Box is choosing to step off the gas pedal and focus more on profitability. With a SaaS company at Box's scale, management has a choice on whether to keep growing at breakneck rates and pumping more dollars into sales, or focus instead on improving margins. Often, the marginal benefits of continuing to expand sales investments are low.Thus, we should keep in mind that even though Box's low-20s revenue growth isn't as exciting as it used to be, its profitability improvements make up for the slowdown. GAAP operating margin this quarter was -25.1%, a stunning 660bps better than. -31.7% in the year-ago quarter.Box's pro forma EPS of -$0.05 also beat Wall Street's expectations for -$0.06, ad free cash flow burn shrank from -$15.0 million in the year-ago quarter to just -$10.3 million this quarter. The negative free cash flow is a highly seasonal aspect of Box's business - in the back half of the year, when billings are typically stronger, the company should be able to turn back to positive FCF for the full fiscal year.There's no reason to be down on Box just yet. It has kept its growth afloat from last quarter without any signs of continued deceleration, and we're still holding out for billings to improve in the back half of this year. Amid the growth slowdown, however, we're seeing obvious signs of margin improvement and expansion in cash flows. From a product perspective, while Box is up against notably larger competitors in Dropbox and Alphabet, it is also the only incumbent with a deep enterprise focus and such well-heeled AI capabilities. In my view, this stocks' cheap valuation multiple presents a compelling buying opportunity for the long haul."
4225539,103480,2018-11-29T19:16:52-05:00,"Shares of Box rose nearly 7% after reporting strong Q3 results.The rise reverses the weak trend that Box has suffered from since May. Still, the stock is down more than 40% from highs.While it's true that Box's growth has moderated, its cash flow story is only beginning to take hold.The company remains substantially undervalued at 4x forward revenues.","It's been an incredibly painful year for investors in Box (BOX), the cloud-based storage software company. Amid declining growth rates, the IPO of rival Dropbox (DBX), and general weak sentiment in cloud stocks, shares of Box have fallen consistently since May, having entered (and not quite yet recovered from) deep bear market territory. Despite this pessimism, Box has remained one of the core long holdings in my portfolio for the same reason: its incredibly low valuation.Thankfully, the company just posted a strong Q3 earnings beat. Unlike most SaaS stocks, Box usually suffers after earnings, despite almost always beating Wall Street estimates. This time around, however, shares of Box rose 7% after reporting a top- and bottom-line beat, helping to reverse some of the company's steep losses since May. In my view, Box is well-positioned for a rebound.BOX data by YChartsAlmost all cloud stocks are still down heavily since the beginning of October. The general market trend is shifting toward value-oriented names, and this is why I think Box in particular has a very appealing potential for a rebound: it's virtually alone in the SaaS sector with its valuation of <3.8x forward revenues. Investors may complain that the tech sector has gotten overheated and overvalued, driving some of the sector rotation out of high-growth stocks and into value - but the same argument does not hold for Box.It's important to note that while many bears view Box as a commoditized offering that will eventually succumb to pricing pressures, the company has added on functionalities at an impressive pace. There's no doubt that Box has maintained its reputation as a best-in-breed vendor among enterprise file storage firms and that its capabilities in AI are unmatched. The timeline below, taken from Box's Q3 earnings deck, also showcases the various modules that Box has tacked on to its flagship platform over time:Figure 1. Box product evolutionSource: Box investor deckIt's also crucial to recall that Box has an installed customer base that's nearly 100k customers deep, and each of them pays Box a recurring subscription fee. Once a company's files are all uploaded and shared via Box, it becomes extremely difficult to rip out. This is why competitive fears for Box may be far overblown: while it's true that Dropbox and Google Drive (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) have accelerated the push into enterprise, they probably can't do much to convert Box's existing installed base, which contains some of largest blue-chip firms in the Fortune 500:Figure 2. Box anchor customersSource: Box investor deckIn my view, Box is a long-term hold. While I'll acknowledge that the company's narrative isn't perfect - we'd prefer to see greater than 20% y/y revenue and billings growth - the company is far too undervalued at <3.8x forward revenues.Here's a glance at Box's latest quarterly results:Figure 3. Box 3Q19 resultsSource: Box earnings releaseThe most important takeaway from Box's results is that the company has more or less managed to stabilize its growth rates. Growth has hovered in the low 20s for several quarters now. This quarter, revenue grew 21% y/y to $156.0 million (matching last quarter's growth rate, and showing no deceleration at all), while beating Wall Street's estimates of $154.6 million (+20% y/y).The company's churn continued to remain low at 4.5%, highlighting my earlier assertion that once installed, Box's customers present a very low flight risk, even in the face of competition. The company also maintained a 108% net retention rate, indicating its ability to upsell the current installed base.Box's broader array of products and ability to sell packaged solutions have noticeably improved its deal sizes and supported its revenue growth, according to long-time CFO Dylan Smith. Per his comments in the Q3 earnings call:It's worth noting that Box fell earlier in May due to concerns over a slowdown in billings growth. Now, it seems investors are pleased with the company's forecast for ""mid-20s"" billings growth in closing out FY19.There were some headwinds this quarter on the profit front, however. Pro forma gross margins dropped 190bps to 73.6%, though the company cited upfront data center investments as the primary driver of the margin decline. Box's CFO noted that price per seat still rose both sequentially and year over year (again nullifying any fears that Box is subject to pricing pressures), due in large part to the higher attach rates for add-on products.In spite of this gross margin headwind, pro forma operating margins still rose tremendously to -5%, up eight points from -8% in the year-ago quarter, as shown in the chart below:Figure 4. Box operating margin trendsSource: Box investor deckDriving the operating margin lift was dramatically improved efficiency on the sales and marketing front, which fell to ""only"" 48% of revenues versus 57% in the year-ago quarter. Box has long been criticized for its focus on ""growth at all costs"" and its heavy reliance on aggressive sales spending to drive growth, but overall the past several quarters, Box has shown an ability to gradually capture more operating leverage on the sales front.Pro forma EPS of -$0.06 also beat Wall Street's expectations of -$0.07, and despite a free cash flow crunch in Q3 (due primarily to a timing of payments originally intended for Q4), Box still expects to achieve positive FCF for both Q4 and FY19.Without a doubt, Box is the kind of stock that requires plenty of patience on the investor's part. Box has perennially traded at a deep discount to the majority of its SaaS peers, despite the fact that its quarterly results refute nearly every bearish claim made against the stock. Competition, pricing pressures and heavy losses are the major arguments against Box - and in this quarter especially, Box proved that A) its add-on products have been able to support high deal values and B) the company has been able to taper down sales expenses as growth decelerates.A stock trading at under 4x revenues typically has a glaring flaw, but in Box, we find none. The risk-reward profile is heavily tilted in favor of the bulls. Stay long and wait for a longer-term rebound."
4215411,90055,2018-10-29T11:16:36-04:00,"Box's stock has dropped hard over the last couple months, down 40% from 52 week highs.Some investors are concerned about Box's seemingly downward long-term guidance.Box's long-term story remains intact despite the recent drop in stock price, and today offers a wonderful entry point for long-term investors.","Box (BOX) is a small business that empowers companies to take control of how they store and access their data. Given its potential to ride the big data mega-trend, I recommended this stock back in June around $25/share. Unfortunately, that pick hasn't worked out so well yet, down over 30% as of this writing.BOX data by YChartsA 30% drop from my recommendation is bad enough. But this stock is actually down around 40% from highs set earlier this year. This undoubtedly has left investors scratching their heads. What has changed with this business that has led to such poor stock returns? That's a question we seek to answer in this article.Box hit an all-time high on June 20th at $29.79/share. As I mentioned, the stock is currently down around 40% from that high. So what has changed with the business over the last 120 days or so?Did Box whiff on earnings? The answer to that is ""no"". The company actually beat analyst expectations on both the top and the bottom line last quarter. Furthermore, solid revenue growth north of 20% fueled record revenue of $148 million.Has there been a change in analyst ratings? Again, no. The most recent update to my knowledge came from Raymond James by Brian Peterson who maintained his buy rating with a price target of $25/share. Analysts aren't raising their price targets, but they aren't lowering either. In other words, professional sentiment on this stock has stayed the same, and can't be blamed for driving the stock lower.Did some news come out that bodes poorly for the company? Once again, no. If you swing over to Box's press release page, you'll see that there's no bad news being reported since the company hit all-time highs.So what has changed if these things haven't? Well, first off, overall market conditions have changed recently. Many high flying companies -- especially in the technology sector -- have cooled off from recent highs.BOX data by YChartsThe six month chart shows that Box has performed roughly inline with peers Splunk (SPLK) and DropBox (DBX), especially over the past month. This bearish sentiment over the entire technology sector is a real factor effecting Box's stock, but one that I personally believe is a temporary headwind. After all, bull and bear markets are just part of investing. You should always expect both at some point.Perhaps the one thing that can be a knock against Box was seeming downward guidance. The company is guiding for $1 billion in full-year revenue for fiscal 2022. Previous guidance said that the $1 billion quarterly run rate ($250 million) would be achieved in the 3rd quarter of 2021. The company has since walked back the quarterly run rate guidance, but is maintaining the full-year 2022 guidance.So, is that really downward guidance? I suppose that's in the eye of the beholder. On one hand, it can be viewed as a sign that Box's management is feeling uncertain about 2021, and therefore it's just a matter of time before 2022 guidance follows suit. On the other hand, nailing down quarterly guidance over two years from now was rather unrealistic to begin with. Removing the quarterly guidance aspect therefore could be seen as a reasonable move by a company setting its focus on the right thing: long-term sustainable growth.I personally take the updated guidance as a positive. Based on what Box is seeing right now, it is still unwaveringly shooting for $1 billion in revenue for fiscal 2022. Keep in mind that Box started fiscal 2019 February 1st of this year. That means that the $1 billion in revenue runs from calendar February 1st, 2021 - January 31st, 2022. This is within my five year time frame for an investment, and a big reason why I recommended Box stock.So, in the previous section while we looked at what has changed, I noted that Box's guidance for $1 billion in revenue for fiscal 2022 has not changed. But what else hasn't changed for this company that is worth noting?In my original article, I never touched Box's opportunity for international expansion. But it is worth noting here. For fiscal 2018, Box derived 78% of its revenue from customers based in the United States. But the company is expanding internationally and already has offices in London, Tokyo, and Melbourne. These cities represent the world's 5th, 3rd, and 13th largest economies, and are excellent strategic places for international expansion.And the expansion is going well. In Japan for example, Box just moved into a new office after five years in the country. Currently the company employs just 100 people there, but the new office will allow space for 200 employees. The move is a signal that business in Japan is trending towards substantial growth in the near-term.So international expansion plans haven't changed. But another part of the business that continues to go as planned is Box's focus on AI solutions. In my original article, I mentioned how enterprises comprise the core of Box's customer base. Box continues to grow here and now serves over 87,000 enterprise customers. Getting these customers to join the platform, and then be able to upsell these existing customers with new solutions -- including artificial intelligence solutions -- is crucial to the long-term bullish thesis on the company.To that end Box continues to make progress. Its original AI product -- called Box Skills -- is still in beta. However, in June the company expanded its beta program, with full roll-out expected in the near future. Additionally, Box has recently acquired Progressly and Butter.ai to bring added expertise to future AI products.Billionaire venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya's presentation at the Sohn Conference in April has been discussed quite a bit in investor circles. And with good reason -- it was a great presentation. One of the things that he said in that presentation that particularly stood out to me was the idea of value creation in Silicon Valley coming in ""waves"". He talked about how recent waves have come through computers, then internet, and then mobile. Now he argues that the new wave of value creation is upon us, that of artificial intelligence. In that light, all companies need to be actively planning on how to derive value from artificial intelligence solutions.While still very early in the game, you have to like the direction Box is headed with its product road map. Data storage and access is the initial product to get customers in the door. But artificial intelligence products is absolutely the logical next step, especially if Palihapitiya is correct in AI being the next big wave of value creation.So in summary, Box still looks like a strong growth company on track to reach its goals. In my original article, I closed by saying that Box was a volatile stock, and that some people may want to sit on the sidelines and wait for a better price. Though I personally didn't wait, those who did are being gifted a wonderful entry point here under $18/share. I believe those who buy today and patiently hold will be richly rewarded in the next 3-5 years."
4200852,104099,2018-08-21T08:52:02-04:00,"In my view, investors would be wise to take profits in Box Inc. at these levels.The shares are very optimistically priced, and I think investors would be wise to sit on the sidelines until the hopeful narrative actually plays out (or doesn't).For those who are long here in spite of the losses and dilution, I suggest switching to calls.","Over the past 12 months, the shares of Box Inc. (BOX) are up about 30%, and in my view investors would be wise to take profits at this point. I’ll go through my reasoning below by looking at the financial history here, and by looking at the stock itself. For those technology investors who seem strangely immune to the need for profits from their investments, I’ll offer a less risky way to “play” this business via call options. Before all of that, though, I’ll go through the strongest bullish arguments that I’ve heard and will try to reply to each of them in turn. My reasons for doing so go beyond my interest in intellectual honesty. In order to understand the bearish side fully, I must grapple with the bullish side, and in so doing present risks of my own thesis.A very good bullish article was published on this forum earlier this month, and I’ll hopefully do the author justice when I go through his arguments, agreeing with some, disagreeing with others.A quick review of the financial history suggests that Box Inc. is in some ways impressive. Over the past five years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 32%. Although the company continues to show losses, the rate of loss is actually slowing at a CAGR of about 1.7%. This is an impressive feat in light of the fact that R&D, Sales and Marketing, and G&A have all grown at a CAGR of 24%, 12%, and 16% respectively.Unfortunately, that’s where the financial good news ends in my view. For example, share count ballooned after the IPO, obviously, but continues to grow at a post IPO CAGR of 4.5%. This dilution relates to one constituency that has benefited tremendously over the past few years: employees. Per employee stock based compensation has basically doubled over the past four years. Total stock based compensation has increased at a CAGR of about 53%, but because headcount has also grown, per employee compensation figures have “only” doubled.In fact, including the money received during the IPO, the company has generated just under $285 million from stock sales (including employee stock purchase plans and stock option sales). This is a relevant risk because $285 million represents just under 2 years of losses. If the mood of the notoriously capricious market changes, the company may not be able to continuously sell shares to finance operations.Source: Company filingsSource: Company filingsIn my view, investing is as much about buying future cash flows at the right price than anything else. Future profitability is important, but if investors overpay, a great business can be a terrible investment. For that reason, something should be said about the stock itself in my view. It might also be the case that a mediocre business like Box Inc. might be an acceptable investment if investors can acquire the shares cheaply.When looking at a stock, one of the first things I do is look at price to free cash flow. If investors can acquire future cash flows at reduced rates, that is by definition a better investment than the alternative. As the chart below demonstrates, Box has been even more egregiously expensive in the past. In addition, the price to free cash flow has come down recently. The problem is that the stock remains very expensive in my view, sporting a price to free cash flow of ~60. Paying $60 today for $1 of free cash next year magnifies the investment risk in my view.Another thing I do when looking at a stock is to review the assumptions embedded in price. I want to use stock price itself as a source of information, to determine what the market must be “thinking” at the moment about the long term growth prospects of the business. The more optimistically priced are the shares, the greater the risk in my view.In order to accomplish this, I turn to the methodology outlined by Professor Stephen Penman in his excellent book “Accounting for Value.” In this book, Penman goes through how an investor can isolate “g” in a fairly standard finance formula (and the magic of high school algebra). By doing so, we can get some sense of what the market is “thinking” about the future for a given company. Applying this methodology to Box Inc., we see that the market assumes a long run, perpetual growth of profits (not revenue, profits) of about 13%. “Perpetual” is a very long time, and this analysis further supports the view that the stock itself is very richly priced.I’ll conclude this section on the stock with a rebuttal to an argument that I’m sure to get. Yes, accounting is “backward looking” and technological innovation is forward looking so accounting may not be a relevant forecasting tool. That would be a fair point, but it misses the gist of my argument. Accounting allows us to see where we are, which is what allows us to judge the size of the chasm between where we are and where we need to be to achieve consistent profitability. Although the future of this company will undoubtedly be different than the past, knowing the past allows us to gauge exactly what needs to happen to make this an acceptable investment. In my view, accounting is particularly powerful because it allows us to see that much has to change for both the stock and the underlying business for this to be a sound investment.I must admit that the majority of people who buy companies like this don’t seem to care about the things that I care about in their investments. That combination of cheap stock and profitable business seem to be almost irrelevant to the crowd of people who are interested in investing in “future tech.” Fair enough. I still have a recommendation for such people that can improve their risk adjusted returns. In my view, switching from shares to call options makes sense at these levels.At the moment, the shares of Box Inc. are trading for about $24.5 and the bid ask spread for the January calls with a strike price of $25 is currently $2.60-2.95. That means that for approximately 12% of the capital, a speculator in these calls will enjoy most of the upside from this stock if the manic crowd continues to bid it higher. On the other hand, if the market catches collective sanity over the intervening months, and the shares swoon, far less capital will be at risk, as 12% of capital is obviously less than 100% of capital. Thus, for those who remain unconvinced by the arguments presented so far, I strongly recommend at least switching to calls.Even a bull acknowledges that the company must change significantly in order to become mission critical for customers. That presents risk to investors. While the barriers to entry are high, and the company has sold well for years, those sales aren’t yet turned into the source of returns for shareholders, namely free cash flows. In spite of a history of losses, and the fact that there’s a disconnect between where the company is and where it needs to be, the market continues to bid the shares higher. In my view, the way to “play” this dynamic is with call options. Using calls, investors can access the future stock returns at far less risk. Achieving returns at lower risk is the essence of investing in my view, and I strongly urge investors to consider this approach."

The cloud content management company has always been an interesting stock since first going public back in 2015. Some stock weakness is likely justified due to ongoing signs of competitive threats hurting growth, but a 10% hit is another opportunity to buy the dip here.Image Source: Box websiteRevenue growth re-accelerating to 21% is difficult to get excited about due to billings growth being stuck at a rate of only 17%. Billings growth hit this level for the second consecutive quarter, so the market is now concerned about a pattern forming. Even worse, the company guided to single-digit billings growth in the current quarter with a rebound in FQ4 to roughly 25%.The numbers don't support the consensus view that revenue growth will rebound up to around the 21% rate next fiscal year. The consensus estimates require a 120 basis point re-acceleration in revenues to reach that target and clearly the nearly 10% drop in the stock is based on fears that this isn't going to occur.For its part, Box continues to suggest that moving up the enterprise scale with partners will lead to larger deals in the future. These deals are taking longer to close and will in theory provide a big boost to billings and hence revenues in FQ4.Per CFO Dylan Smith on the earnings call:Until the company closes the 400 basis point gap between billings and FY20 revenue forecasts, the stock is likely to trade weak. Box has plenty of excuses with a change in developer fees and billings prepayments last year, but the market usually fears the worst and assumes the issues are actually competition.The market is likely overplaying the weak guidance as perceived lowered FQ3 EPS is overlooked for maintained full-year numbers. The company consistently beats EPS estimates suggesting guidance at a loss of $0.08 to $0.07 will end up right at analyst estimates of $0.06 loss. The end result is that Box will likely beat the currently expected $0.18 loss for the year.Cash flows continue to improve, and this has always been a big part of the value equation. The key to any tech story is typically more about whether the company generates positive cash flows versus a reported net loss. Does the company generate money every day it is open or is it burning cash drastically alters my investment thesis and reason for staying bullish here.With billings growth of 17%, Box can continue to boost existing cash flows. Even in the traditionally weak FQ3, the cloud content management company reduced the free cash flow loss by 500 basis points. The end result was that free cash flow burn improved by $4.6 million in the quarter.Source: Box FQ2'18 presentationFor these reasons, Box turns obviously cheap on these dips below $24. A cloud software company constantly moving towards AI with its Box Skills product is rather cheap at an EV/S multiple below 5x.BOX data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that the market clearly fears that Dropbox (DBX) is slowly moving up the value chain and stealing customers that caps growth at Box. Some of the fears are likely justified, but the stock is too cheap for the reality of the competitive threats with Box moving into larger enterprise deals that Dropbox can't match.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4196029,104662,2018-08-07T15:55:52-04:00,"Box shares have seen nice growth over the last year, although laced with high volatility.Box's focus on large enterprises allows them to take advantage of customers with complicated IT architectures with several cloud providers.If Box wants to create a moat, it will need to start offering additional products to expand its value offerings to customers.Doing so will allow Box to take advantage of vendor lock-in, or becoming operation critical, which will allow them to begin seeing competitive advantages.Risk-averse investors should wait until Box has released value expanding additions before entering into a position.","Box Inc. (BOX) has seen the large share price fluctuations that are typical of growth companies that are not profitable but also around a 15% growth in share price. Valuations for growth companies are not always easy, but valuation is not the first step. Investors need to understand the business model of the company. Is the growth sustainable? What must they do to survive? All of these questions need to be answered for Box.There is not going to be quick and clear answers for Box. However, I hope to outline how Box has the foundations created to start building a moat and what still needs to be accomplished before risk averse investors should begin to consider valuating and entering into a position.Box already has their foot-in-the-door for several large enterprises. They support over 85,000 businesses and 69% of the Fortune 500 companies. Large enterprises will be the key for Box to succeed. A study by Veritas suggests that enterprises will continue to rely on multiple cloud providers. Multiple cloud providers are a key factor for vendor-neutral solutions, such as Box. Vendors tend to offer several products that coexist with their cloud, but most of these solutions are only available once you already use their cloud infrastructure, and their add-ons only work for their vendor-specific products. This means a company may need to pay for the same product twice, through two different cloud providers. This allows vendor-neutral Box to survive and grow.Source: Veritas (Study)The study also found that customers rely on these cloud providers for data management. However, this should not be the case. Most cloud agreements push these responsibilities on to the consumers, which allows Box to coexist with these cloud vendors. Although the cloud vendors themselves may offer another product for this, Box provides a vendor-free solution, allowing storage to occur in one place.Source: Veritas (Study)Box operates on the SaaS model, which also has a foot-in-the-door element. Box’s main product is a cloud content management service called Box Platform. From their website,The highlights of Box’s business model are that they offer a vendor-neutral solution, which provides a single interface for a business to interact with all of their cloud and software service providers, as well as industry specific solutions, which allow for product differentiation but also lead to higher specialization costs.But this is their current business model. Box’s future will depend on how they can expand their business model. With a large customer base already, Box will need to become operation critical for a customer. By offering one software solution, they leave themselves open for a large cloud provider to create their own solutions, or for another start-up to create a similar offering at a better cost. Add-ons will be the key for Box. Additional features that add value for their customers, raise the prices that Box can charge, and take steps to become operation critical to their customers. By operation critical, I mean that their customers will rely on Box’s products to the point that there will be operational disruptions if a customer were to decide to end their Box partnership, aka vendor lock-in.In order to become operation critical, Box will have to rely on new products that expand upon Box Platform. Some of the current offerings are listed below.Source: Box IR (Presentation)Box KeySafe and Box Governance are both security additions, with the former providing encryption tools, and the latter providing regulatory services. When combined with Box Zones (service to store data in certain geographical areas), which expanded due to a Microsoft (MSFT) partnership, these offerings provide customers with solutions to the General Data Privacy Regulations rules and allow customers to embrace new data privacy regulations as well. Entrusting these services to follow new regulations is an excellent first step towards becoming operation critical.Box Relay is a solution to streamline processes, and the GxP offering is for healthcare consumers. But the product offering that investors need to follow is Box Skills.Box Skills is Box’s offering to incorporate AI and analytics to their ecosystem. This is their first product offering that truly expands their main business of content management. Box handles a lot of data from their consumers, and the basic value proposition is that by using Box Skills, you have one analytics tool that analyzes data from all sources, rather than relying on vendor specific tools. Box Skills is still in beta and is partnered with IBM (IBM) and Microsoft to leverage their AI capabilities into one tool. Between Box Skills’ data access, and IBM’s and Microsoft’s additional analytics technology, Box Skills has a good foundation to be the first product offering that truly expands beyond content management.It also has the benefit of not needing to beat similar solutions such as Alteryx (AYX) and Qlikview, vendor-neutral solutions, because Box Skills can be sold as an additional feature to the customer’s current Box partnership. Since data is already integrated inside Box Platform, Box Skills can analyze data as it moves through Box Platform, whereas competitors such as Alteryx would need to create a data pipeline that goes through their own applications. As long as Box Skills is as good as these competitors, Box should be able to see respectable acquisition rates. Please note that since Box Skills is not released yet, some features may be changed.Box also sells themselves as an easy, one platform solution. As Box expands, they will also need to focus on quality products that are not only valuable to their customers but also provide simple integration with all types of data sources, along with an easy to use UI/UX component as well. Box Skills will only be the first step though. Box will need to add more features to continue their path towards becoming operation critical, which will be what they need to create a moat.Investors should note that Box will be relying on innovations to grow, which presents several risks, such as wasted R&D spend, product offerings that don’t provide value, other companies offering innovative solutions faster etc. Although Box has mitigation plans for these, it should still be noted that investing in a company that needs to create new products to grow (and survive) carries high risk, especially when the company is not profitable yet.Box can also see one of the major cloud providers begin to target market share of the company. Just because cloud providers have not yet made a major push to create vendor-neutral solutions does not mean this will continue. Vendors have tried to get their customers to use their platforms and their add-ons while offering limited flexibility to other vendors, but if this changes, then Box will likely lose market share.Also, if Box cannot grow their product offerings fast enough, they will be at risk from other start-ups that can offer cloud management solutions as well. They are also at risk of similar companies, such as Dropbox (DBX), becoming direct competitors as well.As mentioned throughout this article, Box will need to continue to add product offerings to expand their ecosystem. If they are unable to do this, they will not be able to have a moat and will likely not be able to fend off current or new competitors.However, Box has made some interesting deals in the past. Their partnerships with Google (GOOG)(GOOGL), Microsoft, and IBM may give investors a hint that cloud providers may be deciding that the capital spent to create a solution similar to Box is too great, and they’ve decided to cooperate and partner with Box instead. Microsoft becoming a partner with Box Skills, when they have their own Power BI product is particularly telling.As mentioned before, Box is not profitable. However, investors still have a few key metrics they should consider for high growth, negative earnings companies. The metrics that I believe are critical are revenue growth, gross margin (path to profitability), FCF positive, P/S (valuation), and churn rate. Outstanding numbers in any of these categories will not make investors bullish, but bad numbers should worry investors.Source: Box IR, Yahoo Finance for P/SAs you can see, Box gives us no warning signs in its financials for a company in its situation. Revenue growth remains high, which gives investors an idea of the base growth of the company with their current products, outside of the yet to be released Box Skills. Billings and deferred revenue are also growing steadily, with billings increasing by 17%, and deferred revenue is up 28%. With their current product offerings, growth numbers are representing Box’s ability to continue to establish their customer base using their Box Platform offering, which will increase the potential market for Box Skills and other future add-ons.Gross margin is above 70%, which measures the future path to profitability for Box. However, Box is still seeing a negative GAAP operating margin of – 34%. Box’s focus is to grow revenue, and they plan on shifting to earnings growth in the next few years. It should be recognized that investing in companies that aren’t profitable on a GAAP basis is inherently risky, and investors should understand this risk before diving into their expenses and financial strategies.With this said, Box’s financials support their goal to become operation critical to their customers. As explained above, Box’s key to success will be based on their ability to expand their value offerings and creating an ecosystem that moves beyond cloud content management. In the financials, we will either need to see large cash reserves, or large R&D spend to support this. The reason is that new products, or innovations, will require either development time (R&D) or acquisitions (cash balance). Although Box has been able to create several partnerships with mega-cap companies, they will still need to have the core development of new add-ons in place. For Box, we see their strategy will be R&D expenses.Box will likely focus on internal innovation rather than acquisition. Box currently holds slightly above $200 million in cash and has very low, yet positive, FCF margins (5%). Box is likely choosing this strategy either because they believe it will be cheaper to develop new products in house and through partnerships, or that there are little opportunities to acquire other companies with their current resources. Regardless, we see a core reason for negative operating margin in R&D.Source: Box IR, Calculated by AuthorR&D margin will remain high for the next few years, but investors will be expecting new product releases to accompany these expenses. Although investors would not be able to measure R&D efficiency, they should be expecting new product announcements on a semi-regular basis in order to justify this spend. With the current rate of product offerings, I do not see R&D margin being a risk as of yet, but this can change quickly.Sales and marketing expenses are extraordinarily high, over 50% as a percent of revenue. Investors should expect to see this number decrease over the next few quarters, as sales expenses are cheaper when adding products to a current subscription, versus getting new customers. With a customer base and business model that rely on large enterprises with multiple cloud vendors, these marketing expenses reflect the costs associated with converting large companies into customers.Investors should expect R&D margins to remain relatively stable and sales and marketing margins to decrease YoY. Else, investors will need to hear a good reason why these costs do not align with the corporate strategy.With growing companies that are not profitable, valuations become tricky. Investors cannot rely on P/E or PEG ratios and are left with comparing P/S and quarterly revenue growth YoY values. Below, I will compare these multiples with other vendor-neutral companies, which include Dropbox, Alteryx, and Okta (OKTA).Source: Yahoo FinanceBox’s current P/S ratios don’t stick out as being greatly undervalued, as they reflect a good value for current revenue growth. However, Box’s future will depend on product add-ons and innovative offerings. Success from Box Skills should see revenue growth increase, along with the release of new product offerings. Because there have been very few new offerings released with Box’s platform, I expect the valuation to increase closer to a 10 P/S (similar to Dropbox), assuming a successful release of Box Skills, and the associated increase in revenue.But there are a lot of assumptions for investors to have. As it currently stands, a 6.77 P/S does not suggest an overvalued thesis but also not currently undervalued enough to present an opportunity. However, bullish investors that expect Box to see continued success with product add-ons and the establishment of an operation critical platform, should be excited to see this valuation, as a successful implementation could increase revenue growth, along with a rise in the P/S metric as well.Again, investors likely will not be determined to buy or sell based on Box’s financials, since there are no clear warning signs, and no signs of undervalued opportunities. The main focus on Box is outlined above, which is, what do they need to do to build a moat, and can they create product offerings that position themselves as operation critical for their customers before another company enters into their market. And this all needs to be done relatively quickly, before alternative enterprise software solutions can be created, or the company needs to switch strategies due to continued unprofitability.Without positive earnings, investors are left with very few metrics to value Box. This is where business model analysis comes in. For most investors, waiting to see Box achieve some success in expanding their product offerings is likely the best move. For long-term investors, waiting for the release of Box Skills, along with how it performs, could provide a sign that Box can survive in the industry. This should be seen as an investment where you wait to see the moat start to take shape, not just see the foundations. Basically, better to be late than to be wrong.But for investors that are able to take on the extra risk, or are firm believers that this vendor neutral solution will greatly reduce IT complexity and want to bet that Box will be able to expand their offerings, I believe their current valuation allows for nice risk/reward investment and should start considering starting a position on a drop.Disclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

4190110,104556,2018-07-25T16:19:39-04:00,"Box is a company that still has an image problem.The optionality Box Skills presents may force investors to look at this name more closely.Box is no longer just a simple content management system, it is fairly innovative.","Box (NYSE:BOX), maker of content management software, has a reputation for being an undifferentiated storage platform, but the company is innovative and it trades for a reasonable valuation.At this year’s Sohn Conference, Social Capital’s CEO presented Box as a top idea. The thesis was based on Box being a visionary in artificial intelligence. When I hear about Box, I surely don’t think of AI and I’d bet that’s the case for most other investors.But the reason why Box was picked at Sohn was because of an innovation that is still in beta testing. It is called Box Skills. Box Skills hasn’t even been officially released yet and people are talking about how big and important it will be. It might pay to listen.Essentially, Box Skills strengthens the value proposition for Box’s content management system. Using AI, videos can be automatically indexed so you can search for a word or phrase. Same with pictures and audio. And third-party developers will be able to build certain skills into the platform. Think of it as an AI ecosystem for business to make use of what was once stagnant data. In other words, it allows you to make sense out of data right there in your content management system. Rather than have to aggregate it all and compile it in a data lake and then maybe use Hadoop and spin data up into the cloud, you can effectively use Box Skills. Now that reality is probably years away, but it is a very promising idea.This is what the CEO said on the last earnings call when asked about Box Skills:If Box becomes a standard for third-party development within this space, it could grow into a huge company. But alas, this is speculation. To provide some more concrete evidence of Box’s innovation, check out the chart below.Source: Q1 PresentationIn the last four or so years, the company has released five additional products besides Box Skills. Box has gone from an undifferentiated, poor-man’s enterprise-facing DropBox (NASDAQ:DBX), to a supposed AI visionary. That is surely not an easy transition. But the valuation does not quite reflect the situation.In the latest quarter, revenues grew 20% to $140 million, gross margins came in around 73%, and non-GAAP operating losses shrank from 14% of sales a year ago to most recently 7%.Moreover, churn was reported at 4.5%, a sign that enterprises are happy using Box. This is one advantage of selling to enterprises. Since they spend so much, they rarely switch software systems. But then again, the sales cycles are much longer.The expansion rate was 113%, meaning that innovative product attachments are selling well. That is a good sign considering that leaves considerable room for expansion within Box’s 60 million registered users, 10 million of which are counted as paying customers.The company’s enterprise value is about $3.5 billion, after backing out about $200 million in cash from the market cap. On a forward basis, sales estimates have 2019 sales at $605 million. So the forward EV/sales ratio is under 6x, a bargain compared to some other cloud-based SaaS companies. However, considering relatively muted 20% sales growth, not a screaming bargain in its own right (crazy that 20% can be considered muted these days). Then again, if Box Skills starts contributing meaningfully to sales, we could likely see growth rates accelerate.The company plays in a crowded space. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), of course, offer Office 365 and G Suite, respectively. These are certainly the biggest cloud-based content managers by far, but Box has seemed to carve out a niche. Even Gartner (NYSE:IT) has named Box a leader in the latest Magic Quadrant. It is difficult, from the outside, to see where Box fits in, but apparently, the superior capabilities and ease of use differentiate the platform enough.If Box doesn’t continue to innovate, its image will stay the way it is now; a company that will soon get squeezed by Google Docs. Pricing power is important when there are such great alternatives, but an analyst pointed out that Box has shown its strength in this space:The analyst’s comment made it seem obvious that Box was a leader in this space. I’m not quite so sure that is the mindset of the majority of investors out there. However, at 6x forward sales, it's evidence that the image is slowly changing.Box is a name that is at an inflection point. Some investors think the company is a glorified cloud-storage company. Hopefully, Box Skills will go a long way to change that. I believe that Box is underrated in terms of innovation and the valuation is reasonable. Though a lot of the thesis is riding on the company's AI transition, I think investors would do well to put Box on their watchlist.Author’s Note: Please scroll up and hit the big, orange ""Follow"" button so you can get these articles before they hit the paywall.

4180222,20521,2018-06-07T19:05:58-04:00,"Box's first quarter revenues grew 20% over the year to $140.5 million, ahead of the market's expectations of $139.7 million.Adjusted earnings for the quarter came in at a loss of $0.07 per share, better than the $0.08 loss per share anticipated by the market.At the end of the quarter, Box had nearly 85,000 paying customers.","According to a report published earlier this year, the global cloud storage market is estimated to grow from $30.70 billion in 2017 to $88.91 billion by 2022, translating to an annual growth rate of 23.7% over the five-year period. The robust industry growth is translating into stellar performance by Billion-Dollar Unicorn players like Box (NYSE:BOX).Box's first quarter revenues grew 20% over the year to $140.5 million, ahead of the market's expectations of $139.7 million. Adjusted earnings for the quarter came in at a loss of $0.07 per share, better than the $0.08 loss per share anticipated by the market. Its billings grew to $116.7 million, better than the Wall Street estimate of $113.1 million. The company added nearly 3,000 paying customers during the quarter, including names like Dubai Airports and Komatsu. At the end of the quarter, Box had nearly 85,000 paying customers.Despite the stellar performance, the market was not too pleased as it is worrying about slowing growth rates. A year ago, Box had delivered 27% in revenue growth.For the current quarter, Box forecast revenues of $146-$147 million, and a net loss of $0.06-$0.05 per share. The Street had forecast revenues of $146.1 million and a loss of $0.07 per share. Box expects to end the year with revenues of $603-$608 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of ($0.19)-($0.16). The Street is looking for revenues of $606.4 million with a non-GAAP loss of $0.18 per share.To drive growth, Box is focused on two key objectives - innovating in cloud content management and advancing its global go-to market efforts to reach more enterprises around the world. Within product innovation, it made the Box Drive product generally available in the quarter. Box Drive offers a simple way to stream all files in Box right to the desktop, thus eliminating the need for legacy on-premises network file shares. It also initiated the beta for its new Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Suite integration and the general availability of the new integration with Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) productivity suite iWork.Within enterprise customers, Box is seeing strong demand for its Workflow product Box Relay, which has been developed jointly with IBM (NYSE:IBM). It's continuing to develop additional automation features for repeatable business processes within Box to help simplify the customer's collaboration needs.Within its advanced enterprise-grade security and compliance capabilities, Box also introduced several updates to help industries move to the cloud. It released Box Admin Insights Dashboard for administrators. The platform offers visibility into key collaboration and security insights. It also released metadata-driven retention as a part of Box Governance, so that enterprises can see increased flexibility and control over their data.To drive its global go-to market efforts, Box is focusing on growing average contract value, strengthening relationships with existing customers and adding new logos through international growth. It saw significant growth in Japan with wins like Mitsubishi Motor Corporation, Hitachi Technologies, and Pokémon.Earlier this month, Box announced the acquisition of Progressly, a workflow software company, for an undisclosed sum. Redwood City-based Progressly was founded in 2014 and has raised $6 million in funding so far. The acquisition is expected to help improve Box's workflow offering as it will be able to build workflows that not only run within Box, but also integrate with external workflow engines like Pega and Nintex and build more complex automation tools and services.Box already has been improving its workflow offering through its partnership with IBM. IBM has also helped Box expand its market reach. But given the deep foundation that the two companies are laying together, I wouldn't be surprised if IBM itself plans on acquiring Box.The stock is trading at $26.71 with a market capitalization of $3.72 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $28.68 in May this year. It has recovered from a 52-week low of $17.25 it had fallen to in August last year."
4183710,90055,2018-06-25T10:14:52-04:00,"Big data is one of the great trends of this decade.While Box competes with many big name companies, no one has the data that Box has.Even under conservative estimates, Box has the potential to double within five years.","Box (BOX) is a small cloud content management company with a market cap under $4 billion. The company cites its main competitors as Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), and Dropbox (DBX). Those three companies have a combined market cap over $1.5 trillion, making Box the small fish in a big pond. And yet, I would say this company has one key competitive advantage that could make this small company a sneaky pick for the long term.By this point in time, most of us are becoming very familiar with the term ""big data"". But let's take a quick trip down memory lane. I got my start on computers back when we were still using floppy discs, which could only handle mere kilobytes of data. Then came cd's that could store hundreds of megabytes, followed by flash drives with gigabytes. Now we are getting more and more used to throwing around terms like ""terabyte"" and ""petabyte"", although, to me, they still don't quite feel like real words yet.According to the chart below, in 2017 the world generated 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day -- numbers utterly unthinkable in the floppy disc days.Source: Data Never Sleeps 5.0 | DomoHowever impressive the current data creation is, we are nowhere close to peak data. Just seven years from now, it is expected that there will over 163 zettabytes of data created every year. For perspective, ""only"" 40 zettabytes will be created next year. With these data forecasts, 2023 will make 2018 look like the floppy disc days by comparison. As more data drivers such as wearable technology, driver-less cars, and the internet of things continue to come online, it appears to be an unstoppable trend that will greatly impact our future. As more data is created, the problem arises of data storage. This rising tide is a boom for memory fabrication companies such as Micron Technology (MU) and is why I picked up shares of the stock. But the issue of data storage doesn't only benefit those fabricating the memory. It also benefits the cloud storage companies. Enter little ol' Box to this conversation.Many investors might compare service users and count Box at an extreme disadvantage in the cloud space. Consider that Dropbox has over 500 million registered users, of which over 11 million are paying customers. Box is around a mere tenth the size with only 59.9 million registered users, yet over 10 million are paying customers.Earlier when I mentioned the combined market cap of Box's competitors, the statistic is a little misleading since not all of Microsoft or Google's revenue is cloud related. However, when it comes to Microsoft, in the last quarter it reported commercial cloud revenue of $6 billion, server products and cloud service revenue of $6.3 billion, and its intelligent cloud segment hit $7.9 billion. Google's quarterly cloud revenue is also up over $1 billion.With all these monstrous figures, how could I possibly see a competitive advantage for Box? Well, it comes down to the type of customer Box is attracting. It has nearly 10 million paying users. But when we break that down further we see that it has 82,000 paying enterprise customers. According to Box's annual report, it now serves 69% of Fortune 500 companies. While already implied by the term ""Fortune 500"", I just want to underline that these are huge customers Box is serving. Multi-billionaire dollar empires like Procter & Gamble (PG) and McDonald's (MCD) all use Box for their cloud needs. Even massive private companies like Airbnb and Uber call Box home.*From Annual ReportAs you can see, the company continues to sign up new paying users at a double digit pace, but just as important the company is retaining the customers it acquires. If you're wondering how the retention rate can be better than 100%, it's because not only is Box retaining customers but those customers are spending more money as time goes on.BOX Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThis reality of keeping customers who are paying more with time is contributing to massive improvements in Box's free cash flow.Offering a cloud storage solution is a business model with several benefits. First and foremost as a subscription service, revenue is recurring. Also, the profit margin in this business is stellar. Box is guiding for between 73%-74% gross margin this year. But just offering a storage service is not a very lofty business goal. It gives people and companies a place to put their data... but what if it could offer to harness the power of the unstructured data?That's where artificial intelligence solutions come in, and where Google already excels. Consider its translate program that can translate text through your phone's camera.Lost in Translation no more with Word Lens in JapaneseThis is made possible first and foremost by massive amounts of data. It's data on the languages and the writing system. There's also Google's Photo AI applications. If you have pictures of your dog in Google Photos and you want to look at them, just type dog into the search. It's not necessary to have previously labeled the picture as containing a dog. Google's AI has simply ""learned"" what a dog looks like. Again, this AI application was made possible by massive amounts of data of how a dog looks.Now, here's where we segue to talk about Box's overlooked competitive advantage. While Google (and Microsoft for that matter) may have superb artificial intelligence applications that help individual consumers sort through their massive piles of data, they aren't as well positioned to offer AI solutions to enterprises. That's because the data is already with Box.Helping companies organize their unstructured data is taking Splunk (SPLK) and its shareholders on a nice vertical ride. The company's revenue and free cash flow have steadily increased over the last five years. SPLK Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsBox and Splunk differ in key ways. First, Splunk deals primarily with machine generated data as opposed to human generated data. Second, Splunk is primarily a software company whereas Box offers cloud storage. These reasons are why Box itself does not cite Splunk as a competitor.However a similarity that exists is that both companies are aiming to help companies make valuable use of their data. Box Skills is a new service that marks a major jump into using artificial intelligence to help its customers mine the value in their data. It's still very early in the game for Box, with a lot of unknowns when it comes to the use of artificial intelligence. However, should the company get it right, this will be an enormous driver for growth. Existing customers will continue to stay if they are gaining valuable insights from their data. Existing customers will also be spending more money with Box, as Skills (and other future AI applications) will be an add-on to the cloud storage. And finally, customers gaining valuable insight from their data will attract more customers to the service.While there are unknowns, I like Box's chances of success in this space due to the amount of enterprise data it possesses. Artificial intelligence value harnessing solutions is undoubtedly the correct direction for the company, and its competitive advantage of already having the data sets it up for success.So, we've seen that Box is doing a great job at playing a somewhat niche role of being a cloud solution for enterprises. The big data it has from these companies is what I consider to be its competitive advantage. We've also seen from the retention rates over 100%, that Box is doing a good job up-selling services with time, which I believe will only get better now as it moves into more artificial intelligence solutions.What does this mean for the stock? Let's circle back to two metrics we already looked at: billings and retention rate. Box defines these terms in its financial statements. Retention rate essential refers to comparable customer spending, while billings includes the retention rate but additionally accounts for new customers. However, billings is different from revenue because revenue can be choppy depending on how a customer wishes to pay -- lump sum vs payments. Since billings includes retention rate, I want to focus on billings. Now, we've already seen that this company has averaged 34% annual billing growth over the past three years, and billings accelerated last year. But let's get bearish in our assumptions and assume that billings drop to 15% growth next year, and drop 1% additionally each year for the following four years.In this bearish outlook scenario, Box could be pulling in nearly $1 billion in revenue five years from now. And just to be clear, this is extremely bearish. At Box's annual conference in 2017 -- called BoxWorks -- the company itself guided for over $1 billion in annual revenue by the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Given how Box reports earnings, the third quarter of fiscal 2021 should come by October of 2020, just a little more than two years from now.Now let's also assume that Box's valuation appreciates and gets more inline with its peers. After all, billings growth over 10% is still a fast growing business by most standards.BOX PS Ratio (Annual) data by YChartsGiven where the market is willing to value companies like Splunk and Dropbox, it's not outrageous to think that Box could trade at 10 times revenue. In our bearish scenario, if five years from now the company is bringing in nearly $1 billion in revenue and is valued at 10 times revenue, we're looking at a (get out your calculators) $10 billion market cap. That roughly translates to $80/share -- up around 200% from today's price. Important to note that even if Box never gets any love and continues to trade at its current valuation of seven times sales, the stock could still trade for over $55/share, which would still be more than a double. For these reasons, I'm making Box my fifth pick for my Double Five Portfolio. I'll be looking to add shares as soon as permitted under Seeking Alpha's disclosure policy.One final note. I see significant upside from today's stock price around $27/share. But I do want to point out that the stock has a high beta of 1.33. It might be possible to wait for a dip in stock price to initiate a position. However, I don't personally wish to risk missing this stock for a slightly better entry point. I'm personally ok with the swings, because I'm in for the long haul."
4192436,104579,2018-07-31T12:07:01-04:00,Box shares have come off recent highs and offer an entry point for new investors.The company has a growing stream of recurring revenue and retains many large customers.As the company expands its offerings it will generate more revenue per customer.Box has a long runway for growth and offers a way to invest in the growing IT space.,"Source: BoxAfter a run up to almost $30 a share, (BOX) shares have pulled back and now offer a compelling opportunity for new investors. The company offers cloud services and allows its customers' employees to work safely and efficiently from anywhere. The company works with many applications currently used by large corporations and has attracted more than 85k customers by offering solutions its competitors do not. With more and more enterprises spending money on the information and technology space, Box should continue to grow rapidly.Earlier this year in the end of April, Box shares jumped from around $21 per share to almost $30.BOX data by YChartsThis came from the news that Chamath Palihapitiya pitched Box as his best investment idea. For those who aren't familiar with Chamath, he has quite the successful history of investing in the tech space. At 28, in 2004, Palihapitiya was the youngest vice president of AOL, heading its instant messaging division. In 2007 he joined Facebook (FB), which was then a little more than a year old. Palihapitiya worked at Facebook to increase its user base. Palihapitiya made investments on the side while still employed at Facebook, including in Plantir, Pure Storage (PSTG), Playdom which was acquired by Disney (DIS), and Bumptop bought by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). He currently runs his own fund called Social Capital, which continues to make investments in the tech space. Based on his successful track record and inside knowledge of the industry, it is safe to say he really has an edge. So once he pitched the idea of Box, its shares instantly popped higher.Currently, shares offer an interesting value. While growth seems to be decelerating, it is based on the law of large numbers. The company has grown revenue from $303 million in 2016 to a potential run rate for $605 million. This is 100% growth in two years.The company also is cash flow positive, which means it can now invest back into the growth of the business.Source: 10QThe company has a strong balance sheet with $217.1 million in cash and $66.9 million in debt, leaving it with a positive cash position of $150.2 million.The company can continue to make tuck in acquisitions that will help it acquire new customer relationships as well as new technology offerings. In fact, the company has been acquiring small start ups such as Progressly and Butter.ai. Progressly had a team of 12 and the company offered a work flow product that will be integrated with Relay, a similar product from Box. Butter.ai connects marketing campaigns with work related apps for live up to date information and feedback. This lets the user know if something they are marketing actually has an effect with a specific customer, or if it is achieving the goals they had hoped for.What is nice about the acquisitions is that they are small in nature, with both aforementioned companies raising less than $10 million in seed funding. They have small staff and are easily integrated. The company is purchasing new technology that enables its business model to be better then competition and does it with a low cost method. This shows smart use of capital by management.The company is still not generally profitable, but investors should be okay waiting as it should get there soon. As we noted earlier, free cash flow is more important at this time. The company should be able to continue to fund its operations without taking on more debt. Shares offer a compelling value to investors looking for a company that offers technology infrastructure to the corporate enterprise.As Box continues to launch new products and cross sell to its customers, revenue should grow.Source: Investor PresentationThe more solutions the company offers, the more intriguing it becomes to potential customers. Selling a company on integrating and investing in a whole new platform is not an easy pitch. The company has to make a large investment in training and implementing the product for employees. The return on investment must be worthwhile, and its of greater benefit to offer more solutions to the customer. As we can see below this has been working well.Source: Sohn PresentationThe company continues to reach more and more customers in the Fortune 500, solidifying its position in the market.Not only does the company earn new business, it generates even better customer retention.While Box already has low customer churn, the more it offers to its customers the more protection the company has. This also protects it from competitors having any advantage over its offerings.What is more interesting is that the company could easily be acquired. With a market cap of only $3.4 billion, a large player like Microsoft (MSFT), (IBM), or Salesforce (CRM), might be interested in adding this company to their portfolio. Since many of the customers are over lapping they would be able to further seal their current customer relationships. If the company continues to generate positive cash flow it could become of more interest to an acquirer.I recently added Box to my portfolio on the pull back. The company deserves a spot in a growth investor's portfolio, as the company has yet to full reach its potential. Whether as a potential acquisition target or a growth story, the share price should see continued price appreciation. Once the company shows consistent and positive earnings, we could see a rapid rise in the share price. As the company continues to compound earnings we could see a great return on investment. In the mean time the company should continue to add value to its brand with small tech acquisitions. This will continue to add great talent with product innovation all at a low price. Should the fundamental story change at all, then investors must revisits the thesis. In the mean time any purchase below $25 a share should offer positive long term returns for those willing to wait."
4187367,103480,2018-07-15T23:19:23-04:00,"Sentiment on Box has been poor since its Q1 earnings release showed a deceleration in revenue growth and a miss on billings.The burden of proof is on Box to show that its second-half billings will improve, as CFO Dylan Smith suggested on last quarter's earnings call.A slew of improvements to Box Skills and its related AI capabilities, as well as high-profile beta signups for the module, is highly encouraging.In addition, Gartner named Box a Leader in the Content Collaboration space for the fifth consecutive year.Shares still trade at a deep discount to recent IPO rival Dropbox.","Sentiment on Box (BOX) probably hasn't been as cautious as in 2015, when Box's high loss margins scared investors into thinking the company's longevity was limited, despite high growth. Now, the problem seems to be the opposite - in its last quarter release, which sent shares toppling, Box was able to make tremendous improvements in its operating margin, but at the cost of growth. The company's top-line growth fell beneath 20% (though only by a hair, at 19.9%) for the first time in its lifetime as a public company, and billings growth of 17% cast an equally sour light on growth potential for the remainder of the year.With optimism for the company so weak, it's a good time to review the bullish case for Box - as well as the recent updates, specifically on the product side, that still render Box a top-tier software investment. I was cautious myself after Box's weak Q1 earnings, but after recent announcements touting the progress of Box Skills (which I believe to be Box's biggest differentiator and long-term growth driver) and new partnerships with Microsoft (MSFT) and IBM (IBM), I am far more willing to bet on a recovery for this company.Earnings will be a critical turning point for Box. Last quarter, Box's co-founder and CFO Dylan Smith noted that the billings weakness in the first quarter of the year would be corrected in the second half of the year, due to higher-profile deals pushing out. Here's a refresher on the comment:With so many aggressive product improvements happening over the past few weeks, Smith's position that customers are deferring their purchases is highly believable. Ultimately, I see a price target of 6.5x EV/FY19 revenues for Box that can be attained after the perception of weak billings can be cleared, implying a $30 target and 15% upside from current levels.The primary driver behind the bullish case for Box has always been its valuation. Box has perennially traded at a valuation multiple far below the average SaaS peer. In the past, investors have cited a multitude of reasons why that should be the case - higher loss margins, low-differentiation product, etcetera. These reasons have since backfired, as Box now generates positive free cash flow and has vastly improved its margins, as well as added new AI capabilities that clearly distinguish the Box platform from competing offerings like Google Drive and Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX).The distinction to Dropbox deserves further mention. Despite a virtually identical business model (with some puts and takes on either side: Dropbox has more consumer users and higher growth/free cash flow than Box, but Box touts AI and enterprise-grade functions that Dropbox is far from being able to replicate), Dropbox has always traded at a significantly higher valuation multiple than Box. As most investors know, last month, Dropbox experienced a phantom surge up to $40 on little news, only to come crashing back down to the low $30s where it has traded for most of this year.DBX data by YChartsStill, at Dropbox's current share price of $32, the company has a market cap of $14.3 billion, and an enterprise value of $13.4 billion (after netting out about $850 million of balance sheet cash). This puts Dropbox's valuation at a rich 10.0x EV/FY19 revenues, based on the company's own guidance range of $1.33-1.35 billion in revenues (+21% y/y).Box, on the other hand, is trading at a much more modest multiple. With a current market cap at $3.60 billion, Box carries an enterprise value of $3.43 billion, after netting out $217 million of cash and adding $40 million of debt as of Box's Q1 balance sheet. Against Box's FY19 revenue guidance range of $603-608 million (+20% y/y), this represents a valuation of 5.7x EV/FY19 revenues. This is despite the fact that Dropbox and Box's growth ranges have virtually converged to the same number (~20%) this year, so Dropbox bulls can no longer argue a growth premium. If Box were trading at Dropbox's 10x revenue multiple, it would be worth $46 per share (or nearly twice its current price). This is why a price target at 6.5x forward revenues doesn't seem too outlandish.To further the distinction between Box and Dropbox, note as well the tremendous progress that Box has made on the product side in Q2 - particularly with regard to Box Skills.Box Skills, in my opinion, creates a perfect distinction between the enterprise-ready Box and the consumer-oriented Dropbox. No other file-sharing company has built in AI/machine learnings capabilities anywhere close to rivaling Box's. Box Skills' ability to natively recognize content stored within the platform - whether text, video, or audio - and add intelligent tag and search features are virtually unparalleled in the industry.Box Skills has been in a limited release since its unveiling earlier in the year (and it was the primary reason why the box of Social Capital called Box a top AI pick at the Sohn Investment Conference), but this month Box broadened its release to a group of top-tier clients. Per a Box press release:In addition, Box has inked a new partnership with IBM Watson, one of the forerunners in machine learning technology (despite not being the one with the greatest market execution). Through this partnership, customers of Box Skills can make use of Watson Facial Recognition (for image recognition) and Watson Natural Language Understanding (for reading documents) for their content stored within Box. The company also announced an expanded partnership with Microsoft Azure, with expanded support for Box Skills' image and text recognition capabilities.These high-profile partnerships and customer signups further legitimize Box's advancements in AI - which, again, is a feat that few content collaboration platforms can boast of. It's worth noting as well that Box scored a top-ranked Leader distinction in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Content Collaboration Platforms for its fifth consecutive year. This ranking probably has more weight with IT buyers than any other, which adds further credence to the conviction that Box truly can pick up billings in the back half of this year.Though the outlook for Box looked weak exiting Q1, I remain positive on Box for Q2 and beyond, specifically due to robust product announcements and improvements made over the past few weeks. It's worth noting that as a feature in private beta, Box Skills has not yet been extremely accretive to Box's revenues, but that could change once it's available for wider release.In addition, Box's consistent valuation discount to Dropbox keeps us hopeful that the gap can close over time. As one of the only SaaS software stocks to trade below 6x forward revenues when the entire market looks expensive again, Box's risk-reward profile heavily favors a bullish position."

With IBM missing altogether from the picture, IBM-led business growth for BOX could be indicative of groundwork for future M&A.Client wins and stickiness have come at a cost. SaaS companies typically have large SGA expenses, leading to GAAP losses at the operating level. BOX is a step further ahead – the company has been making operational losses at the non-GAAP level. Whether the reason for these losses is the cocktail of a business model (SaaS-based delivery and leased ownership of data centers and cloud) or a competitive marketplace, the losses are unlikely to go away in the near term.Source: BOX Financial ModelThis company's business model calls into question the management’s expectations of growth.Source: BOX 2017 Analyst DayThe management expectations imply a revenue CAGR of over 25% for the next 3-4 years.

Adoption of multi-cloud management is increasing due to the growing adoption of cloud-based services and applications and driven by the Internet of Things (IoT). However, enterprises face potential hurdles while adopting multi-cloud management due to application portability on various cloud environments and regulation compliance.Box (NYSE:BOX) provides a cloud management platform that enables organisations to securely manage their content by allowing easy access from anywhere at any time. Box's main premise is that businesses in today's world have tonnes of raw unstructured data and that presents a huge opportunity for technology and AI to help to extract value and actionable information out of that data. Box has two main objectives in its bid to power the digital workplace of the future - to innovate in cloud content management and to reach and enable every business through their global go-to-market efforts.BOX data by YChartsWith its Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cloud content management platform, users are able to collaborate on content within the company and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data protection, security, and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies, and industry standards and regulations.Box currently has over 1,000 integrations with partners that include Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), IBM, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), and the list goes in. All these give users easier access to their content in Box without leaving these applications. Available tools such as Watson AI technologies from IBM is one example how enterprise content can be managed in Box. By bringing intelligence to enterprise content and by leveraging Watson to enrich that content stored in Box, businesses in every industry can accelerate their digital transformation journeys. In addition, many third-party developers have also leveraged on Box's platform to build and provide new applications.Box is the cloud content management platform for more than 69 percent of the Fortune 500. Our user base includes over 58 million registered users and as of January 31, 2018, Box had over 82,000 paying organizations.Source: Box 1Q19 Earnings Presentation Slides.Both Box and Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) have always been mixed up as going after the same customers. Box's main competitors in the cloud management market, as recognised in their 10-K, are Microsoft and Open Text (Documentum). In the enterprise file sync and share market, their primary competitors include, but are ""not limited to, Microsoft, Google, and, to a lesser extent, Dropbox"".In actual fact, in their respective annual reports, both Box and Dropbox didn't list each other as a primary competitor. The reality is that both of them are fundamentally building two very different companies.The vast majority of Dropbox's combined revenue came from consumers. Dropbox has always offered more as an attractive consumer storage tool. On the contrary, Box has built a very different business model that focuses mainly on large enterprise companies to solve much more complex problems regarding content. With increasing number of data produced every single minute, there is potentially no limit to how big the market can be.The fact that people are writing off Box and Dropbox merely as tools for storing files in the cloud when storage space has run out proves the need for further understanding of the complexity of the business. The description is more fitting to Dropbox than Box. Box is a much more formidable competitor than recognised. When analysing customers who tend to be sticky and are willing to pay more on a predictable basis, it typically isn't consumers that do that but rather the larger enterprise companies. And Box has penetrated about 69% of the Fortune 500 companies and can count on them to be a more reliable stream of annual revenue.However, there is no doubt that the market for cloud content management services is highly fragmented, rapidly evolving and extremely competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry. However, that's when the need to analyse the switching cost increases. As each company increases the volume of data placed with Box, the switching cost is increased. And there is a higher switching cost in enterprise market as compared to the consumer market.Revenue growth is at 30% CAGR and strong recurring revenue. Gross margins are pretty consistent around 73%, which gives it space for operating margins to improve over time.Source: 1Q19 Earnings Presentation SlidesThe operating margin has been increasing over the years which is good sign. However, I will not put too much emphasis on its operating margins at this stage. Box's strategy to prioritise more traction and volume to the platform first before exerting any form of pricing power. And I agree with that point. There is no doubt that Box possesses a sticky product. Expansion of its moat is more important at this stage.BOX Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsBOX Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsBOX EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsFor Box, it's better to analyse it on a yearly basis on their progress rather than be restricted to quarterly basis.Box has potential to become a multi-bagger, but it will require a lot of patience. The Box team has done well in trying to get more traction and volume of data onto the platform rather than focusing on immediate profits. As Box gets more deeply integrated into companies, it will provide a strong switching cost moat. It is always easy to focus on growth in the short term, but it is more crucial to analyse its durability.Peter Thiel mentioned in his book, Zero to One that most of a tech company's value will be in at least 10 to 15 year's time. The problem with technology companies has always been their valuation and they always seem to be valued at a premium when they are losing money. Thiel added that the reason for that premium is future cash flow. A business is evaluated on its ability to generate future cash flow. Most of the value of low growth businesses are in the near term, their profits decrease over time as their competitive edge gets competed away. Technology companies follow the opposite trajectory. They often lose money as they build their moats and network effect which could lead to delayed profits. However, its profits will come eventually in the future if its competitive moat remains intact. Therefore, near-term metrics and financial numbers may be important but they only provide a short-sighted answer; whereas qualitative analysis on the potential of its economic moat and competitive advantage is where the mispricing can potentially happen.Box remains a good opportunity for the future. Its market cap makes it cheaper to own than other companies in the similar industry. In addition, it will not be entirely a surprise for them to be an attractive acquisition target as companies will want to get a foothold into AI and data and Box ticks these boxes."

The stock recently hit an all-time high above $28 and another earnings-related dip might give investors a chance to buy on weakness.Source: Box FQ1'18 presentation The market didn't like the FQ1 report including the Rosenblatt analyst that downgraded Box to Neutral. The numbers were generally inline with expectations though billings growth of 17% wasn't that impressive.Accounting for the new revenue recognition standards of ASC 606, revenue growth was solid at 22% though the reported number was slightly below 20%. The billings weakness is likely to attract concerns that Dropbox is stealing business at the margin.  The billings growth has decelerated meaningfully from 28% in the previous quarter and 26% back in FQ3. The company is moving towards selling new products and utilizing the reseller channel to leverage partners to grow deal sizes and hence average contract values.The big advantage over Dropbox is the enterprise focus and pushing towards bigger customers is the prime opportunity to separate from the comparison. The cloud content management company with an artificial intelligence vision continues to innovate and logically moving up the enterprise ladder is logical in that scenario.The company apparently closed six $100,000 deals with IBM (IBM) and is making strides with Fujitsu (OTCPK:FJTSY) in Japan. Some of these moves into larger deals and the reseller channel will push deals into later quarters and may increase the importance of the Q4 period going forward when larger deals are typically closed.Important deferred revenue was up 28% YoY and 31%, if not for the adoption of ASC 606. Either way, Box still appears on a strong growth path. The question is more whether the value is reasonable after the rally.Box forecasts revenues in the $605 million range for this year while analysts predict $738 million next fiscal year. Naturally, the P/S multiple has risen this year with the stock up some 30% from my last bullish call. At a market cap of $3.6 billion, the forward P/S multiple is still a reasonable 5x.BOX data by YChartsA focus of this stock from the beginning has been on the cash flow generation. Box has consistently boosted free cash flow margins making the cloud content business an attractive long-term investment.The company basically doubled both cash flow from operations and FCF from last FQ1. The key FCF margin grew from 3% to 5% in the last quarter allowing Box to generate $7.3 million in the quarter, up from $3.2 million in the same period last year.Source: Box FQ1'18 presentationThe ability to grow revenues at a 20% clip and boost margins in the process will lead to substantial cash flow generation in the future.The key investor takeaway is that Box is likely to trade weak this year with the market fearing competitive threats from Dropbox. The ideal scenario is for the stock to trade back to the previous resistance that is now support around $24. Box remains a long-term play in cloud content management that is likely to produce a few weak quarters before some of the shifts into larger enterprise deals pay off and reward shareholders.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Companies like Box Inc. (BOX) have languished recently due to the fact many saw the data management industry as mature and commoditized at present. The advent of AI has completely changed the entire narrative. Now, Box is sitting in the AI catbird seat and preparing to become a high flyer, I surmise. Below I present my bull case.Box Inc. was selected as the top pick for Chamath Palihapitiya, a former member of Facebook's (FB) executive team. Chamath touted the Redwood City, California-based company Box as a buying opportunity in the burgeoning artificial intelligence space at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York a few weeks ago. Chamath stated:The venture capitalist pointed out Box's AI capabilities. Palihapitiya stated Box was his favorite idea to play the artificial intelligence trend.Chamath went on to say, ""over the next 10 to 20 years most enterprise software will need to get remade to incorporate artificial intelligence and Box is in a great position to win in this 'third wave' of computing.""I completely agree with Chamath and have had the stock on my watch list since the last year. I started my career in the audit business with Ernst & Young (now EY). I quickly realized I had a penchant for consulting and moved from the audit to the technology consulting division for the firm. Eventually, I ended up in Northern California drawn there by the .com boom of the late 90s. I feel Box will be one of the winners from this second coming of tech innovation. The increasing suite of ingenious data management products is key to the long-term growth story.Box is a leader in the cloud content management business.Source: Seeking AlphaThe company has grown revenue at a 32% CAGR since its IPO.

What's more, Box is continuously improving and adding to its incredible suite of data management products.Source: Seeking AlphaOn top of all this, the company has increased free cash flow substantially year over year.Source: Seeking AlphaEven so, when opening a position in a momentum play, I like to see a positive technical set up. The technical status looks solid for the stock at present.When buying a speculative story stock like BOX, the technical status is of utmost importance. It's all about momentum and sentiment. One of my investing mentors, CNBC's Joe Terranova, taught me the art of buying high and selling higher. It's a completely different thought process than buying beaten-down stocks at favorable valuations. When looking at speculative plays, the P/E ratio is not the major factor to consider. The technical status tells the story, and Box's current technical status looks promising.Source: TD AmeritradeThe stock has bounced off the 200-day SMA and just broke out above resistance. On top of this, the long-term technical set up looks very promising as well.Source: TD AmeritradeThe long-term chart shows that the stock has been moving from the bottom left to the upper right over the past few years. This is exactly what we want to see in a speculative momentum play. Furthermore, the stock looks cheap when compared to its closest peer Dropbox Inc. (DBX). Below is an excerpt from a recent article regarding the valuation disparity.Source: Seeking AlphaI'm happy that this comparison appears to make Box seem highly undervalued. Nevertheless, I do not put much weight on these types of bullish points. In reality, Dropbox is an entirely different animal than Box.Dropbox helps individuals manage their data, Box helps corporations manage their data. Check out this excerpt from Forbes article regarding Box's new AI product Box Skills.Source: ForbesBox Skills is what could set Box apart from the rest of the AI competition due to the fact Box already oversees data for a core base of 76,000 paying customers who combined for 30 billion files stored with Box, some with tens of millions at a time. I'd say they have a good head start.Box already has developed an AI product, Box Skills, and at present is managing enormous amounts of metadata for major corporations. I feel the stock could possibly double from here within the next 12 months. Moreover, with a market cap of just $3.5 billion, Box is a bite-sized morsel for several potential mega-cap tech buyers. Furthermore, Box is good for portfolio diversification purposes. The stock should be less affected by macro issues. I bought BOX for the portfolio at $24.21. Discovered Dividends members are up over 12% in the past week alone. This is a speculative buy with the objective of boosting the equity value of the Discovered Dividends portfolio by providing capital appreciation."
4178452,103480,2018-05-31T11:34:59-04:00,"Shares of Box tanked after reporting Q1 results.The company only narrowly beat analyst expectations, and growth decelerated below 20% y/y for the first time (though an accounting shift acted as a two-point headwind).This also was one of the only quarters in which Box has not raised its full-year guidance, sticking to a forecast of +19-20% y/y growth.Shares have become more richly valued after jumping in April and May.","Let's cut to the chase: I've been a champion of Box (BOX) for a long time, but after the company's meteoric rise in the past two months and the mediocre earnings quarter it just published, I'm far less bullish on the company. Box has, for a long time, been a consistent ""beat-and-raise"" performer - getting through each quarter with a comfortable beat margin over Wall Street's expectations and raising its outlook in turn. This quarter, not only did Box just barely inch past Wall Street's expectations as well as its own guidance range, but the company also gave a dismal outlook for Q2 and failed to raise its full-year guidance beyond its original forecast for $603-$608 million, or 19-20% y/y growth.Box has been in deceleration mode for quite some time now. Last quarter, growth had been 24%; about a year ago, growth had hovered in the 30% range. The slowdown in growth is essentially an admission that Box's scale is catching up to it, and that competition in the file-sharing space has eaten into its expansion capabilities. This slowdown in growth, of course, needs to be factored into Box's valuation and its share price.By no means is Box the most expensive SaaS stock in the market - however, it is trading at all-time highs and at a higher valuation than it has ever traded before in the past. Box stock has been in a strong rally mode since April, when the founder and CEO of Social Capital, a venture capital firm, called Box a ""top AI pick"" at the famed Sohn investment conference. That callout spurred a wave of positive coverage from Wall Street, encouraging investors to bid up Box shares. Box now trades at a 6.1x forward revenue multiple, as shown in the chart below. It's still cheaper than rival Dropbox (DBX), which debuted this year on the public markets and is currently trading around 8x forward revenues. But historically, Box shares have tended to trade around 5x forward revenues. With its growth dimming, it's difficult to justify a higher revenue valuation for the stock relative to where it traded in the past. Of course, the Box bull case doesn't rest solely on revenue growth, though revenue growth is the chief component. We have to acknowledge that Box, at its ~$600 million revenue run rate, has shifted into the largest quartile of SaaS companies and its growth will naturally slow down. Part of the Box narrative is shifting also into its cash flow generation potential, and Box did make huge strides in this regard in Q1. However, Box's free cash flow is still not ample enough to support its valuation, and its FCF margin still shows a large gap to what rival Dropbox can generate. At best, Box is now a hold. I'm still extremely bullish on the company's technology and long-term potential, but I see pressures continuing to mount on the stock if it continues to trade in the mid-20 range. Here's a look at Box's Q1 results:Figure 1. Box Q1 earningsSource: Box investor relationsTotal revenues grew 19.9% y/y to $140.5 million, the first time Box ever dipped below 20% revenue growth (though admittedly, just by a hair) and just barely inching past analyst consensus of $139.6 million (+19.1% y/y). Box's performance against expectations has continued a trend of shrinking - last quarter, revenues were just in-line. It was only several quarters ago that Box was still growing in the high 20s and surpassing analyst expectations by a few points each quarter. A dip below 20% y/y growth - especially as it's reinforced by a guidance view that calls for 19-20% y/y growth - would likely take the categorization of ""high growth"" away from Box, even if it's just a psychological threshold.It's important to note that Box's adoption of ASC 606 this quarter, along with every other software company that is affected by subscription-based revenue recognition, provided two points of headwind in the quarter. Box's 1Q17 revenue comp is based on the old accounting standard, ASC 605, against a current Q1 revenue based on ASC 606. Box also disclosed that, had ASC 605 been in place for both the current quarter and the year-ago quarter, growth would have been 22% y/y.Still, however, that doesn't help to explain why Box's billings growth has slipped to just 17% y/y - a growth rate that's equal under both ASC 606 and ASC 605. Because Box is a subscription-based company that signs deals well in advance of the revenue recognized in a single quarter, Box's billings growth rate is actually a far more important metric as it represents the company's one-year revenue pipeline. We typically want to see billings growth in excess of revenue growth to ensure that Box's revenue trajectory will remain stable - but if billings growth is three points below revenue growth, that's a strong signal that revenue growth will continue to decelerate. Dylan Smith, Box's longtime CFO and co-founder, explained away the billings shortfall by commenting that billings in the back half would rise:Box made up for the top-line disappointments somewhat with its profit improvements, however, further enhancing the view that more of Box's bull case will rest on its path toward breakeven and free cash flow expansion. GAAP operating margin in the quarter was -25.5%, a huge 860bps better than -34.1% in 1Q17. The biggest driver, naturally, was a scale-down in sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenues, Box's biggest expense category. Sales and marketing costs dipped to 54.8% of revenues in Q1, vs. 60.3% in 1Q17.Despite these opex improvements, Box's pro forma EPS of -$0.07 still only beat Wall Street expectations by a mere penny. Free cash flow grew almost 2x to $14.4 million, but the implied 10% FCF margin still comes up short relative to the FCF margins that Dropbox is able to produce.Box seems to have taken its foot off the accelerator, and with billings growth coming in below revenue growth on top of disappointing revenue guidance for FY19, the company's growth narrative is becoming harder to believe in. As for the stock, it's difficult to justify Box's ~6x revenue multiple and its premium to historical valuation when the company's growth is sinking into the high teens.Shares of Box rightly plunged 10% after posting Q1 earnings. I think there will be an opportunity to take a long position in Box again if shares dip to the $22 range, but before then, I'd stay on the sidelines."

Over the past year, Box has more or less faded into the background, as Drew Houston's Dropbox (DBX) roared onto the public markets with a huge debut, stealing all of Box's thunder and attaining a much higher valuation that Box has ever traded at.Yet Box remains a quiet, formidable competitor. Most observers had written off Box as a commodity play, useful only for storing files in the cloud when local storage space has run out. They're dead wrong: that description is more accurate of Dropbox. Box, on the other hand, brings incredible enterprise-grade functionality and security to the table, and it's a small wonder that Box counts 82,000 businesses as paying users. Dropbox may have millions of users, but those are consumer accounts - Box's customer base is higher-billing and a much more reliable source of annual revenues.Shares of Box have seen immense pressure since February, when the company's earnings showed modest deceleration and forward guidance has the company slipping to just 20% y/y growth. I believe, however, that excitement over new product releases, in particular Box's AI capabilities, can drive a few more points of growth to the upside. With expectations already so muted, Box doesn't have much to lose.Box's special call-out as a strong AI play at the Sohn investment conference drove the largest one-day gain for the stock all year. Though shares have given up some of their gains, Box is up more than 8% since being mentioned at Sohn:BOX data by YChartsDespite the recent sharp gains, I still believe Box to be materially undervalued and am waiting for the stock to pull off a long-overdue rally. After trading in a choppy pattern (see chart above) for most of its life, the firm recommendation from a well-known investor, as well a sentiment change from Wall Street, Box could be on its way to seeing a more normalized valuation. I'm long with a price target of $28, representing 6x EV/FY19 revenues and 24% upside from current levels.Box's attribution as a ""top idea"" at Sohn is one of the biggest pieces of bullish news to descend on the company in quite some time.For the unfamiliar, the Sohn Investment Conference is an annual hedge fund gala held in New York, with ticket proceeds going to charity. Top hedge fund managers are invited to speak at the conference and give a 15-minute overview of their top ideas. Sohn is widely known as, according to the Wall Street Journal, the ""Super Bowl of investment conferences"". Given this moniker, it's a small wonder that financial analysts and traders listen extremely closely to the top ideas exchanged at Sohn, and the names discussed see a lot of trading action.Box featured as the top idea of Chamath Palihapitiya, the founder and CEO of Social Capital, a venture capital fund. He specifically pointed to Box's AI capabilities, saying that the company ""sits on top of an enormous amount of R&D"". Palihapitiya called the stock ""incredibly cheap and undervalued,"" with an ""unbelievable margin of safety.""We'll discuss Box's valuation next, but let's quickly review Box's AI capabilities. What the Social Capital boss says about Box isn't just window dressing - Box greatly depend its machine learning/AI capabilities during its release at BoxWorks late last year.Of particular note is Box Skills, which leverages AI capabilities to provide context to the content that is stored on Box. Box's premise is that businesses today have mountains of data and files, far more than they can devote Human Resources to reviewing. In today's data-rich world, machine learning has emerged as the only scalable way of harvesting value out of that data.There are three initial ""skills"" that Box can apply to content stored on its platform. Image intelligence adds metadata tags to image files stored within Box, making them easily searchable. Box uses the example of a tennis ad from New Balance. Metadata tags can be automatically applied to that image, giving it the properties of ""tennis,"" ""sports,"" and ""New Balance"" - which a user can easily search and bring up within seconds.Video intelligence, showcased in the screenshot below, provides the same features for video content and also adds transcription abilities. Audio intelligence does the same thing for audio files, and in both cases, Box automatically generates metadata tags that makes these files easy to search and categorize.Figure 1. Box video intelligenceSource: Box investor relationsThis is the ""enormous R&D"" that Palihapitiya was referencing. No other company is currently capable of this - Dropbox doesn't have the same features in its platform; nor does Alphabet (GOOG) for Google Drive. Box hasn't specifically detailed how many deployments Box Skills has gotten to date or its incremental revenue contribution, but given how new and powerful these features are, it's too early to model in too much deceleration for Box, even if its guidance leans toward the conservative side.Dropbox's IPO was good for Box in some respects. More than anything, the mergence of a much-better valued competitor has highlighted just how cheap Box's stock is. Here's a look at how the two stocks currently compare:Source: author-created chart; data from public filings, market caps based on closing price as of April 27.Dropbox has notched a market cap that's more than 4x the size of Box, despite being only twice its revenue size. It's true that Dropbox currently has the leg up on Box in terms of free cash flow - Dropbox generated huge 28% FCF margins in FY17, and most analysts valuing Box are looking at the company on an FCF-multiple basis rather than revenues, putting it in a rarefied category among software companies.But it's not like Box is the loss-leading company it was a few years ago, either. Its GAAP net losses have come down (Dropbox isn't profitable on a GAAP basis either yet), and the company generated $61.8 million of operating cash flows in FY17, a 12% OCF margin (FCF was much smaller at $8.2 million, a 2% FCF margin). Though Box's cash flow margins currently pale in comparison to Dropbox, the company is expected to expand its margins this year as it brings its growth down into a more controlled phase.The main point: Dropbox's free cash flow advantages are worth some kind of a premium to Box, but not one that's this wide. Dropbox trades at a revenue multiple that's four times richer than Box. And the issue isn't really that Dropbox is overvalued - software stocks with strong FCF like Workday (WDAY) and Atlassian (TEAM) do tend to trade near 9-10x forward revenues. The main cause behind this valuation gap is that Box is undervalued. A software company with revenue growth in the mid-20s like Box typically trades at around 6-7x forward revenues, not 4.7x.Back when Box was being touted as a commodity play that wouldn't be able to sustain its margins, it was understandable for the stock to trade below 5x forward revenues. However, the company's huge IP advantages (as pointed out in the Sohn conference in front of a broad audience) have essentially nullified this argument. Yet Box's stock still can't seem to shake off their bargain-basement valuation.Box requires a great deal of patience. The stock has never earned the full respect from Wall Street that it deserves, though with the company's AI narrative spotlighted at the Sohn investment conference, that perception is hopefully beginning to fade. Though Box's management has guided conservatively for the coming year, expect a few points of outperformance to come from Box Skills and unique content recognition features it provides. Box's product suite is far more advanced than any other competitor in the file storage space, and its billings and revenues this year should reflect that.At just 4.7x forward revenues, and trading at a steep four-turn discount to Dropbox despite R&D advantages, Box has immense opportunity to leap up to at least 6x forward revenues, or $28. I'm holding out until at least that threshold before letting go of my position."
4153366,102994,2018-03-05T13:05:06-05:00,"Box had its worst day since its IPO with shares dropping more than 23% on March 1, the day after it reported earnings. Shares recovered a meager 2 percent Friday.Box projected revenue for the next quarter at $139-140 million, consensus was upwards of $144 million. I expect rate of revenue increase to continue to wane.CEO Aaron Levie claims Box is transitioning to Cloud Content Management and dismissed competition from Microsoft (OneDrive), Google Drive and established ECM vendors who are innovating via acquisition.Box all but denied competition from Dropbox which is more than twice Box's size and is now going after the Enterprise, Box's sweet spot.Box was an innovator, but larger vendors who were late to the game, (Microsoft, Google) are catching up and giving their products away free as part of their productivity suites.","Box (NYSE:BOX) is an enterprise cloud file synchronization and storage (OTC:EFSS) provider that is transitioning toward ""cloud content management."" It offers important services to mid-sized businesses and enterprises around file management and collaboration in the cloud, as well as added features like security, compliance, data protection, governance, key management, flexible content geolocation and more.Box is well received by business technology buyers and technology analysts as an EFSS provider, or what tech analyst Gartner now calls ""Content Collaboration Provider.""Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Content Collaboration Platforms July 2017But Box has competition that is quickly closing in. Take Dropbox for example. Dropbox (NASDAQ: DBX,) which is expected to IPO later this month, only got serious about going after business EFSS users in 2014. Dropbox is now in Gartner's Leaders Quadrant with Box. Dropbox is a worker favorite, IT managers will have to give it a look.Not only that, but neither Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with OneDrive, nor Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with Google Drive, qualified for the prized Leaders Quadrant (see where they stood in 2016) until 2017 (see chart above). They now both have a home there. What this shows is that Box's deeper-pocketed competitors are catching-up fast and there's little reason to believe they won't keeping getting closer.There is also this to consider: users of Microsoft Office 365 for Business and G Suite, Google's productivity platform, don't have to pay to use OneDrive or Google Drive. In other words, companies can spend money for the privilege of storing their content in Box, or they can keep it on these big vendors clouds for free.Box is now pitching its AI and machine learning capabilities to customers.This is one area where Google and Microsoft have Box beat in terms of research, skilled and trained workforces and real world experience. Consider the machine learning and AI experts behind Google's search engine, its ad business, its digital assistant ""OK Google"", Google car and more. Microsoft has even built technology that can read documents and answer questions about them that it among the most advanced in the world.Google offers its Box-like product, Google Drive, to G Suite Enterprise and Business users for free, with unlimited storage. Google Drive comes with top-level security, audits and alerts on document status changes, controls over external sharing, information rights management, search and e-discovery and more. Microsoft, for its part, offers the same in addition to identity management, storage in global data centers that support regionalized data residency and privacy regulations, client managed encryption keys and identity-centered security, among others.There's also this, when Box needed to become able to meet its customers' general data protection regulation (GDPR) requirements which involve legislation around data residency in Europe, Box had to scramble. It was less of a hurdle for Microsoft and Google which already had local data centers and teams.Levie does not seem bothered by the aforementioned as he considers EFSS to be ""a commodity"" and these companies, and Dropbox, to be in, pretty much, different businesses. That viewpoint may be a problem because Box is making most of its money in that commoditized business. And while Levie says the Box's future is in cloud-based Content Management, consider where Gartner sees Box among ""Content Services Platforms."" (Gartner renamed its Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Content Management to Content Services Platforms in October 2017.)As a result, it's unlikely that Box will automatically be placed on the shortlists of CIO's who are shopping for new content services platforms. (IT managers generally have to have strong arguments for not going with a Leader.) It's also true that many large, regulated companies don't prefer ""cloud only,"" platforms which is what Box has to offer. They typically go for ""hybrid"" so that they can store and safeguard their data locally and collaborate and conduct business in the cloud as needed.It's also important to note that despite what IT vendors say, many large companies aren't interested in swapping out their existing ECM systems. Consider what Information Management industry analyst Alan Pelz-Sharpe recently wrote:So, while Levie likes to call the Leaders of the Content Services platforms ""legacy,"" not many of them are being retired. Moreover, the established players are acquiring innovators that are similar to Box and modernizing their platforms using the new technologies to insure that their customers can participate in the wave of digital transformation.And while Box likes to tout its Life Sciences wins at companies like Eli Lilly, there are other cloud content services vendors that are just as young and hip as Box (like Veeva Vault) at the company. (Evidence comes from job openings at Eli Lilly).So, it's only prudent to ask if Levie isn't underestimating the competition. Afterall, with Dropbox raising its pitch to businesses, Google and Microsoft offering their EFSS to business users of G Suite and Microsoft OneDrive for Business for free, and Veeva Vault offering cloud content management services specifically built for regulated industries and such, Box's ""land and expand"" strategy will become increasingly more difficult to execute.Couple this with Box's already slowing rate of growth, the future doesn't look as bright as it did a year ago.On to the numbers.Box's revenues came in at $136.7 million, in line with analyst consensus. Revenues increased 7% for the quarter and sequentially and 25% year over year. Numbers like these aren't easy pills for investors in a high growth market to swallow, especially when they are coming from a company that is still isn't profitable. On a brighter note, billings were $204.6 million, up 28% year over year. Deferred revenues came in at $320.9 million, up 33% from the same quarter last year.Box reported an operating loss of $7.5 million on a non-GAAP basis compared with $12.7 million a year ago. The operating margin was (5%) compared with (12%) in the same quarter last year.Losses on a GAAP basis were $32.7 million or loss of 24 cents per share compared with net loss of $36.9 million or loss of 28 cents per share for the same quarter last year.Box added 2000 paying customers in Q4 (total now is 82k.) The problem here is that Box had been adding 3-5000 per quarter.It is Box's outlook that is especially troubling, though. The company expects revenue of $139- $140 million in Q1 and $602 million to $608 million for the full year. Analysts had been looking for $144.3 million and full-year sales of $625.6 million on average. While part of the disappointing forecast could be attributed to Box's newly adopted revenue recognition rules, even after adjustment, the outlook isn't as bright as it used to be. So when you look at Box's Q4 results and forecast together with an assessment of the competitive landscape, Box's future doesn't look nearly as bright as its past. Though I fully expect Box's shares to somewhat recover from the nosedive they took last week, the outlook over the long term looks diluted, especially as compared to other opportunities."

My recommendation has constantly suggested the market was overlooking the value in the cloud content management stock including the sell off following the previous quarterly results.The stock recently rallied from $17 to $24 in two short months. A dip was necessary, but does the drop to $20 in initial trading provide the next great entry point?Despite the volatility in the stock, Box remains a recurring revenue stream story that is slowly turning into a cash flow story. Ultimately, the market likes the consistent growth here, whether or not always appreciating it.The FQ3 results and guidance were basically in line with or better than expectations. The real standout numbers were the bump in deferred revenue growth up to 31% and a huge increase in cash flows.For a company with virtually all of the revenues recurring and strong customer retention, the story is more about cash flows than earnings. The market will focus on the quarterly EPS losses, but Box showed a massive improvement in cash flows from operations last quarter.The big fear following the FQ2 results was the dip in free cash flow margin to -12%, up from -8% in the prior-year period. The company tried to soothe the market, suggesting timing issues were the culprit typical during summer months. The FQ3 results validated our willingness to believe in the company, as Box turned in a solid free cash flow margin of 5%.Source: Box FQ3'18 presentationBox improved cash flow from operations by of an incredible $20.9 million from last FQ3, and free cash flow turned to positive $6.3 million for an incredible improvement of $17.2 million YoY. Both impressive numbers, and crucial considering the cloud content management company only sits on about $200 million of cash now.The cloud stock got a little richly valued up at $24. The forward P/S multiple reached over 5, having nearly doubled in the last year. Though for recurring revenue stream stocks, a stock trading at closer to 4x next year's sales estimates of $623 million is rather cheap.BOX PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsConsidering analysts expect Box to continue growing revenues at clips above 20%, the stock is an easy one to own on dips. Cash flows will continue growing, as the company has now scaled revenues to above $500 million.The market was disappointed with some of the sales projections and, especially, the ability to close deals in the quarter. CEO Aaron Levie had this to say on the earnings call:The key investor takeaway is that Box remains an attractive stock to own as the company scales up and improves its cash flow picture. With the stock trading at only about 4x FY19 sales, one will want to scoop up this necessary dip."
4128879,103480,2017-12-01T00:09:21-05:00,"Box reported a solid Q3, with revenue outpacing analyst estimates and earnings in-line.After dipping briefly into negative free cash flow territory in Q2, Box returned to posting positive cash flow, validating the business model of a once-rapid cash burner.AI capabilities announced last month in its new product, Box Skills, should drive further growth for the company.Box remains a truly vital software platform with a healthy ecosystem; the company is still retaining high-growth status despite reaching a $500-million scale.","We've been here before with Box (NASDAQ: BOX): good earnings, poor reaction. Despite all that Box has achieved in the last year - maintaining high growth, turning free cash flow positive, and launching critical new products - it remains a constant victim of earnings volatility, no matter what the numbers say.It's important to keep in mind, of course, that Box is up substantially this year - more than 50%, as can be seen from the chart below. But with its superior growth profile and cheap valuation (4.6x EV/FTM revenues, substantially below software peers), Box is a company well positioned to continue outperformance in 2018, especially if it keeps up its cash flow performance.BOX data by YChartsLast quarter, when Box was trading at $19, I had written that Box is worth 5-5.5x revenues - implying a price target of $22-24. Since last quarter, shares have jumped ~10%, approximately in line with the increase in the broader technology sector. Despite Box's rise, I continue to believe the stock is worth 5.5x EV/FTM revenues, which now implies a price target of $25 based on the latest quarterly guidance and growth trajectory. Box no longer has the wild potential it did earlier this year when it was trading under $14, but I believe there's still 15-20% of upside left. With tech stocks already so high, it's difficult to ask for much more than that going into 2018.The slight dip in Box's stock post-Q3 presents a good buying opportunity - if history is any guide, Box always recovers in a big way after these types of quarters. Looking longer term, the product announcements Box made in its annual BoxWorks conference last month - particularly around Box Skills, a new product that applies machine learning to content stored in Box to generate automated summaries and categorizations for the user - will not only provide additional upsell opportunity for existing clients but also establish its position as a thought leader in AI/ML.Box posted revenue of $129.3 million in Q3, up 26% y/y. In Q2, the company had offered a Q3 guidance range of $128-129 million, indicating that Box achieved slightly over the high end of that guidance. Analysts had expected $128.6 million (+25% y/y), implying a one-point beat this quarter.Billings of $141.5 million also grew at a 26% y/y rate, matching revenue growth, as deferred revenue balances grew 31% y/y to $253 million - recall that billings account for recognized revenue and deals booked into deferred revenue, which will be recognized as revenue within 12 months.The chart below shows Box's growth trajectory over the past few years, by quarter:Figure 1. Box growth trajectorySource: author-created chart; data from public filingsEven as a hardy Box bull, I do have to acknowledge the deceleration in Box's top-line metrics, as both revenue and billings have slowed down in the back half of this year. However, a couple notes are key to point out on deceleration: first, at Box's $500-million scale, deceleration is almost a law of nature, and the fact that it's still growing in the high 20s is a commendable accomplishment.Second, Q3 doesn't yet fully capture the effects of new product launches and the uplift that BoxWorks generates for sales. Q4 is typically Box's biggest quarter - as is true of every IT company when CIOs unload the last of their budgets. Box could see surprise upside in Q4 as it also has the added benefit of the Box Relay and Box Skills launches to drive sales conversations and provide additional billing opportunities within its existing client base.It's also important to note that with Box's massive improvement in margins and free cash flow, some growth has to be sacrificed. SaaS companies are making a perpetual trade-off between growth and profitability - and Box's deceleration coupled with cash flow expansion this quarter is a perfect illustration of that.Figure 2. Box operating leverage improvementsSource: Box Q3 earnings releaseAs shown in the above chart, Box improved its operating loss margin by 4 points this quarter - a huge improvement for a company still growing revenues at 26% y/y. Particularly impressive is the fact that R&D dropped two points despite Box's recent product launches - and the shedding of a point of general and administrative spending is always a good sign of a disciplined company.The company generated pro-forma EPS of -$0.13 (adjusting for stock-based comp), and was in line with analyst consensus of -$0.13.Earnings aside, cash flow was the major headliner for profitability this quarter.Figure 3. Box cash flow resultsSource: Box Q3 earnings releaseAs shown in the above chart, Box generated $14.1 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, up from -$6.8 million in the prior year Q3. The company's FCF of $6.3 million is also up from an FCF loss of -$10.9 million last year.In Q2, investors had turned a cold shoulder to Box because it dipped into negative FCF. As expected, Q2 was driven by the seasonality and billings lumpiness common with SaaS companies - the underlining fact is that Box's margins are trending extremely positively, and that along with revenue growth should drive massive cash flow expansion.Box also raised its FY18 guidance to $505-506 million, up $1 million at the midpoint compared to a prior guidance midpoint of $504.5 million. This represents full-year revenue growth of 27% over FY17's revenue of $398.6 million.Yes, it's true that Box beat expectations this quarter by a smaller margin than we've come to expect - but a beat is still a beat, and doesn't merit a 3% selloff.Box has a great growth trajectory ahead of it. In the past two years, it has truly differentiated itself as a value-added software offering. While the company started off as a commodity file storage service, with few differences in functionality as compared to Google Drive (GOOG) (GOOGL), Box's products are now rich with third-party extensions, seamless collaboration features, and content recognition capabilities. Box has become a mission-critical IT product as exemplified by a retention rate that has consistently held above 110% - showing that not only are Box's customers staying installed, but are expanding their reliance on the platform.While commoditization worries once justified Box's lower trading multiple relative to the wider software sector, Box's rich application capabilities now no longer fit that bill - trading at 4.6x EV/FTM revenues, Box is one of the biggest bargains in enterprise software despite its YTD gains. Once a company like Box has gained its $500-million scale, its growth trajectory is virtually certain as size begets size. Investors will continue to appreciate steady gains as Box heads toward the $1-billion revenue mark."
4152160,103480,2018-03-01T06:26:48-05:00,"Shares of Box tanked more than 10% after reporting Q4 results and guidance that fell short of consenus.The stock has re-entered buy territory as it falls back to a bargain valuation below 5x forward revenues.It's true that Box's growth may be tapering off, but the company's free cash flow growth is just beginning. It's looking to trade at reasonable multiples of OCF and FCF.With rival Dropbox recently filing documents that show $305 million in FCF (a 28% margin), Box will feel the pressure to deliver more on the cash flow side.Product advancements, especially in AI, will keep Box relevant and growing in the IT community for a long time.","Is the hypergrowth phase over for Box (NYSE:BOX), Aaron Levie's homegrown cloud collaboration software company? The company has had a tumultuous year, with growth decelerating quarter after quarter and hitting a low of 24% y/y growth in this quarter as the company crossed the $500 million annual revenue mark for the first time. Box's growth glidepath illustrates a ubiquitous truth - even the most rapidly growing of SaaS and technology companies can't keep growing indefinitely. Unless you're peddling a full portfolio of products like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), once you hit a saturation point in your key market, your growth rates will start to come down.But at the same time, Box is rapidly developing into a cash flow story. Though the company has yet to hit a full year's worth of GAAP profitability (the next milestone in its journey as a maturing startup), it has begun this year to spin out positive operating and free cash flows, up from losses in the prior year. This development comes right on time as Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX) files its S-1 documents that show huge attainment in cash flows. In FY17, Dropbox generated $305 million of FCF, up more than 2x y/y and representing a cash flow margin of 28%.Box isn't quite there yet. Dropbox has a leg up over it in two primary ways: first, its revenue scale is about twice Box's size, giving it obvious scale advantages; and second, Dropbox's primary focus on consumer users (versus Box in the enterprise arena) gives it more opportunities for word-of-mouth marketing and natural ""pull"" demand, whereas Box has to staff up a major sales organization to push its products onto enterprise buyers. While the latter factor will never change, I believe Box's enterprise focus gives it an edge in the market, with a much more stable client base and the opportunity for upsells should the company decide to roll out new additions or modules.I've been long on Box for quite some time, and view the company's post-Q4 pullback as an opportunity to pick up more shares. Rare is the SaaS company that trades below 5x forward revenues (most of Box's peers are in the 6-7x territory), and with cash flows just now starting to expand, Box could soon trade at an appealing multiple of OCF and FCF as well. Yes, softer guidance for FY19 and the associated deceleration that will get baked into Wall Street's models is a concern - but Box has generally been consistent in beating forecasts and raising targets. I'm more keen to focus on the positive aspects of the story, cash flow and AI innovation being chief among them.BOX EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsHere's the summary snapshot of Box's fourth-quarter results:Figure 1. Box Q4 resultsSource: Box investor relationsRevenue, unfortunately, was just in line with analyst expectations. Box grew its top line 24% to $136.7 million in revenues, decelerating yet again from last quarter's 25% growth. For a cloud SaaS company, meeting expectations is probably just the same as missing them - growth investors expect a healthy beat every quarter, and sell off stocks that don't have large upside surprises.What I find encouraging about Box's top-line results, however, is the fact that billings did accelerate. Box's billings in the quarter grew 28% y/y to $204.6 million, outpacing revenue growth and accelerating from 26% y/y growth in Q3. Given that billings represent the deal activity that Box signed for the entire forward-looking 12 months, and not just revenue and old billings recognized in a single quarter, I view billings to be a better long-term barometer of Box's success. The fourth quarter is typically Box's biggest one, same as any IT company that relies on IT buyers using up their budgets in the November/December time frame to make last-minute buys. It's encouraging to see that the company at least saw acceleration in billings growth, even if revenue did disappoint against forecasts. These billings translate into deferred revenue that will give extra padding to Box's revenues in the coming four quarters.One metric that investors probably did balk at, however, was Box's customer adds. Every quarter the company reports its base of paying customers, and in the fourth quarter, that number was 82K - only a 2K increase from Q3's figure of 80K, and a disappointment for a company that typically adds 3-5K of new paying customers in any given quarter.Still, however, we do have to give credit to Box for maintaining its revenue and billings growth despite its much larger scale. With its forward guidance of $602-608 million in revenues for FY19 (implying 20% y/y growth and a four-point miss against consensus of $626 million, by the way), Box has moved onto the larger side of the SaaS software sector.Making up somewhat for the top-line disappointment, however, is a beat to the bottom line, driven by margin improvements. Box shrank its GAAP operating loss in the quarter to -$32.5 million, representing a -24% operating loss margin versus -33% in the prior year's Q4. The company achieved greater efficiency in tapering down both its sales and marketing and general overhead expenses as a percentage of revenues. In addition to a one-point increase in gross margin (from 73% to 74%), these margin improvements helped Box outperform against Wall Street's earnings targets, with pro forma EPS of -$0.06 beating expectations of -$0.08.Box must be feeling the heat on the cash flow side when its biggest rival Dropbox has just posted enormous cash flows and is using FCF as one of the biggest selling points in its IPO (Aaron Levie and Dropbox CEO Drew Houston have had an acrimonious public relationship, with Houston deriding Box for being of limited appeal for non-enterprises and Levie claiming Dropbox doesn't have the security or sophistication for corporate customers). Indeed, Dropbox is trying to distance itself from Box as much as possible in its IPO, as it doesn't want to end up receiving Box's lower ~5x revenue multiple.While Box is still far from generating the 28% FCF margins and ~2x growth that Dropbox is enjoying, it is catching up. Box grew FCF 31% y/y to $13.3 million in Q4, representing a respectable 10% FCF margin.For the full year FY18, Box generated $8.9 million in FCF, up from a loss of -$24.9 million in FY17. The fact that Box is just coming out from negative FCF suggests that we don't yet know what a steady-state FCF margin for Box can be.Box doesn't specifically guide to FCF growth, but if the company were able to expand its FCF margin 5 points to 15% this year, it would generate $91 million in FCF on its guidance midpoint revenue of $605 million. Given large SaaS companies like Salesforce and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), as well as Dropbox, generate FCF margins in the 20-30% neighborhood, this isn't too ridiculous of a target as long as Box can continue its margin discipline and continue the trend of 9-point operating margin improvements that it executed this quarter. With Box's current enterprise value at just $2.7 billion, it trades at just under 30x this ""hypothetical"" FCF - of course, the company can generate much larger FCF as it continues to scale to the size of Dropbox.Box's investor crowd hasn't always been the most loyal following, with Box shares vacillating up and down widely over the past year. With shares up ""only"" 20% in the last 12 months, lagging behind performance in the broader software sector, Box still has room to move upward and shine.BOX data by YChartsThe long-term trend for Box is extremely positive. Box has an exceptionally sticky customer base, and it's well positioned to keep rolling out more innovative features and add-ons. Box's nascent new rollout of Box Skills, in particular, is extremely appealing with its content recognition and transcription capabilities that aren't widely available elsewhere in software. I'm long with a price target of $26, representing 5.5x forward revenues (still a discount to SaaS peers)."
4159727,22148,2018-03-28T18:04:17-04:00,Box initially dipped on the hot Dropbox IPO.The company faces an increasingly competitive cloud storage and content management sector.The stock trades at an attractive P/S multiple for the cloud space.,"With the IPO of Dropbox (DBX) last week, Box (BOX) saw an initial dip due to competitive fears and probably some traders using the stock as a source of funds for the hot new stock. Despite competitive threats, the fears appear unnecessary as the market isn't applying the same logic to Box as the hot IPO.Source: Box websiteIf one believes CEO Aaron Levie, Box and Dropbox are not the same. Box aims to service the secure content sharing needs of large enterprises, while Dropbox focuses on consumer subscriptions and is slowing moving into small corporations.The market though doesn't buy this comparison and appears to favor the ability of Dropbox to land and expand via initial exposure to employees of these large corporations. All while both companies increasingly face competitive threats from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iCloud, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Drive, and aggressive offers from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) OneDrive and others.Both companies would probably tell a different story on whether enterprise customers would trust the security and compliance of Dropbox. For those outside the technology world, the numbers will have to speak volumes.Box has been public for 3 years now, so the financials are more mature than those of Dropbox with the market demanding a focus on free cash flows. Just after an IPO, the market tends to be overly bullish about the prospects of a company without the profitable demands.Box hit my radar as the stock dipped following the IPO due to the negative cash flows. The recent results though tell a far better story as the content management company is now consistently producing strong cash flow margins. The stock might dip, but the investment thesis remains solidly in the buy the dip category.Source: Box FQ4'18 presentationDropbox has some impressive numbers that drive the enthusiasm for the stock. The market can be overly obsessed with active users and subscriber numbers that aren't always legitimate. The 500 million registered users on Dropbox no doubt helps drive the market value that tips the scale at $13 billion.Source: Dropbox S-1Dropbox generated revenues of $1.1 billion last year from 11 million paying customers and, the market value with over 400 million shares outstanding after the IPO is now far in excess of the only $3 billion value of Box. So, Box had roughly half the revenue base of Dropbox in 2017 on 82,000 customers and now has a quarter of the market value.Where Levie has a point and investors need to pay attention are the margins. Dropbox only produces gross margins of 67% in comparison to the 76% margins of Box. Not a massive difference, but a sign of the scale of having larger customers.Surprisingly, though, Dropbox actually produced a profit after excluding stock-based compensation. The company had a large operating loss of $112 million or about 10% of revenues, but SBC came in at $164 million on the year.Box is considerably better off at this scale of the business of around $500 million in revenues, but the company doesn't have the 30% growth rate of Dropbox despite being smaller. Conversely, Box is already generating free cash flow at revenue levels of $500 million where Dropbox had a massive loss. Revenue in the 20% growth rate (despite ASC 606 impact) for a cloud software provider will generate solid margin growth and cash flows.BOX data by YChartsQuality cloud companies just don't trade at forward P/S multiples below 4 for very long, especially when the closest market comp is now closer to 10x.The key investor takeaway is that the company is in an increasingly competitive sector. CEO Aaron Levie is probably accurate that large enterprises aren't going to abandon Box for a more consumer offering like Dropbox, but the bigger fear is the aggressive push of Microsoft and others. Regardless, Box is too cheap to be dropped, while the market is distracted by the shiny new offering in the sector."
4113496,103480,2017-10-14T07:42:28-04:00,"Box shares have soared this week on the back of new product initiatives rolled out at the annual BoxWorks conference.In its 2017 analyst day, management updated its estimated total addressable market to $45 billion, with its new products expanding greatly upon Box’s initial use case.Box affirmed its path to profitability and updated its long-term operating model, forecasting its first pro forma profitable quarter in FY19 (calendar 2018).The company is currently at a ~$500 million run rate, larger than most software companies, and is still growing at 30%.","After years of languishing in a penalty box (no pun intended), Box (NASDAQ: BOX) has finally returned to the limelight. Shares have finally surfaced above $20 (and a 52-week high) after a sustained rally last week, returning Box to levels not seen since immediately after its January 2015 IPO. A much-deserved bull narrative has descended upon the stock, driven largely by the positive reactions drawn from Box’s analyst day.Unlike many of its cloud SaaS peers, Box possesses many of the attributes that signal a high-quality company: scale (the company is reaching toward $500 million in revenues), growth (revenues grew 30% in the first half of this year, impressive given its large scale), and nascent profitability (the company is virtually near cash flow breakeven). Further, this is a company that still has plenty of tailwinds to support growth, which investors picked up on last week as the company announced updates to its platform via Box Relay and Box Skills.These new products initiatives, which management believes not only increases attractiveness in deal bakeoffs but also increases pricing potential, have supported an expanding of Box’s TAM to $45 billion. Given the new operating model metrics released at the analyst day, bullish investors now have a visible case for healthy profits at a large revenue scale.Box is a company worth staying long on. Though the stock has its fair share of ups and downs, as Wall Street remains ever-watchful on short-term fluctuations in quarterly billings and erratic cash flow results, the long-term narrative remains intact. Box is the leading enterprise platform for documents and content, which now expands greatly upon simple storage and offers rich analytics and workflow management capabilities.In Box’s S-1 filing, it had originally forecast its total addressable market (TAM) as $25 billion, based on IDC market estimates of IT spending on software for file sharing and storage.Now, the company has aggressively expanded its TAM to $45 billion in a space it defines overall as Cloud Content Management (CCM). Just as in its prior TAM estimation, this $45 billion figure is based upon the aggregate sum of IDC’s estimated IT spending on several software categories.The new products Box has released since its IPO - including Box Relay and Box Skills, which were the most recent additions to Box’s portfolio - have added on to Box’s original $25 billion TAM which consisted solely of File Sync & Share and Network Storage. The below screenshot, taken from the analyst day presentation, shows how Box’s product line addresses its newly adopted market segments:Figure 1. Box now addresses a $45 billion TAMA larger TAM points to larger opportunities for expansion, especially as the company begins to become more saturated in its core file sync & share segment. New products give Box the opportunity to approach new customers with a different angle, as well as upsell existing ones.Let’s start with Box Relay, which will GA (become generally available) on November 13 of this year. The company currently has ~250 customers on its beta version.Box Relay is intended to be a simple take on workflow automation, which can be used to streamline any process involving a set of actions around documents. The screenshot below, taken from Box’s website, shows an example of using Box Relay to streamline the process of going live with a sales contract. Box Relay sets up the steps involved from drafting the contract to final execution and assigns each task in the process to each individual, routing the baton to the next directly responsible individual as tasks are completed.Figure 2. Box RelayWhile Box Relay isn’t a new software category - companies like Nintex and Appian (NASDAQ: APPN) already address workflow management needs - Relay is intended to be a native, convenient solution to Box users who need an intuitive tool that works alongside where their content is already hosted.Box Skills is arguably the splashier product announcement, even though it’s a product built largely on technology from third parties. Box Skills combines the AI and machine learning capabilities of several leading technology companies - IBM Watson (NYSE: IBM), Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Google Cloud Platform (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to bring intelligent content recognition features to files residing in Box.Figure 3. Box SkillsBox Skills was announced at BoxWorks the day prior to the analyst meeting and will be fully open for beta testing in “early 2018.” In a blog post introducing the product, Box pointed to three initial capabilities:A screenshot example of Box Skills’ image recognition capabilities, taken from the launch blog post, is shown below:Figure 4. Box Skills image recognition capabilitiesIn the spirit of linking up several AI platforms from major technology companies to deliver a complete service, Box has also announced it will open up Box Skills to third-party developers to build add-ons and extensions. This allows the company to create an ecosystem around Skills (the same way it has created a large developer community around the core Box platform) that can further advance its entrenchment into enterprise IT.Box also announced its new long-term operating model at its analyst day, showing the company’s progress toward margin goals to be attained at the $1 billion revenue scale:Figure 5. Box long-term operating modelThe chart above also shows the quick pace at which Box is moving toward its target model. While Box was once famous for being called a cash-burning “house of horrors,” the company has become virtually cash flow breakeven in the first half of this year. The majority of this shift toward profitability has been an increase in sales efficiency, which is broken down into quarterly attainment in the chart below, also taken from Box's analyst day deck:Figure 6. Box quarterly sales efficiency improvementWhile Box used to spend nearly 80% of its revenue on sales and marketing, it has since cut that figure by 30%, and sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue now sits just above 50%. That 30% has gone straight to the bottom line - which has a powerful effect if you also consider Box’s rapid revenue growth.At $1 billion in revenues (which Box can achieve in three years if it grows at an average of 25% for each of those years), Box is intending to generate 17% FCF margins, implying annual free cash flow of $170 million. At Box’s current market cap of $2.7 billion and net cash position of $150 million, this implies a current EV/FCF multiple of 15x on Box’s long-term free cash flow generation capabilities. Granted, the $1 billion revenue/$170 million FCF marker is still relatively far into the future, but beginning to view Box’s valuation in terms of a cash flow multiple proves that there is long-term valuation support as the company matures into a cash machine.Free cash flow valuations aside, most investors still think of Box in terms of its revenue multiple, and even after the stock’s ascent this week, Box still remains significantly undervalued relative to its peers in mid-to-large cap software:BOX EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsBox’s product and financial announcements coming out of BoxWorks and the analyst conference this week solidify its roadmap. The fact that the stock hasn’t ever staged a true outbreak since its IPO gives a compelling reason now for investors to ride the stock upward. Box is a paragon of Silicon Valley success, having evolved from a single-product company with tenuous cash burn into a diversified software platform addressing a large growing TAM and staking out a path to large profit margins."
4103444,103480,2017-08-31T15:10:53-04:00,"Despite strong fundamentals, Box stock has continued to trade in a narrow range, but remains poised to break past its $20 IPO mark.Seasonality has caused a return to negative cash flow and caused a selloff in the stock, ignoring the continued strength in billings (the most important long-term metric).Box continues to land large enterprise clients and become an enterprise IT standard in file sharing and collaboration, making the stock a good long-term play in software.Its valuation at ~4.5x EV/FTM revenues is 2 turns lower than the majority of its peers, despite a strong growth profile and improving profitability.","Box (NYSE: BOX) just can't seem to catch a bid. After rallying nearly 10% this month and inching closer toward $20 (an important psychological level because it's the original IPO price, above which it has failed to cross again), Box shares fell again on a very slight Q2 disappointment - negative cash flow. While profitability and cash flow are important metrics for bread-and-butter companies, a single quarter's cash burn does not make an iota of difference for a software company in full growth mode like Box.We'll dive into the numbers in a bit, but one key takeaway from CEO Aaron Levie's remarks eclipses the financials: Box's industry is moving away from the commoditized element of cloud storage and moving more into content management, an area in which Box stands out and continues to deliver leading innovations. Gartner, the leading software research firm, has re-defined the Content Collaboration space to increase the importance and weighting of rich content management features, and in its July 2017 edition, Gartner once again named Box the undisputed leader - ahead of Dropbox, as well as offerings from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).With its industry-leading position and widespread hook into the enterprise IT landscape, Box's runway remains solid - see my previous article for a discussion on Box's technical values and supremacy in the content management and collaboration space.BOX data by YChartsBox's valuation (above; though note the chart doesn't reflect the after-hours sell-off or the quarter revenue reset - Box's EV/FTM Revenue multiple is around 4.25x) gives it plenty of room to run. With a valuation in the 4's, Box trades almost like a storage company - but with the content management industry's seminal shift away from commoditized cloud storage websites and into deep, data-crunching content platforms, Box really deserves to trade like a pure high-growth application software name. Recall that the rest of the application software industry trades at multiples between 6x and 8x forward revenues.Let's dive into Q2. For the quarter ended July 31, Box posted:Revenue beat analyst expectations of $121.7 million and the company's own guidance of $121-$122 million. See the company's growth glidepath below:Figure 1. BOX growth metrics by quarterCustomer counts continue to soar, and Box landed a number of marquee deals in the quarter, including McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH), and the State of Nevada.Most importantly, billings remained on track above 30% - an important achievement in the seasonally slower Q2, where summer buying activity is slow in the enterprise and IT leaders aren't racing to spend the rest of their budgets until December. With consistently strong billings prints quarter after quarter, Box has a strong revenue pipeline to deliver continued beat-and-raise quarters.Guidance wasn't too bad either. The company's FY18 revenue range of $503-$506 million was roughly in-line with consensus of $505.7 million, and came in on the high end of EPS (Box is projecting -44c to -46c vs. consensus of -46c).Rare is the software company that breaks the $500 million mark, and it's a sign of both maturity and technical validation in the difficult-to-please enterprise landscape. Box's losses aren't vanishing into thin air - they are investments into product and distribution, which fortifies the company's long-term prospects.Next, let's turn to what everyone else is talking about - after two successive quarters of positive operating cash flow, Box has ""relapsed"" again into negative OCF territory, posting $-9.5 million in OCF in Q2 versus positive $8.5 million in Q1 and -$4.5 million in the year-ago Q2.Now, those numbers look somewhat gory at first sight, but let's dig into the components of Box's cash flow:Figure 2. BOX Q2 cash flow statementAs can be seen above from the press release financials, Box's losses haven't grown exponentially larger. In fact, the majority of the cash flow deficit owes to two items: the increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses.These are meaningless balance sheet transactions, almost entirely irrelevant to the company's business health. Seasonality drives irregular movements in the balance sheet picture from time to time, and that may impact calculated cash flows - but this quarter's OCF print can't be interpreted as a weakness in Box's commitment to delivering operating leverage. Box remains on track to deliver positive OCF in FY18.Margins are the true indicator of Box's profitability potential, and Box actually delivered 2% of operating margin improvement in Q2 (on a pro forma basis, Box beat analyst's PF operating margin consensus by 170bps). The largest driver of this was a 2% improvement in gross margin over the year-ago Q2:Figure 3. BOX gross marginsWith gross margins continuing to rise, Box delivers incredible customer economics, profiting nearly seventy-five cents of every dollar in customer contracts.Box's operating expenses remain in check as well:Figure 4. BOX operating marginsOverall operating margins improved a healthy amount, and set a record high in 2Q18 (generalist investors might think a -32% operating margin is outrageous, but when considering that the majority of that operating expense is largely ""down-sizable"" sales spending, it's not a bad story). Recall that Box's high spending is a choice by management to invest in its large sales force, which contribute to the company's massive growth engine - it doesn't indicate a poorly run business or a failed business model.The only component of operating spend to increase was general and administrative, by 1% - but recall that Box hired a new COO, Stephanie Carullo, in Q2. The spike is likely one-time.With margins showing healthy improvement, the cash flow print seems almost naive to consider out of context. Core metrics are still humming along nicely, and investors have turned a blind eye.The Q2 after-hours selloff, owing to a largely inconsequential cash flow misstep, has made Box even cheaper relative to its high-growth software peers.Figure 5. BOX trading compsNote that the chart shown above gives you a rough idea of Box's valuation relative to its more modestly valued comps. Some software companies like Appian (NASDAQ: APPN) trade at 8.5x forward revenues, despite having nearly flat growth. One can only wonder why Box is so unloved despite its massive growth at a $500 million scale.Properly valued, Box should return to at least ~5x forward revenues ($22). Even 5.5x ($24) isn't a stretch for a company with its growth rate. This range implies a ~20% upside from current levels, and given that Box is sitting very close to the 4x mark, a fairly safe investment. Few software companies - especially those in the ~30% growth bucket - cross below 4x forward revenues.Box also announced another major business driver in Q2 - a deepening of its relationships with Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Box has rolled out new features deploying Google Cloud Vision to automatically ""read"" documents stored in Box and convey their contents to users. The company also announced future AI-driven releases built on Azure.The fact that Box is becoming increasingly more inter-operable with different cloud infrastructures highlights its shift into becoming a ubiquitous platform technology, one that can run across systems and be deployed in a variety of environments and use cases. In addition, with Box products being bundled by Microsoft sales reps in Azure deals, Box essentially has the ability to grab more revenue ""for free,"" without using its own sales investments.Despite Google and Microsoft having their own offerings in content management and file sharing, they have chosen to partner with Box, highlighting its status as a customer favorite. With the exception of Google Drive (which is largely free), no other brand in the space is as powerful as Box, making the stock a solid long-term investment.The market is notorious for its short-term orientation - a single quarter's cash flow miss seems like the end of the world today, but for a growth-oriented company, it's almost meaningless. Billings are high, customer economics point to elevated gross margins and profitable SaaS contracts, and top-tier partnerships expand Box's reach into almost every prospective enterprise client in the world. What's not to like?"
4103167,22148,2017-08-30T18:21:35-04:00,Box reported mixed FQ2 headline results.The cloud content management company saw key billings surge 31%.Cash flow questions will provide a dip buying opportunity.,"After the close, Box (BOX) reported mixed quarterly results. The stock is initially trading down on a minor revenue miss and cash flow concerns highlighted by CNBC. The stock was trading close to the initial post-IPO highs so a great quarter was likely needed to send Box higher. The question is whether some of the concerns are a reason to avoid the stock that has been one of our recommendations this year. The reason to like Box is the consistent revenue growth that as sat around 30% lately. As well, the company has strong partners in Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) that aligns Box with the tech giants that aren't trying to take over every aspect of the world. The market will focus on revenues missing the $124.3 million target by $1.4 million. The reality is that Box grew billings by 31% to $139.5 million and deferred revenue by 32% to $240.8. Billings growth was 31% in the prior quarter so the content management company isn't seeing any slowdown in this metric like growth. Both metrics are phenomenal and signal substantial growth ahead. As the market has become more focused on earnings and especially cash flows in the case of a cloud content management firm, the FQ2 results will cause short-term consternation. Box reported that cash flow from operations dipped $9.5 million and free cash flow fell $14.7 million. Both numbers were more than double the levels of last FQ2 and ended the trend of two quarters of positive cash flows. The market just isn't happy with money-losing operations and especially ones headed in the wrong direction. Box reported an improved net loss, but the free cash flow margin got larger at negative 12%. Source: Box FQ2'18 presentationThe company suggests timing issues are the cause for the typical dip during FQ2 and still forecasts achieving cash flow positive for the year ended January 31, 2018. The market though will initially provide a dip opportunity as questions always pop up in these scenarios where margins dip whether temporary or not. While the market is contemplating the company's ability to achieve cash flow goals, the stock is exceptionally cheap. The stock has now dipped to only an EV/sales multiple of 4.8x forward expectations. Box only has a market cap of $2.5 billion as revenues look to top $500 million this user. The key investor takeaway is that the market is missing a consistent grower trading at a reasonable multiple."
4090856,103480,2017-07-26T15:53:00-04:00,"Shares of Box have steadily rallied toward the $20 mark, where the stock debuted in January 2015 and has never since returned.After being dubbed a money-losing ""house of horrors"" and a cautionary tale against investing in tech IPOs, Box has emerged two years later as a mature, profitable SaaS business.Box shines as a case study of how Silicon Valley does (should do) business: Ignore Wall Street doomsayers, invest in growth, and reap profits on recurring revenues after achieving scale.Verticalized applications, strong billings, and a new enterprise-friendly COO are all catalysts that can vault the stock into a new bull run.","The Box (NYSE: BOX) of 2H17 appears, to most investors, remarkably different from the Box of January 2015, when a little-known dorm room company selling a service seemingly equivalent to Google Drive(NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had the audacity to go public, closing its first day of trading at $23 a share. It didn't take long for the company and its 29-year old dropout CEO, Aaron Levie, to draw fire under the fresh new scrutiny of Wall Street. Shares careened to $18, then $15 by mid-August, and finally dropped to its all-time low of $8.82 a full year later in January 2016. Since then, shares have quietly and steadily rallied, as investors have learned to trust in management's execution and in the strength of Box's billings growth and the impressive count of Fortune 500 clients on its trophy rack.Even as Wall Street flashed its sell signals and ordinary non-tech savvy investors turned their noses up at Box's losses, Box knew what it was doing. It poured cash aggressively into expanding its sales headcount (arguably the most important investment for an enterprise software company), knowing that recurring revenues at 70%-plus gross margins and 115% dollar-based retention were worth the investment. And bear in mind, those kinds of numbers are best-in-class in the Valley.Box is the rare fulfillment of the tech IPO promise: give us cash to fund our growth, and we'll reward you with profits later. Box has begun to turn that lever now, generating $8.5mm and $14.5mm in OCF on revenues of $117mm and $101mm in 1Q18 and 4Q17, respectively. And this is just the beginning: with gross margins in the 70s, Box is just on the cusp of capturing true operating leverage - at the far end of the spectrum, mature cloud companies such as Splunk (NASDAQ: SPLK) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) that are still in growth mode can generate OCF margins of 15-20%.Box reports 2Q18 earnings in early August, and I believe an earnings beat (Box has an unsullied history of beating expectations, eight out of eight quarters as a public company) will trigger a multiple expansion from its current level of ~4.5x EV/FTM revenues to >6x ($26), positioning the stock squarely above its IPO range without stretching its valuation.In the following sections, I will dissect Box's growth drivers, trajectory, and valuation. I will also discuss competing bear theses on Box. But, first things first ...It's a flagrant foul to analyze a software company's numbers out of context and without regard to its positioning in the IT landscape and its contributions to technological evolution. So, a quick overview on Box: at its core, Box Inc. is a subscription-based SaaS product that allows businesses large and small to store, share, and enhance files and documents. (It also lets individuals sign up for accounts - you can get 10GB of free storage for yourself at box.com - but we will ignore this unit for now, as it's not the revenue powerhouse of the company). The company was founded in 2005 by USC dropout Aaron Levie (CEO) and his childhood friend Dylan Smith (CFO), preceding Dropbox (DROPB) (2008) by three years and Google Drive (2012) by seven.While Dropbox has a very public feud with Box over who has the better product, it is largely a consumer-focused application. Dropbox likes to boast about its ""hundreds of millions"" of users - at which Box simply scoffs, as most of those users are non-paying. The enterprise IT community has put its vote of confidence in Box (64% of the Fortune 500 are paying users - a shortlist includes GE, P&G, Glaxosmithkline, KKR, and others). The Gartner Magic Quadrant (the software industry's equivalent of the Oscars) has named Box as a Leader in Enterprise File Sync And Share three years running, edging out a higher position over Dropbox Enterprise.Box has retained its status as enterprise IT's storage darling due to an immense set of enterprise-grade features: security controls and data governance (giving it an edge over Google Drive), seamless file sharing and cross-platform workability, and API capabilities that integrate powerful third-party enterprise applications such as Salesforce, Splunk, and Docusign within the convenience of the Box environment. In addition, go-to-market partnerships with IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) give Box an entryway into the CIOs of the world's largest enterprises, which form the core of Box's revenue base.Enterprises typically pay SaaS-style (per-month, per-user) for Box's services, billed annually upfront. Enterprise pricing is customized and undisclosed, but for reference, a standard small business Box account costs $15/user/mo. Enterprise deals with 1000-plus seats will probably run on per-user pricing a notch or two lower.Now let's turn to the dollars and cents. In June, Box delivered a four-point beat for the first quarter ending April 2017, reporting revenue of $117.2mm (+30% y/y) vs. consensus expectations of $114mm (+26% y/y). Billings clocked in at $99.6mm (+31% y/y), a strong y/y growth number despite the seasonally slow first quarter, and operating cash flow stood at $8.5mm vs ($4.2mm) in 1Q17.Key callouts in this quarter:Guidance calls for $502-$506mm in revenue (+29% y/y at the midpoint) for FY18.Let's take a look at Box's revenue and billings growth numbers to get an understanding of its growth glidepath.Figure 1. Box metricsNotice that Box's y/y revenue growth has exceeded 30% in every quarter (with the exception of 4Q17, due to a tough y/y comp). This is a rare feat for a software company at a $500mm scale. Billings, arguably the more important metric as a leading metric of future revenues (calculated as revenue plus change in deferred revenues), accelerated in the most recent quarter to +31% y/y growth. This stellar growth sets a nice tone for FY18, especially considering that it occurred during the seasonally slow first quarter (IT leaders are loath to sign new deals in the beginning of the calendar year, preferring to back-load spending nearer to when budgets close in December).Also note that Box's dollar-based retention (calculated as revenue from existing customers plus upsells, minus churn) has remained steadily above 100% while customer counts continue to climb nicely, indicating that revenue growth is being driven both by new accounts and deepening relationships with existing ones, an important indicator in a mature software company.Growth aside, the other important part of Box's resurrection narrative is that it is finally beginning to capture operating leverage. See below Box's operating expenses as a percent of revenues since going public:Figure 2. Operating expenses as % of revenuesIt doesn't take rigorous analysis to notice the declining trend across all three components of Box's operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. As revenues scale upward, operating expenses also increase, but not in a perfectly linear fashion. Coupled with a gross margin that has steadily held in the low 70s, this makes for a powerful forward trend as Box continues to grow at a healthy clip. Also, key to note is the decline in sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenues - though Box has managed to retain revenue growth in the 30s, it has also managed to drive increased sales efficiency.Let's also compare Box's operating metrics to its cloud/SaaS peers that have achieved maturity and scale to determine what Box could look like in 2-3 years (all data is taken from each company's most recent fiscal year end):Figure 3. Cloud/SaaS operating compsAs Box scales toward $500mm in revenues (expected to be achieved in FY18) and eventually toward $1bn, it will start looking more like the other companies in this chart. These comps can be considered as Box's long-term operating model. Figure 2 shows that Box has made steady progress each quarter in decreasing its operating expenses (especially sales and marketing spend) toward these target averages.Given continued growth and good execution, expect Box to continue capture operating leverage and begin to crank up its OCF yield. Box is already on track to deliver (small) positive OCF in the 5-8% range this year, which is impressive given its smaller scale relative to the comps in this table.So now we've established that Box is maintaining strong growth rates while making its first foray into profitability. The question now is: what is such an asset worth? Because no matter how solid a company is, an expensively valued stock still makes for a terrible investment (read: Snap).Figure 4. Box valuation (EV/FTM Rev), IPO to presentFor the majority of its life as a public company, Box has traded under 5x forward revenues, a significant discount to software peers growing at 30%-plus. While this caution may be warranted in 2015/2016 when investors were unsure that Box could continue to grow while achieving profitability, I believe this discount is no longer warranted.To construct a refreshed valuation framework for Box, let's take a look at other SaaS companies with a similar scale and growth profile:Figure 5. Cloud/SaaS trading compsNote on methodology: forward revenues are based on an extrapolation of management guidance; balance sheet figures are taken from the most recent quarter and market cap is based on close of trading on July 20, 2017.SaaS companies in the >30% growth bucket typically trade at >6x FTM revenues. The major exception is Box. One bear argument used to claim that Box deserved a lower multiple due to its staggering losses, a claim that is now debunked because A) Box has achieved OCF profitability and B) new IPOs such as Yext (NYSE: YEXT) and Cloudera (NYSE: CLDR) are posting similar losses or greater, yet is still trading at healthy multiples.Twilio (NYSE: TWLO) is a particularly instructive comp as a company of comparable revenue scale and barely positive OCF like Box. After shooting to >$70 post-IPO and becoming one of the most richly valued software stocks on the Nasdaq (at one point trading near 20x revenues), TWLO crumbled to the mid-$20s and has stabilized near $30, implying a ~6.5x multiple as shown above. The 6x range has acted as a floor for TWLO's valuation.Box, on the other hand, has been perennially undervalued below 5x. A strong Q2 and positive guidance should, in my opinion, push the stock into a new breakout and drive valuation toward 6x, implying a price target of $26.No equity analysis is complete without a nod to the opposing side, so we'll spend a second to consider their thoughts.Bear Thesis #1: Box is a Money-Losing ""House of Horrors""We've already spent considerable time discussing Box's new veneer of profitability, but despite posting two consecutive quarters of positive operating cash flow, this thesis just can't seem to go away.In this Bloomberg interview, Box was criticized for its overspending on sales and marketing and deemed a ""house of horrors"" with ""gory"" numbers. That perception has long cast a shadow over Box's reputation. Even Mark Cuban, who seeded Box with a $350K initial investment, said he would ""combust"" if he was running Box.The naysayers did not expect Box to achieve cash flow profitability. And let's also consider Box's liquidity - with $210 million of cash on the books, only $1.2 million in burn during fiscal 17 and an expected positive cash flow for fiscal 18, Box has some considerable flexibility before it ""combusts."" Face it - the Box of 2H17 just isn't the house of horrors it once was.Bear Thesis #2: Cloud Storage is Becoming a Commodity ServiceThis is a more interesting bearish proposition, and it's partially true. In 2017, the word ""cloud"" is no longer as exotic as it once was, and cloud infrastructure giants such as Amazon AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform are locked into a price war that is driving computing costs lower. Cloud infrastructure, after all, is nothing fancy; it's just a techy term for renting server racks and storage/compute services from third parties. Bears fear that storage players like Box will either be forced to lower pricing to compete or see their customers flee to competitors entirely.The key to overcoming this obstacle is to consider exactly what differentiates Box's service from the pure storage providers. After all, Box is not a bare-bones Google Drive that only acts as a repository for files. The reason Box has accumulated such a loyal base of Fortune 500 customers is due to its add-on services, security features, and API extension capabilities. Box enables workers to securely collaborate on files, manage version history and integrate with other cloud applications. Box's Platform offering, launched in 2015, allows Box to become a central hub for users' content, natively connecting Box files to 1,000-plus external applications while managing workflow and metadata.With these features, Box more closely resembles a PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) offering than a commoditized infrastructure play. Platforms, once installed and connected to a host of other applications are extremely sticky and difficult to unplug, a story corroborated by Box's high retention rates.With regard to pricing, see Box's gross margins below:Figure 6. Box gross marginsThe cloud price wars have been underway for years, yet Box's steady gross margins don't appear to convey price weakness. Obviously, the tech landscape is ever changing and investors will have to continually monitor margins and retention, but for now, Box's moat seems safe.Very few software companies reach the $500 million scale, and those that do are rewarded with consistently high valuations (Salesforce, Workday, etc.). For the majority of its life as a public company, Box has been shunted to the wayside. Now, as the company approaches Q2 earnings, it has notched multiple gold stars in its belt: growth at scale, along with continued solid business metrics and the beginnings of a path to profitability.Despite these factors and the recent run in the stock, Box still trades a turn or two below its closest peers. It is a rare, proven asset in an otherwise expensive market dominated by ""show-me"" stories. Continued product innovation, increased cloud adoption, a now-seasoned management team and a sizable company that is still hungry for growth should be able to bust expectations for quarters to come and lift the stock to a more appropriate multiple."

4067626,20521,2017-05-01T19:15:28-04:00,,"According to a recent report published by MarketsandMarkets, the cloud storage market size is estimated to grow $23.76 billion in 2016 to $74.94 billion by 2021. That translates to an annualized growth rate of 25.8% over the five-year period.Box’s FinancialsBox’s (NYSE: BOX) fourth quarter revenues grew 29% over the year to $109.9 million, ahead of the market’s expectations of $108.8 million. But the company continued to suffer losses and ended the quarter with a loss of $0.10 per share. However, it was better than the market’s expected loss of $0.13 per share. During the quarter, billings grew 22% to $159.3 million.Box ended the year with revenues growing 32% to $398.6 million with billings improving 23% to $454.2 million. Non-GAAP net loss per share improved to $0.56 per share compared with loss of $1.12 per share reported a year ago.For the current quarter, Box forecast revenues of $114-$115 million, and a net loss of $0.14-$0.15 per share. The Street had a forecast of revenues of $115 million and a loss of $0.12 per share. Box expects to end the year with revenues of $500-$504 million, and a net loss of $0.45-$0.49 per share. The market was looking for revenues of $501 million and a loss of $0.41 per share for the year.Box’s Product EnhancementsTo expand its market reach, Box has been working on new products. During the quarter, it released the new Box Notes web and desktop apps that help in driving real-time collaboration across teams while ensuring that the system meets the security, governance, and compliance needs of large enterprises. The real-time collaboration tool has been built into the Box app and offers an intuitive web application for fast collaboration. It allows users to access and pull up notes through a sidebar, mark and retrieve bookmarked notes, and is available right from the desktop for both Mac and PC Operating systems. Box is now working on making the service available offline so that users will be able to utilize the service whenever they want to. When they connect with the Internet, Box Notes will sync to Box so that everyone will have the latest, up-to-date version.As part of its integration enhancements, it expanded the service to include Office 365 on Android. Now Box is available across the entire Office product suite and offers improved Excel preview capabilities so that the Box and Office user experience are more seamless. It has also improved its IBM integration through the Box + IBM Cloud Connections, so that users can now store, share, access, and update their Box content within the IBM Connections environment.Box has been driving growth through two key focus areas. First, it has been innovating in cloud content management through the release of additional products and platform capabilities that help enterprises move to the cloud. Second, it has been investing in global go-to-market efforts to reach more enterprises all around the world. As part of its second initiative, it has been releasing Box Zones that allow global enterprises to store their Box data locally. During the last quarter, it added Australia and Canada to the Box Zones program.Its stock is trading at $16.93 with a market capitalization of $2.2 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $18.36 in February this year. It has recovered from the 52-week low of $9.86 it had fallen to in July last year. The stock appears to have made a recovery considering that it had been trending at below list price of $14 each for most of the year. Prior to listing, Box had raised $560 million. Its last funding round was held in January 2014, when it raised $150 million at a valuation of $2.6 billion.Meanwhile, Box’s competition from startup Dropbox is continuing at a stronger pace. Dropbox is still privately held and does not disclose detailed financials. It did, however, recently announce that after achieving a positive free cash flow position last year, it has now passed an annual revenue run rate of $1 billion. Dropbox does not disclose detailed financials, but analysts estimate that it ended last year with revenues of $750 million.Dropbox has raised $600 million in venture funding so far. Its last funding round was held in January 2014 when it raised $350 million at a valuation of $10 billion. Valuation has since fallen to nearly half, and Dropbox has also relied increasingly on debt funding to run its business. Many were expecting Dropbox to go public soon. But the company has been delaying plans of going public, partly due to the dismal performance of Box so far. Recently, it also announced the access to a new $600 million line of credit (LoC) facility with six banks. While the LoC may not signify any material impact on the timing of the IPO, it does give Dropbox more flexibility to defer the IPO, if needed.Dropbox is also improving its offerings to attract more enterprise customers. It recently unveiled Smart Sync, a feature that allows users to see and access all of their files, whether stored in the cloud or on a local hard drive, from their desktop. The service is available to enterprise customers for a fee based on the number of employees who use it. It has also released Dropbox Paper, a collaboration service that allows groups to create, edit, and collaborate on projects in a single workspace. The service is available to users in 21 languages."
4070928,102646,2017-05-09T02:10:03-04:00,"Box and Carbonite have a lot of similarities.They were started in the same year, but Box became a household name.I explain why it is better to invest in Carbonite than Box.The thesis assumes that Box won't be acquired.","In 2015, Box (BOX) launched its IPO, raising $175 million at a $1.6 billion valuation. Since then, not much has happened. Although its valuation has gone up to $2.5 billion, it’s stock has trailed the Nasdaq 100 index which is made up of technology companies. Its annual revenue has increased from $216 million in 2014 to $399 million in 2016. It has beaten analysts' estimates in both earnings and revenue since its IPO.Box has increased its total number of users to more than 52 million, although just 16% of them pay. More than 71,000 companies – including 64% of Fortune 500 companies – use its products for cloud storage and sharing. It has a churn rate of 3% and an impressive retention rate of about 115%.There are several reasons why Box has underperformed past the IPO. It competes with companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG) which have better economies of scale. For instance, Google Drive comes preinstalled on most Android phones. Also, as other SA contributors have mentioned, Box is a misunderstood company. While its product is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Onedrive, and Apple Drive, its main target is different from them. I believe that’s the reason why most Fortune 500 companies use its product over the others. Also, investors are concerned with the company’s growth prospects.Box has never turned a profit and its net loss has increased from $116 million in 2012 to $150 million in 2016. This increase is attributed to its OpEx which has gone up from $153 million to $437 million in the same period. For such companies, investors are always willing to take losses as the companies invest in growth. The question is, how long will it take for Box to make money for its investors.To better answer this question, we need to look at Carbonite (CARB) - a company that is very similar to Box.Carbonite is a cloud backup company that targets small and medium-sized businesses. To an extent, Carbonite competes with companies like Box and Dropbox (DROPB). In fact, Carbonite’s customers are unlikely to use Box’s services because they can access their files and documents remotely and across devices. Its other competitors are companies like International Business Machines (IBM), Oracle (ORCL), Mozy, and iDrive that offer cloud and hybrid backup solutions.Carbonite held its IPO in 2011 and is currently valued at $613 million. Just like Box, it was established in 2005. Its revenue has increased from $84 million in 2012 to $206 million in 2016, but it has never turned a profit. It does not publish its user statistics, but in 2011, the company had more than a million paid users.The table below compares the revenues and operating expenses for the two companies in the past four years.BoxCarboniteData from MorningstarAs you can see, in 2013, Box made $17 million more than Carbonite. The difference increased by $197 million in 2016. The devil is in the detail. In 2016, although Box’s revenue increased to $399 million, its operating expenses increased to $437 million. On the other hand, Carbonite’s total operating expenses were just $149 million. In short, Box is spending more money in operating expenses than it's making in revenues.Most of Box’s operating expenses are going to sales and marketing. In 2016, the company spent $226 million (or 56% of revenue) on sales and marketing. On the other hand, Carbonite spent just $73 million (or 35% of revenue) on sales and marketing. This means that Box is paying more costs on customer acquisition than Carbonite. For how long will this continue?The table below compares the percentage of sales and marketing costs to revenue for select SAAS companies in the past four years.Data from YChartsThe percentage of Carbonite’s sales and marketing expenses to revenue is lower than that of Box and other SAAS companies. Yet, its YoY revenue is growing by almost 20%. Remember, Carbonite is a small company that does not get a lot of media attention – thus free marketing – the same way Box does. For instance, in the past one year, Box has been mentioned in TechCrunch more than 200 times, while there was no mention of Carbonite. This means that Carbonite has managed to perform well compared to other companies.As I mentioned, Box and Carbonite are different companies with similar products that target different type of customers. For instance, if you are a paying Carbonite subscriber, you will have no need for Box’s services. This is because, in both services, your documents and files are backed up in the cloud and you can access them remotely across devices. Therefore, to stay relevant, and to attract new customers, the companies must invest in both research and development, and acquisitions. In the past 4 years, Box has spent $328 million on R&D (or 31.2% of revenue), while Carbonite has spent $105 million (or 18%) of revenue on R&D.Box has spent a lot of money on R&D, but the product remains the same, albeit with a few new features. The features are shown below. Therefore, Box remains largely a one-product company. This is what separates the company from its competitors. On the other hand, Carbonite has diversified its offerings to include storage, data protection, and disaster recovery through acquisitions. In 2015, the company spent $15 million to acquire eVault, and in January, it spent $65 million to acquire Double-Take Software. Therefore, Carbonite’s data storage customers might also use its other products for disaster recovery or data protection.Source: Box PresentationSince the two companies do not expect to make a profit this year, I will not compare their PE ratios. Using the (less-effective) forward PS ratio, it is evident that Carbonite is currently trading at a bargain. It has a PS ratio of 2.8, while Box has a ratio of 3.9. The SAAS companies mentioned above have a PS ratio of 7.4, 5.0, 5.7, and 4.95. Part of the reason why investors are paying a premium for Box is that they expect it to be acquired. A few months ago, a list of potential acquisitions by Salesforce showed that Box was under consideration. The leaked document can be found here. Another reason is that Box has a higher growth rate. It has a quarterly YoY growth rate of about 25%. However, as mentioned, this growth is coming at a higher cost compared to Carbonite, which has a growth rate of about 20%.Final ThoughtsCarbonite and Box were started in the same year, but the latter became more famous. Since the two companies operate in a similar niche, it is very easy to compare them. Their revenues have grown significantly in the past few years. However, as I have shown, Box spends more money to acquire customers than Carbonite. Its operating expenses as a percentage of revenue are higher. Carbonite has also achieved a positive EBITDA, which means that its profitability might be near. Box’s main advantage over Carbonite is the amount of free advertisement that it receives. Still, Box’s sales and marketing expenses as a share of revenue are much higher. Another advantage that Box has over Carbonite is its customer retention rate, which is at 115% compared to Carbonite’s 86%. Still, I believe this is a good number for a company that is not well known."
4089710,52592,2017-07-24T00:02:57-04:00,"Last quarter, Box achieved record revenue results and generated positive free cash flow.International exposure could also be impacted by the weakening dollar.Strong revenue growth, cash flows and many other reasons could make Box an acquisition target.","Earnings season is heating up and Box (BOX) has an interesting story to tell. As a cloud management play that works with organizations of various sizes in various industries, from Microsoft (MSFT) to McDonald’s (MCD). With no profits and no P/E, the stock is valued around 4.5 2018 EV/revenue, which is lofty. What should investors keep a lookout for on the earnings report?Last quarter, Box guided for $121-122mn in revenue for Q2, and -0.13 non-GAAP EPS. Estimize, a crowd-sourced earnings estimate community, polls users and has been more accurate than an average of Wall St. metrics for many companies, including Box:As we can see, over the last few quarters, the Estimize estimates have tracked more closely to actual results, and in Q2 it expects a loss of 0.10 EPS and $123mn, both above Wall St. and Box’s guidance. Perhaps we are looking at a beat.In Q1, Box reported record revenue of $117mn, above the high-end of guidance, 30% up YoY. The stock reacted positively, and after spiking almost 10% in the following days, Box has come off its highs and is up around 5% since the call. The company subsequently guided for $121mn for the quarter, with FY18 guided at roughly $500mn.The sentiment around the stock has been relatively bullish for a while now, as the 50-day moving average has remained bullishly ahead of the 100-day. When a crossover of the 50-day over the 100-day occurs, it can signal momentum in one direction or the other:A recurring theme we believe will show up in other earnings reports this season and which should impact Box is this year’s declining US dollar. We have pointed out in past articles how in the past, a strong dollar smacked earnings of multinational companies like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Now, the trend may be reversing, and multinational companies with international revenue and profits could stand to benefit. Box has many international deals, and CFO Dylan Smith cited “strong international growth as being a pretty strong contributor” to Q2 2018 overperformance. CEO Aaron Levie commented that “[w]e saw particularly strong traction in our international markets, including Japan and Canada, growth in new products[.]”With the dollar weakness largely unforeseen by many and with Box’s growing international exposure, earnings are set to be favorably impacted, especially in YoY comparisons.Box makes an interesting acquisition target for a handful of reasons. Its recent breakthrough in becoming cash-flow positive marks a turning point in the company’s history. Box ended the last quarter with roughly $210mn in cash and expects FY 2018 to be the first full year of positive free cash flow. It also has roughly half a billion dollars in debt on the balance sheet. Its market cap might be the most compelling number of all, at a mere $2.9bn, or a drop in the bucket for major tech companies like Microsoft, Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Box's GAAP operating loss of $40mn was an acceleration from the year-ago quarter and could also reduce the tax burden of an acquirer.Box’s 30% YoY revenue growth, on track to $1bn soon, could also provide an impetus for revenue growth. Indeed, MSFT took on LinkedIn before it reached $1bn in revenue and paid a hefty premium. Box already partners with Microsoft, having integration “across Office 365 experiences” and currently services 74,000 different customers. In fact, many potential acquirers could find the company’s finances and growth profile to be compelling. Other reasons like the talent and personnel at Box, and its leadership in a growing cloud management industry, make it a compelling idea for many.With earnings only a few weeks away, Box stands to gain from its international exposure and the weakening US dollar. We are hoping management provides more detail on its ability to “have a number of these new product capabilities for customers’ to being to use Box more as that system of record…certainly buying our additional products and rolling Box out.” And remember, due to “seasonality of billings” Q2 is typically Box’s weakest quarter for cash flow and an earnings miss could also provide an entry point to pick up shares as well."
4078251,22148,2017-06-02T00:13:16-04:00,Box beat FQ1 EPS estimates.The cloud content management company continues innovating to grow the TAM.The stock is only at a reasonable value now after the gift price last year.,"After the close yesterday, Box (NYSE:BOX) reported FQ1 financial results that again generally beat analyst estimates. The cloud content management company has completely altered the original negative view by Wall Street typical of the hot IPOs from the last few years.It is now trading above $20, potentially changing the equation from my original recommendation at the start of the year. Is the stock still a buy after a sharp 40% rally this year?For FQ1, Box performed on all major financial fronts. Revenue, billings, and deferred revenues all grew at least 30% over last year. And possibly more importantly, the company again produced positive free cash flows.Guidance for FY18 remains healthy, allowing for investors to value the company as a fast-growing SaaS stock versus worrying about negative margins. Box only currently trades at 5x sales estimates for this year, which is actually low for a software platform.Its ability to show leverage in the results is a big part of the changing investor sentiment. The difference between the company reporting quarterly losses in the $0.30 range and the losses dropping to the $0.10 range per quarter makes the market more comfortable that breakeven is near.In the last quarter, the operating loss declined to 14% of revenues, down from a rather large 25% back in FQ1 last year. The leverage in the system contributed to a $20 million improvement in operating cash flows on only a $27 million gain in revenues.As well, the company continues growing product lines, and innovation is a big part of the investment thesis. Box has consistently grown the product lines in the last few years to where the original core product isn't a big part of its revenues anymore.For this reason, analyst Brian White placed Box as a stock to buy for 2017, which caught my initial interest. The analyst sees a total addressable market of $45 billion, placing the current annual revenue target of $500 million at only a fraction above 1% of the market.The key investor takeaway is that Box remains a reasonably priced stock after what was a gift price over the last year."
4077680,24400,2017-05-31T11:57:44-04:00,"Investors who are looking for a cloud stock that can delivered outsized returns in the next 12 to 18 months should give BOX a long look.BOX, which has beaten Wall Street’s earnings estimates in six straight quarter, no longer presents the same risks as it did before.With revenues still climbing at a 30% clip, combined with improving margins and cash flow, BOX stock — currently at around $18 — should reach $22 by year's end.","Cloud-based collaboration platform company Box (NYSE:BOX) is set to report first quarter earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday. And investors who are looking for a cloud stock that can deliver outsized returns in the next 12 to 18 months should give Box a long look.Indeed, with these shares already up 30% this year, BOX is not the bargain it was six months ago. At the same time, the Redwood City, Calif.-based tech company, which has beaten Wall Street's earnings estimates in six straight quarter, no longer presents the same risks as it did before. And with revenues still climbing at a 30% clip, combined with improving margins and cash flow, BOX stock - currently at around $18 - should reach $22 by the end of the year, delivering more than 20% returns.Part of the reason has to do with the fact that, despite BOX operating at a loss, the rate at which the company is moving towards profitability continues to accelerate. Box is projected to lose 47 cents this year, compared to 56-cent loss a year ago. But here's the thing: Based on fiscal 2018 projected loss of 21 cents, the rate of improvement jumps from 9 cents this year to 26 cents next year.The rising profitability is driven by the investments Box continues to make in its platform, particularly in areas such as security, compliance and administrative technology. And combined with plans to hire more sales personnel, Box should be able to leverage its partnerships with leading enterprise cloud computing technology giants such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), among others.On Wednesday the company is expected to report an adjusted loss of 14 cents on revenues of $115 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when it lost 18 cents on revenue of $90 million. In the fourth quarter BOX disappointed the Street by offering an outlook that missed estimates, sending its shares down sharply by 8% to around $16. Investors looked beyond the fact that BOX - for the first time - hit free cash flow positive during the quarter.Rob Owens, analysts at Pacific Crest was quick to reiterate a Buy rating on the shares, while raising his price target to $25 from $21. Assuming BOX posts another beat and raise on Wednesday, BOX stock could very well reach Owens' $25 target much sooner rather than later, especially with BOX forming partnerships that will help it better leverage its cloud-computing technologies.That said, with the shares already up 45% in twelve months, I'm modeling a more conservative target of $22 to account not only for some profit-taking, but also for the fact that the target doesn't divert to widely from the company's earnings and EBITDA capabilities, which are yet to breakeven."

Whether or not Snap can ever live up to its sky high valuation or whether Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram will cripple Snap, only time will tell. What we do know though, is that huge IPOs like Snap frequently consume most of the attention, and other valuable stock IPOs can sometimes fly under the radar. In January, 2015 a cloud based enterprise storage provider and mobile business collaboration platform, Box Inc. (NYSE:BOX) went public. The IPO failed to generate the hype of a Facebook, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), or Snap, however, the company could be an interesting growth play going forward in 2017.Box went public just over two years ago and its stock surged from the IPO. After the IPO though, its share price declined most of 2015, and then found a bottom in 2016. This year, Box had seen its share price run up almost 20%, but after its latest earnings call on March 1, 2017, Box saw its share price fall 8%. The story behind the recent price action could be an intriguing one.Earnings:Box reported Q4 2017 earnings that beat analyst expectations. EPS came in at a loss of $0.10, compared to analyst projections of a loss of $0.14. Revenue was $109.9 million, compared to analyst projections of $108.9 million; a 29% increase. Perhaps most impressive though, was that CEO Aaron Levie said two years ago that Box would be free cash flow positive by Q4 2017, and that is exactly what happened. Box reported FCF of $10 million, compared to a loss of $21 million in the previous years period. Billings were also up 22% for the quarter.If Box reported strong earnings and revenue, why did Box's stock price fall post conference call? Guidance. Box projected an EPS loss of $0.14-0.15 for Q1 2018, compared to a consensus estimate of $0.12. Despite earnings the revenue guidance was pretty much in line though. Box projected to bring in $114-115 million, compared to the consensus revenue estimate of $115.15.Our Take:Although the companies guidance was weaker than expected, the CEO came out and said that the lower EPS would be related to investing in growth. Since the revenue projections are relatively in line, I do not EPS as a reason for concern here. The CEO also made some other comments that caught my attention. He said that Box would remain free cash flow positive for the full year of 2018 and focus much of the cash on investing in growth. Annually Box is projected to earn $500-504 million in revenue in fiscal year 2018 compared to $398.6 million this past year; about a 26% growth rate.Levie said Box will be focusing on large deals in the enterprise segments that have fueled its growth recently. Box is attempting to help these large enterprises migrate their data from files, into the cloud. I think the business model and overall story seems compelling. As long as revenue growth stays on track, I do not see EPS as a cause for concern in 2017.One area for concern could be competition. Even though Box has partnered with IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) in the enterprise market, its largest rivals remains Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and privately held Dropbox. Alphabet is a cash machine and has beaten out competitors all across the board. That being said, it's no wonder Box is trying to be aggressive and invest in growth because if they do not, I'm sure Alphabet will take full advantage of the opportunity."
4033804,72585,2017-01-04T07:15:00-05:00,BOX possesses a sticky and defensible business with extremely low churn rates and great opportunities for product cross-selling.Supercharged growth with high sales and marketing costs hides the true underlying profitability.Enterprise cloud and Box's revenues should grow at 20%+ CAGR rates over the next five years.Opportunity to leverage the fixed-cost base as revenues grow further.,"OverviewBox (NYSE:BOX) provides a SaaS enterprise content management platform that enables small to large organizations to securely manage enterprise content while allowing secure access and sharing of this content. It provides modern cloud architecture combined with enterprise-grade security and controls, and integration to multiple corporate technology solutions.I believe the market does not have a good understanding of Box's product offering, its business model and its value to the corporate clients. Furthermore, very few investors seem to possess an understanding of the reasoning behind Box operating with strongly negative EBITDA and being unwilling to switch to profitability. One of the reasons for the volatile trading of its shares may be that Box went public too early. But this in turn creates an attractive opportunity for investors who can distill what is going on behind the stock's financials and understand the business's fundamentals.Box's total addressable market in storage is huge and projected to reach $23bn by 2019 and to grow at above 20% CAGR over the next five years based on IDC's data, where the company is among the best pure plays of this supercycle. The largest companies are just starting to feel comfortable with keeping their data in the cloud, and penetration rates would be growing in the foreseeable future. Based on the estimates from IDC's figures, currently Box holds around 2.3% of the storage market, and I believe it should reach 3-3.5% by 2019 via more aggressive marketing and taking share from the legacy providers.Cloud commoditization and the corporate marketIt is frequently said that cloud storage is a pure commodity and limited differentiation between the providers. In fact, the picture is different if you look at the enterprise cloud. Box offers a complete package with multiple integrations and collaboration features, which create effective barriers to entry and greatly increase switching costs.Also, it is typically thought that a company like Dropbox is a direct competitor for Box. But in fact, Dropbox serves a very different type of customer being fully focused on consumers and small businesses, while Box specializes in small- to large-sized businesses which got very different requirements.The next element which I believe is not well understood by the market is that you cannot simply start using any cloud storage provider across the enterprise. Enterprise cloud as a product and business is different to the consumer cloud. It is important to differentiate the two since the former has much higher user retention and LTV.Corporate users have comprehensive compliance requirements, data protection policies, access management, information governance, data residency and analytics requirements. In turn, Box is the only platform which can comprehensively meet all those enterprise needs. For example, with Box, you can collaborate with both internal and external parties in a controlled environment.Is Box competitive in the long run?The testimony of cloud platform differentiation is Box's partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has its own well-established cloud storage offering. Microsoft is working to integrate its enterprise solutions with Box's platform and hence would be driving Box's sales forward in the future. From Microsoft's perspective, it would be making more from other software sales via easy Box integration other than trying to compete in the data platform space directly. Furthermore, Box explicitly underlined that it is hardly competing with Microsoft directly.The below chart summarizes the current state of the enterprise app and data management, which is highly clustered and unstructured and the reason why Box is competitive vs. larger providers:(click to enlarge)Source: Box, Inc.The main differentiator of Box vs. other corporate cloud storage providers is its integration with all the apps used by enterprises including custom apps and Box apps, which allows centralizing everything on the Box's platform and easily share and collaborate across the company. Box prides itself on the best collaboration functionality, which is based on the growing number of products used by companies and employees need to work across apps effectively and key info internally.Developing effective and user-friendly collaboration software is extremely complex since user behavior is hard to predict and analyze and developing a solution which is loved by end-users takes a very long time and multiple product iterations. As a result, it is widely unappreciated that UI/UX together with the underlying technology represents a strong competitive advantage and over two years' worth of time lead in front of competitors that try replicating it. This is based on the prevailing software development cycles, where it takes at least 18 months to develop an enterprise software product from scratch and at least further 12 months to refine the product and become competitive with the incumbent players. This time lead can be used to acquire key users and improve the product even further to make competing with it much less lucrative.Source: Box, Inc.In short, there is large differentiation across enterprise cloud providers and product is nowhere near being a commodity. Providers compete on multiple factors: enterprise-grade security and compliance; ease of user experience; scalable product and infrastructure for large deployments; low-cost, quick deployment; depth of integration into enterprise applications such as office productivity, desktop and mobile tools. The notion of Box's product differentiation is reinforced by its 26 issued US patents, 15 issued UK patents and two Canadian patents that directly relate to its technology with a further 84 pending patents in the US and 16 pending applications internationally.Growth and increased business stickiness via partnershipsBox's partnerships were major growth drivers recently by expanding reach to a much wider user base, and at much lower marketing and user acquisition costs. Benefits of partnerships can be divided into two categories: 1) added distribution and growth for the core products and 2) partnerships that increase the value of the technology.For example, the recent partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM) contributed significantly to Box's results in the last quarter, including eight six-figure deals and enabling its reseller network to go-to market with Box. The IBM deal provided customer wins in markets where Box doesn't necessarily have a lot of penetration like international markets or highly regulated industries.In the case of IBM, it has a large set of products which help businesses to operate on the backend, where in turn Box helps IBM users inside the company to share and collaborate when using those products. There would be sizable benefits from this in the long term since IBM would be helping Box with go-to-market, provide support for its consulting division, build solutions around Box and essentially act as a new major distribution channel. Box's tech becomes more valuable on the back of the above integrations and the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) partnership.Secondly, the upcoming partnership and integration with Google will allow Box's customers to seamlessly work with Google Docs, Google Sheet and Slides, where Box would be acting as the centralized constant management solution. This partnership again reflects the strength of Box's cloud offering and its technologies in the enterprise segment since Google owns the highly popular Google Drive. But due to its product and technologies, Box works better as the central content platform for enterprises, where admins can protect files with strong security controls and reporting, customer-managed encryption, rights management, and mobile security. This would both increase the value of Box's tech and allow to reach multiple new customers who are existing Google users.Market growthThere is a cloud switching mega trend for enterprise data storage, which would offer a very strong growth to all the key participants in the sector, including Box. Additionally, the industry would likely get more consolidated and competitive pricing pressures would weaken. The reason behind the cloud trend is evident from the research by Forrester, which suggested $2m average per company savings from retiring traditional storage and enterprise content management and 20% improvement in user productivity. The set of established participants is well defined at this stage, and unlikely to grow since barriers to new entrants are steep due to great cost disadvantage upon entry.Box's recent financial data reflects that cloud switching trend continues its strong growth path since the company posted significant growth in deferred revenue for Q3 2017 with $192.6mil, which amounts to an increase of 36% from the same period last year. This is the money that was received from clients in advance of services and provides strong revenue visibility.Box's total addressable market:(click to enlarge)Source: Box Inc., IDCAnother major misconception by the market regarding Box is that it is purely a storage market play. In reality, storage represents only half of the Box's large and fast growing addressable market, and the company is part of large markets in file sync, content management and platform related apps, which are estimated to reach a combined $23bn by 2019 according to data from IDC.Making sense of marketing expenseThe case of Box - the more it spends on growing revenue right now, the larger its market share will end up in the long term since the product is highly captive for the users. Once the enterprise committed to one of the cloud providers and deployed its software and data, switching to an alternative is extremely complex and costly, and Box can sell further products with low user acquisition cost once a corporate client is using one of its products.For example, Q3 2017 client retention rate for Box was at 115%, which is an outstanding result for the business and its products; retention rate is defined as the net % of TAV (total account value) retained from existing customers, including expansion. Great retention was further supported by Box's 3% churn rate, which is much less than 8-10% churn of the traditional SaaS providers. Platform APIs, data retention, and workflow tools which form part of daily user routine and get integrated into further applications and processes continue to drive customer stickiness. Essentially this means seat growth in existing customers was at 18% and the company is strongly benefiting from product cross-selling.This makes the customer lifetime value for Box's platform very high and justifies the current marketing expense being at 58% of revenue. It is a poor measure to simply look into how much revenue is generated by the marketing expense in the same year (where Box ranks pretty poorly at the moment). E.g. Spending $1 to generate $1.5 revenue in year 1 and none in year 2 would be much inferior to spending $2 to generate $1 in year 1, 2, 3 and 4.The economics of Box and long-term customer value can be well illustrated by the 2010 client cohort (every customer acquired in 2010). In 2010FY, this cohort showed only $2.8mil revenue and a strongly negative contribution margin (revenue from the acquired customers in excess of the variable costs). In turn by 2014FY, the revenue from the same customer cohort reached $14.4mil with 34% contribution margin and $19mil annualized equivalent during the nine months of 2015FY.Source: Box, Inc.Neglect of the long-term customer value in favour of revenue per $ of marketing cost is among the main reasons why Box's stock offers an opportunity for long-term investors despite its lack of profitability.Leveraging the fixed cost baseBox is enjoying declining sales and marketing expense as % of revenue since customer expansion and acquisition costs fall due to the business model nature and would continue doing so as the business grows further. Box's ability to greatly leverage its fixed cost base is evident from the historical data, where sales and marketing expense fell from 138% of revenue in 2014 to the current 65%.Source: Box, Inc.The company continues to expand contracts with existing customers, and as its renewal base grows, the natural leverage in the SaaS model kicks in since those sales tend to be much more efficient. Rep productivity increased by 10% year on year, according to the latest quarterly data, and further improvements are expected this year because the sales force becomes more experienced and it has more of the newer products to sell.As a result of those efficiency improvements, Box has sharply cut its cash burn vs. last FY with recent free cash flow at -11% of revenue, which is a sizable improvement to -48% in same period last year. This also illustrates the strong skills of management and ability to get to breakeven or profitability in case the deteriorating cash position requires doing so.FCF as the share of revenue:Source: Box, Inc.Temporarily elevated R&D expenseIt should be appreciated that Box is investing disproportionately high amounts of money in R&D to solidify its technological lead and deliver new products and technologies that would allow capturing more customers in the long term and remain more competitive in the immediate term.But such expenses would be falling in the future as % of revenue as Box grows further, acquires more corporate users and its leading position strengthens. For example, it was spending 26% of revenue on R&D in FY16 (31% in FY15) and announced target at 16% once it reaches $1bn in revenues.ValuationThe company is on the trajectory to generate $1bn revenues in four years' time and it is just the matter of time before it gets there since the storage market combined with auxiliary markets is huge and growing fast. Management provided guidance that Box would begin to prioritize FCF margin optimization in favor of growth once it reaches $1bn revenue mark.(click to enlarge)Source: CapitalIQ, catalyst.comHence, in three years, we can expect Box to move away from the current focus on supercharged growth towards sustainable long-term cash generation. This implies FCF visibility should be much stronger and priced in by FY2020. Given the lack of comparables to value a SaaS company in the normalized growth state, I would apply historical revenue multiples of those companies. Looking at the SaaS universe reveals a long-term median valuation multiple around 5x LTM revenue. For FY2020 target multiple for Box, we can assume 3.5x LTM revenue or 70% of historical SaaS company median. Those projections are based on Box's slowing growth at that point towards longer-term rates. Based on the above revenue target and applying conservative revenue growth projections of 30% and 25% over the next two years, the stock offers 43% upside with the three-year time perspective.A near-term upside is created by the short being at 15% of the stock's total float. Continued revenue growth of the company combined with improving profitability over the next two years may lead to the squeeze of those shorts and stock overshooting on the upside. Reduction in marketing and R&D expense as the share of revenue over the next year can act as an additional catalyst since it would make it easier to understand the potential profitability of the stock.ConclusionHigh growth SaaS businesses such as Box are not well understood since typical earnings-based valuation approaches which apply the last 12 months' financials don't work well there. This provides an attractive opportunity for the investors who understand the underlying business fundamentals and can take advantage from the enterprise cloud supercycle. The company would be reducing its cash burn over time and leverage its fixed cost base, which would lead to the stock's repricing. There is widespread view that cloud is a commodity-like product. As Box normalizes its operating margins, it would become more evident to the market that the company possesses a sticky product with good pricing power instead of being a commodity, which in turn would lead to further share price increase by reducing the risk premium."
4058493,98236,2017-03-28T12:25:44-04:00,Box reported the results of its fiscal year earlier this month.The company over-attained operating result expectations noticeably.The company offered what was considered to be disappointing guidance for the current fiscal year.Careful analysis suggests that the guidance is based on a level of expense growth that seems highly unlikely.The company is pivoting from being a business that outsources data storage for clients into a company that is focused on opportunities in Enterprise Information Management and Workflow Management.,"Box - How is this company planning on not falling victim to the reversion to the mean maladyA few weeks ago, Box (NYSE:BOX) reported the results of its fiscal Q4. The results in many respects are very similar to those of many smaller enterprise software vendors. The company beat the prior consensus for operating results in terms of revenues, earnings and cash flow. Its backlog grew but its forecast both for Q1 and for its entire fiscal 2018 year were below prior expectations. The shares fell 8% the next day and have fallen an additional 2% since that time. That said, despite the recent sell-off, the shares are up 33% over the past year. The shares are up a bit more than that since I wrote on the name a bit more than a year ago. When looked at as a whole, last year was one in which the company handily exceeded its initial business objective in terms of earnings and had a decent performance in terms of reported revenues as well. (Initial guidance was for revenues of $390-$394 million with non-GAAP losses forecast to be $.85-$.82; actual results for the year of $398 million of revenues with a non-GAAP loss of $.54). Bookings showed decent trends for the year, but were less than stellar in last year's fiscal Q1 which had a noticeably negative performance on share price performance at that point.Like many companies with SaaS models, the company's billings are determined both by the volume of contracts and the length of contract terms - the reason why some vendors have dropped reporting a billings metric. In the case of Box, the change in contract terms resulted in a growth in calculated billings of 22% but a growth of 28% when adjusted for term length.Will the company really show no progress in terms of improvement in operating margin metrics this year? Revenues are forecast to grow by 26% at the mid-point or more than $100 million. Revenues grew by $96 million, or 32% last year and were up by 29% last quarter. Operating expenses for the full year grew by 5% and were up by 7% in Q4. Stock-based comp was up by 32% last year and by 40% last quarter. Those kinds of trends suggest that the company will either dramatically re-accelerate growth or will do much better in terms of non-GAAP EPS. I will suggest the latter is more probable. And beating EPS significantly while growing in the mid-high 20 percent range ought to allow the shares to see reasonable appreciation and produce another year of positive alpha.BOX has a consistent record since it has been public of beating its EPS forecasts significantly - 8 times in a row at this point. I have no reason to believe that the forecasts in terms of earnings for both Q1 and for the full year of fiscal 2018 (ending 1/31/18) will prove to be much different. I will return to looking at the details of the earnings forecast as presented; I think before doing so it makes sense to look at bookings and growth and how the company will actually segue into profitability and deal with the many competitive issues that have and continue to concern investors.Box - How does a company that stores data in the cloud manage to grow and even achieve positive cash flow?Basically, the issues that need discussion at this point involve differentiation and the company's competitive moat. In the long run, nothing else is going to matter significantly. Selling storage is simply not a long-term business strategy for this company. It has to be able to offer its users something that is either cheaper or more functional than solutions that are available elsewhere. The nature of Box's pivot is the subject for much of the rest of this article.At this point, very few users are going to be using Box simply to store data. They don't have to and they aren't. The company is selling content management solutions these days that offer a substantial level of governance, security and MSFT Office integration. It is the features as much as the storage that constitute what Box sells and constitute the competitive moat. And it is the features that offer the best opportunity for the company to achieve a reasonable level of non-GAAP profitability in the near future. Box Governance provides the company with a 30% uplift to its average monthly revenues. Box Zones is a service that allows users to utilize Box technology while keeping their data in a local venue in order to comply with local legislation. KeySafe is a service that allows users to install encrypted keys on access to sensitive documents. The company said that KeySafe was the key enabler of a $1 million deal last quarter. The oldest of these service, Governance has only be offered for 18 months; the other services are newer still.When investors consider Box, it would be an error to think of the company just in the context of storing data on the web. The company mainly sells to large enterprises that are looking to outsource a significant component of their document retention and security requirements to a 3rd party. That is a very different market with different parameters when compared to simply storing data in a box - regardless of whether the data is in the cloud or anywhere else.Most of the users that ultimately wind up Box are doing so after evaluating Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) SharePoint and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) OneDrive. Both MSFT and OneDrive are far less expensive than Box. It was never feasible for Box to drive to compete with the data storage capabilities of much larger rivals where the technology heavily favors larger vendors in terms of costs and efficiency. Users who choose Box are doing so because of the features the company offers and not because of the company's core storage functionality.The company is not going to be successful without introducing a significant number of new features every year. The market is anything but static and what is a differentiator one year will wind up being not much more than a feature offered by larger companies in two or three years. Some of the offerings that Box is planning on introducing can be thought of as somewhat far-afield from the company's core storage technology, although so far, the offerings do incorporate the company's core storage technology.The company in partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM) is releasing what it calls Box Relay later this year. It is a workflow management tool that allows work groups to build, track and manage workflows. That is a very crowded field and the best known of the many products in the space is probably Jira, the tool offered by Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM). I have no way of determining just how robust Relay will be and if it will constitute a real entry into the market. According to one market researcher linked here, the market is supposed to reach $10 billion by 2021 with a CAGR of 23%.The company released Box Notes, a precursor and adjunct to the Relay offering which is designed to accomplish much of the functionality necessary to drive real-time collaboration across teams within security, governance and compliance rules that are required by most large enterprises these daysOne assumes that the leadership of this company is well aware of the competitive dynamics of the market and in particularly the specific attributes of both Jira and Slack. Perhaps that is a dangerous assumption, but I imagine that coming into the market after the success enjoyed by both TEAM and Slack is going to require some additional/improved functionality that will be part of the launch. This is a large and still developing market and there ought to be room for another vendor so long as that vendor offers superior functionality at an attractive price.The relationship with IBM and the creation of joint products is going to be significant for the company's ability to grow. IBM, which became a partner a bit less than 2 years ago, was part of 18 of the company's 64 $100,000+ transactions last quarter. Box is embedded in 10 IBM solutions that are sold by that company as part of its overall product line.Box has not completely positioned itself as a participant in the what is called the Enterprise Information Management market, but it is becoming more and more a company that is focused on those kinds of solutions. Over time, it seems to me that it is inevitable that Box will take the steps to emerge as a leading vendor of cloud storage coupled with EIM, compliance, governance and workflow which is a very different strategy than I believe to be generally understood. The EIM market is reckoned to be in the tens of billions of dollars depending on which market research firm is doing the reckoning. The growth rate of the space is said to be 20%.It is far easier for vendors such as Box to differentiate their offerings within the EIM space than it is when the solution is considered to be simply cloud content storage. In fact, the investment case for Box revolves around the success the company can have in pivoting so that it is considered by users to be a company offering content management and work flow management in the cloud. If it can do that - and I believe that it can - it will achieve mid-twenty percent growth for many years to come, I believe.The EIM/ECM space has a different set of competitors, including OpenText and IBM. It is not the most perfectly served market in the world and these days, with OpenText (NASDAQ:OTEX) focused on the integration with the assets it recently bought from Dell in the space, there are going to be some targets of opportunity for this company to gain share.IBM's effort in the space has been basically ineffective since it acquired FileNet and that hasn't changed. At some point, it may be that IBM decides that it can achieve more leverage by continuing to deepen integration with Box than trying to continue to sell FileNet. It would be a very positive denouement for Box and one that is not terribly unlikely given the relationship between the two companies.During the course of the conference call, CEO Aaron Levie talked about what users want from content management these days. Needless to say, that includes security, governance, compliance location and platform capabilities. But Mr. Levie believes that the initial use cases are going to center around employees who want to share, collaborate and keep track of projects in workgroups. Mr. Levie spoke about a new user replacing Documentum as one of the larger deals Box closed in the quarter. I think that is the growth path which is not really understood or appreciated at this point by most investors.The mechanics of revenue growthAt the current time, Box has a penetration of 7% in the Fortune 500 which have some level of paying deployment. Most of these customers have really just begun to roll out Box and there is significant headroom for growth in the installed base. So far, the company is seeing about 2/3rds of its revenue coming from expansion of its installed base which is a combination of adding additional seats and additional products. I think in terms of improving profitability in the short term, it will prove to be far more efficient to continue to focus on selling more things to existing customers. But it is certainly a balance that has to be maintained over the years since the company needs new users constantly in order to develop up-sell targets.Underneath the headline metrics that the company reported last quarter was its ability to close 16 deals of greater than $500k and 8 deals of more than $1 million. That is a significant percentage of the annual contract value sold by the company this past quarter and is a hallmark of the pivot to EIM solutions. The deals are not only larger, but they almost inevitably will be stickier than the deals that simply involve storing and syncing data in the cloud and they should ultimately drive both growth and profitability.At this point, the most successful add-on product sold by this company has been Governance. At the end of the fiscal year, Governance had been sold to 700 users out of 70,000. The potential revenue runway for the add-on products, simply in terms of selling them within the installed base, is very significant - and it is likely that the upside to revenue the company might achieve during this quarter and this fiscal year will be a function of the success of the add-on business more than it will be a function of selling new name Box only accounts.The company is also re-accelerating the growth in its number of new sales hires. That may seem to be counter-intuitive given that the company is forecasting slower percentage growth. The company basically believes that the introduction of Box Zones, which allows the company to offer local data storage based on the platforms of both partners IBM and AWS, has had and will have a significant positive impact on its ability to sell its solution internationally. As that potential has emerged, the company has started to engage more thoroughly in some international markets (Australia was the site of one of the larger deals that the company closed in Q4) and it is expecting to accelerate growth as the new salesmen that it hires reach a productive tenure.Like many cloud vendors, this company's gross margins are primarily a function of data center utilization. It has completed a move into new data center capabilities. That in turn is going to lead to capacity utilization reaching a nadir in Q1, along with gross margins which are expected to build for the balance of the year and to reach a level of 74%.The company is also engaged in working with ISVs to work with its platform as a vehicle on which to build significant vertical applications. The poster child for that effort to date is Medidata (NASDAQ:MDSO). It is always a bit difficult to forecast the success of new initiatives such as the Box platform and Relay in advance of them really coming to the market. This company has enjoyed significant success with its new products which appear to have been well conceived and congruent with market needs. I have no reason to think that the company will not be able to layer in the new products it will need to sustain growth in the mid-twenty percent range for some years into the future.Some thoughts about guidance and expensesIt is, I suppose, inevitable for most observers to simply record company guidance in publishing expectations. Most of the time that is a reasonable strategy although not always. But I think in this case and after the share price pullback based on the guidance provided in the earnings release and detailed a bit more on the earnings conference call. It might be well to take a look at some of the specific expense categories to test for whether the overall forecast is the most likely set of expectations.It is well to remember that so far since Box has been public, and after now reporting 8 quarters, it has always exceeded its earnings guidance. It is reasonable to assume at this point that this is by design and not by accident. In the last 4 quarters, the company has reported losses that ranged between 25%-29% less than had been previously forecast. I would be inclined to think that continuing that kind of over-attainment is a reasonable starting point for developing earnings expectations.The company has also stated that it would have positive free cash flow for the year as a whole. That was not the boldest of projections - CFFO had reached a negative of $1 million last year, an improvement of $65 million from the prior year and up by $10 million in the 4th quarter alone driving CFFO in Q4 to a positive $15 million.Box is forecasting that revenues this fiscal year are going to be about $500 million or a bit higher. It has forecast that it will achieve gross margins of 74% on that revenue level, although gross margins for a company like this are very volume sensitive. But in any event, the company is forecasting gross profits of $371 million. The company is forecasting a GAAP loss of that would be $168 million. To reach that forecast, the company would need to spend $538 million on operating expenses, an increase of more than $100 million or 23% year on year. In the fourth quarter, as mentioned previously, operating expense grew by 7% year on year. For the year as a whole, operating expenses grew by $21 million or 5%.The largest component of operating expense is sales and marketing. It only grew by less than 5% last quarter looking year on year. General and administrative costs were flat for the period. Sadly, there were no questions on the call that related to how operating expenses might ramp from 7% in Q4 to 23% for the full year. It would be hard to construct a reasonable model that would be congruent with the kind of expense growth ramp necessary to spend $538 million in the current fiscal year. Expense growth of 15%, still a pretty significant step-up in the percentage growth of operating expense, would just bring operating expenses to $502 million for the full year and would yield a GAAP loss of $136 million.Box has forecast that stock-based comp will be $104 million this fiscal year, and overall if operating expense grew by 15%, the non-GAAP EPS forecast loss would be $.25. I personally think that is a far more likely metric to expect in the current fiscal year and would most likely bring the company to non-GAAP profitability by Q4.At least on the surface it is hard to reconcile such a rapid growth in operating expenses with the forecast slowdown in revenue growth and the qualitative comments about the company's successes with IBM, successes in selling larger deals and successes in the nascent phase of its partner program. As mentioned, no one really asked the company to justify its forecast for opex growth and the consensus forecast as collected by First Call suggests that analysts have accepted the company's forecast without demur. The company's qualitative comments alluded to here are such that it would be hard to imagine that sales productivity is not likely to improve. I think that if Box can grow revenues at rates at or above its current projection and more than halve the non-GAAP loss it achieves, it is likely to put a noticeable tailwind behind valuation parameters.ValuationRegardless of anything else, Box is not likely to produce positive earnings in the current year. So it will be necessary to look at EV/S and possibly CFFO and free cash flow in order to value the shares. Box reported 130 million shares outstanding at the end of the fiscal year. It uses plenty of stock-based comp and has experienced a growth of 5% in outstanding shares year on year, although it is forecasting a slightly lower percentage increase in outstanding shares this year. At yesterday's closing price, the company had a market capitalization $2.13 billion. The company had net cash of $127 million at the end of the fiscal year as well as an additional $34 million of capital lease obligations. So that brings the enterprise value to a hair over $2 billion and correspondingly yields an EV/S ratio of just about 4X. That is a pretty reasonable valuation if my belief in the company's growth is well-founded.Last year, as mentioned earlier, the company more or less broke even in terms of CFFO. I think that the company is likely to improve its overall GAAP dollar loss by $15 million. In addition, stock-based comp is forecast to increase by $26 million. The company had a $55 million increase in deferred revenues last year which was smaller than the increase in the prior fiscal year, but Q4 deferred revenue growth was about 10% year on year. In the absence of any specific guidance, it seems prudent to expect that metric to grow 10% year on year or about $6 million. Other assets and liabilities, including receivables were flat in fiscal year 2017 and there is no reasonable expectation to expect a material change this year. That would bring CFFO this year to around $45 million+. The company has completed some of the significant additions to its data center capacity and it has moved into a new headquarters. CapEx for the current fiscal year is not likely to be much more than $5 million. That yields a free cash flow forecast of around $40 million and a free cash flow yield of 2%.Investors who buy BOX shares at this point are doing so based on growth expectations and based on expectations that the company will significantly exceed its earnings forecast this year. Both of those expectations seem reasonable to me. I think that the company is likely to continue to produce positive alpha going forward and current share prices present an attractive entry point."
4034085,22148,2017-01-03T19:51:00-05:00,"Box is another beaten-down former hot IPO.Well-known analysts placed the stock as a top pick along with a very respectable group of tech stocks.The stock valuation is much more compelling now than at the time of the IPO, with constantly improving financials.","When Box (NYSE:BOX) went public at the start of 2015, the stock surged on opening day. Typical of the period, the cloud-based software company that helps businesses with data collaboration and management quickly fell from those highs.Now down nearly 50% from the highs and two years later, Box offers a completely different valuation proposition. The recent pick as a top stock for 2017 by Drexel Hamilton caught my attention considering the quality of the other firms on the list. Should one unwrap this gift in 2017?Improving Valuation EquationAbout a month ago, Box reported FQ3 results that included a milestone of quarterly revenues in excess of $100 million, along with solid guidance. In its first quarter as a public company, it only had $63 million in revenues for FQ414.The combination of the lower stock and higher revenues completely changes the value equation on the stock. The key P/S multiple is naturally down in half now, as next year's revenue is targeted at $500 million.BOX PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsOf course, the real issue was the concern over money-losing operations. Box has already cut losses in half since going public.Typical of this type of business, the more crucial metrics are around billings and cash flows. While the Q3 operating loss was $17 million, Box only used $7 million of cash in operations. Free cash flow was still negative, but the improvement was dramatic from last FQ3.Drexel Hamilton CallWhat was attention grabbing was the bullish call by analyst Brian White of Drexel Hamilton. He placed Box on a list of top tech stocks for 2017 that included Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and Twilio (NYSE:TWLO).The group generally underperformed the market, which was up about 10% over the last year. Twilio went public during the year and ended 2016 near the lows.BOX data by YChartsAfter looking back over the last few months, analyst Brian White has increasingly been bullish on Box. Part of his push for 2017 is a belief that the enterprise software company has innovation in the form of Box Governance and Box Zones products that will contribute to growth this year.Even back in September, Drexel Hamilton viewed Box as underappreciated due to an increasingly large total addressable market reaching $45 billion, while revenues sit at only 1% market share.TakeawayThe key investor takeaway is that time and lower stock prices can reduce all that ails the stock of a growing company. Box appears ready to finally deliver on the bullish forecasts of Drexel, making the stock worth finally unwrapping."
4007158,48501,2016-09-19T19:14:24-04:00,Sales are expected to reach $400M in FY17 and $500M in FY18.Box should raise additional equity capital to improve its financial position.A primary degree bull market may be beginning with the shares already fairly valued.,"Box Inc (NYSE:BOX) provides online storage, file sharing, and content management to enterprises globally.Box is positioning itself as the go-to provider for enterprise content management, a highly competitive market. With the release of Box Zones and Box Governance, Box is better positioned to gain market share. Box Zones allows enterprises to share data globally and individuals to work collaboratively while maintaining file storage in the jurisdiction required by local law. Box Governance is a compliance friendly electronic content manager that aims to keep companies operating in highly regulated industries in compliance with laws regulating electronic documents.With 59% of the Fortune 500 already relying on Box, the company is well positioned to expand geographically and through additional product offerings. In my view, Box posts $400M of revenue during FY17 and $500M of revenue during FY18, with cash flow from operations turning positive in FY17. Leadership's strategy of global expansion through partnerships with companies such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), should prove to be an efficient method of gaining scale.A key risk to Box's share price is competition from Microsoft, EMC, OpenText (NASDAQ:OTEX), IBM, Oracle, and Xerox (NYSE:XRX), to name a few; the impact of competition is at least partially offset by the company's willingness to be collaborative with competitors. Also, management may decide to engage in an additional equity offering, diluting existing shareholders.I see the risk of an additional equity offering as too large to take a long position in Box; in this scenario is makes more sense to buy into the secondary initial public offering. Additionally, Box is fairly valued, trading at a 19% discount to the industry based on FY18 sales with 25% revenue growth being forecasted.Bearish Free Cash Flow OutlookCash flow from operations isn't substantial enough to cover capital expenditures and make substantial investments in the business, over the forecasted horizon. CFO is expected to be $21M in FY17 and $31M in FY18 with capital expenditure coming in at $24M and $28M, respectively; free cash flow is thus negative $3M in FY16 and positive $3M in FY18. Operating expenditure is anticipated to be 111% of revenue in FY17 and 98% of revenue in FY18. Consequently, with the margin for error this tight, leadership is likely to either have to cut operating expenditure or raise more capital, likely equity. In my view, with the limited free cash flow generation over the remainder of FY17 and during FY18, it makes the most sense to go to market for additional equity capital, strengthening the company's financial position without adversely impacting growth potential.Data courtesy of Morningstar and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingFor FY17, I expect revenue to grow 32% to $400M with the operating loss coming in at $162M. The net loss is also expected to be $162M with EPS of $-1.28 for a ROE of -146%. Operating expenditure is forecasted to continue to decline as a percentage of sales with EBITDA of $-116.With Box Zones and Box Governance continuing to ramp, sales are expected to increase 25% to $500M during FY18. The operating loss and net loss is anticipated to shrink to $140M with EPS of $-1.06. Operating expenses should grow at a much slower rate than revenue over the next few FYs. Data courtesy of Morningstar and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingCFO is expected to be $21M in FY17 with CapEx declining 67% relative to FY17; management is guiding to CapEx of about 3% of sales, but $12M of CapEx doesn't seem achievable, given the company's operating history. Free cash flow is expected to be $3M in FY18, exiting the year with cash of $189M. I'm not forecasting any acquisitions during FY17 or FY18.Data courtesy of Morningstar and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingFinancial leverage is expected to increase substantially in FY17 and FY18 as equity decreases while debt remains constant. The debt to equity ratio ends the years at 47% and 56%. Financial leverage is anticipated to climb to 5.53 at the end of FY17 and 7.43 at the end of FY18. An equity offering would decrease financial leverage and improve the financial position.Primary Bull and Fairly Valued SharesBox appears to be in the beginning stage of a bull market of primary degree with the MACD forming a bullish divergence and the RSI trending higher. The moving average has yet to turn higher, but the share price is above the 50-week simple moving average.Data courtesy of Morningstar and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingBox is trading at a 19% discount to the industry with sales expected to grow 25% in FY18. The argument can be made that the growth rate commands a premium multiple to the industry, but the financial profile says differently. Consequently, I view Box as fairly valued."

Prior to listing, Box had been valued at $2.4 billion. A year later, the company's valuation has fallen to just over half that value as the market doesn't appear too pleased with its loss-making business model.Box's FinancialsBox's first quarter revenues increased 37% over the year to $90 million and managed to surpass the market's expectations of $89 million in revenues. Billings grew 8% over the year to $75.9 million, but missed the analyst estimates of $83 million. The company continued to report losses and ended the current quarter with a net loss of $0.31 per share. The market was projecting a loss of $0.39 per share for the quarter.While the company did manage to surpass market expectations for the last quarter, its outlook was comparatively weak. For its second quarter, Box expects revenues in the range of $94 million-$95 million compared with the Street's forecast of $95 million. It expects to end the quarter with a non-GAAP loss of $0.20 to $0.19 per share, which was better than the Street's estimated loss of $0.22 per share. Box projected the year's revenues at $391 million-$395 million with non-GAAP loss of $0.78-$0.75 per share.Box's Product EnhancementsDuring the quarter, Box continued to enhance its product offerings. As part of its objective of international expansion, the company released Box Zones, a cloud-based offering that will allow organizations to store files in data centers that are physically located in other countries. The offering is being made available as an additional subscription service. It will work on top of public cloud data centers from IBM and Amazon and has begun first on AWS regions in Germany, Ireland, Japan and Singapore. It will be available on additional Asian and European locations on the IBM cloud later this year. Box Zones will help companies meet federal requirements of some countries that require that the data be stored physically in certain places.Meanwhile, Box announced that it is now a FedRAMP compliant company. The certification ensures that Box for Government's technology meets the security assessment, authorization and monitoring for cloud products and services according to US federal authorities. It is the gold standard for federal certifications and will help Box make bigger inroads into the government sector along with helping its clients ensure they meet federal requirements. Prior to attaining the FedRamp from the Defense Information Systems Agency, Box has achieved other federal certifications including HIPAA, PCI DSS 3.1, FINRA/SEC 17a-4 and FISMA certifications.Meanwhile, also, Box continued to deepen and build relationships with key enterprise vendors. Last quarter, it expanded its partnership with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) that will help companies access and edit PDFs and execute workflows with Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Sign directly in Box on both desktop and mobile.Its stock is trading at $10.02 with a market capitalization of $1.21 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $19.33 in June last year. It had fallen to a 52-week low of $8.82 in January this year. The stock is still trading below its last year's list price of $14 each and has failed to recover to the $2.4 billion valuation it had reached prior to listing.After the announcement of its latest results, Box was downgraded by analysts. JPMorgan is worried about Box's plans to transition its business model from multi-year payments to annual payments and expects to see less top-line upside than previously expected. The steep miss in billings for the current quarter were a big driver for the downgrades."
3991153,100856,2016-07-25T10:31:00-04:00,"Since it went public in 2015, Box has been a disastrous investment.In a volatile sector, its lack of competitive advantage is fatal in the long run.Investors would be better off ignoring this particular stock.","Box Inc. (NYSE:BOX) has seen its share price plummet by 55% since its IPO in January 2015. Last month, the share price fell 17.7%.To put it simply: this is not an investment that a profit-oriented investor (and there are other kinds, if you want to believe the reasons certain breeds of activist investor provide for buying into a particular stock) would want to have made. So why has Box stock collapsed like this?OverviewFounded in 2005 and based in Redwood City, California, Box Inc. is a cloud storage and services provider with a market capitalization of $1.32 billion and a 57,000-plus client list including such firms as Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Alere Inc. (NYSE:ALR), GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and Flir Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:FLIR).Box's primary function is to provide a platform for its corporate clients to share and store documents and to collaborate online in creating content. To their credit, Box has managed to grow its customer base, grabbing 3,000 clients in the previous quarter. And they have been able to grow revenue.However, cloud-based storage solutions are not enough to sustain a business and growing revenue has not translated into profit. These issues are central to the problem with Box as an investment.Competitive AdvantageThe sub-heading in this instance is key to why Box has been such a disappointing investment. The firm possess no real competitive advantage in the sector within which it operates. Cloud storage and service provision is a market with low barriers to entry, and competitors that Box has to contend with include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).Every one of those companies are much larger than Box and each possess a huge portfolio of products and services that permit them to offer similar cloud services at a discount to Box, undercutting them.Box has attempted to collaborate with some of its competitors, such as IBM and Microsoft. In June 2015, Box and IBM teamed up to create a number of cloud-based solutions for corporate customers. Box would benefit from access to IBM's portfolio of security and content management tools, which could enhance their own cloud offerings, while IBM could utilize Box's platform by integrating it into their MobileFirst applications.The deal with Microsoft, also announced in June 2015, involved deep integration of the Box platform with various Microsoft applications, such as Office 365. However, this has not stopped Microsoft from releasing a Sharepoint upgrade which has mobile applications and which allows free migration from Google Drive and from Box. In short, these joint ventures into cloud service provision have not shielded Box from competitive threats nor have they enabled the firm to become profitable, something it has never been in the 11 years that it has been in operation.ValuationBox is currently trading at around $10 per share, and earnings per share are -$1.59 for the last 12 months. The price-to-earnings ratio is -6.70. Basically, there is no margin of safety with Box stock whatsoever.Net income figures over the past three years reveal a trend that makes it seem unlikely that the stock will recover any time soon. Although revenue has grown, with year-over-year revenue growth of 35.7% in the previous quarter, the operating costs and ongoing reinvestment into the firm means that Box remains unprofitable.For the period ending 1/31/2014, net income was -$168,898,000.For the period ending 1/31/2015, net income was -$168,227,000.For the period ending 1/31/2016, net income was -$202,948,000.Furthermore, Box has a high debt burden of $52 million, with a debt-equity ratio of 0.38. Over the past 12 months, it has had an operating loss margin of -66.4% and an average net loss of -67%.Suffice to say, the company is in no position to pay a dividend, so all that is left to offer shareholders is capital appreciation. And the stock's trajectory since the IPO suggests that this is an unrealistic expectation too.Final ThoughtsBox's joint ventures with IBM and Microsoft have not provided it with the financial viability that the company hoped for as the firm is still unprofitable and the share price continues to decline. There are no guarantees that things will improve in the long run, either: the tech sector is very fast-paced and companies must innovate constantly to stay at the forefront. Only two companies are truly battle-tested within the tech sector: IBM and Microsoft.The likelihood of Box Inc. joining these firms as venerable blue chips is very slim given its current status. It has almost no competitive advantage within the cloud storage and services sector, it has never been profitable in the eleven years since it started operations, it has huge debt, its stock offers no margin of safety, pays no dividend, and has little prospect of providing capital gains either. Since the IPO, its value has declined by more than half. Consequently, investors would be well advised to act as though this company does not exist.DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial professional and accept no responsibility for any investment decisions a reader makes.

Privacy Shield agreement.","Twitter Plans to Go to Apple TVShares of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) are remaining red-hot, climbing almost 7% in Monday's trading session. The stock is now up 14% in the past five days and almost 50% over the past three months.So what's got the stock moving higher today? The microblogging platform has been on a spree of signing streaming deals, perhaps most notably with the NFL to broadcast Thursday night football games.According to new reports, the company is considering launching a service on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple TV, which would allow users to stream the content on their television. Reportedly, the company's plans for live-streaming are not ""fully formed,"" which seems semi-concerning, seeing as though these streaming initiatives are what management is banking on to accelerate growth. It's also concerning given that the season isn't that far off.CEO Jack Dorsey & Co. have deals in place with the Pac 12, NFL, MLB, NHL, NBA and eSports (video game competition). The thought here is that video will drive user growth and engagement, which will drive more ad dollars to the platform and ultimately, a higher stock price.Investors are cheering the move to Apple TV, as it will - at least on paper - help boost engagement and use. Particularly for live-streaming an NFL game. Some have also speculated about a potential buyout from Apple given Twitter streaming deals and other properties (like Periscope). But given the premium needed to do so, a takeover seems unlikely, given Apple's history of purchases.Twitter sports a market cap of roughly $14 billion. Assuming the board would even be open to a sale, a ~40% premium would put the stock at a $20 billion valuation. Apple seems unlikely to bite at that price, especially for a property that's still struggling.Check out: Twitter Gets Into Bed With AppleSpeaking of Apple, It Too Could Use a BoostShares of Apple have traded well since it reported earnings in late July. Investors are overlooking the company's year-over-year declines and looking forward to a new iPhone launch next month.We've already covered the planned overhaul of the MacBook, as well as the new iPhone features expected this year. But if Apple goes for the triple-whammy, it will have to overhaul its iPad as well.According to new reports, that's exactly what it plans to do - but not for next fiscal year. Instead, if the reports are right, the new devices will come in the second half of 2017 (fiscal 2018 for the company). There will be three new devices, a 12.9"" iPad Pro 2, a 10.5"" iPad Pro and a 9.7"" iPad.The last of which looks as if it will push out the iPad Mini, which became less relevant with the launch of the larger lineup of iPhones.What does this mean for the business? iPhone sales are almost surely going to improve in fiscal 2017 vs. the current year, as a year-over-year slump with the new model seems unlikely, (barring a recession). MacBook Pro sales have actually been doing pretty good, but it would have been nice for the company to release its updated version ahead of the school year, as the devices are currently expected later this year. That's too bad too, because it was the first major overhaul in some four years.iPad sales, however, have not done as well. Last year, the company saw revenues for the device slide to $23.2 billion, down 23% from the prior year. In the most recent quarter, sales were down 13%.With any luck though, MacBook and iPhone sales will be strong next year, with perhaps the iPad seeing a nice boost in fiscal '18. The question is, will the iPad be enough to move the needle and perhaps offset worries of a slower iPhone that year (assuming no major improvements to the device during its ""off year."")Is Dropbox Prepping for an IPO?Perhaps, boosting the company's confidence for an IPO was Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), which went public at $15, quickly shot up north of $40 and has since continued its meteoric rise. The stock hit a 52-week high of $66.40 in Monday's session, but despite closing higher by nearly 10%, shares fell considerably from those levels, ending the day at $58.47.That's possibly what Dropbox (DROPB) is looking for if it decides to IPO. According to sources, that's exactly what it may do in 2017.While the company has said in the past it doesn't plan to IPO ""any time soon,"" next year isn't really ""soon,"" considering the comments came last November. One thing on many investors' minds though will be the valuation.The company had previously been valued at $10 billion. But that was about two years ago. Since then, several investors have written down the value. That makes sense too, given the valuation of its nearest competitor, Box (NYSE:BOX), which has a valuation of just $1.6 billion.The situation is semi-reminiscent of Pandora (NYSE:P) and Spotify (MUSIC), with the public-traded Pandora having a much smaller market cap (valuation) than the latter.Dropbox is apparently free cash flow positive, but not yet profitable. For what it's worth, Box's current market cap is about one-third below the valuation it had as a private company. Only time will tell.U.S. Companies Join in Privacy Shield AgreementA number of large, U.S. companies have signed on to the European Union's Privacy shield agreement, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) - the last of which also signed an unrelated, seven-year cloud infrastructure deal with IBM (NYSE:IBM).In all, more than 40 companies are a part of the pact, with more than 200 applicants still working through the review process. It's expected that other large companies will be next.So what exactly is this agreement? To borrow a few words from Seeking Alpha's Yoel Minkoff, ""the so-called Privacy Shield agreement [is] the new data-protection pact that allows American firms to transfer information on European citizens to servers in the U.S.""The companies making this list are compliant with the requirements of the agreement (obviously). Data protection is important, especially when it comes to the internet and passing information between the two continents.Previously, the Safe Harbor Framework was in place, which thousands of companies between the U.S. and Europe used to exchanged data. However, the European Union invalidated Safe Harbor last fall, at the ""perceived risk of U.S. government spying.""None of this comes as much of a surprise, especially given how much issue the EU has taken with large U.S. tech companies in the past. Whether it has been on data privacy, taxes or business tactics, it's clear the EU wants to swing a bigger hammer.Tech TidbitsThe Nasdaq Composite hit a new 52-week high in Monday's session.Microsoft is offering NFL-branded Surface covers for all 32 teams for $160 a pop."
3958224,98236,2016-03-14T13:35:07-04:00,"Box reported another strong quarter last week with most operating metrics exceeding consensus expectations.On particular, the company achieved positive operating cash flow and showed an adjusted bookings increase of 45% year on year.EV/S valuation at 3.3X current year forecast revenues is quite modest for the growth prospects of this company.Concerns that the company's future will be destroyed by Amazon and other large competitors are significantly overblown based on most current data points.","How to distinguish a long-distance runnerOne of the hardest things to do as an investor or an analyst is to figure out if a company with a good idea with a certain spark of creativity can take that idea and make it into a real company that has substantial revenues, cash flow and at least non-GAAP profitability. There are no secret signs printed on the readily available research material that tells you that salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is going to be a great company while Violin Memory (NYSE:VMEM) is going to fall by the wayside.In the foregoing article, I'm going to take a look at one of the more controversial names that delivers its services exclusively via the cloud. Box (NYSE:BOX), as its name implies, is a service in which users can store their documents and from which other users can both retrieve documents and modify documents in a collaborative fashion. It is, no doubt, a great idea but there are a fair number of great minds who thought that such a service would resonate with users and hence the competition is fierce.But fierce competition may or may not mean that the space is a bad investment. Many, many people were aware at least five years ago that the time of spinning discs was drawing to a close and the world was moving to all-flash arrays. And of course that has been correct. The problem soon became that there were simply too many companies that were selling exactly the same product to the same people. Not to reprise that bit of painful investment history, but in the end, even the leader in the space at the time, Fusion I/O, was a bust as an investment.So, it isn't just the space that is important but something that many people describe as the moat. The problem with solid state storage didn't turn out to be demand. It turned out that too many people could figure out how to make flash arrays and the space was soon crowded and lacked product differentiation. There is an old saying in Texas, my home for a few years, to the effect that ""if there are too many duck hunters and not enough ducks, most everyone doesn't get to eat."" So far, with the potential exceptions of Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) and Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) most investors haven't enjoyed the transition to SSDs.The question for potential investors in Box isn't going to be if the market is large enough. Sharing documents via the web in a secure and controllable fashion is a great idea and is not really the subject of much controversy. The question is whether or not what Box does is sufficiently unique and if it has enough product differentiation to prove to be a real, i.e. profitable company.There are investors who still think that cloud is likely to be similar to storage world. They fear that the solutions that Box and others sell will be commoditized with rapidly falling prices making it impossible for anyone to achieve much in the way of profitability. I have heard that cloud was a passing fad, that it was overhyped and that it was doomed as an investment graveyard almost since I heard about the potential for cloud. The difference not appreciated by many observers is that cloud is really a mechanism to deliver software and storage more efficiently. Underneath the shell of the cloud business model, all of the successful companies either have to have created value for users in terms of the software they sell or the storage that users acquire. The companies in the space share one common characteristic in that they deliver software via the cloud and thus have quite similar business models. On the other hand, despite investor misapprehensions to the contrary, there is no cloud industry.One of the harder things that tech investors have to do is to figure out exactly what is common and what is unique when it comes to the Box service or any other kind of web-based software service. These days, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) deliver sales force automation solutions via the web. And yet that hasn't turned the space into a commodity and CRM has continued to be able to differentiate its solution and has surely gained market share in the broadly defined market for sales force automation solutions.If one defines Box from a 30,000 foot level and one looks at all the vendors who sell what is termed cloud-based storage or even if one looks at the vendors who sell access to cloud-based documents with provision for collaboration and security, the landscape appears pretty homogeneous and one would readily conclude that the space either has become or will become a commodity. Dig a little deeper and the opposite conclusion emerges. Yes, there are a lot of people who sell something like what Box sells. And there are probably more vendors who could sell something quite similar to what Box is selling today. But it is my contention, after trying to evaluate both sides of the question, that Box is in the process of deepening its moat and broadening the aspects of differentiation it has with other companies in the space.What does Box actually do and what problems does the company solve for its customers? Why are large enterprises deciding to adopt the Box solution?The idea behind Box is breathtakingly simple. From the standpoint of end users, the Box application allows them to access any file for which they are permissioned, from anywhere on any device. From the customer standpoint, using Box is another method of securing content. In other words, it is a tool that simplifies information governance and enhances global compliance requirements such as HIPA, FINRA and many, many others.Box is basically an overlay product. Its functionality partners with many software vendors that have integrated the Box solution into their products. Probably the best known, and likely the most significant, partnership that Box currently has is with IBM (NYSE:IBM). IBM essentially adds the Box solution to its analytics and social solutions. The partnership was initiated at the end of June 2015.Trying to strip out the PR speak that litter press releases in the IT space, essentially the new capabilities of the integration will include Box integration with IBM's content management product and integration into Watson Analytics which will be able to access content stored in Box. Further, Box will facilitate joint customers who want to store data in the IBM cloud but will use Box to facilitate data movement. Some other partners include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office 365, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), salesforce, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) WebEx and Symantec (SYMC). At the moment, there are 1,000 apps that are connected to Box.To say there are many companies in the content management space would be like saying that there are lots of grains of sand at the shore. And to say that the competitors don't match much of Box's functionality also is more than a bit of a stretch.So, how then did Box manage to grow to $303 million in annual revenues with 57k customers and millions of registered users? (At this point, I think the registered user metric is not all that important. Box generates a little less than $100/year per user, so at the moment, in the middle of the company's quarter, it probably has about 4 million users who are actually using the product.) I think there are basically two reasons for the company's success that may not be properly recognized by investors.As mentioned above, the company has a massive partner ecosystem that actually does lots of the heavy lifting in selling the product into large enterprises. What Box sells is going to be an overlay product for a large cohort of users who will buy the product as part of a deployment of salesforce, IBM or WebEx. Box is very focused on moving up the market and selling to large enterprise customers. Part of its success comes from the validation of its technology by its partner ecosystem. Many investors fail to appreciate that often the difference between a great idea and a good investment is the go-to-market strategy and the marketing ability of the company. If there were one single driver that has led to the company's success thus far, I think it is the company's partner ecosystem.But behind ecosystem has to come product. And Box certainly appears to have some significant advantages in terms of its product when compared to the competition. The most recent feature/function study on the space is ""The Forrester Wave Enterprise File Sync and Share platforms, Cloud Solutions, Q1 2016."" Now that is a mouthful. The study was actually just published on 3/10. So far as it goes, Box is the clear leader in terms of both market presence and the capabilities of its current offering. The thing that is most striking about the survey, at least to me, is that the Box product is said to have a significant lead in terms of its usability - really ease of use. Box gets a 5.0 score for usability - 5 being the top of the scale, Dropbox is at 4.3 and every other competitor is at 4.0 or less. Given the overall desire of market research firms to reach less controversial conclusions and conclusions that do not put their larger customers in a bad light, the lead that Box has in ease of use is really surprising. And again, according to Forrester, the single most important reason as to why enterprise users buy Enterprise File Sharing (EFSS) solutions is ease of use. Indeed, according to Forrester, users commented that even with gaps in functionality, they would still choose the vendor that provided ease of use. For example, Forrester says that there are governance gaps in the Box offering but that it doesn't matter much because partners such as IBM deliver Box's content management and fill the gaps. I realize that not all readers are going to be convinced either by the Box partner ecosystem or by the Forrester analysis.A few months ago, SA Contributor Dallas Salazar wrote a very thorough analysis of a particular feature that was then included in Dropbox but which was a gap in the Box product set. I don't pretend to be able to analyze software offerings in terms of feature/function. It isn't my background and I simply lack the deep domain expertise that market research firms offer to people like me. But my point here is not to denigrate the analysis of Mr. Salazar which is very thorough and well written, but to suggest that the analysis is not completely focused on what gets users to buy this kind of a product. I really do not know precisely how Box would rate on a feature/function analysis. But if ease of use is what motivates buyers, and if Box has a significant advantage in terms of ease of use, my guess is that in conjunction with the product being offered to enterprises by large, if not to say dominant vendors, the company is going to have an admirable win/loss rate and reasonably high sales productivity.I do think that it is worth noting that the balance of the Forrester report says ""that Box continues to push the boundaries of the EFSS market."" So as far as it goes, that is about as good as it gets in terms of what market research consultants write about companies.Just for the record, Gartner (NYSE:IT) obviously does market research on the space. It's a large market and is growing quite rapidly. In their Magic Quadrant review, Box is a leader, but not the absolute leader. But as it happens, Box is the only vendor in the Gartner magic quadrant whose solutions run in the cloud. In the Forrester Report, the legacy, non-cloud vendors were exiled to a different graph and a different set of rankings.I will never buy stock in a company whose direct competitors are Amazon, Google and MicrosoftI understand the sentiment and those conclusions. When I first decided to take up writing this article at the suggestion of a friend in the software business, those were my sentiments as well. As I have personally used Google Drive, that clearly means that even the most technically challenged user can get some functionality out of that service. And the fact that it didn't cost anything was not an incidental consideration in my thinking. Admittedly, I'm not a large enterprise, and of course the use cases of large enterprises are far different than my personal experience. Still, Google along with many other large firms inhabit this space.I think one thing to note at the outset is that currently Microsoft is as much of a partner as it is a competitor for this company. The latest Gartner survey mentioned above actually advises users to avoid Microsoft OneDrive for Business based on no fewer than 152 evaluation points. In fact, the Gartner VP in charge of research in this sector, Guy Creese, told users at the Gartner Catalyst event that Box would be the Gartner recommendation against Microsoft even considering the strong integration that OneDrive has with SharePoint. At the time, Mr. Creese made his presentation last September, Box was not as imbedded in Office 365 as it is today. Mr. Creese basically told the audience that the two reasons to consider OneDrive would be the desire some users have to work with large vendors and if a user was centered on use of Office 365. I think it is reasonable to suggest that currently, as the collaboration between Box and Microsoft has increased, the latter reason would be less valid.I think that the situation in terms of the competition between Google and Box is somewhat different. There are a great many services that purport to give a user advice as to which solution to buy. The success of firms such as Gartner and Forrester has brought forth a host of emulators. The most thorough report comparing Google and Box specifically came from a service called cloudHQ. That report, sadly, didn't call out specific conclusions. Industry veteran CNET also provides a comparison which is far less favorable toward Google than the report from cloudHQ. And there is still another report that emanates for Stanford University which is more or less useless for a comparative evaluation.To summarize the CNET report, it basically suggests, politely, that Google Drive is best suited for integration with a Google desktop and is not optimized for use in a workgroup setting. It basically tells users that if they use Gmail and other Google services, adding Google drive makes sense and otherwise it is not a wise purchase.The cloudHQ report is somewhat less judgmental. It talks quite glowingly about some Google drive strengths including the ability to collaborate amongst 50 users and the strong editing tools that are available to modify documents.It does note, however, that Google Drive is optimized for users of Gmail and for other personal productivity apps including Google Photo.Google is a force of nature. No one expects that a company such as Box could compete head to head with Google if that company really wanted to address the business market. At the moment, it seems fair to say that Google and Box really do not compete or do not really overlap in very many competitive bake-offs.Either fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your point of view, there are apparently significant performance issues when it comes to using Google drive. It was, I believe, these issues that downgraded its rankings in the Magic Quadrant reports I discussed earlier. According to cloudHQ, 30% of respondents lost folders and 20% had issues synching files. There were some other issues as well.Box, as might be expected, is integrated with a host of third-party apps. Google drive is not. Box uses sophisticated encryption and integrates with single user sign-on providers. Box has gotten all the necessary compliance certifications. Google has not. For corporations concerned about the potential to suffer from hacks and the liability that a successful hack attack can create, using the Box solution is a better choice.What does this all mean to investors? It seems relatively clear that neither Microsoft or Google consider the space strategic for their corporate objectives. Their products were designed as features and as part of broader desktop ecosystems. The products, at least for now, are neither optimized for use in the enterprise or to generate any significant amount of revenue. The products from both Microsoft and Google are not expected to be and do not have to be best of breed solutions. They simply have to work well enough so that individuals and enterprises committed to one ecosystem or the other can continue to work within the confines of that ecosystem. In terms of that objective, they have succeeded admirably. The solutions were never intended to be direct competitors of Box and today they aren't.Might all that change in the future? Of course. It is simply a matter of corporate strategy and prioritization. Google has so many priorities that seemingly are for more significant in terms of their potential to sustain the company's incredible momentum that it doesn't seem particularly likely for them to focus on a niche market such as enterprise-shared cloud. It is a huge market for Box, especially as that company attempts to become a multi-product vendor. It means very little to Google.I think more or less the same comments apply to Microsoft, just not quite so much. Microsoft certainly has the ambition to become a player in the enterprise space and developing a product to compete with Box could be part of such a strategy. Clearly that is not the case now and according to the consultants MSFT has a long way to go to develop an enterprise class product. Based on the most recent series of releases from Microsoft, it seems quite clear that its short-term focus in the enterprise is to complete the project it started years ago of building a viable alternative to Oracle in the database world. That would be an amazing and transformational event for MSFT even at the scale of that company and one that is going to require an enormous amount of focus and some amount of luck to succeed. Trying to dominate a niche market while attempting to take on an entrenched monopoly just doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.But of course the real potential gorilla in the room is Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) and its Zocalo offering. At the time that Zocalo was launched in the middle of 2014, much of the trade press described it as ""a Box, Dropbox and Huddle killer."" It was renamed as WorkDocs last year and essentially re-launched. There is a limited amount of competitive analysis available so far that specifically compares Box and OneDocs. About the best that I could find was from a company called Agora that has applications that help manage Dropbox, Google Drive and Box. As such, it doesn't particularly recommend one service or another to users. Basically, the current edition of Amazon has a limited partner ecosystem and it lacks many ease of use features that are standard on the solutions offered by the other vendors in the market. I suspect that getting the product right is going to be a priority for Amazon. It is in part of their wheelhouse. Their products will only improve from here according to Agora.It is really challenging to attempt to evaluate the potential competition between Amazon and Box. Headline writers and some investors are fond of black and white conclusions to the effect that Zocalo and its offspring WorkDocs are hired assassins of the other companies in the space. Hyperbole doesn't really substitute for analysis, however. My guess is that the overall space is large enough to support multiple competitors who will each carve out a niche. Inevitably, the presence of a competitor such as Amazon has to impact the ultimate market share in the broad space that Box can sustain. Is WorkDocs going to put it out of business? I doubt it. The closest analog that comes to my mind relates to the entrance of Microsoft into what was then known as the BI space. Microsoft is still a player in the space and Gartner ranks the company as No. 1 in its 2016 Magic Quadrant report. That really hasn't prevented the other vendors in the space from enjoying some reasonable measure of success and it was, perhaps, a factor of the dramatic consolidation of the space at the end of the last decade.There is no current evidence that Amazon WorkDocs is impacting the business of Box. WorkDocs was not even included in the Forrester report which is as recent as March 10, 2016. Sometimes stories in the real world wind up with happy endings. After all, didn't Downton Abbey's finale last Sunday teach us just that. There will be readers who have gotten this far and finally tune out because there is no guarantee that WorkDocs will not become the category killer. I just think that is a less likely scenario than Box developing a multi-product presence that allows it to continue to compete successfully.Box went public at an IPO price of $14/share on January 22, 2015, and closed at $23/share that first day and hasn't traded as high as that price since! The process of going public consumed 10 months and along the way the company raised $250 million in a private round the prior summer. Even as BOX started trading, those late stage investors were down by 29% and at the moment, the shares have lost 13% compared to the IPO price. There was plenty of skepticism about the IPO at the time for obvious reasons. Competition, excessive valuation, lack of profitable operations and cash burn.It would be hard to say that any of the negative factors that were present before the IPO have been erased. Box still faces competition and it still sports what many would consider a high valuation. It's not the stock to own in a risk-off market. It was $9.20/share at the trough of the February tech stock route down by about 34% from its price at the start of the year.I make no claim of prior knowledge as to the whims of the Tech Stock Gods. I would imagine the latest stimulus from the ECB and the continuation of what can properly be called ""easy money"" in the US will favor investment in riskier asset classes. But how that will really turn out is, at the least, hard to know.And I really can't promise investors that their fears regarding competition won't be realized. It would be the worst kind of misrepresentation to claim that I had that kind of second sight. But I think it is worthwhile taking a look at the real numbers and trying to extrapolate some of the significant trends that have been becoming more visible.Valuation: Perhaps less of a nosebleed than imagined!Box announced its results for the full fiscal year of 2016 that ended 1/31 after the market closed on March 9. The results were a significant beat on most key metrics and 6 out of the 10 analysts that cover the name have raised estimates over the past month. The shares have an average rating of 2 on the Thomson/Reuters scale which is just above average for momentum growth stocks. On the other hand, the mean price target of $18/share which suggests nearly a 50% upside over the next 12 months is probably above average for the stocks in the momentum growth category reflecting, I imagine, the uncertainties and skepticism that surround the name. I would contend that in looking at a name like Box, you really need a fair amount of skepticism in the market in order to achieve the kind of returns most tech investors are looking for. Box currently has a short interest of more than 11 million shares which is close to 50% of the current float.My belief is that there is a huge amount of operating leverage in the model. Last quarter, the company improved its expense ratios in all of its major categories and for the first time G&A expenses actually declined year over year. Just for the record, R&D was 31% of revenues for the quarter and was 33.6% for the year. In sales and marketing, the expense ratio was 74.4% for the quarter compared to 80% for the year and G&A showed an expense ratio for the quarter of 22.3% compared to 23.4% for the year. Overall, operating expenses grew 24% for the year compared to 40% growth in revenues for the year.Many cloud-based software companies simply are not built to achieve profitability using GAAP measures because of the significant mismatch between the recognition of revenues and expenses under GAAP measures. I won't reprise the arguments on that point which I have written about as have many other commentators. I think overall that bookings are a far better measure of ""growth"" and cash flow is a much better proxy for economic earnings than most of the other metrics.The company actually reached a significant milestone last quarter as non-GAAP cash flow from operations was positive, at least by a small amount for the first time since Box has reported numbers. As is usual in parsing through a cash flow statement, there are puts and takes. DSO was higher in Q4 than in Q3 and that led to a significant increase in A/R that will almost inevitably reverse in the current quarter. On the other hand, the growth in the deferred revenue balance significantly increased during the period compared to prior quarters. Much of that increase was the result of longer term, prepaid contracts that the company no longer offers. Of the $45.2 million increase in deferred revenues seen in the prior quarter, I believe that perhaps $14 million was the product of those multi-year deals that are no longer on offer. The CFO basically said that because of the company's improving business model, the company was going to have a policy of annual payment durations which will have the impact of smoothing out some of the variability in reported bookings but which also will bring bookings below revenue for the current fiscal year.The company reported that its costs of supporting its free user base declined from 15% to 10% of revenues. Again, some investors object to freemium models for a variety of reasons. As the company signs more and more large deals with Fortune 500 names, the overall impact of the freemium model is going to diminish. Needless to say, enterprise users are not sold using a freemium model.The company also reported very positive churn statistics with that metric improving to below 3% and down significantly from the year-earlier period. And finally, a statistic beloved by many companies with cloud models, the company had an expansion rate of 20% with existing customers driven both by seat growth and by some limited amount of cross sells.The company has an EV/S of 3.3X on current year revenues and that metric is forecast to be 2.6X in the following fiscal year. I think that there is little question that metric is depressed by the concern regarding the company's profitability and to achieving full-year positive cash flow. The company doesn't forecast cash flow and it would be difficult for an outsider to attempt to do so this year given the shift to annual contract billings. But I am brave and will attempt the feat.Overall, the company is forecasting about a $35 million improvement in non-GAAP profitability this year. Trying to guess about certain of the other categories that make up cash flow, including the deferred revenue line, I think it is reasonable to believe that operating cash flow will improve by about $50 million overall in the current fiscal year to an operating cash loss of between $10-$20 million, with a significant level of positive cash generated during the company's fiscal Q4. On current trends, the company will be substantially cash flow positive during its fiscal year 2018.Looking at relevant comparables, and not comparables of older and better established software companies, the shares appear to be substantially undervalued. It would be more than a bit unusual to see a company with top line growth of almost 30%, and improving profitability valued at less than 2.6X EV/S. Skeptics are going to suggest that Amazon, in particular, is going to destroy this company and the other independent companies in the space. No one can prove a negative, especially a negative about something that is supposed to take place in the future. My belief is that the market growth is large enough to accommodate Amazon and the other competitors while leaving significant runway for Box.Some Final ThoughtsBox is one of the more controversial momentum growth stories in the tech space. It recently reported a particularly strong quarter and gave firm guidance. After a brief rally, however, the shares sold off to about where they had been before the earnings release. There persists a huge level of skepticism that Box can survive or thrive in a world that is dominated by Amazon as well as potentially Google and Microsoft. I feel that such fears are overblown - but I believe they are currently weighing heavily on valuation.The company has just begun to show significant operating leverage which should be more evident in the current fiscal year and which should lead to non-GAAP operating cash flow in Fiscal 2018. Given the valuation and the growth prospects, I feel that the percentage upside potential is more significant than is appreciated by most investors. We'll check back in another 90 days to see if my thesis is playing out."

More importantly for shareholders was the 34% year over year (""YOY"") increase in billings growth. After Q1 billings surprised to the downside with only 9% growth, Box tanked by as much as 10% as investors and analysts wondered if their high growth story was still in tact. The quarter was a step in the right direction for the beleaguered company who's share price has plummeted since it's IPO. After digesting Q2 results, let's take a look to see if Box's growth story is still in tact.Source: Yahoo FinanceRevenue GrowthFollowing Q2 results, revenue estimates for 2017 were revised upwards by management to $394-$396 million. At the mid-point of this range, Box would be looking at a 30% growth rate YOY. Although moving along at an impressive pace, growth has clearly slowed in recent years. Growth in 2016, 40% and estimated growth in 2017, as mentioned above are both below their compound annual growth rate of 51% of the past 4-years.Source: Company PresentationIn 2013 and 2014, Box grew revenues at an impressive clip and as they have grown, they have been unable to sustain the same level of growth. I believe the reason for their post-IPO struggles is related to their inability to grow revenues at a pace consistent with their historical performance.ProfitabilityManagement also raised GAAP EPS guidance to a net loss between -$1.30 and -$1.28. This implies approximately 23% YOY growth in 2017. Furthermore, extrapolating Analysts estimated earnings growth of 18.31%, we can anticipate a net loss of approximately $1.05 per share in 2018. Over the past few years, Box has been moving in the right direction and significantly reduced net losses. However, once again their growth has slowed over the past three years which does not bode well for their path to profitability. Prior to their IPO in 2014, Box co-founder Dylan Smith projected that Box would be profitable by 2018. Unless something major happens over the next year, this is one projection that will not come true.Source: Image - Author, Data - Company financialsCash FlowThe company also likes to highlight that their free cash flow (""FCF"") as a percentage of revenue has been steadily rising indicating improved overall cash flow. However, the trend continues and growth quarter over quarter has been slowing quite significantly. Now that costs associate with the HQ move appear be at an end, I would like to see their cash flow increase at a higher rate.Source: Company PresentationKey PartnershipsThe most significant positive for Box are its partners. Apple, GE and IBM are just some of the partners who utilize their services in a number of ways. You can see a full list of partners here. The important takeaway for me is that Box has a best-in-class retention rate. Equally as impressive as adding new partners is their ability to drive growth organically through continued expansion with existing customers. As the market matures, this will be a key source of growth for the company.Source: Company PresentationGrowth Story is changingAs a result of Box's slowing growth, their story has changed. Yes they are growing revenue, EPS and operating cash flow and yes, they are adding new partners on a regular basis. However, since their IPO that growth has subsided significantly. According to the company, Box is a world leading enterprise software platform that is transforming the way people and business conduct their work. Demand for connectivity across the world is on the rise and Box should be well positioned to expand both organically with existing partners and through new partnerships worldwide. However, Box needs to demonstrate that they can execute and return to higher growth rates and until this happens, I will remain on the sidelines.If you would like to receive updates for any of my upcoming articles, please click the ""Follow"" text at the top of this page next to my profile."

But as the cloud computing industry progressed, other competitors, due to the low barrier of entrance, also joined the space. At the moment, Box is ranked lower in comparison with giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and others that have unlimited amount of resources and known for ruthless competition:Source: skyhighAnd if we look at the Box's stock performance in the last couple of years, we would see that the company's share price is depreciating since its IPO in 2015:Source: BloombergThis brings me to the question of whether the company has a future. Declining prices and market volatility already turned-off investors last year, and buying shares of the failing business is the last thing they would want to do in the current market environment. However, there are signs signaling that Box can be a strong competitor in the industry it once ""created,"" but the management will need to face tough decisions that will determine the company's future, and it won't be easy.Three Catalysts for growthLast month, Box announced its earnings results for the quarter ended December 30 and FY16. Q4 saw a considerable growth in revenues and billings that improved by 36% and 59% Y/Y, respectively:Source: Company presentationHowever, while the growth in revenues is signaling increases in the company's business operations, its net income continues to decline year after year:Source: NASDAQThis means that despite the continuous effort from the management to fix things, they still fail to decrease their expenses and don't make any money at the moment. To tackle this problem, CEO Aaron Levi in the latest earnings call announced that Box will be focusing on three major initiatives that will help the company improve its financial condition and restore investor confidence.The first initiative is focused on increasing the number of services that Box offers. Levi believes that shift from traditional cloud storage provider to the multiproduct company will have a great impact on its business model. Last year they already launched Box Governance, which helps clients comply with the regulatory policies and effectively manage important business information in a better way than before. The service is already considered a success and will play a crucial role in Box's future. As Levi said:In February, Box also launched KeySafe, an encryption service that gives costumers control over their data and an unchangeable audit log of key usage. The service is new, so it's too soon to say whether it'll be a success or not, but it's good to see that the company is exploring different options to recover from the current situation.The second initiative is focused solely on one thing - the Box Platform. It's a new developer-focused platform that offers a way for businesses to power content services in any app for any user. It enables B2B2B and B2B2C providers to expand into the new markets with hundreds of millions of potential new customers:Source: Company's presentationOn the conference call Levi was excited about Box Platform and was very optimistic about its future:The third initiative focuses on building a world-class partner ecosystem. With the launch of new services and the potential of The Box Platform, the company plans to build strategic alliances with influential players from different industries that will enable Box to gain competitive advantages against others.Overall, it's good to see that the company is exploring different options that will help it to recover from the falling stock price and improve its current financial condition. Investors should be focused on the implementation of those three initiatives since their success will determine whether the company has a future.I personally have no position in Box and would rather wait for the next earnings call to see whether the company is worth investing in. But most of the analysts give it a ""Buy"" rating and expect a lot of upside to come in the coming quarters:Source: NASDAQFor example, Credit Suisse sees Box as a contrarian play and gave it a $24 price target, while Drexel has 12-month PT of $18 per share. And considering the potential of the company's new initiatives, they might be right. As for me, I'm currently waiting for more news to come."
3757576,70435,2015-12-15T15:32:17-05:00,Shares under pressure after lacking profitability and low user conversion rates.Stronger revenues have not led to positive cash flows with the company yet to profit.Better guidance and results will help shares rebound and improve shareholder value.,"Box (NYSE:BOX) has had a challenging year since its January initial public offering. After reaching highs shortly after going public, shares have consistently lost value and have struggled to maintain any real upward momentum. In the most recent earnings report, it's evident that Box is intent on turning the ship around after a decidedly strong performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Box outperformed earnings estimates and managed to set a bold outlook over the short and medium term, seemingly ready to turn the corner toward profitability. Recent market trends and competitive advantages point to Box being able to reach the guidance. However, in order to succeed, they must navigate a difficult field and a true turnaround will take time.Ending the Year StrongBox's shares have not found their footing all year and have tumbled after reaching highs the day after the company's IPO. After reaching $24.73 per share shortly after going public, Box shares have settled most recently at $12.79. Since the listing on the NYSE, Box shares have lost nearly 45% of their value. It also has been impossible for the company to sustain any real price growth as losses continue to expand and investors worry about the company's long-term profitability.Despite suffering from downside pressure on share prices Box has been successful at growing revenues consistently. For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the company reported $78.7 million in revenues, a 6% quarterly improvement, and a 38% improvement year over year. Box has now managed to raise revenues for four quarters running and is looking to continue that streak into next year. Aside from the top line success the company has steadily improved the operating cash flow situation, lessening the bleeding from -$19.6 million last year to -$17.3 million in the most-recent reporting period.Most of this revenue growth has come on the back of the company's ability to continue expanding both its individual user base and its enterprise division. The company has increased its user base by 4,000 in the latest quarter, raising its total number to 54,000 registered users overall. More than individual users, Box has been greatly successful at penetrating the enterprise market, building major partnerships with companies such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Box currently reports that they provide services to 52% of Fortune 500 companies as well as 52% of Global 2000 companies. These numbers represent a great value for Box beyond monetary gains. The company has managed to entrench itself as a reliable service provider and is well positioned to monetize its users.This user expansion has already shown results with billings increasing in the third quarter to $89.4 million, marking 37% year-over-year growth, and a $10 million improvement over the second quarter). Box is concurrently working to convert a larger part of billings into revenue by attempting to improve capacity and lower costs for hosting free users. Overall, the third quarter provided a positive picture for the company going forward.Box definitely felt encouraged, providing revenue guidance of $81-82 million, approximately 30% year-over-year growth, for the following quarter. Aside from revenue growth, the company expects to reach $150 million in positive operating cash flow by 2017. Overall, Box is gearing itself up for a potentially great run in 2016.Strengths and WeaknessesWhile the company's guidance is above analysts' predictions of around $80 million in revenues, it has positioned itself well to reach its goals. The company's road to profitability, however, is still a ways off. While Box has been successful at acquiring and retaining users, the vast majority of its users are still on free plans, meaning that the burden of hosting their data falls on Box. In the past year, the company has spent approximately $9.6 million every quarter, about 13% of quarterly revenues, in support costs related to free users. Even among the company's enterprise users, only 16% of the Box's enterprise customers are paid, and only 2% of the total users have moved to a paid plan.Despite the low conversion rate, the company has managed to create a very strong and recognizable brand profile. When combined with great market penetration, Box has found itself in a strong position to convert users to profits. The company is currently evaluating strategies to decrease the costs of hosting free users while also actively working to convert free users to paid users.Another strong plus for the company and substantial competitive advantage is its differentiation from the rest of the market. As opposed to services such as Dropbox, Box has been successful at creating a diverse offering of services from cloud storage to ""bring your own device"" (BYOD) to industry-specific platforms, a move that has strengthened its position within the sector.The FundamentalsSince listing on the NYSE, in similar form to many recently listed technology upstarts, Box has not listed a single profit in any of its quarters. This is reflective of the industry tendency to place an emphasis on the growth of the user base for the valuable data it offers and the ability to convert from a bigger pool of potential clients. However, as the share prices have made evident, this has not impressed Wall Street and investors looking for returns from a high-growth industry. In fact, since the IPO, net income has only deepened the decline despite an improvement in revenues.Debt levels have continued to steadily increase for the company all the while free cash flow remains firmly in negative territory, providing more cannon fodder for short sellers. At present, short interest in the shares is especially high, currently at 22.36% of outstanding shares, and one of the reasons why Box's stock price has fallen by nearly 45% year-to-date. While this means that a substantial group of investors are not confident in the outlook, should Box hit its revenue and cash flow targets in the coming quarters, it could mean a nice squeeze higher, especially considering the amount of float being held short.Shares have been beaten up over the last few months with Box stuck in a downtrend since the public offering. Since hitting a low of $10.93 in October shares have managed to rally back to the upside, but the downtrend remains intact. However, should earnings guidance come to fruition, it will provide some tailwind for shares to the upside and possibly reverse the existing decline. The target on the upside is $14.25 by the end of the year with positive fourth quarter results likely to push shares back toward $16.65 if Box does not disappoint.Outlook Strengthening In Spite of HeadwindsDespite difficult times for share prices, Box seems to be ready to turn the ship around. The company has been successful at improving its core business and has taken steps to increase its user base in a highly sustainable way after boasting a retention rate of 119% in the third quarter. Although it will require a drastic improvement in underlying fundamentals, 2016 represents a major opportunity for the company. If Box can maintain the momentum heading into next year, the company should provide early investors with more upside for shareholder returns after a disappointing first year as a publicly-traded entity."
3956816,37141,2016-03-09T01:52:21-05:00,,"By Eirik NordgaardBox (NYSE:BOX) is set to report its fourth-quarter financial results after the bell on Wednesday (3/9). Box is a cloud-based, mobile optimized Enterprise Content Collaboration platform that enables organizations to securely manage their content. As content creation and sharing is growing explosively, investors and analysts will be paying close attention to Box's report on Wednesday to get additional insight on where the industry is heading.Wall Street is anticipating Box to announce a loss of $0.41 per share and revenue in the range of $81-$82 million for the quarter.What to look for?Not to sound like a broken record, but future earnings projections are the most important variable that will influence the price of this stock. The latest trends are showing an increased adoption of cloud computing technologies as well as the need for technology where enterprises can collaborate and share files securely. Box has consistently been investing in security, compliance and administrative technology, which positions it in a favorable position for growth. However, continuous investments in research and development activities are costly and investors are worried that cost may overshadow growth in the to-be-reported quarter.As for the cloud storage and file sharing industry in general, future guidance is looking positive. On Monday, Box's competitor Dropbox (DROPB), released a statement saying its growth trajectory is stronger than ever. Dropbox has added a 100 million users since June of last year, and continues to scale its business operations. Dropbox also reported that growth among large customers (enterprises) was particularly strong. As long as Dropbox is not cannibalizing on Box's sales, this is a positive indicator for the company. Box is currently in a stronger position to capitalize on the growth in the enterprise market as this has been its main focus since day one.Box has several strategic partnerships with companies such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). According to Box, 99% of its 39 million registered customers and half of its paid customers are employees of Fortune 500 companies. Box's retention rate (renewals and sales of additional services) remains well above 100%, indicating that those massive customers won't leave anytime soon. Box's partnership with IBM, which provides IT services to plenty of Fortune 500 companies, is likely to strengthen its ties to these valuable customers.Analyst ConsensusWe took a look at where different analysts think this stock is headed. The average of analysts' estimates has a price target of $18.28 on the stock. The most bullish brokerage firm has a $24 target, while the most bearish sees the stock headed to $11.Several hedge funds and institutional investors recently modified their holdings of the company.Millennium Management LLC increased its position in shares of Box by 57.5% in the fourth quarter. Millennium Management LLC now owns 137,872 shares of the company's stock worth $1,925,000 after buying an additional 50,323 shares during the last quarter.New York State Common Retirement Fund increased its position in shares of Box by 516.6% in the fourth quarter. New York State Common Retirement Fund now owns 72,763 shares of the company's stock worth $1,016,000 after buying an additional 60,963 shares during the last quarter.Finally, Bank of America Corp DE increased its position in shares of Box by 415.9% in the fourth quarter. Bank of America Corp DE now owns 78,817 shares of the company's stock worth $1,101,000 after buying an additional 63,539 shares during the last quarter.Fundamental AnalysisFrom a fundamental perspective, Box's growth looks solid. Quarterly revenue grew by 37.9% last quarter, billings climbed 45%, and it ended the quarter with over 50,000 paying customers. However, Box also posted a GAAP net loss of .2 million, down from a loss of .6 million a year earlier. Box's operating expenses also jumped 30% to $102.6 million, fueled by an 18% increase in sales and marketing expenses and a 62% spike in R&D costs. Investors and analysts will be paying close attention to how cost in comparison to revenue has developed over the last quarter.Let's take a look at how Box's financial ratios compare against the other major players in the software as a service providers sector. We populated the SprinkleBit analyzer with, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). For this analysis, we used revenue multiples, market cap to revenue, market cap to total assets, and PE to measure Box against it peers.By running the fundamental measures in comparison to the peers, we received an implied share price of $23.77. With the current trading price of $12.7 (EOD 3/8), Box is undervalued by 96.93%.Technical AnalysisWe have also analyzed the technicals on the daily chart in order to see where the stock price could potentially move to.With an entry price of $12.07 and a reported loss on earnings, the stock has the potential to fall to $10.50 for a 13.01% loss.With an entry price of $12.07 and a reported beat on earnings, the stock has the potential to rise to $13 for a 7.71% gain.The risk/reward ratio for this trade is 0.67."
3738486,61281,2015-12-07T13:21:27-05:00,"Box reported Q3 results with declining growth and increasing losses.Since IPO, Box’s stock price has dropped by 40% and short interest reached 50% of the float.Box is going through massive change and will continue to bleed in the process.The company is a decent acquisition target for an enterprise software company.","Online storage/file collaboration provider Box (NYSE:BOX) reported Q3 earnings last week in light of the continuous decline in stock price and negative sentiment towards tech unicorns. Box's earnings attracted attention from both Wall Street and Silicon Valley as they look to see whether the company will provide positive growth figures that could suggest a possible turnaround for this once very promising unicorn.Box's results were not a complete disappointment: the company reported in line EPS and higher than expected revenues as well as providing Q4 guidance higher than analysts' consensus. Box mentioned that in Q3, 55% of the Fortune 500 companies were using Box solutions that are three percentage points quarter over quarter. This growth is going in the right direction of expanding the company's enterprise business to become more competitive while taking advantage of its increasing network (like the IBM (NYSE:IBM) partnership) which is a key component to Box's growth as described in an earlier article.Box CEO Aaron Levie mentioned again the strategic importance of enterprise business to the company's future growth and described some of the company's partnerships with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM. However, another comment by him seems more important to me:Box is currently focused on smaller companies and tries to replace other vendors in companies that are replacing their legacy software. However, the big money is with the big, complex corporations, where Box is currently not available. As personal storage like Cloud, Dropbox, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Drive, etc., have become commodities, and Box cannot win a price war in this segment, it's more than obvious that the company needs to accelerate its transition into the enterprise market. However, while going there, the company is bleeding currently, as shown in the chart immediately below.Box's top line growth has declined rapidly, while its operating losses deepen every quarter. In a period when investors are looking for stability, the increased losses and growth erosion are a red flag. The downward trend slowly convinces investors to either sell and stay away from Box or sell it short, as shown in the chart below.Since Box went public, its stock price dropped by 40% and short interest reached 48% of the float. Both of these figures represent limited investor confidence in the company fueled by declining growth, increasing operating losses, intensifying competition and the recent devaluation of Dropbox. Even though Box spotted the trend change in personal storage/file collaboration on time and started shifting to enterprise software, this transformation has represented a long and tough journey for Box.In the long term, I believe Box's shift to Enterprise software would prove to have been a good move, and the company's future solutions could compete in the big boys' playground. However, we are still not there, and the stock is likely to keep bleeding on the way. Box solutions might become more competitive in the big enterprises market. However, I think that competition with Microsoft or Google is somewhat out of Box's league, and I'm skeptical whether Box will be able to handle this on its own.As Box's enterprise solution gets more attention, I believe either IBM or Microsoft will acquire the company to beef up its solutions and prevent other tech giants from entering this market by acquiring Box before them.In the short term, I think Box could offer an interesting speculative investment as a high-risk/high-growth profile company, preferably through options that could capture the acquisition scenario and the trend change when it comes. For conservative investors, I think Box is currently too risky when an inflection point is still not in sight, and they should avoid it."
3958712,20521,2016-03-15T17:41:18-04:00,"Box's streak of losses continues, as it ended the quarter with a loss of $0.26 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.65 reported a year ago.The company's competitor, Dropbox, is expanding its presence into the enterprise segment.Both Box and Dropbox probably need to take inspiration from another player in the same space, Egnyte.","Last week, cloud-based storage services provider Box (NYSE:BOX) announced its fiscal 2016 revenues. The company may have beat the Street's forecast, but the market is still cautious with its valuation. The company's valuation plunged to less than half after it went public early last year. Things haven't looked much better since, with the stock continuing to languish at less than listing levels.Box's FinancialsThe company's fourth-quarter revenues increased 36% over the year to $81.8 million with billings growing 59% to a record $130.2 million. Its streak of losses continues, as it ended the quarter with a loss of $0.26 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.65 reported a year ago. The results were better than the Street's forecast of revenues of $81.77 million and a net loss of $0.29 per share.Box ended the year with revenues growing 40% to $302.7 million and billings increasing 50% to $369.1 million. Net loss for the year fell from $11.48 per share a year ago to $1.67 per share.Box finally appears to be focusing on improving its profitability. The company expects to be free cash flow-positive by the end of the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year. It also managed to reduce its spending during the quarter. In earlier years, Box's sales and marketing spend had outpaced its revenue. During the current quarter, its sales and marketing spend was a comparatively modest $63.3 million.For the current quarter, Box forecast revenues of $88-89 million versus analyst estimates of $86.9 million. It expects to end the current fiscal year with revenues of $390-394 million and a net loss of $0.85-0.83 per share. The market was projecting the year's revenues at $392 million, with a net loss of $0.88 per share.Box's PartnershipsDuring the quarter, Box continued to expand its relationships with key enterprise vendors. After announcing its tie-up with IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM) last year, the company has seen additional sales commitments from IBM that are expected to last over a decade. The two announced the availability of two new product integrations with IBM Case Manager and IBM Datacap. In addition, Box is working on a new workflow technology with IBM that will leverage IBM Watson's intelligence.Box also strengthened its partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and announced three new integrations with Office 365 that will now support integrations with Microsoft Office Online with real-time co-authoring, Office for iOS and Outlook.com. It also introduced Box for Enterprise Mobility Management with Microsoft Intune to offer cloud-based mobile device management, mobile application management and PC management capabilities. It released the Box for Windows 10 universal application that will deliver seamless content experience across Windows 10 devices.The company entered into agreements with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) to provide Box customers the ability to collaborate within Salesforce.As part of the company's security enhancement, it introduced Box KeySafe, a solution that allows customers to manage encryption keys in the cloud.The stock is trading at $12.17, with a market capitalization of $1.47 billion. It touched a high of $20.60 in June 2015. The stock has recovered from the 52-week low of $8.82 it touched in January this year. Early last year, Box had listed on the exchange at $14 a share. Prior to listing, the company had been valued at $2.4 billion in its venture-backed avatar.Dropbox's Enterprise OfferingsMeanwhile, Box's competitor, Dropbox (DROPB), is expanding its presence into the enterprise segment. For a while, Dropbox focused on attracting individual users to its service. Now, it is expanding its presence. The company recently released an Enterprise Tier for its Dropbox for Business and it claims to be seeing strong traction. Dropbox relied on a bottom-up approach to gain its business users - ""when enough people use technology in their personal lives, it's only a matter of time until it infiltrates their work lives and permeates throughout the company."" It already has 500 million users, and is hoping to convert them to business users. The company claims that it is being used in almost 8 million organizations, and is adding as many as 25,000 enterprise customers each quarter. 75% of Dropbox's enterprise customers are based outside the US.The company also is working on a beta release of a new team collaboration tool, Paper. The collaborative tool is currently a web-only app that grants users access through their Dropbox account. It works similar to Google Docs and allows multiple users to edit a document at the same time, with changes highlighted through different colors and identified by the user's full name displayed in the margins. Currently, the service is very basic and offers limited fonts, text sizes and formatting options, because the company wants to keep the service as a medium of collaboration of ideas and not distract users by focusing on formatting. The move will help Dropbox make progress in the Enterprise Collaboration market, which is forecast to grow from $47.3 billion in 2014 to $70.61 billion in 2019.Dropbox's FinancialsDropbox does not disclose its financials, and its latest revenues and profitability figures are unknown. According to reports, the company was trending at revenues of $300-400 million for 2014 and $200 million in 2013.The company has raised $1.1 billion so far from debt and equity financing. Its investors include JPMorgan, BlackRock, Innovation Department, QueensBridge Venture Partners, Salesforce Ventures, T. Rowe Price, Index Ventures, Accel Partners, AFSquare, Benchmark, Glynn Capital Management, Goldman Sachs, Greylock Partners, Institutional Venture Partners, RIT Capital Partners, Sequoia Capital, SV Angel, Valiant Capital Partners, Ali Partovi, Amidzad Partners, Bobby Yazdani, Hadi Partovi, Pejman Nozad, Signatures Capital and Y Combinator. In January 2014, Dropbox had raised $350 million at a valuation of $10 billion. Since then, the valuation, as predicted, has fallen significantly, as both Fidelity and T.Rowe Price cut down their valuations by as much as 51% in Q4 2015.Egnyte's FinancialsBoth Box and Dropbox probably need to take inspiration from another player in the same space, Egnyte. Mountain View-based Egnyte offers a hybrid approach to cloud-based storage. Its customers can store files either on-premise or on the cloud, because Egnyte realizes that most organizations would like to keep some of their files on-premise to maintain higher security and compliance. Its platform allows organizations to decide which files are to be stored behind their firewalls on their premises and which of those are to be made available on the cloud. The platform also makes suggestions on storage locations, based on a smart algorithm.Egnyte also has always been conscious of its financial model. The company does not offer any freemium options, and all services are available at a price. Prices vary depending on the software usage and the number of employees that are provided access to the platform. Egnyte does not disclose its financials either, but is expected to generate $100 million in revenues this year. The company is still not profitable.The company is venture funded, with $62.5 million received from investors, including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Google Ventures, Polaris Partners, Northgate Capital, CenturyLink, Seagate Technology and FLOODGATE. Its last round of funding was held in December 2013, when it raised $29.5 million at an undisclosed valuation from Seagate Technology, CenturyLink, Northgate Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Google Ventures and Polaris Partners. Recent valuation figures are not known.The cloud-based storage market is rife with competition. Dedicated players like Box, Dropbox and Egnyte are facing competition from giants like Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that provide similar services. Most of these giants bundle the cloud storage segment with some of the other services they sell, and offer cloud space for free. Dedicated vendors have thus had to reduce prices and rely on alternate approaches like partnerships to gain a bigger market share. The current price-based competition is hurting their profitability and, in turn, their valuations."
3524116,61281,2015-09-21T11:39:00-04:00,Apple's new iCloud prices are part of the commoditization trend in the consumer cloud storage services market.The leading competitors have strong ecosystems and leading branded apps.Box has improved its reach within Fortune 500 companies in the last few quarters.The company should strive to lead the business segment and become a follower in the consumer segment to succeed in the long term.,"In its September 9th event, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced a number of exciting new products that include the new iPhone, iPad and Apple TV devices that took most of the attention in this event. However, I want to focus on another announcement Apple made that day that might receive less attention but has wide implications over some companies - the new iCloud plans. The new iCloud plans could have probably gone unmentioned unless the company introduced a significant drop in its upgrade plan prices. The new prices are highly competitive and mostly on par with competition, as shown in the table below:Source: Companies' websitesSegments ComparisonApple's iCloud is primarily a personal cloud storage service targeted at common consumers. Let's see what the competitive landscape in the consumer segment is:Market ImpactThe new iCloud pricing will probably have very little impact on Google, Microsoft and Amazon as they have particular features that are preferred by certain consumers: OS compatibility, ecosystem, interaction with popular apps, ease of use and pricing. Dropbox and Box are unique players in the cloud storage market as cloud storage is their core business, and, while they have a broad partnership network, they don't have popular, branded productivity apps (like Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets and Apple Numbers in the spreadsheets app, for example) that are used as default services. Hence, they are highly dependent on their network and their marketing.While Dropbox remains competitive in all consumer segments, Box has a highly attractive offering in one segment and is totally absent in another. I don't think this is happening by mistake - Box understands perfectly that the consumer cloud storage segment is going through accelerated commoditization and it would be very hard for the company to compete with Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon in the consumer market when they have such a strong ecosystem in this segment.In the Q2 earnings release, Box mentioned that 52% of Fortune 500 companies and 28% of Global 2000 companies use Box's solutions. Box presents a gradual increase in these two factors as well as more registered users and larger partnership networks. As I mentioned above, I believe the consumer cloud services market is going through an accelerated process of commoditization where Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon offer very attractive pricing. Box cannot get into pricing wars with these giants in the slowing consumer market.To win in the long term, Box should strive to become a leader in the consumer segment while transforming to a follower in the consumer market. In the enterprise/business segment, Box should become more competitive, increase its network and ecosystem, as it did lately with the IBM (NYSE:IBM) partnership, and rebuild the company as an enterprise-focused service. At the same time, while consumer prices drop rapidly, Box should remain competitive, so it will not become obsolete, and match its prices to its competitors. In the event that Box becomes a leader in the enterprise segment in a few years' time, it could then invest in the consumer segment once again. For investors interested in benefiting from the expected surge in cloud storage, Box, at its current price, might be an attractive long-term alternative."
3479666,48411,2015-08-31T15:52:53-04:00,"BOX has been working the conference circuit hard ahead of its September 10th earnings report.I think this is to begin laying groundwork for a marketing and positioning shift that will hopefully help the company differentiate from peers.BOX equity has been under serious pressure and I fear, as I've opined in the past, that it could be taken out at much lower than IPO pricing.BOX needs to take aggressive marketing and messaging action to avoid ending up like Zulily, a cautionary tale of misconception.","We're eleven days out from Box (NYSE:BOX) reporting FQ2 results and I think the big question on every analysts' mind will be what exactly does Box have to do to shake its misled reputation (or is it?) of being just another cloud storage company? Because it's this that's dragging Box to lower lows post-IPO. If Box doesn't put a stop to this soon, it could end up being another Zulily (NASDAQ:ZU).Zulily, to much publicity as was well-deserved, came out to an incredibly hot IPO as it was billed as the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) competitor of the future (well, an Amazon competitor of the future). Zulily proceeded to crater from IPO with more and more impressive velocity after each quarterly reporting disappointment. This coupled with the fact that Zulily did have an attractive underlying model (if the value of it could be unlocked), an attractive infrastructure footprint (and becoming more attractive), and management's inability to get aggressive with spending to drive growth and/or innovation led to Zulily being taken out at near the all-time lows with very little of a premium (all things considered). That's how I can see the Box story playing out if Box can't defend its market cap much, much better than it has - a theory I detailed in a prior research note.Now, I think Box knows this and it's gone on the offensive as of late with its pounding the table on differentiation at its last two conference presentations - both the Cannacord Genuity Growth Conference and the Pacific Crest Global Technology Leadership Forum (via Sentieo.com). Box made sure the analysts present were well aware of its new product launches in EKM and a low cost (~$1/month/user) higher education offering as well as coming launches with new partner IBM (NYSE:IBM). All are relevant and all are meaningful, for sure. But the market, at least those that I chat with, has been well aware of this and still Box equity continues lower. I just don't know that this is an angle worth continuing to pursue at the expense of other, potentially more resonating ones. I think a major marketing and awareness shift in is order. I also think that Box might be on to one that should resonate, which is a good thing for Box longs.One messaging strategy that I noticed Box trying to really hit home with during both presentations was this idea that it's the ""vertical specific"" player in its space. I really, really like this strategy for tech and I've used it effectively before when working with tech startup management teams within my consulting business umbrella. This is a way for Box to become the ""white glove"" provider of cloud storage/EFSS and a way for it to be thought of in a different way than its largely commoditized peers. Guys, I really can't stress this enough - in tech the ""idea"" or the ""conversational"" positioning is equally as important as the underlying tech. It doesn't matter that an iPhone has largely the same tech capacity as competitors or that Microsoft Office has largely the same productivity capacity as competitors, both are conversationally positioned in a much different way than competing products/tech. If Box can execute on this marketing shift, which is one that I'm actively trying to convince Datawatch (NASDAQ:DWCH) management to launch (I have no business relationship with Datawatch but am considering taking a large position in the name - large enough, with a group of investors, that I'll need to file a Form 13D/G), I think it can change the trend for its equity price as well. And again, Box really, really needs to shift the trend quickly. Box has already shown a nice take rate in both healthcare and government verticals and with its partnership with IBM, who also really likes to play the vertical game, I expect Box to have continued success in this. We'll see.I think the big risk with Box isn't that the stock goes to zero but that the company gets taken out at a low price - very similar to Zulily as mentioned above. Like Zulily, Box has an attractive model and infrastructure. Box has plenty of customers, nice capital recycles - according to Box CFO Dylan Smith Box spends $2 for every $1 it creates in long term recurring annual revenues and has a 123% revenue retention rate, and a tech infrastructure (see: EKM) that would be hard/expensive/time taking to replicate. Box isn't a commodity, it's just being traded as one. That's a very dangerous place to be for shareholders who got in pre-IPO or anywhere north of the lows which the stock currently trades.We'll find out quite a bit more in regards to the Box story in eleven days. I'll update readers then.Good luck everybody."
3470876,92596,2015-08-27T09:16:43-04:00,"Fox in socks - Knocks on BOX Inc.Second-tier entrant in the fundamentally unattractive and largely unprofitable technology niche of cloud-based file sharing.With just 47K paying customers, Box is a tethered goat in a forest of industry apex predators including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Citrix, IBM and a phalanx of independents including Dropbox.Tech giants use file sharing as a loss leader to support well-developed ecosystems, and thus crush the margins of participants like Box, whose core business is file sharing.The firm has been significantly loss-making since founding ten years ago and has no viable path to positive cash flow, much less earnings in the next three years.","29 July 2015JWD Weekly CallThe Box IPO - ""call your broker immediately!"" Jim Cramer - 22 January 2015In the expanding hunt for one-off U.S. equity shorts, I have quantitatively detailed unattractive industry trends in: Telecommunications (fixed line, wireless and network backbone), Television (broadcasting and cable), Internet (Chinese niche freebies - *U.S. ADR - okay), Publishing (print media), Technology (infrastructure architecture - cloud hosting), Technology (internet media - streaming music), and Entertainment and Leisure (Macau casino operators - *U.S. parent).Each enterprise-specific short rationale was leveraged to either a) a fundamental deterioration of profitability, b) sector in long-term structural decline, c) flawed business model with explainable, depreciating business metrics. All of which should lead to earnings warnings, analyst downgrades, industry re-ratings and ultimately, operational losses. That's how we do it. On the weekly call, I focus on a company with elements of d) all of the above.Coupled with eyewash and puffery, the short story is a throwback to the peak of the last economic cycle, when Prince was partying like it's 1999. That was before the clock struck 'black midnight' on the new millennium, and dot.com bubble busted, as I near-drowned myself with salty tears in Verbier.Most in our guild believe that it's really different this time, in the technology sector. For reasons of broadly improved profitability, moderate leverage, lower valuations, sustainable business models, and importantly, pre-IPO private market lifespan of 14 years (2015 average) vs. 3.5 then; surely the consensus is correct (as it usually is). But there remains a sufficiency of hucksters, buskers, and big top promoters hiding in fold and we would like to finger them out.Enterprise: Box Inc.Ticker: (BOX US)Sector: TechnologyIndustry: Infrastructure Software - File Sharing PlatformAction: ShortExecutive SummaryWhat's in the box?Cutting through the verbiage and tech talk, Box runs a relatively unambiguous, understandable business. Founded in 2005, the firm gives away storage space on a file sharing platform in the cloud. Its internet service allows users to store personal files (originally photos and videos), in secured virtual book lockers that could be opened, viewed, shared and modified by selected users with a simple password.The freemium business model provides 10 GB of free storage, with the option to upgrade with a monthly subscription for larger users. As the operation is increasingly loss-making, building on ten years of red ink, Box is attempting to transition to subscriber paying enterprise (commercial) users. As of the most recent 10-Q, just over 9% of Box customers pay for the service. The company reports 37 MM users, but only 47,000 are revenue generating customers (one customer can have more than one user i.e. enterprise).This report will detail my financial analysis of the Box and quantify the model further on. But deviating from the usual standardised format, Box like the News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWSA) story, is very much leveraged to a man. In this specific instance, the persona of the chairman, CEO and company co-founder is an important driver of share price.Business Insider: ""A brilliant genius,"" Aaron Levie started building websites when he was 13 years old and launched Box Inc. from his dorm room.

Magazine' in 2013 and the USC Entrepreneur of the Year in 2014 (Inc.)It is not unreasonable to suggest that Box market capitalisation is broadly dependent on the credibility of this (once?) rising tech star. So the question is, where is he going from here? Based on the post-IPO share price, it appears that the fan base is losing its zeal. More on the boy wunderkind - read on.Cloud Hosting vs. File Sharing PlatformBut first, as I presented a short rationale for Rackspace Hosting (RAX U.S.) on 15 July, a succinct explanation of the difference between cloud hosting and file sharing is appropriate. Both RAX and BOX are players in the infrastructure software sector but very different niches.RAX revenuesContract Model75% managed hosting25% cloud computingCorporates pay Rackspace to deliver websites, host websites, service web-based IT systems, and provide cloud servers for computing. The firm targets a range of companies from SMID to enterprise. Think of it as contractual outsourcing. RAX builds and maintains a warehouse in the cloud, a 'work shop' where businesses to rent floor space (managed hosting) and run business computations (cloud computing). RAX peer comps are H-P (NYSE:HPQ), IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT) on the enterprise level; Amazon Web Services (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) on the SMID level.BOX revenuesFreemium model100% subscription feesBut 91% users pay nothingBox provides users with a 'box' on a file sharing platform. It does not provide services to manipulate the content itself and only supplies the room and proprietary software which theoretically makes it faster for users to sort and find their files (like the way we can find archived e-mails in Gmail). If the user needs a bigger room (storage space) with a better view (bells and whistles), then they pay a subscription fee.Both are fundamental shorts, Box is even more compelling; and here is why …Financial AnalysisThe bulls say that earnings do not matter and point to the Amazon model. The pioneering online retailer has been credited with growth and valued as a multiple of revenues (P/S). It is true that tech companies which exhibit aggressive growth trajectories are not typically trading at a P/E multiple - fine. Yes, Amazon's $248b of revenues just passed Walmart's (NYSE:WMT) $229b, becoming the single largest retailer in the world, without ever delivering a bounteous fat-bottomed line. But the critical difference here is that the online giant maintains a wafer thin but provisionally positive operating margin of +0.2%. Box (in business for a decade) operating margin in Q1 2015 was -77.0% and this is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.Box peaked on IPO at $23.23 and has since fallen 30% in six months to $16.29. Of interest (and I include this nifty annotation for the technical analysts in the crue), the stock just traded below the post-IPO bust level of $16.66 from 5 February 2015. The 'support' level of $17.00 watched by the traders since March has been broken, and shares are making new lows (Bloomberg)Consider that on 25 October 2014, the company was valued at $2.45b pre-IPO. Nearly two years later market capitalisation stands at $2.01b and I expect that it will shrink prodigiously from here. Why?CompetitionBOX faces overpowering competition from industry juggernauts Google's 'Google Drive,' Microsoft's 'OneDrive', Amazon (AMZN) 'Zocalo' and IBM's 'Connections'; as well as privately held Dropbox, Citrix (CTXS) 'XenMobile', Carbonite Inc. (NASDAQ:CARB), Logmein Inc. (NASDAQ:LOGM), and others.Dropbox 300MM usersOneDrive 250MM usersGoogle Drive 240MM usersBox Inc. 37MM users … but only 47k paying customersFile-sharing technology has dismissively low barriers to entry. As such, virtually all developed technology ecosystems offer it, as well as a significant number of smaller unlisted start-ups. The bullish Box spin implies a significant software differentiation; one that provides a better user experience, more options and customisation to user preferences.But all participants tout the same line, each with tiny variations on a theme, and I see no competitive advantage, rather significant weaknesses. On the enterprise level Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive, offer arguably better technology, better service, comparable storage space, and file size for 50% lower subscription fees.On the low end, there are manifold entrants providing similar services for free.And many believe that DropBox - with pending IPO - is best of breed.Unlisted start upsDropcanvas, Droplr, Clipica, Ge.tt, Snaggy, Pastelink and other unlisted start-ups are literally giving away what Box can do.Pastelink … 'The easiest way to share files online'Pastelink lets you share files in seconds, and is completely free of charge. There is no limit to the number of files one can share with Pastelink, 2GB limit per file.DropcanvasLimited to 5GB per file but unlimited number, thus no actual limit to the amount of files the user can store and share with not charge.Ge.ttThe user can active Ge.tt without creating an account.SnaggySnaggy is a sharing platform combined with a Photoshop-like image editing tool.DroplrMore of same with an iPhone app.ClipicaClipica is similar to Snaggy but creates a unique URL for each file such that images and videos can be sent or displayed on Facebook or Twitter.Knave of Diamonds - Wild CardIt is difficult to quantify the following investment consideration, but I submit that the telegenic CEO represents a 'wild card' in an otherwise fundamentally sound short analysis. Aaron Levie knows his audience and has them all fooled. From Business Insider, ""Brilliant Quotes That Show the Genius Mind Of Box CEO Aaron Levie"" October 25, 2014On competition, Levie says: ""The way that start-ups have to compete against big companies is by focusing on what are the things that the big companies can't do. It is never enough that you are just building a better product, or that you put together some different type of optimization on the service. You really fundamentally have to attack dimensions that are almost impossible for an incumbent to be competing on.""But in reality Box is not able to differentiate itself from the field in the intensely competitive, crowded and largely unprofitable cloud storage space.On Box: ""How do you take a sales force and a services organization that look more like a Salesforce.com or an Oracle or an IBM and marry that with a product and a cadence and a culture that moves like a Google or a Facebook? That's what we're trying to do at Box."" Meaningless sloganeeringOn technology: ""There are phases in technology. Mainframe to PC, PC to cloud, to cloud and mobile. These things come around every 10 to 15 years, and we're in one right now."" What?On building a company: ""It's all about, what are you trying to build and change that other people want to be a part of that process and that experience, and then going after the best possible people that you work with to go do that. That's what we did at Box."" wErds … scriptOn relentlessness: ""Never give up: They said Neil Armstrong wouldn't land on the moon. That Newton couldn't discover gravity."" The wunderkind compares himself to Isaac Newton.From the Eraserhead fright-dew at the top of his pointy head … (IMDB)... to the turquoise socks w. ruby jogging treads on his feet (actual photo of him speaking at Enterprise 2.0), Aaron Levie appears as a grandstanding maestro of costume, buzzword, and gimmick (businessinsider.com)The better I understand the story, the more it reads like a pump and dump. My position is that in this peculiar occurrence, the cult status of the Tout/Chairman/CEO/Co-Founder is in fact, a fundamental computation in current market cap. As his novelty and credibility in the investment community recedes, so surely will market capitalisation.Addition drivers of share price depreciation?M&A RiskIt is always a risk when shorting the space that a firm's client book and proprietary software has a takeout value to someone. but I believe less so in this short story, than others like Pandora (NYSE:P). Back when the world was right, pre-IPO and Levie was at the top of his game, it was reported that Box fetched a single bid for $550MM.Why would any prospective suitor pay more than that figure today, when the future for Box has dimmed considerably? Box has a small paying customer base and indistinguishable software.$550 MM implies a -73% downside from current market cap, and any potential buyer would likely wait for a decline in enterprise value before making a bid.There is no excess cash, so shorts need not worry about share buybacks or dividend announcements.Short InterestBox is heavily shorted with 5.6MM shares short representing 19.6MM ASO's or 29% of all shares outstanding requiring 5.8 days of ADV to cover. As previously indicated, a high SIR is not necessarily a red flag in my investment process. More often than not, a validation of original short thesis. Liquidity = 76% fleet float or about 1,000,000 share daily velocity.Lock-upThe post-IPO lock-up and quiet period, ended last week 22 July 2015. New NASD rules make it for difficult for institutions to flip hot money IPO's like Box than in 2000, but I would anticipate significant volatility over the next two weeks. 1) Insiders and institutions, seeders and incubators with 30,000,000 shares will be selling and 2) sellside spivs will be banging the gong and rattling the bars.* Look for CS to pound the table. Interestingly, co-joint book runners MS and JPM are already neutral; and my analysis of Mark R Murphy's spreadsheet was enlightening. And another clue from the other side of the trading desk, only two (2) of nine (9) bank analysts who cover the name have assigned a [Buy] or [Outperform] rating, which is highly unusual in this liquidity driven market. Seven (7) are neutral [Hold], market perform, or [Sell] rated.*on cue, Monday night 27 July, Pacific Crest, Portland Oregon-based, bucket shoppe analyst Robbie D Owens was the first to 'upgrading' Box with new $24 USD price target implying 12-month near 50% upside.

3509126,20521,2015-09-14T14:25:34-04:00,,"I have repeatedly written about the VC funding frenzy that has taken companies with doubtful business models to lofty valuations and exorbitant amounts of funding. Driven by such valuations, it is little surprise then that on the public stock exchanges even Billion Dollar Unicorns have faltered. Cloud storage company Box (NYSE:BOX) is one such example.After continuing to struggle with the timing of an IPO, Box went public earlier this year. Since listing, their valuation has been declining and the stock continues to struggle to go past its list price.Box's FinancialsFor the recently reported second quarter, Box's revenues increased 43% over the year to $73.5 million. Billings for the quarter grew 45% to $79.6 million. They continued to report losses and ended the quarter with a loss of $0.28 per share. The market was forecasting revenues of $69.7 million and a loss of $0.29 per share.Box expects to end the current quarter with revenues of $76 million-$77 million, compared with the Street's forecast of $74.2 million. They are looking to end the year with revenues of $295 million-$297 million compared with the market's expectations of $289.5 million. They revised their guidance for the year upwards from $286 million-$290 million expected a quarter ago.Box's Tie-UpsBox recently entered into several agreements to help gain a bigger market share. They entered into a global partnership with IBM that will integrate their solution with IBM's enterprise content management, analytics, social collaboration, and security products. Through the tie-up, Box's solutions will be available to IBM's customers globally. Additionally, Box will also be incorporated into IBM's MobileFirst initiative for iOS apps. They also entered into an agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) that will allow for integration of Box with Office 365 for the desktop, Office on iOS and Outlook.Box's Product EnhancementsMeanwhile, Box continues to deliver product innovations. During the recently ended quarter, they announced the availability of Box Governance, a new solution that will allow customers to seamlessly manage the entire life cycle of business documents including creation, retention, and final disposition. Recently, they also added several new enhancements to Box's metadata service that include metadata templates in the admin console, metadata APIs, and the ability to sync metadata from third party systems.To expand their reach in other industries, Box launched Box for Education, a new service that has been customized for the education industry. The service will allow universities to develop custom departmental workflows to accelerate collaborative processes, create workspaces that will help in new ways of connecting and learning and reducing the risk and simplifying the governance of end-user IT. They also announced integration with Blackboard Collaborate, an online collaborative learning solution.Despite the innovations, the market is not too pleased with Box. The company continues to burn through cash and is failing to carve out a defensible position for itself in the industry. Bigger players like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft themselves are at a price war in the space, making it difficult for Box to improve margins.Their stock is trading at $13.71 with a market capitalization of $1.65 billion. It touched a high of $24.73 soon after listing in January this year. Box had listed on the exchange at $14 a share. As expected, its valuation has fallen since pre-IPO levels. Prior to listing, Box had raised $564.1 million with their last round of $150 million valuing them at $2.4 billion.Dropbox's FinancialsThings aren't much better for Box's competitor, Dropbox. After years of speculation of whether or not Dropbox will list, Dropbox's management recently suggested that the company would much rather focus on improving profits than going public. Like Box, Dropbox too operates on a freemium model. While their detailed financials are not known, analysts peg their revenues between $300 million-$400 million for 2014. Revenues are expected to have grown from $200 million in 2013. However, we're hearing rumors that revenues have now started to decline. These rumors are unverified. According to market reports, of the more than 400 million users that Dropbox has, a mere 100,000 are paying enterprise customers.The weak monetization has not stopped Dropbox's skyrocketing valuations. They have raised $1.1 billion so far from debt and equity financing. Their investors include JPMorgan, BlackRock, Innovation Department, QueensBridge Venture Partners, Salesforce Ventures, T. Rowe Price, Index Ventures, Accel Partners, AFSquare, Benchmark, Glynn Capital Management, Goldman Sachs, Greylock Partners, Institutional Venture Partners, RIT Capital Partners, Sequoia Capital, SV Angel, Valiant Capital Partners, Ali Partovi, Amidzad Partners, Bobby Yazdani, Hadi Partovi, Pejman Nozad, Signatures Capital, and Y Combinator. Their last round of venture funding was held in January 2014 when they raised $350 million at an unrealistic valuation of $10 billion.Well, from here, the only way to go is downhill!"
3352485,48411,2015-07-23T18:28:19-04:00,"Every time I get bullish Box, Dropbox has to come out with something innovative.Internal communication and chat engine startup Clementine is out with news that it’s been acquired by Dropbox.Dropbox now offers a Slack-lite within its overall platform and should make file sharing and collaboration much, much easier.This should matter to Box considering that while Box isn’t directly identifying as a cloud storage pure-player it doesn’t want to concede market share.Box, now and again, is stuck on the defensive in that I think it needs to do something immediately to address this new convenience that Dropbox is offering.","Every time I get bullish Box (NYSE:BOX) - though I'm not a raging bull, recently I've been more complimentary than at any time in prior coverage - Dropbox has to come out with something innovative. I get that Box is beginning to diverge from the Dropbox/OneDrive (NASDAQ:MSFT)/Google Drive (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) peer group and into something of a quasi-cloud storage platform. One that offers security and access via its new IBM (NYSE:IBM) partnership as its primary value add. But I don't think it's far enough away from the peer group or established long enough in its own classification (that it's trying to secure) to completely ignore Dropbox developments. I still, rightly or wrongly, consider Box and Dropbox in a two-horse race for the cloud storage top spot and with that I watch Dropbox very closely.Internal communication and chat engine startup Clementine is out with news that it's been acquired by Dropbox. Clementine is basically a Slack-lite or a blended WhatsApp/email service for non-phone number tethered internal communication. This makes it tailor made for SMB/enterprise deployment, an area that both Dropbox and Box have targeted as a primary market to capture. Clementine is best explained by imagining if Microsoft cared enough to integrate a side-chat engine into Outlook or if Google made it convenient to access Hangouts in-Gmail or had a pure-play chart service in-Gmail. (Hello! Microsoft and Google - are you reading this? Do this!). That's basically what Clementine is and that's exactly what Dropbox (and Box) needed.Dropbox now offers a Slack-lite (which it and Box have integration with but Dropbox's integration, it should be noted, is much deeper) within its overall platform and should make file sharing and collaboration (via its own Microsoft integration) much, much easier. This should matter to Box considering that while Box isn't directly identifying as a cloud storage pure-player it doesn't want to concede market share just because it's trying to focus on being the most secure and readily-accessible platform. Box wouldn't do well to see Dropbox closing enterprise customers and upmarket SMBs in size because it's now that much more of a value add to the daily workflow. That concept I don't think is hard to understand.Box, now and again, is stuck on the defensive in that I think it needs to do something immediately to address this new convenience that Dropbox is offering. It wasn't but a little over a month ago that I was expressing to readers these same concerns about Dropbox offering to users and non-users the ability to collaborate and share in file storage/maintenance via its link sharing capability. Box of course already offered this for users only and has yet to address this for non-users, presumably the only crowd it's targeting for acquisition (please note the sarcasm). I guess we can add internal chat as another bullet point on the Honey-Do list that Box needs to complete to be up to par with Dropbox in convenience, collaboration, and workflow optimization.Post lockup and trading at the abbreviated 52-week lows I would think that Box has plenty of work to do to move higher. It just seems like Box is always one step behind or aiming in not the wrong direction but a slightly off-the-mark direction. We'll have to see how it all plays out, and I'm still thinking that Box is viable takeout target for both Microsoft and IBM for the reasons stated in prior articles, but Box right now is confusing at best and on the defensive at best. I don't have a strong opinion on the stock in either direction, mostly in light of the technical trading of the stock, but I'd be conservative about adding here on the lows. Box has plenty going for it, but it also has plenty going against it in a confusing directional development focus. Let's hope it clears up soon.Good luck everybody."
3505426,48411,2015-09-11T13:33:30-04:00,Box reported excellent financial results at FQ2/16 reporting - but financials have never been what worries the market longer-term.Box also reported that it continues to see take rate for its new beta products and for some of its recently launched new-tech additions - both are good news.But did Box do enough to shift the conversation away from long-term existential concerns? Or did Box not?,"Box (NYSE:BOX) did quite a few things for itself at FQ2/16 reporting. None were more important than continuing to evidence itself as a growing financial story. That's where Box has built its valuation bull case foundation and it's a good spot to have done so because Box really is a great (and getting better) financial story. But outside of this and definitely more important to the Box narrative, the thing that Box absolutely had to do at Q2 reporting was establish itself as a differentiated player in the EFFS/cloud storage space. It had to, because - well, this continues to be the valuation bear case that's winning out quarter after quarter of financial reporting. This is the overwhelming, front of mind thought on both investor and analyst minds and this is the reason the stock needs to double from last close to reach 52-week highs. So did Box do this? Kind of. I'll explain.First, Box financials continue to impress. Box reported it now has more than 50,000 paying customers which includes more than 52% of the Fortune 500 and 28% of the Global 2000. Box also reported an uptick in large deal size, a meaningful metric in the space to track, after closing 33 deals over $100,000 compared to 21 a year ago. It also announced it closed 4 deals over $500,000 compared to 3 a year ago. Again, I think this big ticket count is meaningful in evidencing enterprise presence. If Box can effectively prove out its value prop to each quarter's cohort expect the velocity of these deals to increase Y/Y for comparable periods. Box investors would love to see that.Box revenue and billings in Q2 were $73.5 million and $79.6 million, representing Y/Y growth of 43% and 45% - impressive figures at this stage of maturation when considering Box's overall size. But it wasn't just pure volume that Box created (although that helped), Box is creating more efficient volume as it leverages into its fixed cost infrastructure. While this isn't unusual of subscription based models it is worth pointing out. As Box approaches $300 million annual revenue run rate it's managed to bring non-GAAP operating margin in 12 points - bring the metric down from negative 57% to negative 45%. Box leveraged its S&M line, which should be leveraged down sequentially going forward, 18 points bringing this line down from 91% of revenues to 73% of revenues.All of this coupled with a lower cost to support free users (this was as a result of that oh-so-evil word, commoditization, that continues to be the black cloud over the Box story) helped Box leverage into operational cash burn a whopping 20 points. Box cash from operations fell from 50% of revenues to just 30% of revenues. With Box being able to leverage topline growth and the commoditization (read: deflation creation) of storage costs to lower cost of housing for free users Box now sees the quarter ending JAN 31, 2017 as its first at free cash flow positive. All told, great news and a great quarter from a financial standpoint. By the way, as long as Box remains ""on top"" (with Dropbox as well) of the niche expect these financials to do nothing but improve.But again, nobody was really all that worried about Box as a financial story in the here and now. What (we) the market is worried about is the commoditization of Box's services longer term. Much has been written about the ""race to zero"" for the space's seemingly destined to be commoditized services. Tim Walters at Digital Clarity Group is actually recently out with an amazing summarization of the commoditization dynamic in tech with a focus Box. I recommend a read. I've also written about this subject before for readers and focused on how this might eventually lead to a takeout of Box at much lower valuations - the fact is even if commoditized Box's services and infrastructure are impressive.So did Box do anything to change the conversation? I'm not sure it did entirely but it did establish a strong start. Box definitely continues to run with its ""vertical specific"" marketing shift in noting that (SOURCE: BOX FQ2/16 investor call), ""we plan to jointly create new apps for customers in industries like healthcare and retail,"", and, ""as a part of Box for Industries, we are continuing to build deep expertise, product enhancements, partnerships and go-to-market efforts in verticals like retail, media, fin serve, healthcare and government"". I applaud this directional marketing pivot and reiterate my thoughts of my previous research note. This is most definitely Box's highest visibility strategy for exiting the ""zone of commoditization"" it entered regarding public opinion of its services.Box also noted, very importantly, that it continues to see a trend of a greater percentage of its overall user base as paid users, that its taking price - Box noted a pricing uplift of between 20% and 30% for new enterprise customers deploying new enterprise tech offerings (read: EKM, governance product, etc.), and that its retention remains a robust 121%. Box's paid user percentage sits currently ~11% which is up 200 bps Y/Y - people don't pay for commodities. Box's pricing take is also important in that it shows a growing product saturation at a higher price point on a solution/tech basis and a higher overall tick rate. Both are meaningful in shaking off the commodity label.So, for me, Box did well its first quarter out of the gate focusing on changing the conversation. I think at BoxWorks, the company's annual customer conference kicking off in a few weeks, the company has a chance to reiterate this new theme as well as attach the theme to any new product announcements. BoxWorks is usually when Box outlines a yearly update to its product roadmap - Box should focus entirely on illustrating how the roadmap is differentiating. Box should also avoid noting that major partners like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) prefer to ""partner up"" rather than create similar services to its own on their own, something management noted on the Q2 investor call. That doesn't exactly scream ""we're a business that is worth investing in"" - if Microsoft and IBM would prefer to use services rather than tether financials to them isn't that counterproductive to the new narrative? I think it is.Still, I'm more than impressed on the whole with what Box has done financially and more importantly with what Box did ""conversationally"". Box needs to relentless pound the narrative into the brains of those that follow its services. I continue to believe that Box isn't a commodity, but that it currently trades like one. In that, I continue to recommend an avoid of the stock but this is a name worth following. If Box can figure out how to get proper valuation the valuation will be much, much higher.I'll report back after BoxWorks. Good luck everybody."

This integration, which is just 8 days after Box announced a similarly huge integration with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for its Microsoft Office 365, further confirms my speculation that Box is ""on the block"" as an acquisition target.I recently opined that Box, the polarizing ECC platform provider, could be being looked at as a potential platform addition for Microsoft in that Microsoft's integration signals a concession of OneDrive market share. It should also be noted, which wasn't mentioned in my article, that Microsoft also has a substantially similar integration with Box competitor Dropbox. That said, I believe this to only underline my speculation that Microsoft has conceded its OneDrive market share. Also, that Microsoft is instead trying to first promote the take rate of its productivity suite while secondarily building a ""wish list"" for cloud storage and collaboration providers.Now, how is this summary relevant to the Box/IBM partnership?With the Box/IBM partnership bringing the benefits of IBM's Analytics, Social, and Security tech to Box customer's existing and new as well as the new ability to choose local, in-region data storage on IBM's cloud platforms for international enterprise customers I believe Box is now significantly more attractive as an overall acquisition. Along with these benefits the IBM partnership also will allow builders and developers to integrate Box API's into enterprise apps and web services tethered to IBM's platform and existing Box customers will now be able to utilize Watson Analytics for contents stored via Box.Again, this materially changes the reach and use case capacity of Box and that is a very, very enticing combination for a company the size of IBM and/or Microsoft - both with agendas much larger than cloud storage and collaboration to push. Adding this capacity via M&A, at what is currently a discount to IPO pricing, just makes sense.With Box now having the ability to offer the entire Microsoft/Box customer base something that at least is competitive with what Dropbox is offering the Microsoft/Dropbox customer base and now being paired with IBM either Microsoft or IBM stands to be in-line for substantial cross selling with a purchase of Box, using Box as the ""middle man"". Box should have no problem retaining both associated customer bases that it has crossover with as a result of the deep integrations with both companies.Put simply, the more deep integrations that Box can execute on the more attractive it becomes as a takeover. It also, if immediate term market reaction to both the Microsoft and the IBM announcements is an indication, become a more expensive takeover target.If either player is serious about taking a leadership role in the space and/or leveraging a massive cross sell opportunity I anticipate rumors of a Box takeover circulating in the mid-term at the latest.Good luck everybody."
3275035,48411,2015-06-22T13:41:10-04:00,"BOX has partnered with Microsoft to bring several conveniences to Box and Microsoft Office crossover customers.The BOX platform will now allow users to alter, autosave, and view Office files in real-time from any device regardless of operating system.Clearly a huge value add from the BOX side and an admission of concession from Microsoft for its OneDrive cloud storage competitor.But I believe this is a long-term move from Microsoft in that Microsoft eventually buys BOX and its more secure offering.Continue to avoid BOX but BOX is interesting longer term now.","The Box (NYSE:BOX) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) partnership is a really, really peculiar one. It's interesting to say the least. It's especially interesting in light of Microsoft's obvious, concentrated, and massive SMB/enterprise solution push in that I think it underlines just how not concerned the company is with even maintaining the subpar OneDrive's competitive standing. I think this partnership and deep integration could also mean much bigger things for both companies down the road.Microsoft and Box have teamed up to allow Microsoft Office users several conveniences when working with files stored with Box. Again, I think that Microsoft accommodating Box - a supposed OneDrive competitor (actually, for a fact Box is a competitor of OneDrive), simply makes obvious that the only reason Microsoft hasn't divested OneDrive is that it theoretically furthers the value of the broader SMB/enterprise productivity suite as a whole. Outside of that, it appears Microsoft has shunned the storage facility.Microsoft and Box now allow Microsoft Office users the ability to open Office documents, across the suite - inclusive of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc., on any operating system while using Box as the launch platform. Also, Microsoft Office users will now be able to have changes saved across the Box platform on an automated basis. This means that on an immediate basis Microsoft Office files will be accessible in real-time on a real-time basis, inclusive of all changes. That matters to a global enterprise or an SMB operating in multiple offices. This also makes Box a much, much more collaborative platform to Microsoft Office users and Box also brings the added bonus of being superbly secure - a major value add to all Box users.While I don't expect this to have, say, Slack users transitioning use-time to Box this is a huge development for Box to a large segment of users (over 1 billion Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents reside on Box as of mid-June 2015). What I mean by that is that Box (which is also integrated into Slack - but isn't promoted by the company as readily as Dropbox) isn't trying to be a collaboration and workflow solution, like a Slack, but it is in fact a contributor now to higher rates or collaboration and to increased workflow as a result. This is a readily understandable and highly visible ancillary benefit to using Box that wasn't there before and it matters.Now what does this mean longer term?I think it means that at some point, but only at the far ends of the valuation spectrum - I'll explain, that Microsoft ends up buying Box. Allow me to explain.So, Box has been on a seemingly perpetual slide in valuation since its IPO for reasons that have been well-advertised. That said, it does for its space have some nice attributes - most notably the security it brings to cloud storage. But, I don't believe it can be a big runner (as was expected at IPO) or even have serious long-term viability simply offering cloud storage. Cloud storage, led by Microsoft and especially Google, is in a race to zero. The mechanism is a complete commodity.Still, if Box gets cheap enough I believe that because of the differentiators Box does have and the fact that OneDrive is just about the least competitive cloud storage platform that Microsoft just makes the investment into buying Box. Buying Box would buy a bunch of crossover customers who are already using the platform, it would secure these users within the Microsoft Office productivity suite, and it would allow for a more secure, safer cloud storage platform to further drive the Microsoft SMB/enterprise solution suite.Now, the opposite end of the spectrum has Microsoft (in my opinion) doing the same thing. If Box can somehow prove to not be a commodity or to be differentiated I think Microsoft would be silly not to buy what would at that point have to be evidencing itself as a best of breed cloud storage platform. Given the above-mentioned customer base crossover and at that point whatever Box is doing to not be a commodity it would just make too much sense.Whatever ends up happening, this Box partnership tells me that Microsoft is done investing in OneDrive and that it's conceding the market share to Box. That's good for Box and probably good for Microsoft in that OneDrive wasn't a big value-add to begin with.Again, in summary this partnership is peculiar to say the least. I think it's the tip of a massive iceberg that we see more visibly as time goes on. For now, it's simply a reason to buy both companies…if you're ""into"" the cloud storage space when it comes to Box.I'm not, so I'll recommend an avoid of Box and a long position in Microsoft - two recommendations that are unchanged in light of the partnership.Good luck everybody."

One of these concerns, the fact that BOX is being commoditized by other, easy-to-acquire, easy-to-use point solutions, was partially dealt with by direct competitor and similarly named Dropbox two days ago.Dropbox, which is a private file sharing/file storage company, has given users and non-users platform access in two very distinct but very important capacities - again, addressing one of the primary concerns that I had/have with BOX.Dropbox has allowed users to request files from non-users via a generated link that directs the file being shared to a specified location. The use cases are obviously near-limitless and many of you reading this article (who are also likely either BOX and/or Dropbox users) have probably been wondering (as I have) why this feature wasn't implemented at launch. Further, Dropbox has created the interface to allow for automation of the request, if deemed appropriate by the user. Finally, Dropbox has allowed this external file requesting for files as large as 2GB - effectively putting it in-line with one of the more popular free file shares applications WeTransfer.Let's talk about why this matters.First, the competition between BOX and Dropbox (and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), etc.) is fierce. Incredibly. With, in my opinion, BOX and Dropbox being the pure-play name brands in the space having a differentiator like this is undeniably a competitive advantage.That's not good for BOX.What this also will do is potentially pull over and/or lock-in users of point solutions/existing users of Dropbox to the company that might have been considering (if being pulled over from point solutions) between BOX and Dropbox. To be clear, assume I use Microsoft OneDrive and WeTransfer. I user OneDrive for my file ""sharing""/storage and WeTransfer to actually facilitate the sharing off OneDrive platform. Now, if I'm aware of what's going on at Dropbox, likely I just consolidate the point solutions. Maybe I'm just a WeTransfer user and decide I want file storage as well as transfer ability - now I just become a Dropbox user as well. If I'm not already using a file storage facilitator like BOX or Dropbox and I visit a comparison website which one do you think now stands out?The other big place where this matters is convenience and I'll try to be concise with this but it deserves some detail as well.Now, using Dropbox, I don't have to confirm the file sharing transaction. The file is either in the location I selected or it isn't. I'll be able to clearly see the file in its place or clearly see that it isn't in its place. Prior to this upgrade, using either service, I would have had to send an email asking for the file to be sent to me (assuming a non-user is sending the file) and I would have had to confirm that user enrolled in the platform (BOX or Dropbox), successfully sent the file, and that receipt was good on my end.The only workaround to this was using an integration vehicle that also has a chat engine, like a Slack for example. Otherwise, as stated above, I'm now using email to facilitate all the interim steps necessary to actually share and store the file. Why wouldn't I just use email to execute this?What Dropbox's new feature does is create new use cases, potentially create new users, make existing users happier, make its platform stickier, and make its platform more defensive to 1) file sharing apps, 2) project management apps that offer file share and some form of storage, 3) collaboration apps that offer file share and some form of storage, etc.The point is this was big and it's something BOX doesn't have. Again, that's not good for BOX.So, incredible security of platform and massive network be darned - BOX is on the clock to match this feature. The question is how long does it take and at what market share cost.I continue to recommend an avoid of BOX.Good luck everybody."
3247876,48411,2015-06-09T19:03:37-04:00,"BOX, which I'm admittedly a soft bear on, had an impressive showing at the Credit Suisse Disruptive Tech Conference.BOX allowed Justin Somaini, VP of Enterprise Security, to explain to the markets the ways that the company protects data and secures traffic.BOX also detailed its thoughts on M&A and expanded its already robust security offerings.While impressive, the core avoid case remains with this name and I have to stand pat on my recommendation.","Box (NYSE:BOX) recently presented at the Credit Suisse Disruptive Technology Conference and I thought the presentation was a really important one considering what's happened with the stock since coming public and considering that to this point I've been harsh when analyzing BOX.BOX sent Justin Somaini, its Chief Trust Officer/VP of Enterprise Security, to do its bidding and he was a great choice. Again, in light of the expressed market concerns he makes perfect sense.I think lost in the commoditized service that BOX generally provides, what I believe is a second tier collaboration application, is the unique security levels that BOX brings to the table. This doesn't get talked about enough by the industry. Nobody is guilty of this as much as I am, but it is an important bull case argument to get right. When considering a BOX position - long, short, or none at all, you should have all the info.BOX did well at this conference and it needed to.The following are my thoughts.(All conference information provided via Sentieo.com.)An Email Value Add?...The big bear case argument I have against BOX goes something like this - even if I use BOX I still have to send an email to notify the other party of change (most effectively) and Box is competing with companies more than happy to be in a race to zero.Why don't I just use email? Or something with a chat built in like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - which is a company happy to see this space in a race to zero? Or something with hundreds of integrations, a chat, and a more effective overall workflow manager - also called Slack.Well, apparently, because BOX offers a wide variety of access rights and expiration capabilities. I mean, this still doesn't matter to me if 90% of my file traffic is about my new Subway sandwich (assuming I own enough Subway shops to be considered ""enterprise,"" which is the market BOX targets) because the sensitivity and the document control at that point is just about meaningless, but I can see how this matters in the big picture across TAM. This feature would still matter to my finance guys (using the sub shop example) and there would still be the potential for an expanded use case potentially (in our example).Look, this matters and I can and have to admit that even being a soft BOX bear. But does this matter in such a large way that I would stop using Slack which has direct integration with Dropbox? I'm not sure it does. Especially when factoring in the overall race to zero that pricing is in.Logs on the market cap fire…So for me this does matter.I like the idea that BOX brings an added level of accountability and work flow tracking for a laundry list of reasons that I think are obvious. That said, this also scales down to the bottom end of the enterprise market and is a definite reason to own BOX even if my primary business (our example of owning a sub shop) doesn't value security at a premium. It's still nice to know who has access to what in chronological order from an efficiency improvement standpoint.Anything that I can collect data and analytics from in an effort to ""get better"" (read: more efficient) is worth at least hearing out.Security, security, security…Again, this is why I was happy to have an expert on BOX's security features doing the presenting. This is another plus for the bulls. BOX being able to even further restrict, or provide the ability for restriction, document use is huge.Limiting the ability to print/copy/download a file limits its potential distribution. If you've ever tried to raise money for a private placement in the micro cap space you would understand how valuable this feature would be. Sure, rumors and the content of the document could still leak and if somebody wanted to they could still transcribe the document but any level of deterrent is a positive. BOX's watermarking should only further this.M&A…I think this is pretty self explanatory but I'm really happy for BOX bulls to hear the company acknowledge that it's willing and actively looking for M&A opportunities.BOX needs to get better, more comprehensive, differentiated and defensive to survive in this space. I'm not too hot on Dropbox for these exact same reasons as well. I just don't think that as is BOX can stand to not aggressively try to acquire all the attributes I listed above. Apparently, the company is aware of this and that's also a good thing for the bulls.Still an avoid…I'm willing to be proven wrong on BOX and again I did like its overall presentation. I learned a bit about the company that I didn't know and we got some insight into the future. But again, as is I can't responsibly recommend a long position in this name.I still recommend an avoid of BOX.Good luck everybody."
3280285,24276,2015-06-24T09:03:55-04:00,"Box shares are up on a wide-ranging deal with IBM.Box also has big deals working with Microsoft and GE.It has yet to make a profit, but it does swim with sharks well.","The last time I looked at Box (NYSE:BOX), the cloud storage start-up, I was predicting it would try to get out of the box it was in as a generic storage provider through acquisitions like Verold, which offers an application for analyzing data visually from a cloud.Now, after delivering what most considered a strong quarter, sales of $65.8 million and a loss of $47 million, or 40 cents per share, the company is showing the next step in its rise, alliances with some of the biggest names in business.Our Dallas Salazar has been looking closely at the company's relationship with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), predicting that the company may eventually buy Box, but on Tuesday it announced a second partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM), one that is actually more far-ranging.The plan is that Box customers will be able to store data in any of IBM's 46 data centers, apply IBM tools stored at Box, and bring Box more software. Asked about the deal, CEO Aaron Levie pointed not to the Microsoft deal as an offset, but his continuing relationship with General Electric (NYSE:GE), which has invested in the company.In other words, don't worry about this shark or that shark because Box is swimming with a bunch of sharks. Look, they're friendly.I think that's one way to look at it, a positive way. But there is also a negative way. Big companies are offloading some things customers want to Box that they don't feel like building on their own. It's a cheap way to seem to be expanding in the cloud, letting Box make the investment, so if it works they can buy Box, which has a market cap of just $2.1 billion, or more likely just take those operations back in-house, leaving Box adrift.Where you used to buy Box based on its ability to grow quickly as a cloud storage service, in other words, you're now buying Box based on Levie's ability to charm big corporations into painting Box' fence, Tom Sawyer-style. Instead of the corporate partners investing in his company, he signs alliances with the big boys that persuade the public markets to finance his expansion.So far it's working. Box has a host of major institutional and mutual fund shareholders, so that despite never having made money for shareholders, the shares are holding their own, down less than $6/share from their first trade in January. The assumption is that if Box can continue getting corporate applications to support its service, and their customers to buy its service, then its future is secure because, if one of those sharks makes a move to buy it, the resulting battle would make all shareholders rich.If you like swimming with sharks in a box, then Box may be the stock for you. It's not the way I play."
3311835,83436,2015-07-08T13:37:23-04:00,"BOX is trying to move away from cloud storage and towards being a data management platform.Big companies can clearly use a dedicated data service, as BOX aims to provide, and this will obscure competition with more watered-down customer attention and less crucial software tech development.The company's stock chart has taken on a predictable pattern - though such patterns are rarely reliable, the fundamental upstrokes caused by positive news are showing how to play long term.BOX stock is intrinsically tied to profit hopes. Today, it is a medium-short term player's stock, but savvy long-term investors have indications of when to buy and occasionally sell off.","IPO Hype Smashed The Long-Term Investment AngleBox's (NYSE:BOX) IPO was turbulent, beginning at the average consensus of $17-$18 per share, and momentarily popping to 60% over that valuation. The short-lived hysteria dialed back to reality; however, after an undesirable income report, dragged the price back to $17 per share.Box has already indicated that profits are not today's focus. For long-term investors, it must be questioned whether the company has the leverage needed to provide reliable motivation of stock price from today until the day a decent revenue-to-profit ratio finally shows up.I personally consider freshly post-IPO companies too risky for a long-term investment. The IPO feeling-out period frequently leads to a topple in price that recovers some distance in the future. Consider how many people already lost 60% of value in the BOX IPO mishap already. It's difficult to assert riding out an unsure thing, when that money could be used in a more stable venture.Box obviously has value as a company, and even squirrelly IPOs can be played like a slot machine. I made 10% overnight on BOX catching the post-topple rise, but I own zero shares now because I like prettier stock charts. There is value in this company, but we must analyze the soft moat that must first be believed in before we get behind a BOX long position for large, long-term investors. We'll look at the chart in a minute, but first…Box's Value As A CompanyIt has been declared by some analysts that the company has ""no moats"", a term used to describe a deep buffer that keeps competition from devouring its customer base. However, the tech world offers increasingly smaller moats, often consisting of convoluted mini-patents, or acquisition of other start-up companies that allow one company to leapfrog beyond the competition's projected future: a time-gain only.Box's business is viable because handling massive amounts of data is cumbersome, and data security issues have been plaguing many companies. Consider Target's (NYSE:TGT) infamous holiday sales disaster that occurred immediately after a massive data breach. BOX is offering security at a time when security is being tested on deeper levels and on a massive scale.If the company offers a desirable service and access to data is truly smooth, a foothold in the market can become a moat by itself - but only as the price wars begin to churn, allowing BOX's time-based advantage to set in deeper. While a lack of un-debatable moats might keep this stock from being a Warren Buffett style long-term investment, there is no reason to immediately reject this stock on the moat principle alone.Company players with the most cash (or debt) pointed to solve the most specific (and necessary) problem can establish entrenchment with new acquisitions and internal developments. While Warren Buffett might be slapping his forehead, the world watched Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dominate search by simply possessing a slightly better search algorithm and maintaining the self-discipline to refrain from adding clutter to its web pages. While we can't call this a moat, we can understand that regarding data, the shortest route from A to B can establish brand dominance, and that is Box's goal. It is not alone, however.BOX Customers:- 45,000 business customers(Half of the Fortune 500)- 35 million registered usersGoogle Storage Customers:- Google Drive quotes 240 million users- Google for Work customers are quoted at 5 million.An interesting angle written by Thomas Claburn states that storage is almost a commodity at this point, and that selling storage might even remain a loss leader provided by companies to promote their other products. For this reason, BOX has been rebranding itself as a full information management platform.When Will Box Profit?The problem with BOX is that ""during its 2015 fiscal year it lost $167 million, with revenue of $216 million."" Yes, most are aware that the company is not running into oceans of profits. BOX watchers wonder if competitors offer too much threat. However, competitors in the future might offer more generic storage services, with less customized interfaces and less direct customer service. This means it won't be able to compete with an extremely business-tailored data service.Raw data storage is not information security, and it's not a tailored and streamlined business platform. Raw data storage is not technically innovative today - so, a hungry business that's prepared to develop new soft innovations in data management will strive in this crowded corridor.Box's Stake In The GroundJust as logistic companies handle other corporations' shipping, handling data is proving to be a desired symbiosis. Handling data in mass proportions is time intensive, and keeping data secure, manageable, and available to workers has become a viable business. Data management can happen in-house with great expenditure of a company's internal resources, or out of house, with the simple signing of a contract and handing over a brick of cash.However, until the market sees BOX's data management platform exceed the simple expectations associated with cloud storage, its stock could still face flat spells. While the roster of Fortune 500 customers made the market hungry for BOX, this year has shown that BOX hype hasn't delivered to the fickle market yet.The Future of Data""The mission at Box is to transform the way people and organizations work,"" said Levie, the driving force behind BOX. While this is a generic statement, the company knows it must move away from thinking about storage by itself and begin to understand how data wrangling translates to work design. Consciously attending to designing tools that aid in workflow is a different world than offering a random pool of cloud data.Developing information flow patterns, great data search, intuitive data management, and streamlined tools that reduce issues that come with dealing with hefty data catalogs could evaporate entire work pipelines. There is value in such achievements.The fact is, data management can take on a new dimension, and big companies are starting to bet on that truth. As IBM (NYSE:IBM) jumped on board with Box, so will others. When big companies integrate a data service, they are looking for a focused provider. Competitors like Google have hundreds of projects on their plate. Big players will likely perceive data-dedicated BOX as a better bet in the future developments of data management. Large companies know that integrating any new service has a high work cost. They don't want to try out every cloud data service. They want to make the right choice once.BOX StockBox stock has provided a bad ride for anyone unwilling to close stock trades and reopen them later. The long-term investor has seen wake after wake of long-side waves build, then collapse.When BOX IPO'd, Jim Cramer gave it a buy rating at $18. Anyone who bought over that price got scorched. As time passed, anyone who bought above $18 continued to get burned. Since Box is not basking in profits, news events move this stock in odd ways.Box charts yield the simple advice to buy long positions cautiously at $17 to $17.50 range. $17 is a low that has been hit continuously over the last half-year.Even buying long at $17 can't be ridden to oblivion. A position must be bought low, and temporarily sold on the peak waves, simply as the history of this chart details. In terms of technical analysis, $17 has become a bedrock support level - and it can be played with news events accordingly.Fundamentally, BOX stock moves every time a new large company signs up for its services, and time deteriorates this positive outcome because the market is waiting for the company to talk about when it will hit profits. Additions to the client roster is what is driving this stock, and there is no reason to fully doubt that future additions will happen. Watch for them. Be very cautious to buy long after a large surge in long-side growth.A Word Of CautionThe market is waiting for post-IPO growth for this company to take off. A roster of half the Fortune 500 is very similar to that same roster plus another 2 or 3 additional companies. The market wants to see cloud storage hit profits - until then, the market waits.The recent downfall of BOX's stock price in the second week of July shows that the company is not going to be resilient if the Dow Jones reaches a correction period. Over the next couple weeks, be careful purchasing BOX even at the robust $17 support level, because if that support is penetrated, a lower price shelf could be the final trajectory. If the Dow Jones supports itself, then BOX appears to be sustainable at $17.00 to $17.50 per share. Play at your own risk!"
3263115,48411,2015-06-16T16:43:21-04:00,BOX had yet another strong presentation - this time by way of its post Q1/16 investor call.BOX is both getting offensive and defensive with its EKM and Box Developer Edition additions.Expanding use cases and positioning itself for existing enterprise customer seat expansions is a very good thing for BOX longs.While I'm not yet ready to recommend a long position in BOX I'm much closer now than I was just 30 days ago.,"Box (NYSE:BOX) had a really strong FQ1/16 that has allowed shares to put in at least a short-term bottom. Shares had initially spiked but quickly sold off a high volume uptick into the next few days post-reporting. Still, make no mistake, the quarter was one that saw the longer-term bull case move forward. I remain a soft BOX bear based on some longer term viability concerns but even those have taken a hit in light of the last few presentations made by the company - both at conferences and the investor call that followed quarterly reporting.BOX has worked hard to both build out and promote its differentiation. The idea that it has little is the primary bullet point that every bear thesis begins with. BOX did well to establish a baseline of differentiation at Credit Suisse Disruptive Tech Conference in having its VP of Enterprise Security make a strong performance detailing the company's security and retention customization capacity. Both are powerful value-adds that apparently BOX used to add customers and to more importantly add use cases.The big announcements at FQ1/16 reporting were EKM and Box Developer Edition, both which furthered the efforts described above.I touched on EKM and what that means to BOX in detail in a previous article but what it means is primarily existing enterprise seat expansion. BOX CEO Aaron Levie detailed this on the investor call:That's huge in helping BOX be more offensive and defensive - a rare chance to leverage a technology into accomplishing both. In an effort to not reiterate a prior article that was majority written on EKM I'll leave it at that.Now, what Box Developer Edition has done is just as attractive but should be a major offensive weapon. Depending on how ""defensive"" you believe overall network effect is (I don't weight it heavily) it could be eventually considered in helping establish an additional barrier to entry as well. Again, Levie gave great color on this on the investor call:Again, huge.Levie detailed how this platform addition and use case expansion shouldn't allow the company to increase overall pricing per seat or drive much revenue as a stand-alone feature but that it should create ancillary business opportunities. He even gave an example of an enterprise win that took place strictly on the basis of having so many existing freemium users within the company. I wouldn't model Box Developer Edition in for anything meaningful just yet outside of maybe increased levels of retention (which can be and should remain well over 100% as BOX expands existing customer seat count) but this will be an interesting catalyst for upside performance in the future, albeit on a lumpy basis.In total this quarter was a good one for BOX and a bad one for bears like me. BOX remains well capitalized, it showed 19 points of leverage Y/Y, it added customers - including showing continued success moving upmarket, it expanded its platform capacity, and most important of all it continues to make way into the ""no differentiation"" argument.I'm not ready to get long BOX just yet but I'm a heck of a lot closer today than I was a month ago.I continue to recommend an avoid of BOX.Good luck everybody."
3072856,24276,2015-04-16T15:56:32-04:00,"In buying Verold, Box gets into visualizing data rather than just storing it.The company was becoming a commodity play.Box needs a buyout or a better handle on expenses to be worthwhile.","Box (NYSE:BOX), the struggling online storage company, is trying to get out of a box of its own making by buying Verold, a 3D technology company.As CEO Aaron Levie explained in a blog post, Verold has created a visualization system using the WebGL standard that lets users gain new insights into large data sets quickly. Contractors can deliver project visualizations to multiple partners and shoe designers can deliver designs to multiple production houses, he wrote.The purchase puts Box into a new part of the industry. Levie described it as ""work flow,"" but it's basically about using large data sets, rather than just storing data. While archiving was the original motivation to use Box, more active, intensive use is necessary if it's to avoid being crushed as a commodity play. Verold will eventually become part of Box's data preview offerings.From a financial point of view, of course, Box is a mess. With sales of $216 million for all of 2014, and a market cap of $2.1 billion, it's selling at roughly 10 times sales. But it is losing almost as much as it takes in, $166.6 million last year, mainly because selling, general and administrative expenses are climbing rapidly - from $211 million to $269 million while sales were growing from $124 million to $216 million.It's that growth rate that makes Box look valuable, even cheap. Analysts give it a $21 price target for next year, up from the current price of about $17.50. For a tech stock, however, that's a minor bump, and only five banks are currently following it with a mean valuation of 2.9 - a weak hold.If you're looking to buy into Box, then, you're really looking for a take-out, and Verold gives Levie a hook he can use to get a deal done. Whether he's willing to go after a deal, or even take one, is another question.Box, which is based in Austin, is more interested in opening up new enterprise markets, like government, in hopes of securing a long-term future.My own view is that this is the kind of company you would expect Yahoo (YHOO) or Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) to have snapped up a few years ago, but both have had their ambitions reined-in by financial reality. Maybe privately-held Dell could be persuaded to make a run at it now, or even Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).All that, unfortunately, is speculation. Levie for now seems focused on trying to make Box stand on its own. But that would mean getting expenses under tighter control while continuing to grow the top line. Verold will help, but probably not enough to excite the street.Until you hear a stronger rumor of a buy-out, in other words, stay out of the Box."
3230046,48411,2015-06-02T11:20:52-04:00,"BOX came out to a hot post-IPO start but has since traded down on what CEO Aaron Levie calls ""confusion"".But is it confusion or clarity by the market? Has the market defined BOX as it is currently as a commodity, like I have?I think that BOX has a few major concerns that until addressed will press on its market cap and its top-end pricing.BOX is also in uber-growth mode which will make for some lumpy reporting as guided - but how will the market react to seeing this on paper?In an attractive broader SMB/enterprise solution space I just think BOX isn't the play right now on a risk adjusted basis - avoid this until post-earnings.","If you invested in Box (NYSE:BOX) just post-IPO on the highs I wish you all the best but am I the only person who is concerned about what the shares are going to do when BOX reports at Q1?I think the market, regardless of the growth rate reported - unless it's something absurd (think 80% or an absolute ""wow"" number and it absolutely won't be a ""wow"" number reported), is going to again tank shares on reporting. Because you know that BOX didn't slow spending and in fact BOX management actually guided that they expect to increase spending for several key metrics Y/Y at accelerated rates on the Q4 investor call. BOX will likely report margin contraction, negative EPS expansion, and potentially some disruption in expected growth due to the longer sales cycles and overall sales cycle unpredictability that comes with targeting the top-end enterprise contracts that it is targeting.Yes, I get that targeting these massive deals takes a bit longer than smaller deals AND is certainly more lumpy in reporting and so does the market, but how will the market react when it sees this on paper?There are other factors that should press on BOX as well and they have nothing to do with the financials but they will be brought into the bright spotlight of the market as a result of the ""concerning financials"" that the market reacted so quickly to at last reporting. But before discussing those I should outline that I think BOX is caught in this ""misunderstood""/""negative"" momentum channel that the SMB/enterprise solution space sometimes traps newly public names in post-IPO. This, in my experience, is just how the SMB/enterprise solution space works right out of the IPO gates sometimes. ""The Market"" decides if it understands and/or loves your solution regardless of generally anything that gets reported, meaning it excuses anything reported that could be viewed as negative, or it decides it doesn't - which is appearing to be the case for BOX.What leads me to this conclusion? BOX has failed to move higher on what is definitively positive news (read: DOJ deal, EKM launch, etc.), a surefire sign that the market isn't willing to trade BOX on a ""benefit of the doubt"" basis just yet. I'm on board with this and don't think this to be unfair but based on my experience in trading the SMB/enterprise solution IPO space the last few years it could be a while before BOX gets up off the mat.So this brings us to maybe what will be considered the meat and potatoes of this article and I'm sure there's a large faction of readers who disagree with me on this but I'll take the flaming in an effort to be honest. What are my issues with BOX at this valuation?First, I don't even really like the BOX platform all that much but I'll give it that it's one of the two most convenient platforms that are in wide circulation from a use standpoint and that counts for something because the only differentiator any of these platforms have in the first place is their network size. Yeah, I get that this platform and the ""other one"" of substantially similar name have specific security measures that are different and they have other more technical features that are different but really are those the factors determining which platform the counter party at the company you're consulting uses? I didn't think so.BOX, and every other company in this direct niche - the call it file sharing/file protecting niche because ""Content Collaboration"" space is just way too much for me, are commodities that for the near-term should be considered glorified email accounts. I really think that.I mean what can I do in BOX that I can't do in an email account (potentially using a secondary service coupled with the email depending on file size) albeit at higher risk? I mean do I really need to use BOX to send that two page fact sheet on the company I'm consulting to another party in another state? Even if I do don't I have to use email, messaging, some other workflow app just to communicate (if timely) to the other party that the file has been shared/updated/changed/etc.? Is BOX the only content collabo/workflow optimization app that we all use? I just think there's a commodity factor here that everybody is trading but nobody is talking openly about just yet.The point is that if BOX closed up shop tomorrow that nothing about my life or your life changes. We still have 50 other options for file sharing (again, conceding at a higher security risk) and for file storage. We now have even more options for collaboration and workflow optimization. Also, is anybody going to argue that BOX is the only way to secure file share/storage? Again, it works back to commoditization.I'll end the article focused on this thought heading into BOX's next earnings so we can keep the comment stream hopefully focused on the commodity or not commodity argument and not on discussions of Aaron Levie's competence as a CEO, BOX's expansion plans, BOX's land and expand strategy, etc., but I will answer the ""yeah but you could use the commodity argument about all tech solutions"" rebuttal - no you can't. Other SMB/enterprise solutions that have come to market have differentiation of some sort and we could point this out in a lot of different ways but HubSpot/Marketo are differentiated and offer something unique, Zendesk is differentiated and offers something unique, Paycom/Paylocity are differentiated and offer something unique, Connecture….you get the point.If you're looking for that IPO that's going to double or more in the next 4 quarters BOX might be it. It might and maybe I'm being way too cynical and the market sentiment turns and BOX ends up shooting higher but maybe it isn't. If you're asking me there are less commoditized, more obvious (at this point) plays in the space that still have plenty of room to run. I think BOX on a risk adjusted basis just isn't the play right now.Good luck everybody."
3238686,48411,2015-06-05T09:02:40-04:00,"BOX needs to realize that it's currently not mission critical and has several fatal flaws.It then needs to make an aggressive buyout offer to Slack, which to me is its largest direct and indirect threat.Slack is already massive and growing quickly while being integrated with BOX's competitor Dropbox - this will hurt BOX if Slack is allowed to come public.Continue to avoid BOX until it can do something drastic to change its value-prop.","Box (NYSE:BOX) needs to do something drastic while it's less punitive, and while it still can. I think I have a great idea for what it should do. The only problem is 1) is it possible and 2) will the ego of CEO Aaron Levie allow it if it is? Still, I think it makes sense and BOX should consider it.I think BOX should make a run at buying Slack.Yes, I know Slack just did a round in October for $120 million with ease, impressively led by Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins, that valued the company at a whopping $1.12 billion. More recently, BOX has been valued by DST Global and Index Ventures at $2.8 billion based on a more recent raise of $160 million. But that just means BOX needs to go for broke with its offer.Why does BOX have to do anything? I tried to explain this in a recent article but to summarize - because I think BOX isn't mission critical, has zero differentiation, has zero barriers to entry, and if BOX went away my life doesn't change. There are several free alternatives that work with little discount to convenience.Now, how would Slack fix BOX?I was chatting with a friend of mine, Scott Turner from Austin, Texas - who has monetized several startups and is currently working on a competitor to HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), when the idea came up. I've asked around to several other tech fanboys and they've agreed as well.One of the big problems with BOX is the lack of communication capacity and overall lack of integrations. I still have to send a communication of some sort to alert the end user (to be most effective) that activity has taken place. Seemingly a pretty simple problem to fix, right? Maybe.But that still doesn't solve the integration issues for BOX - Slack is already integrated with BOX's competitor Dropbox (just hold SHIFT, drag, and drop) and has integrations with asana, Google Hangouts, Jira, Papertrail, pingdom, Pivotal Tracker, Sound Cloud, AppSignal, Bitbucket, bugsnag, BUILDBOX, mialchimp … need I go on?But even if BOX fixes its messaging and integration issues on its own (can it? how long would it take? at what expense?), it doesn't acquire Slack's ~30,000 active teams and 268,000 active users using its application (as of October 2014 - it should be noted Slack is growing at ~3-5% per week according to October data as well). These users, by the way, are the exact corporate/SMB/enterprise customers that BOX is looking to aggregate as well.Maybe there's some crossover there between customer bases but how much sense does it make to combine these two services and how productive a workflow app would a Slack/BOX combo be? Actually, we're kind of already seeing how productive it would be in that Slack has the Dropbox integration and it's coupled with other imperfect players from the productivity vertical of the SMB/enterprise solution arena. Is it safe to say that Slack is going to be an indirect threat to BOX when it eventually comes public? I think so. All the more reason to make an acquisition run.The big missing piece for me in the SMB/enterprise solution space (and really I'm leaning hard on the enterprise side of that) is general ""workflow"" solutions. Regardless of how you want to split that definition up, and I'm keeping it wide for reason, nobody has a great fix. (Please don't bring up asana - my least favorite of any of the quasi-players).So, assuming BOX realizes it's plagued with the problems I just detailed, is this deal possible?Well, as of the filing of its 10-K, BOX had ~$330 million in C&CE, ~$120 million in deferred revenue, and just ~$40 million in debt. Inclusive of operating leases, BOX had ~$347 million in total contractual obligations. So if you factor that into its overall leverage, many times folks don't, it has room to take on some debt. We don't know what Slack's financials look like, probably very similar to BOX's - operating at huge losses but generating healthy revenues, but my guess is that the NewCo wouldn't be that levered up. There's also the big possibility that this deal could be done in a big way with stock and warrants. I think at the valuation, BOX would have to make a bid as it isn't possible that the deal would be done in all debt.The point is that it's possible, and even highly possible. But that still leaves Aaron Levie, the CEO who came out after a bad earnings and pounded the table in defense of his company (a little early in the process, right?) instead of just sitting back down at the table and going to work. From his reaction to the negativity, I might surmise that he has a bit of an ego and a bit of defensiveness to being told his company isn't as great as he thinks it is. I could be entirely wrong, but that's my analysis of management. Would Levie be willing to see what I already see just post-BOX IPO?Listen, BOX has problems. I've recently detailed those, so I won't reiterate them again, but BOX can't fix its overwhelming problem of not being mission critical without doing something drastic. I think Slack is drastic, it's splashy, it's bold, and it just might be the difference between lower lows (the path that BOX is on now) and higher highs.I continue to recommend an avoid of BOX.Good luck everybody."
3002046,67493,2015-03-15T14:38:48-04:00,,"It's pretty interesting to follow the first earnings release/conference call for a newly-listed public company: oftentimes you will see the first published numbers for a new listing well and truly 'scrubbed up' so as to paint the best picture possible to the analyst community. Frankly, Wall Street is as much about marketing and telling a story as any other industry so it's hard to blame executives for trying to start out on the right foot.Which is why it's fairly meaningful when high-flying IPOs really bomb their first earnings report - as Box (NYSE: BOX) did on March 12. The cloud storage/SaaS name IPO'ed to much fanfare in January, selling ~12.5mm shares @ $14 each; the stock promptly roofed it to $24, and before the recent earnings report was selling at $20.5 - a cool 10x sales (forget earnings, operating margins are negative 63%).But this report really jumped off the page - for all the wrong reasons. Thing is, it's not as if the bar was particularly high: for 4Q, analysts were expecting net losses of ~$2.25 a share (GAAP) - yes, that's right, losing $2.25 per share on a $20 stock in one quarter - but Box managed to lose $2.64 a share. More worrying was the decline in billings (a non-GAAP measure that is a forward looking indicator for out-year sales) growth rate, from 46% in the first 9 months of FY14 to just 33% in 4Q (and well below sales growth rate of 61% in the quarter).This is important because when you are losing money at the prodigious pace Box is managing, you really need to see accelerating revenue and billings growth to justify the increased OPEX spend. In fact, one of my main gripes with Box - and indeed, many other JOBS Act IPOs - is that they haven't really proven themselves as viable businesses and so have no reason to go public.Thinking about it more broadly - how do you 'know' if you have a viable business or not? Well clearly, viable businesses generate profits and cash flow. But even if you can't make money today, as long as you can see a feasible path to profitability, you may still have something to work towards. What you really want to see is economies of scale and operating leverage: the more of X you sell, the cheaper it costs to produce X, and hence margins expand (often starting negative, then going very positive over time as fixed costs don't grow with revenues). This is how you justify negative operating margins when a business is small, hoping to grow the business to a point where you can enjoy the benefits of operating leverage.Now, let's go back to Box. I am not an expert on cloud storage, nor the 'software-as-a-service' industry. What I can say, though, is that Box's business, even as it has grown, is not demonstrating the kind of scalability you need to think it could be sustainably profitable. Revenue in the most recent year was $216mm - this is no longer 'de minimis' - and grew 75%, but OPEX grew 30% too. Operating margins at -77% in FY14 may look like a massive improvement from -128% in FY13, but really this business is not scaling anywhere near fast enough given the valuation. Consider that even if Box grows revenues at ~40% next year and costs grow just 10% - beyond unrealistic - the company will still be running ~-25% operating margins.Actually, analysts are more bearish than this, and project even -20% negative operating margins out to FY18, but you get the point: it is still very unclear if Box has a viable business at all. Any business that is so hyper-competitive that you have to spend 96% of your revenues on sales and marketing (as Box did in FY14), can't really be called a 'business'; 'money pit', 'forest fire', or 'black hole' may be more apt descriptions.And we are not talking about small dollar amounts, either. Box - post IPO - has ~$306mm in cash as of January 2015; according to analysts, they will lose ~$148mm in EBIT next year (of which some is stock comp so let's say ~$120mm cash burn). The company has shown themselves to be acquisitive too, and assuming that continues, Box has maybe ~1.5-2 years worth of cash (again, if we take the street's pretty rosy consensus estimates at face value). As such, current shareholders are likely to get diluted - probably more than once - in the next couple of years.In the meantime, Box shareholders also need to contend with the ugly reality that just 12.5mm (9%) out of ~144mm shares outstanding are currently in the float, and that a ton of locked up stock, most of it with strike prices of $0-$6, will hit the market in the next 6 months. Most insiders were happy to sell down at $14, with the business looking better 3 months ago… methinks they'll pull the parachute hard anywhere north of $10 now. The stock is trading at $17 in the after-market - still a crazy ~9x sales - but likely not for long…Disclosure: No position in BOX"

According to data from Renaissance Capital, 34 IPOs yielded $5.4 billion in raised capital for the quarter. The result was the slowest quarter in over two years. Nevertheless, Box Inc. (NYSE:BOX) was one of the stocks that generated returns over 100% from its IPO price. However, individual investors weren't able to purchase shares of Box at $14; they had to wait until trading began at $23. Individual investors should be rest assured that after the IPO dust has settled, there're still several great opportunities for investing in recent IPOs like Box.Box's Competitive AdvantageMy initial review of Box's IPO covered its key competitive advantage as a primary reason for investing. Just to quickly recap, Box has created a cloud-storage platform with emphasis on collaboration, sharing and security. The platform's features are focused on the business-customer market where Box offers a very competitive set of tools for the price. And, based on everything the company has done since the IPO, this focus is still very much the business-objective. A recent CNET review rates Box as best for teams of employees and companies looking to share and collaborate on projects.Box's Investment Value CaseDespite widespread pre-IPO knocks at the company's inability to generate a profit and its hefty expenses, Wall Street took Box's stock on a roller coaster ride. The company offered shares at $14 per share, above the $11-$13 price range set in the prospectus. The company began trading near $23 per share, dropping to $17 per share within two-weeks, and recovering back to $21 by end of week three. Most individual investors wanting to invest in day 1 would have had to buy in around $23. Since the IPO, the stock has retreated to $19 as of April 1st. The result is still a much more aggressive valuation than the pre-IPO target.Source: Google FinanceThe stock is already trading about 25% below its three-month high with no major change in outlook and strong 2016 guidance.Box's Growth CaseBox's biggest selling point at its IPO was the exponential growth it was able to historically post, as well as the quickly growing market it was concentrated on capturing.Source: Box S-1Growth prospects still look very promising. Since the IPO, the company announced 74% year-over-year revenue growth for fiscal year 2015. The company also announced fiscal year 2016 revenue guidance of $282-$285 million, which would represent about 32% annual growth.Other Keys to Box's FinancesDespite Box's growth, it has scaled operations nicely maintaining a very attractive gross margin. Most of Box's expenses come from sales and marketing efforts as well as other administrative costs. These expenses can easily be curbed in the future and would not be expected to grow at the same rate as revenues.Source: Box Investor RelationsAdditionally, Box got a huge influx of cash from the IPO. The cash will enable investments in technical computing and storage infrastructure and should be able to sustain the company to profitability and positive cash flows. Following that, any remaining cash represents even more growth potential whether it's through additional investments to grow organically or through acquisition.Source: Box Investor RelationsSummaryBox looked like a great investment opportunity from its original IPO filings. The opportunity quickly diminished when the rest of Wall Street also recognized the opportunity and drove-up the price for an IPO-pop. Since the January IPO, Box's stock price has stabilized. Although the investment at the current $19 per share does not look as attractive as the $11-13 per share at the IPO, the growth prospects still make $19 an attractive entry point."

        Box's debt poses a potential hazard for investors.
        Box's huge growth potential makes it an attractive purchase at this price.","Finally, the first major initial public offering (IPO) of 2015 has occurred! On January 23, 2015, Box Inc. (NYSE: BOX) raised $175 million by selling 12.5 million shares at $14 each. Box, which had initially been looking to price its IPO between $11 to $13 per share, announced on January 22, 2015 that it had sold 12.5 million shares for $175 million.While Box's IPO pricing point was higher than the original indicative range, it was lower than its valuation of $2.4 billion ($21/share) at its most recent funding round. On the day of its IPO, however, Box rose 65.93% to $23.23/share, above the valuation of its last funding round.The cloud storage company, founded in 2005 by current CEO Aaron Lee, planned on having its IPO last year, but delayed plans due to a downturn in interest. When it first filed for IPO, investors were disappointed due to Box's lack of results, which stemmed from wealthy competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). But in the last ten months, Box's revenue has surged over 70%, decreasing its losses, and improving its future growth prospects.What Does Box Do?Box provides online file sharing, along with personal cloud management services, for a variety of businesses. The company's business model is similar to options offered by Google Drive or Microsoft Skydrive, where it offers 10GB of free storage, and then charges for additional storage.The company also runs a service called OpenBox, which connects content stored on Box to a variety of popular online web based applications and services, like Autodesk, Twitter, Scribd, Google Apps, and FedEx.Box's future growth plans involve facing competition from other major companies in the field, particularly Microsoft, whose recent discounts have hurt Box's growth rates. To combat this, Box has created a variety of services on top of storage to make its offerings more attractive. Should Box manage to defeat its competitors, its growth potential in a sector estimated to grow 23% a year from 2013 to 2017 is huge.Growth estimate from market researcher International Data Corporation (Source)BOX's ValuationMajor tech company IPOs like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), whose current value is 50% of its high, to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), whose current value is nearing its all-time high, have shown us that tech IPOs and their aftermath can be a trying time.Box's current stock price of $23.23, a noticeable increase above the $14 IPO, means that investors will now have to pay more per share than Box was originally priced at. At this price, the company will have a market cap of $2.7 billion, which reflects a 10% increase over its most recent valuation round, which valued Box at $2.4 billion.Box's future stock price depends on its cash bleed. In 2011, Box lost $50 million, in 2012, $113 million, and in 2013, $169 million. Its 2014 fiscal year ends on January 31, 2015. Currently, the company has a net deficit of $361 million. (Source) The $175 million Box raised from its IPO will not cover half of that. Unless Box can turn profitable, it may have darker days ahead. However, Box's significant price rise as a result of its IPO, means that Box should be able to sell more shares in the future in order to help pay off its debt.On top of this, Box has 32 million registered users with 99% of its user base coming from Fortune 500 companies. (Source) This means, unlike other major tech companies with larger user bases, Box has a large amount of room for growth.At its current price of $23.23, despite Box's rapid rise above its IPO price, Box still represents an undervalued stock with huge future potential. As a result, I would recommend investing in Box.Comparisons (current prices based on closing price as of January 22, 2015)Looking at other major tech company IPOs, particularly those in the cloud computing market, we can try and come to a conclusion about how Box will do in the months following its IPO.Since its split-adjusted IPO at $2.75 in 2004, salesforce.com has risen over 2000% to its current price of $58.00. Salesforce.com is a global cloud computing company headquartered in California, and is best known for its CRM (customer relationship management) products.Since its 2012 IPO at $28.00/share, Workday has risen almost 300% to its closing price of $81.40 on January 22, 2015. Workday is an on-demand provider of capital and human capital management software.Since its 2007 IPO at $26.00/share, NetSuite has risen over 400% to its current price, $106.42/share. NetSuite is a California based software company that sells software used to manage both customer relationships and business's operations.As you can see above, in the months following their IPOs, all of these three cloud software companies have risen staggering amounts, offering great returns to investors. This means that even though Box has risen 66% since its IPO, it still has significant room for growth in the future.ConclusionWhile Box has major competitors and a poor balance sheet to deal with, its huge growth potential, along with results shown by other companies in the same sector, mean that despite its massive price rise during its IPO, Box offers an attractive opportunity for the value seeking investor."
2900416,55382,2015-02-09T19:10:31-05:00,"Box serves a ultra-growth market, but that's not always a good thing.Almost all of Box's competitors have deeper pockets, and more resources to finance growth.Current valuation seems to be reflecting a bright future for Box, but that is far from certain.","BOX Business ModelRecently, Box (NYSE:BOX) had its IPO, successfully raising $175M in gross proceeds. Immediately after its public debut, BOX share price jumped by roughly 70% only to eventually pull back and settle at the current price of $19.60.In this article, I take a hard look at Box's business model.In our world, it's hard to find a commodity that is in greater demand than digital storage. We spend our days taking pictures, sending emails, sharing videos, listening to music from cloud services and streaming movies and we back up our information in the cloud.Everything we do on the digital plane creates a messy trail of data that requires storage. Why would you delete a file from your computer when the cost of saving it forever is basically $0?At the organization level, enormous amounts of data are created, categorized and stored in massive data centers. Companies like Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) allow other companies to store digital information for cutthroat prices.This trend is not going to stop. In fact, it is growing at an alarming pace.Demand Will Grow For The Foreseeable FutureAccording to a study conducted by IDC (and sponsored by EMC (EMC)), five years from now the amount of digital data will be four times higher than it is today.A much more critical observation is that between 2019 and 2020 (roughly), the world will create the same amount of digital data that has been created from the dawn of history until 2015.If there is one sure trend you can follow in the foreseeable future, is the trend of digital data growth.Don't Be Blinded By 'Empty Calories' RevenuesTranslating this into business terms, it means that the demand for services like those provided by Box will be in high growth mode for the foreseeable future. This is very apparent if we look at the stellar 80% revenue growth rate Box experienced in the first nine months of 2014.Source: Box S-1 filingI don't expect Box's growth rate to slow significantly. The evidence for my argument is the chart above. In a very different comparison to other markets, the growth in digital data is in its exponential phase, at least up to 2020, and even thereafter.That said, looking at Box as an investment forces us to take a hard look at its business model and its competitors.Box is currently a money-losing business due to a simple dynamic. To acquire a customer, Box incurs significant upfront costs, but recognizes revenues over time, often resulting in negative margins during the early period of the subscription. It takes a long time for Box to start making money on a customer.Source: Box S-1 filingFor example, in its prospectus, Box analyzed its 2010 customer cohort. In 2010, Box reported it had a negative contribution from these customers as expenses were higher than the $2.8M in revenues for that year.In fiscal 2014, revenues from the same customers were $14.4M, which was higher than expenses and resulted in a positive contribution margin of 34%.Source: Box S-1 filingThis means that for the foreseeable future, as Box tries to capture a significant portion of the market growth, it will spend more money on acquiring new customers than it will get from older customers that are already generating positive cash flows.For How Long Can Box Keep Financing Its Growth?Box will have to rely on access to financing sources to finance the above spread.Judging by the first nine months of 2014, Box is burning cash at a rate of $130 M/year. This is not a sustainable model, and unlike its big tech giant competitors, Box doesn't have hundreds of millions of dollars to invest. After the recent IPO, Box cash reserves should be around $300 M. That should fund Box operations for the next 24-30 months.Source: Box S-1 filingAfter that period, Box will need to raise more funds either by debt or by a secondary offering. To maintain its market share, Box can't afford to slow down with customer acquisitions. Winning the digital storage market is a marathon, not a sprint.How Can It Compete With Google, Microsoft and Dropbox?Such a high growth rate attracts fierce competition. It happens in any market; the digital storage market is no different.Amongst Box competitors you can find Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), DropBox, Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and several other big players such as Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) and EMC. These competitors mostly have much better resources than Box (with the exception of DropBox). They can keep growing their business and burning cash for a longer period than Box.Looking at the market growth, each year Box will have to acquire more customers, and incur higher upfront expenses than the year before. Only when Box's customer base gets to a significant level might it achieve profitability, but that's not something to expect in the foreseeable future.Looking at competitors, the fierce competition is driving down prices. As of today, the norm in the industry is to offer 15GB of free storage to new customers. The norm for business users is $15/user/month for unlimited storage. Sustained pricing pressure will push forward the breakeven point for each new Box customer.Box PricingSource: box.comMicrosoft PricingSource: Microsoft.comDropBox PricingSource: Dropbox.comValuationAfter we understand Box's business model, which is likely to result in losses, secondary offerings, and reliance on debt, how does the market price this business?Box is trading with a market cap of $2.24B (as of February 9). That is around 12 times sales and 9 times the book value.Clearly, the market valuation reflect a belief that Box will win this race and achieve decent profitability in the near future.I simply don't see a path to profitability any time before 2020 (when previous cohorts will finally contribute enough to cover expenses) at least, and that path will be paved with debt and dilution, which increases the risk.That said, if Box keeps growing its customer base, which already includes 48% of the Fortune 500, it could become an interesting acquisition target for a bigger player for that sole reason.ConclusionThe cloud digital storage market is booming. Each year, the amount of data created and stored grows by around 40%, and by the end of this decade, each year will see even more data being stored.Winning this market is a marathon contest, and we are only a few yards into it. The reward for winning this marathon is having a multi-billion dollar business, but in the case of Box, the risk is very high, making it a high reward/very high risk play. Without constant financing, Box doesn't stand a chance to achieve the required size to be profitable.The business that will win this marathon and will grow into a multi-billion dollar business a few years from now will have to keep bleeding incredible amounts of cash to win new customers and expand business with existing ones. In that regard, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon all have a clear competitive advantage.In addition, growth will be accompanied by a rising CapEx budget to support the infrastructure development to allow data center expansions.To conclude, the market bets that Box will finish this marathon. My view is that it is way too early to figure that out, and the evidence mostly points in the other direction, making Box as a too risky investment for diligent investors."

2921506,76505,2015-02-17T05:28:07-05:00,"Cloud storage company Box saw its IPO climb as high as $24.73 per share on the first day of trading.CNBC stock market mogul Jim Cramer is highly optimistic about the stock, and Box's efforts to differentiate itself from other cloud storage companies is commendable.However, Box still has a long way to go in proving it has what it takes to compete as an independent firm.Since Box has no competitive advantage with big-name companies like Google and Microsoft, investors purchasing shares at these levels are taking on significant risks.","Los Altos, California-based Box (NYSE:BOX) saw its Initial Public Offering (NYSEARCA:IPO) climb to as high as $24.73 per share on the first day of trading - a 77% gain in comparison to the $14 offering price. Investor dollars are seemingly continuing to chase after nearly every new IPO out there, and the cloud storage company Box is no exception.With the IPO events in mind, you may be wondering whether or not Box is an ideal investment to add to your holdings. Jim Cramer from CNBC seems to think so. But despite Cramer's well-articulated opinion, it's probably a good idea to ""think outside the Box"" and pass on this stock for now, as Box's current share price would only be sustainable if the firm had an edge or niche in its industry. While Box is offering a slate of services that make it unique from competitors like privately-owned Dropbox, the company will struggle to make a dent with corporate customers against the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Box's Admirable Diversification EffortsBox initially delayed its IPO to take some time to clarify its mission and agenda to generate revenue. This move was a sage move by management to prove itself as being more than just another Dropbox competitor that does the same things Dropbox does. After all, the two company's names and face-value purpose are quite similar, and the two are often conflated. Overall, Box should be commended for their efforts to set themselves apart from the rest of the pack.Source: BoxThe IDC recently forecasted that Box's market for file sharing and business collaboration software will grow by a 23% average annual rate to $2.3 billion by 2018. Box is seeking to capitalize on this growing market by moving away from focusing on individual consumers and more on big businesses, as explained by Forbes' Kurt Marko:While Box's shift in emphasis and sharpened focus on corporate customers is a good move by the company's management, it is not enough to outduel the likes of Google and Microsoft, which is why the stock is a risky asset to hold at these prices.Key Indicators Pointing In Wrong DirectionBox's own filings reveal critical information about why the firm may have issues competing with other file-sharing companies:Also, Box admits in its filings that 9 out of 10 of its ""customers"" use the free version of its product, as the 10GB of data is more than enough to cover their needs. Just 1 GB of storage will hold about 15,000 Word documents and more than 300 images. As a ""freemium"" user of Dropbox myself, I can attest to the large amount of space I have to work with without paying Dropbox a single cent.Simply put, what Box provides consumers is great, but can easily be replicated by other startups, or most importantly, is already being offered by established competitors like Google and Microsoft. Microsoft's file-storage service OneDrive for Business ""offers enough storage space for roughly 200 high-definition digital movie downloads-at a lower monthly cost than Box,"" according to the Wall Street Journal.Microsoft, with its Office 365 platform, gives customers a holistic package that includes all of Office 365's programs, an email service, and content management like Box has. There's no real reason to pay Box $15 per month to do something that Microsoft can do, and much more, for even less money. Box could attempt to compete by lowering prices, but that would squeeze profit margins significantly, and I doubt Google and Microsoft would have major issues undercutting the smaller firms in cloud computing.It's worthy of note that Box's revenue growth has decreased amidst a marketplace that's heating up quickly. According to its prospectus, for the nine months ending last September, Box generated $154 million in revenues - losing about $129 million in the process. Revenue growth decreased from 81% to 70%. For a growth stock story like Box, that's not a good sign. Box is having to pay more to acquire and retain new customers.Also, cloud computing companies like Box have significant issues with translating free customers into actual paying customers. Box's infrastructure costs in running the business will grow to be unsustainable if the company cannot acquire enough paying customers, as Andres Rodriguez shows:ConclusionWhile Box has enjoyed success on Wall Street with its IPO and is making good choices to build its brand, there is no reason why customers can't achieve the same ends that Box promises than with other companies. Sorry, Cramer, but competition in the cloud computing industry is going to be fierce among smaller firms like Box, and it's tough to dislodge the industry giants. Box has little to no competitive advantage and has not proven itself to be up to the challenge yet. As an independent entity, Box is a dubious investment at best, and investors should ""think outside the Box"" IPO."

That information is not in the SEC filing but was mentioned in the retail roadshow. It was announced in May of 2014.To put the conclusions and observations in context, the following is reorganized, edited and summarized from the full S-1 referenced above.BusinessBOX provides a subscription-based cloud-based, mobile-optimized Enterprise Content Collaboration platform that enables organizations of all sizes to easily and securely manage their content and collaborate internally and externally: data cloud storage.BOX's platform combines powerful, elegant and easy-to-use functionality that is designed for users with the security, scalability and administrative controls required by IT departments.BOX has built its platform to enable users to get their work done regardless of file format, application environment, operating system, device or location.CustomersBOX's paying business customers include more than 48% of Fortune 500 companies and more than 22% of Global 2000 companies.BOX has over 32 million registered, paying users across more than 275,000 organizations. Users include employees from 99% of Fortune 500 companies, including companies in highly regulated industries such as healthcare and life sciences, telecommunications, energy and financial services.As of October 31, 2014, approximately 90% of registered users are non-paying users who have independently registered for accounts and approximately 10% of registered users are paying users who register as part of a larger enterprise or business account or by using a personal account.BOX currently has over 44,000 paying organizations.For the nine months ended October 31, 2014, revenue from non-U.S. customers represented 20% of revenue. BOX expects revenue from non-U.S. customers to increase at a higher rate than revenue from U.S. customers over time.Technology trendsThere are several fundamental technology trends that are dramatically changing both individual behavior and enterprise IT infrastructure. Information workers increasingly expect to be able to access and work with their business content from any internet-enabled device, and they demand solutions that are as simple to use as their consumer internet applications, such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.However, legacy on-premise IT architectures were not built for ease of use or mobility. As a result, IT departments are increasingly pressured to find easier to use solutions that address employees' changing work styles, while also protecting confidential content, including documents, presentations, spreadsheets and multimedia.PlatformAt its founding, BOX recognized that content is more accessible, useful and powerful when it is centrally stored, managed and shared. BOX has architected its Enterprise Content Collaboration platform from the ground up to be cloud-based and mobile-optimized to meet the evolving demands of today's information worker.Cloud-based Enterprise Content Collaboration is especially powerful because it enables users to access and collaborate on centralized content from anywhere and allows organizations to access new features and apply policies and controls across all users and content simultaneously.BOX's solution is especially well-suited to support globally distributed workers with multiple devices.The introduction of the iPad application in 2010 further accelerated enterprise adoption of the platform. In 2012, BOX introduced the Box OneCloud platform and the Box Embed framework to encourage developers and independent software vendors (ISVs) to build powerful applications that connect to Box, furthering the reach of the Box service.In recent years, BOX expanded its global presence, opening the first international office in London in 2012, followed by Paris and Tokyo in 2013.EcosystemBOX is building a rich ecosystem around Box. BOX's platform integrates with the applications of BOX's technology partners, including salesforce.com, NetSuite and others, giving BOX's users full access to Box without leaving partner applications.In addition, third-party developers can rapidly build, update and provision new applications that leverage and extend the core functionality of BOX's service, increasingly with a focus on specific industries and vertical market use cases.To date, tens of thousands of third-party developers have leveraged BOX's platform as the secure content layer for their applications, including developers that are part of its Box OneCloud ecosystem, which provides users with access to more than 1,300 iOS and Android third-party applications.Intellectual propertyBOX relies on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions to establish and protect BOX's proprietary rights in its products and services.As of October 31, 2014, BOX had seven issued U.S. patents and nine issued Great Britain patents that directly relate to BOX's technology that expire between 2028 and 2033, and BOX had 87 pending patent applications in the U.S. and 46 pending patent applications internationally.

2825556,61281,2015-01-16T03:24:11-05:00,Box is one of the leading pure-play vendors in the ECM market.Company presented impressive growth rates and expected to hit GAAP operating profit in 2018.Rival Dropbox offers a 3x higher P/S ratio with roughly similar revenues as Box.Box currently offers an excellent investment opportunity in the ECM market to benefit from the trend of growing data.,"In an earlier article covering Box's (Pending:BOX) IPO, I discussed the company's estimated IPO price based on its series F preferred stock price. Box has filed it updated S-1 last week and added a price range in its shares offered to the public. In this report, I will provide a comprehensive view on Box IPO than previously provided which will include an overview of the ECM market, Box's offering, Box's financials, a breakeven forecast and discuss its valuation and how it stands compared to biggest rival, Dropbox.Enterprise Content Management IndustryEnterprise Content Management (""ECM"") is a segment of the cloud storage market in which software vendors offer a SaaS solution to allow large enterprises to share, collaborate and sync internally among different locations, sites and business units in a simple, quick and low-cost method. The ECM industry is focused on enabling efficient sharing and collaboration of user generated data that is uploaded to a shared the environment. Access to the company's data is available online, either through websites, APIs, or dedicated folders. As ECM gains popularity among corporations, it is also made accessible to the public, who can use these services as personal cloud storage that can be selectively shared with other individuals.The economic potential of the ECM business is driven by the rise in the use of traditional electronic devices like personal computers, tablets, and smartphones and by expected growth in the use of new devices like smartwatches, wearables, and other IoT devices. The increasing number of electronic devices produces an increasing amount of data generated and stored for different purposes, from data analytics and market insights to historical backup and personal storage. In an IDC report that is frequently cited in the SaaS and big data industries, the consulting company forecasts that the amount of data in the world will increase from 130 exabytes (1 exabyte = 1 million terabytes) in 2005 to 40,000 exabytes in 2020 (as shown in the graph above, on the left). As the amount of data increases, the need for storage also increases, and cloud storage corporations should expect increased demand for their services.Most of the ECM vendors operate under a freemium business model and offer a basic plan for minimal storage for personal use and premium plans that target mainly enterprises. ECM vendors offer three types of content management solutions:In the ECM market, there are three types of players that offer the above solutions. The first group of players is tech giants that offer ECM capabilities, like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) with Drive; Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with Office 365, OneDrive, and SharePoint; Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with Zocalo; and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with iCloud. The second group of players includes large enterprise vendors, such as EMC (EMC) with Syncplicity and Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS). The third group of players includes pure-play ECM providers, such as Box and Dropbox.Box OfferingBox has a freemium business model with a basic free plan that offers 10 GB of storage that offers sync and sharing capabilities as well as integration and API capabilities and premium plans that provide either 100 GB or unlimited storage for more than three users. Premium plans offer a wide variety of EFSS, ECC and industry-specific solutions under three premium plans: Starter, Business and Enterprise. These are presented in the table below:Box FinancialsBox filed an updated S-1 with the SEC last week, pricing its IPO at a range of $11-$13, which was lower than its Series F preferred stock price of $20. The IPO price range reflected a 35% discount on the Series F preferred stock price and a market cap of $1.5B to the company; it was significantly lower than Series F's $2.4B valuation. Box updated its pricing and improved its price-to-sales ratio, from 16.5 under Series F's valuation of $2.4B to a price-to-sales ratio of 9.6 under IPO's mid-range valuation of $1.5B. According to the company's S-1, the driver behind the reduced valuation is the drop in big data stock prices that drove revenue multiples down between mid-2014 and January 2015.Box's P/S ratio of 9.6 is in between the P/S ratio of cloud storage competitors and big data players. The rationale behind this pricing method is that the current cloud storage competitors, such as Google, Microsoft and EMC, have other, more profitable sources of income that push their revenue multiples to single digits. Meanwhile, big data players have double-digit multiples that are driven by a growing acceptance rate for their products, which are currently generating relatively small revenues. This revenue ranges from Google 4.92, Microsoft 4.2, and Citrix 3.18, to Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) 17.03, Tableau 17.13, and Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) 13.02. Even though Box doesn't directly compete with the big data players mentioned, they are all growth companies based on the increase in storage usage caused by the increased usage of electrical devices. While Splunk, Tableau and Veeva allow customers to analyze the stored data, Box allows its customers to store the data that will be analyzed by these companies at a later date.As shown in Chart 1 below, Box's revenues increased at a quarterly rate of 17% from Q1'12 while operating expenses grew at a slower pace, driving the OpEx of revenue ratio down from 2.78 in Q1'12 to 1.57 in Q3'14.Even though Box has improved its OpEx to revenue ratio, the company is still struggling with operating losses. However, as presented in Chart 2 below, Box managed to keep its gross margin around 80%, reduced the operating margin loss, and decreased the OpEx to revenue ratio. This is a healthy trend towards an IPO - which many companies that went public this year didn't achieve - and highlights Box's operational improvements.Box GAAP Operating Profit in 2018As mentioned above and presented in Chart 1, Box's revenues grew at a quarterly rate of 17%, and the OpEx increased by a quarterly rate of 11%. Assuming Box's revenues, and OpEx will continue to grow; however, as competition intensifies, and technology evolves, Box will experience a slow decrease in growth rates. Assuming revenues (and cost of revenues) will erode in a conservative pace of 4% each quarter and OpEx growth will erode in a moderate pace of 2% each quarter Box is expected to achieve GAAP quarterly operating profit in Q4'17 (ending in January 31, 2018) and a GAAP annual operating profit in 2018. Box profitability trend that is presented in chart 3 below incorporates the quarterly fluctuations that revenues and OpEx experience within every year.Operating profit in 2018 assumes that increased competition will impact prices in the ECM market, reduce Box market share and will erode Box's revenues growth. Increased competition and additional technological innovation will require Box to maintain its OpEx investment rising driven by higher R&D costs and sales and marketing costs. Increase in operating profit will drive net profit higher that will drive the stock price appreciation after the company will go public. As Box is expected to face increasing competition in the ECM market, investors considering the Box IPO should get a sense of the possible Dropbox IPO, financials, and valuation compared with Box.Dropbox FinancialsAs mentioned above, Box's biggest pure-play rival in the cloud storage market is privately held company Dropbox. Dropbox also operates in a freemium model and offers three plans: basic for free with 2 GB storage, pro for $10 with 1,000 GB storage, and business for $15 with unlimited storage. Similar to Box, Dropbox offers EFSS, ECC, and industry-specific solutions. However, Dropbox has better prices and offers larger storage space than Box.As Dropbox has not filed its S-1 yet (rumors say it will happen soon) and keeps its financial figures confidential, I will use publicly known information released by Dropbox in public interviews, press releases, and company events to compare its performance to Box's.Both companies are heavily backed by VCs and have raised roughly the same amount of funds, around $500M, through equity raising. However, while Box was valuated at $2.4B at its last funding round, Dropbox was valuated at $10B, adding the latter to the list of start-ups worth more than $10B together with Xiaomi, Uber, Snapchat, Airbnb, and Flipkart. As shown in chart 4 below, Dropbox's estimated revenues (based on interview, press release, social media posts and company events announcements) grew rapidly from $3M in 2009 to $325M in 2014, while the company's P/S ratio dropped from 48 to 29. The sharp decline in P/S ratio is driven mainly by the rise in the company's valuation between series A and series C that increased from $120M in 2009 to $10B.As Dropbox's valuation is high with 29 P/S ratio, Box has a more reasonable P/S of 9.6 that may offer an investment opportunity. Even though Dropbox's valuation is steep it is perceived as a more innovative and exciting company than Box and may attract more demand for its stocks in a future IPO than Box.ConclusionBox offers ECM services under a freemium business model that generates an increasing amount of revenues with a stable 80% gross margin. Box still has high operating expenses; however, the ratio of operating expenses to revenues is decreasing along that, drives an improved operating loss margin. A conservative forecast estimates that Box will achieve GAAP operating profit in 2018 under the assumption that increased competition and new tech innovations will erode growth rates. Box IPO offers an excellent opportunity to benefit from the expected increase in the amount of data in a reasonable revenue multiple that reflects the recent pullback in the big data and SaaS stocks. Box's biggest rival is Dropbox that present higher valuation in its funding rounds but has a much greater revenue multiple that make Dropbox an expensive investment under current levels of P/S ratio. Box is a sound investment alternative to the growing ECM market that has investors waiting for Dropbox's IPO, and ignoring Box's IPO may be ignoring the better IPO of the two."
2847856,80646,2015-01-25T18:25:25-05:00,Box experienced considerable investor interest during its first day of trading.Investors are excited because of its growth potential.The stock is still a great long-term play with a great position in the market.,"Box (NYSE:BOX) shares soared on their first day of trading Friday, closing at $23.23, a 65% increase over the $14 per share IPO price - a clear signal of solid demand for a highly criticized cloud technology company.Box doesn't lead the cloud industry. It is very much the small guy in a land of tech giants such as Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) OneDrive, Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Platform and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iCloud. In fact, privately held Dropbox boasts about 300 million users, compared to 32 million for Box. As a result, this unique position in the industry allows Box to provide four very attractive value propositions.PriceBox offers more storage and services for a better price than the leading competitors. As of right now, this bargain has not converted to more users, especially of the company's free ""Personal"" plan. This trend is due to a difference in advertising efforts. Box has concentrated on groups and businesses, instead of focusing on early adopters by promoting free services like competitors have.Source: SoftwareAdviceAs a result, Box is a cloud service provider to a smaller group of paying members, resulting directly in better gross margins. First, there is less to store because there are fewer customers - a major cost savings. Second, there is a higher concentration of paying customers than non-paying customers. Therefore, Box likely has a better gross margin on the cloud business than any competitor.Having a better gross margin business is significantly important in high-growth arenas. One of Box's key criticisms is that it spent too much on sales and marketing over the past few years to make any net profit. However, as the business matures, sales and marketing costs are controllable, meaning budgets can be set and maintained. Also, given that the industry is heavily dependent on the subscription-based model, a sale today will generate revenue for months and years to come.SecurityBox offers premier enterprise-class security features, such as SSL, SSO, and state-of-the-art data-loss prevention. It offers a multitude of compliance with industry-specific laws, including HIPAA privacy regulations in healthcare. Not only does Box allow very granular permissions for enterprises, it also provides a large suite of tools to track, report and manage file sharing/utilization that parallels some of the best enterprise network products on the market.Security is essential to cloud computing going forward. As cyber crime continues to have substantial negative impacts to businesses, valuable, reliable security platforms will be not only highly desired, but required. This emphasis on security also points toward positioning the product toward paying customers (businesses). Individual free users would never justify paying for added security measures, but paying businesses will.Sharing And CollaborationBox is at the forefront of cloud sharing and collaboration, only rivaled by a few products from Google, Microsoft and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Imagine instant collaboration, version control and recovery, invitation-only project workspaces, the elimination of needing FTP, a single tool to sync everyone regardless of organization and complete compatibility across operating systems. Microsoft Windows OS and SharePoint server software can't even say they effectively achieve this level of collaboration. Some argue Box's enterprise tools are more cumbersome than the intuitive tools offered by Google Drive and Dropbox, but the naysayers fail to recognize the complexity of business situations Box can service.GrowthThe first three value propositions all revolved around having a very attractive product in the market, which is critical in the competitive technology arena. If what you are selling doesn't create value for consumers, then you will never create value for shareholders. The final value proposition is Box's tremendous potential for growth.Businesses are usually slower to adopt new technologies than individual consumers; therefore, it's not surprising to see the market for individuals to have advanced further along the cloud adoption curve than businesses. However, Box is now poised to recognize the benefits of accelerating business-based adoption. This is in contrast to Apple, Google and Dropbox, who will have to figure out how to better monetize individual cloud computing.Box's current situation closely mirrors another tech company's story. A company that was overshadowed by existing tech giants, but those giants had focused on individuals much more than the businesses. A company that was not making money at the time of its IPO. A company that was criticized for spending too much on sales and marketing versus the segment's stander. A company that saw business adoption follow well behind individual adoption. A company that attracted huge investor interest post-IPO. A company that experienced tremendous growth over the past four years - LinkedIn (LNKD).LinkedIn Income Statement Trends:Source: Google FinanceSince 2010, LinkedIn has grown revenue from $243 million to $1.5 billion, a compound average growth rate of 109%, after capitalizing on businesses and individuals adopting social media for professional interactions and offering a product highly concentrated on doing just that.Finally, a quick comparison in market cap between the two companies: LinkedIn $29 billion, Box: $2.7 billion. If Box can even experience a fraction of the adoption and utilization LinkedIn experienced after going public, this should indicate very strong upside potential for the business."

In particular, the business model of Box. They’re spending so much, Alex says. I like Google Drive better, Ron says. File sharing is a commodity, Jon says.They’re all right, on some level.But while opinions are somewhat subjective, math is math, and the physics of software as a service (SaaS) and recurring revenue are highly predictable. And there’s one thing we now know after Box’s recent SEC filings on its run up to an IPO: Box will be at a billion dollars in revenue before we know it. In fact, probably right around 2019.And this has absolutely nothing to do with what you or I think of Box as a product, or even what you think about the market per se.Here’s what Box’s revenue run rate is today, and will it look like over the next 5 years, based on current and projected growth rates (Box hit a $228,000,000 run rate in Q3):From Box’s SEC filings, we can predict the future pretty reliably. Even if growth dramatically declines, Box will still hit a $1,000,000,000 revenue run rate by 2019. Box’s growth rate declined a bit in Q3 ‘14, but it’s still growing at an epic rate — 70 percent year-over-year in 2014.You can love Box, hate it, or maybe never even use it but still have an opinion. It’s fun water-cooler talk. But SaaS and recurring revenue is highly predictable once you hit scale. Box will hit a $1 billion run rate around 2019, plus or minus.You can bank on that.Disclosure: None"
2750275,73565,2014-12-11T18:36:21-05:00,,"This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders.Box (NYSE:BOX) is a 1000+ person company providing collaboration and document sharing software. We had previously analyzed the business when the company filed their first S-1. Yesterday, the company filed an updated version of their S-1. In the past two quarters, some of the key financial characteristics trajectory have improved materially.In the next seven or so charts, we’ll explore how the Box business has evolved. We will explore revenue growth, average revenue per customer, sales efficiency, payback periods, net income, gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots, I’ve used New Relic’s (NYSE:NEWR) colors as a consistent legend. Box company data is powder blue, median values are black, and other company values are gray.While the company took a little longer to hit its stride than most, Box is growing revenues incredibly quickly. In the last months, the company will have grown more than 111%, and astounding figure for company generating more than $120M in revenue. The median publicly traded SaaS company achieves those growth rates at $13M in revenue and is unable to sustain them past $35M in trailing twelve months revenue.This extraordinary growth is readily apparent in this chart. In year six, Box was relatively close to the median for total revenue. In the last 12 to 18 months, the company has clearly pulled away and demonstrated exceptional revenue growth.File sharing products are viral. When one user adopts Box to share files, eventually many other users within a company will want to share files similarly to collaborate. This behavior engenders best-in-class account revenue expansion. Box reported greater than 30% annual account growth for each of the previous three years. To compare, I’ve plotted New Relic’s account growth by year. Box been able to sustain greater than 30% negative net churn figure, while New Relic’s has been declining each year at about 9%. In short, this behavior is a massive and incredibly valuable engine of revenue growth for the business.Box took six years to reach $50M in revenue and is among great company including Hubspot (NYSE:HUBS), Demandware (NYSE:DWRE), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). But, as we saw in the previous charts, Box’s initial ramp was slower, followed by meteoric revenue growth.To achieve this growth, Box has invested a huge amount of capital. In fact, the business has outspent almost every other company to achieve its revenue. However, in the last year, the business has reduced its investment and decreased its burn rate. When the company filed its first S-1, it reported net income as a percent of revenue at -191%. This figure has dropped by 30% to -136% in the last year, to about $168M.To achieve this cost reduction, Box reduced its investment in sales and marketing by 19%, from 169% of revenue to about 138% of revenue. At this pace, the company is still far above the norm. The tradeoff is that the company is also growing at 10x the rate of the median.As a result of a decrease in sales and marketing investment, Box’s sales efficiency, a measure of how much revenue a dollar in sales and marketing yields, has doubled from 0.27 to 0.54, which is about 36% less than the median. This is a good sign for the business, especially when considering the average account expansion pattern noted above.In addition to relative sales and marketing expense reductions, the business reduced its investment in engineering, as a percentage of revenue from 50%+ to 37% in the last twelve months. While this figure is substantially above companies of a similar age, it’s consistent with companies in their fifth year, who on average are growing as quickly as Box.Box’s gross margins are 10 percentage points better than the median, at 79% and continue to rise as the company grows. Higher gross margins enable the company to invest more in customer acquisition and point to a business with increasing efficiencies.The average customer pays Box about $5,000 per year. Given the number of free accounts, this measure is likely a bit misleading. The largest customer has more than 95,000 seats and is likely worth more than $1M, but unfortunately, we don’t have a distribution of customer account size or other proxy to get a better sense.Overall, Box has dramatically changed its investment strategy in sales & marketing and engineering investment, likely through a decrease in hiring, to reveal a very special business underneath. The company has best-in-class negative net churn, improving sales efficiency and exceptional revenue growth. Some may still point to much higher than median losses, but this objection will likely disappear with time. The company is proving it can cut costs by 30%, improve efficiency by 50% and still grow revenue 111% annually."
2823276,64283,2015-01-16T10:43:09-05:00,"Box is an online file sharing and personal cloud content management service for businesses.If that sounds similar to Dropbox, you are right.I make the case that Box's competitive strength emanates from its niche market, and its ability to provide more than just storage space.The higher end of the IPO range ($11-$13) sounds like a fair deal worth a lot more if you believe in Box's future.","OverviewBox (NYSE:BOX) offers cloud storage and file sharing services that help clients securely share and access files online and across devices, thereby enabling customers to securely store, share and manage files. This can help firms simplify paper-based office processes and enable them to secure confidential information.Important IPO informationAccording to the new SEC form S-1 filling;Twitter, Box IPOTake the Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) IPO for example. The company had not made any money and some people where skeptical of the $26/share IPO pricing. But on November 7, 2013, a day after Twitter had gone public, the opening trade was at $45.10 per share, and it closed its first day up almost 73% from the offer price.The misconception that Twitter is just another social networking site made people underestimate its potential for growth. They overlooked its uniqueness. Twitter's originality has nothing to do with social networks where people connect mostly to friends and friends of friends. Twitter is a real-time information alert where people connect due to shared interests with people who have something to say. Once you understand the distinction, you start to understand the essence of Twitter and its growth potential.The same goes for Box. The company has not made money and it is not expecting to make money in the foreseeable future. Most of its expenses have gone toward attracting new clients - an initiative meant to grow revenues in the future. But Box is not just another storage site like Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud Drive, Microsoft's OneDrive and Amazon's Cloud Drive - it's more than that.Box is a platform that allows employers to control who can access what information and monitor who accessed it while ensuring that the information is secure. It reduces the costs associated with paper-based office processes and allows collaboration within an organization. In addition, as long as the usability of applications such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), LinkedIn (LNKD) and Twitter remain popular, people's bias toward work applications that are similarly accessible, intuitive, social and collaborative - like the Box platform - will always be high.Box is focused on the enterprise market. Why is this important?Storage might become free or very cheap in the near future due to the size and capabilities of the industrial players. Companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) can subsidize the cost of storage for their consumers because the value of keeping them locked into their ecosystems is much greater.This is where Box's niche market becomes relevant. Firms are not just looking for storage space. They need their data to be secure and to be easily accessed by employees on whatever devices the employees are using. And they need to control who can access what information and who cannot. By focusing on the enterprise market, Box is able to cater to these firm-specific needs and become an integral part of a firm's growth and cost-saving strategies. Box is able to do that by selling the security, the platform value, the collaboration and the integration into the firm (via the WSJ; subscription required at link):Box is positioned as a solution to firms' problems and not just another expense. Therefore, even if the individual cloud storage business becomes over-saturated and the prices for storage drop considerably, the enterprise market will not because firms are looking for more than just storage. Box's penetration into the enterprise market offers it great upside potential moving forward. Being focused allows it to be truly good at what they do.Is $11-$13 Per Share Reasonable?Box is focused on a niche market - the enterprise market. It has gone beyond just providing storage space to providing security, data management and data control. Box's vision is to help propel the visions of its clients forward by offering solutions to data-related problems. It has barely scratched the surface in its niche market, which gives the company more room for growth and development. So is $11-$13 per share reasonable? It is. But it is worth a lot more if you believe in its future.RisksSource: Market RealistAccording to the company's S-1 fillings, Box explains why it spends more on sales and marketing than it makes.Therefore, Box expects expenses per customer to reduce over time. With the assumption that Box might continue with a higher retention rate, revenues per customer should increase over time (retention expenses are lower).So what factors matter in evaluating the Box IPO?In late 2012, Ernst and Young surveyed 312 institutional investors around the world focusing on their most important IPO factors. This is what they found:Source: Pinelli, Maria, ""Right team, right story,"" EY research document.Reputation of the banking syndicate. Box's lead underwriters are Credit Suisse Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC. The other underwriters are BMO Capital Markets Corp., Canaccord Genuity Inc., Pacific Crest Securities, Raymond James and Associates, Inc., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Goodwin Procter LLP. Looking at the team of experts Box has handling their IPO, their reputation precedes them.Confidence in management. Other than CEO Aaron Levie and CFO Dylan Smith, the other members of the executive management team have worked previously in firms such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Google, Yahoo (YHOO) and so on. But most importantly, they are visionaries. The team members have either been part of startups before or have headed new projects at big corporations. This entrepreneurial background makes them suitable to take Box to the next stage.Customer base. As of October 31, 2014, according to SEC S-1 filing (p.2), Box had over 32 million registered users and supported over 275,000 organizations that collectively interact with their content on average over four billion times every three months. Box's customers include over 44,000 paying organizations globally, and its largest deployment to date is over 97,000 users. Meaning not all users are paying users. This implies Box can increase revenues by converting non-paying clients to paying clients at lower costs since they are already familiar with Box's platform. In addition, Box's customer base includes leading organizations across industries, including Ameriprise Financial, Inc., Bechtel, Eli Lilly and Company, Gap, Inc., Schneider Electric, Sunbelt Rentals and Viacom. There is still a lot of room for growth in both well-known brands and small firms.Performance consistency. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2011, January 31, 2013 and 2014, Box's revenue was $21.1 million, $58.8 million and $124.2 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 179% and 111%. For the nine months ended October 31, 2013 and 2014, their revenue was $85.4 million and $153.8 million, respectively, representing period-over-period growth of 80%.Industry attractiveness. Gartner, Inc. (a leading information technology research and advisory company) expects total cloud spending to increase from $130 billion worldwide in 2013 to $243 billion in 2017.These factors represents a fast growing industry. Furthermore, based on the growing need to back-up work in the cloud and the 29% of people who use multiple devices at work, the need for their content to be available in the cloud, and accessible on multiple devices will keep growing."
2717655,61281,2014-11-28T12:56:54-05:00,"The leading cloud storage company, Box, filed for an IPO and offered a first glance into the financials of a cloud storage company.
        Box increases revenues at a quarterly rate of 18% and reduces OpEx to a revenue ratio every quarter.
        Based on the series F share price, the Box IPO might reflect a market cap of $2.4B to the company with a high 16.5 P/S ratio.
        In the quarters following the IPO, investors will look for a high growth rate to support the high valuation. Disappointing results may drive a sharp decline in stock price.","The enterprise file storage and synchronization provider Box (Pending:BOX) filed for an IPO a few months ago in an attempt to go public towards the end of 2014 or the beginning of 2015. Box is a cloud-based file sharing and content management services provider which enables organizations to share content internally and externally through its online platform or mobile apps. Box is one of the leading players in the cloud storage and collaboration market; however, it faces severe competition from Dropbox, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Drive, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) OneDrive, and Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS).Similar to many SaaS companies, Box has a large number of strategic partnerships with other cloud services providers to enable its customers to increase their added-value from using Box by quickly integrating it into their existing systems and meeting their unique needs. Box partners with industry leaders from different cloud services segments, such as Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Symantec (SYMC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and many others.Even though Box was founded nine years ago, the company maintains its rapid pace of growth and revenues have increased every quarter at a rate of 18%. In addition to the quarterly revenues, Box's operational expenses are also rapidly increasing. As for many other growing SaaS companies, the high revenue growth rate goes hand in a hand with high operating expenses, and the company had an operating expenses to revenue ratio of 1.6 in Q1'14. As shown in chart 1 below, Box's operating expenses to revenue ratio dropped each quarter from 2.8 in Q1'12 to 1.6 in Q1'14, as mentioned above.The drop in OpEx to revenue ratio was driven mainly by a drop in sales and marketing expenses out of the total revenues. Box improved its sales and marketing expenses by 40% between Q1'12 and Q1'14. In Q1'12, Box spent $18M on sales and marketing, 179% of the company's revenues that quarter, and in Q1'14, Box spent $47M on sales and marketing, which accounted for only 107% of the company's revenues.The quarter-over-quarter improvement in the sales and marketing to revenue and OpEx to revenue ratios drives a slow margins increase. As shown in chart 2 below, Box's operating margin improved from -202% in Q1'12 to -83%. While these figures are far from the positive turf, the increase rate is impressive and together with the OpEx improvement and revenue growth signal a slow financial recovery.IPO Price EstimationBox has not yet disclosed it IPO price, but investors can estimate the price range based on the previous funding series prices. Box had nine funding series and additional engagements with private investors in which the company raised a total of $560M. As shown in chart 3 below, Box share price increased sharply from $0.29 in series A that took place in 2006 up to $20 in series F that took place earlier this year.In the latest funding round (series F) Box sold 7,500,000 shares for $20 per share which reflects a market cap of $2.4B for the company with a high P/S ratio of 16.5. Other competitors that are traded in the US have lower P/S ratios such as Citrix with 3.43, Google with 5.4 and Microsoft with 4.28 make Box's valuation a bit high. A reasonable range for the Box IPO price would be between $23 -/+ 5% which indicates a 15% return for investors in series F and $26 -/+ 5% which reflects a P/S of 21, reasonable for an emerging growth company like Box.ConclusionsIn the recent years, more individuals and companies prefer to use cloud-based storage to store, manage and synchronize their files in order to reduce storage costs and increase organization efficiency. Box is one of the earliest players to enter the market of cloud storage and currently has more than 27M active users worldwide that generate more than $100M in annual revenues. Box increases revenues rapidly in a quarterly rate of 18% and as most SaaS vendors also have large operating expenses. However, the ratio of operating expenses out-revenue declines each quarter together with an impressive operating margin improvement. In light of the rapid growth rate, a valuation near the bottom end of the price range mentioned above that would keep Box market cap below $3B, might be an attractive investment opportunity. Once Box becomes a public company, it should continue to strive for higher revenues and better margin to make an investment in it worthwhile; otherwise, the company's stock price will dive quickly."
2148653,64343,2014-04-17T19:20:58-04:00,"Most investors don't understand the subscription-based, recurring revenue business model of software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies.Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is a key metric for subscription businesses and a critical indicator of a company's health, but accounting rules don't recognize it.Box CEO Aaron Levie has built a growing, profitable SaaS company. He's a true genius - and this article explains why.","When Box (NYSE:BOX) filed its long-awaited paperwork to become a public company, it caused a lot of talk about the financial health of the company, and the long-term viability of its business model.At issue was how much money Box is spending compared to its revenue, particularly on sales and marketing. People began wondering: is founder and CEO Aaron Levie a quack or a modern-day genius?Let me be clear: he's a genius, and he's not the only one.I've known Levie for six years, ever since Box became an early customer of my company, Zuora, and his company's revenues were in the low single digits. I've watched with great pleasure as Levie, co-founder Dylan Smith and the team have grown Box into the force that it is today. He is the latest in a line of true entrepreneurs, laser-focused on making his vision of collaboration a reality. With over 34,000 paying companies across the globe including Bechtel, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), and Gap (NYSE:GPS), it's obvious that companies see the value of Box and trust it to power their businesses.But it's crazy to me that 10 years after the IPO of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) as the first public software-as-a-service (SaaS) company, Wall Street still doesn't understand the subscription business model. The software industry has been on an inevitable path to subscriptions since 1999, when Salesforce was founded.Fast forward to today with Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Box, Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) and others. These companies have proven that a subscription model with recurring revenue is a different kind of business. It's complex. Yet, when managed well, it's a healthy and financially attractive model that has disrupted some of the most established industries across the globe.Even giant software vendors like SAP (NYSE:SAP) are now offering major products via subscription. And I assure you this is just the beginning.Why then, is there such controversy about Box? Forbes writer Kurt Marko recently questioned whether Box is a ""viable standalone business,"" pointing to the fact that operating expenses outweigh revenue and calling it ""the beginning of the end."" Erik Sherman with CBS News claimed that Box ""badly needs the money"" and that ""an IPO is necessary to bring in the capital needed for long-term viability.""It's become apparent to me that there is a fundamental lack of understanding about the subscription business model, a term I call the ""Subscription Economy.""In order to understand the true genius of Box, let's look at the four big differences between the subscription model and a traditional software business.1. Subscription businesses care about a different revenue metric: ARRThe first thing to know is that for a subscription business, revenue is not revenue. It's the difference between a one-time payment and recurring payments.Just think about it - let's say you have two friends: Jack says he'll give you $10 just this once, and Jill says she'll give you $5 a year for each of the next 10 years. There is a big difference between the two - you know that Jill's deal is a better deal.That's why smart subscription businesses look at something called ARR, which stands for Annual Recurring Revenue, and consists of only the subscription revenue from customers for an ongoing service. To get at ARR, subscription businesses take the value of their subscription contracts, normalize it to an annual amount, and add it all up. For a subscription business, more so than cash or revenue, ARR is the true indicator of your company's health.But here's the thing: accounting rules today don't recognize ARR.In fact, accounting systems do not differentiate between a dollar that recurs and a dollar that does not. Accounting systems today are built on the double entry standard created 500 years ago by Luca Pacioli to help Venetian merchants track the sale of spices. And in that system, a dollar is a dollar is a dollar.Fortunately, there's a simple way to approximate ARR from a standard income statement - just take the quarterly revenue, strip out non-recurring revenue such as setup fees or consulting fees, and multiply it by four.That will give you a close estimate as to what the ARR was at the start of that quarter. (The sophisticated reader here will note that this doesn't tell you what ARR is at the end of the quarter, and it doesn't include revenue contributed from in-quarter bookings … but we'll leave that for another time).In Workday's most recent filings, for example, the company reported $141 million in quarterly revenue, of which $110.7 million was subscription revenue. By taking the subscription revenue and multiplying it by four, you can see that Workday likely started out that quarter with about $443 million in ARR.We've performed the same calculations for Workday, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), NetSuite (NYSE:N) and Salesforce.com, below.Now how about Box? Unfortunately, Box doesn't actually break down how much of its revenue comes from subscription versus that which comes from professional services. We do know that professional services is less than 10% of the total revenue, otherwise it would need to present that separately from subscription revenue.We'll make an educated guess that Box's consulting revenue is in-line with Salesforce.com's and plug in 5%. Based on that, we see that Box started its most recent quarter at $148 million ARR, double what they were at one year ago. That's pretty good growth.(**) Our guess2. Well what do you know, it turns out cloud storage is not that expensiveOne common refrain I've heard from people is that Box's costs must be high, since they are storing all those files and have to purchase so many disks. And they must be losing money because they give so much of storage per user.A look at Box's gross margins shows a different tale.But first, let's do a quick Accounting 101 for the non-CPAs out there. In a SaaS company, there are really just three sources of costs: people, data center, and marketing. In the income statement, the part of Box's S-1 filing causing the most comments, these costs are allocated into four key buckets:Take a look at what Box says goes into its costs of revenue:Now, most folks will take these cost buckets and map that to revenue to get a margin. Revenue minus costs of revenue, for example, is your gross margin. We're going to do something different and compare these costs to ARR.Why ARR? Think about it - the great thing about ARR is that it's a forward-looking metric - ARR very closely approximates what you expect to make this upcoming quarter, compared to revenue which tells you what you already made last quarter.If you are Levie and Smith, and you know what your ARR is at the start of the quarter, you can make some smart decisions on how you want to spend that money. Comparing expenses to ARR better approximates how the executives in the company actually think and run their businesses.To do this accurately, you have to take out the cost of goods sold that are tied to the professional services, and you have to take out the stock option expenses that are reported in the filings. That's why we call this a Gross Recurring Margin, vs. just a Gross Margin.Here are the numbers we calculated:As you can see, Box's gross margins are in line with others in the SaaS industry. It actually doesn't cost that much to offer storage in the cloud.3. Recurring Revenue Margin: The Real StoryAt the heart of financial accounting is the concept of matching. When $1 is shown on the income statement, it shows the amount of cost of goods sold, sales and marketing, R&D and G&A (general and administrative) that went into making that one dollar.Unfortunately, the whole concept of matching starts to break down for subscription business models. That's because ARR represents revenue acquired in previous periods, which are simply now renewing. Sure, you need to service the customer, so cost of goods and G&A is to service the customer and does match to the ARR.How about R&D? Well, the traditional view says the products you are selling today are already done, and you are investing in research to create innovations that drive future sales. But here's the thing -- the customers of SaaS companies did not sign up for a static service that never gets better. If you know something about SaaS companies, they are obsessed about keeping their customers happy, to keep them buying the service, and they invest in R&D against that goal.At Salesforce, we started naming releases with the seasons, for example the ""Winter 2013 release,"" to convey the constant rate we expected to add enhancements to the products. That's why I like to think of R&D as being matched to ARR.Sales and marketing is where it gets interesting. If your ARR represents today's revenue that you expect to recur, then your spend on sales & marketing is going towards growing ARR, to acquiring future revenue that is not yet in ARR. In other words, today's sales and marketing expenses are matched to future revenue.(In accounting lingo, sales and marketing acts more like a ""capital expenditure,"" or capex for short. In the old manufacturing world, you invested in a big factory to build a bunch of widgets, and you spread the cost of that factory out over time as you made and sold those widgets over time. That would be depreciation of course. In the subscription economy, you invest in sales & marketing to acquire customers, and you recognize revenue from those customers over their lifetime, which often can be 3, 5, 10 years or more. However, accounting rules today do not let you spread or depreciate sales and marketing costs over time.)That's why we like to look at something we call Recurring Revenue Margin, which is your ARR minus your cost of sales, research and development, and G&A, but before the spend on sales and marketing.* Quarterly numbers annualizedWhen you look at Box's business from a recurring revenue margin viewpoint, you see they are running a profitable business. If Box stopped all sales and marketing today, it wouldn't grow any more, but it would have an intrinsic 20% margin business. Now, Box isn't as profitable as Salesforce or Netsuite, yet, but when you look at Box's recurring revenue margin over the last four quarters (below), the trend isn't bad.You can see that Box and Workday are spending in research & development. Why is R&D spending so high? I would speculate that this is Levie betting on the future -- Levie likely believes he has a big market that is growing fast, and he needs to invest in R&D with more features to outpace Dropbox or Microsoft's SharePoint product.4. The Genius of Going for GrowthSo what have we established so far? Subscription businesses really care about recurring revenue, which is measured by ARR. On an ARR basis, Box is a fast-growing SaaS company today. On a gross margin basis, it doesn't cost Box too much to offer storage in the cloud, and on a recurring revenue margin basis, Box is building an inherently profitable business.The last thing to look at is where all the controversy lies. On his blog, Tomasz Tunguz notes that:Let's take that again. Box is spending more money on sales and marketing than it has revenues, 3 times more than its peer group, and over 50% more than the #2 spendthrift on the list. I see the Box billboard every day when I drive down Highway 101. So what is Levie getting for all that money? Let's take a look.In the quarter ending Oct. 31, 2013, Box spent $46 million in sales and marketing to grow ARR by $20 million, net of churn. That means he spent over $2 to acquire $1 of growth. Compared to other public SaaS companies, that's on the high side, although if Box expects that $1 to recur for the next 5 or 10 years, that's still a pretty good deal.Has Levie built a house of cards, one that requires more and more money to fuel, but that ultimately will fall apart when the music stops?I don't think so. I see a person who, by the age of 28, has convinced some pretty big names in the investment community to give him over $400 million dollars to go after a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.That's pretty amazing in and of itself. But that's not all. Levie then built a business with strong fundamentals that is intrinsically profitable, if looked at in the right way.Finally, by recognizing that he's in a land grab in a fast growing market with multiple players, Levie is showing he has the courage to bet big and spend big to acquire as many customers as he can.What if one day Levie decides that he's won, that he sees the market for cloud collaboration slowing, and he's the clear market share leader? At that point, if he cuts R&D back down to 15%, and sales and marketing down to 15%, he'll have a 25% margin business. If he's a $1 billion company at that point, that means he can throw off $250 million in cash.If he can grow that into a $10 billion company, he's throwing off $2.5 billion in cash. That's a great business. And that's the genius of Aaron Levie.This post originally appeared on Business Insider and at Zuora.

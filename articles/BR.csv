4356294,102170,2020-06-30T01:46:11-04:00,"Broadridge has outlined and executed on its growth and margin expansion plans.It has the opportunity to improve its earnings due to macro tailwinds and operational leverage, which makes it a favorable company.Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, Broadridge continues to hit its goals.","Broadridge (BR) has provided expectations for near-term goals but has experienced hiccups given the impact of COVID-19 on certain lines of business. BR has not returned to pre-COVID levels due to investors' concerns of meeting expectations. This has been exasperated by management's cadence in the latest earnings conference call. Historically, management has been a good steward of capital and has expanding operating margins. There may be upside if the near-term headwinds abate and if management provides an improved tone during the next earnings presentation. Broadridge does provide steady performance with a decent capital return to shareholders. There may be some near-term turbulence, but this is balanced by macro tailwinds, capital returns and margin expansion.Broadridge provides products and services aimed for investor relations and back office operations for the financial industry. The company has two operating segments: Investor Communications and Global Technology & Operations.Investor CommunicationsGlobal Technology and OperationsFrom a high-level view, BR's revenue was largely flat between FY18 and FY19 and may be considered unremarkable after having strong growth of 4.5% and 43% in FY 18 and FY17, respectively. While it may appear that growth stalled recently (it sort of did), the previous years were supported by acquisitions. If we peel back the revenue growth in FY19, we can see positive trends that include solid recurring revenue growth in both segments which carry wider margins. Recurring revenue growth outpaced declining growth in other business lines within the Investor Communications Solutions (ICS) segment.Both total revenue and recurring fee revenue are expected to grow 3-6% and 8-10%, respectively, in FY21. These ranges were originally outlined last year in the 4Q19 earnings presentation and remained unchanged, but management provided cadence in the Raymond James presentation where performance may end up in the guidance range provided. Now, total revenue is expected to be at the lower end of the range, as BR is unfavorably impacted by lower event-driven revenues due to lower proxy and equity contests. Fund companies do what they can to put off these events during high-stress periods due to uncertainty in the reception a change may bring. This is important because even though the company was impacted by COVID-19, revenue remains relatively stable due to the importance of its services with its customers. On a long-term basis, BR should be able to ride the tailwinds of mutualization, digitization, and data & analytics trends. Broadridge sees opportunity in digitization and data & analytic needs with the Governance business. Regulatory documentation and communications will largely shift to digital from paper-based. Long-term growth is further supported by recent acquisitions RPM (wealth management), Rockall (back-office), Shadow and ClearStructure. The Investor Communications segment is expected to have a steady low-single digit growth, whereas Global Technology and Operations (GTO) is expected to have mid-teens growth.Broadridge has strong expectations for margin expansion and laid out its plans in the March 2018 Investor Presentation for Adjusted Operating Income margin expansion of ~50bps/year.Not only did the company hit that goal in FY19, it doubled it from 13.8% to 15%. Operating income improved due to integrating recent acquisitions and an increase in higher-margin recurring revenue.Source: 4Q19 Earnings PresentationI mentioned the updated guidance earlier from the 3Q20 earnings presentation, and the table is below.Both GAAP OPM and Adjusted OPM remained unchanged. BR has been aiming for these targets and shows management is capable of managing the business to hit these goals even in the current environment. The pain comes from a double whammy - lowering guidance of both diluted EPS and adjusted EPS growth due to lower event-driven revenue.There may be near-term pain for EPS expansion, as there could be potential client onboarding delays, impact of lower assets under administration and interest rates on mutual fund processing and transfer agent business. These headwinds are mitigated by a strong $330 million backlog, strong GTO growth potential and a 97% client revenue retention rate.The third quarter had its ups and downs when compared to the linked prior-year quarter.Source: 3Q20 Earnings PresentationOverall, revenue growth was positive and supported by recurring fee revenues, but event-driven revenues was down 43%. Operating margin declined 100bps due to the negative impact of unfavorable revenue mix (lower event-driven) and higher acquisition expenses.It is important to mention the liquidity and resilience of the balance sheet. During times of peril, BR can fall back on its balance sheet. Liquidity is solid and consists of $402 million in cash and borrowing capacity of $1.5 billion. Additionally, the company is solidly investment grade. This strength should provide comfort for current and potential investors.Source: 3Q20 Earnings PresentationThere is no other publicly traded company similar to Broadridge. Of course, there are companies that offer some of the competitive services, including State Street (STT) and Bank of Mellon NY (BK). Furthermore, there are mom-and-pop shops that handle Investor Relations activities for their customers, but those are largely regional in nature. There are some other competitors - Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), SS&C Technologies Holdings (SSNC) and MaketAxess Holdings (MKTX) - that somewhat compete with Broadridge. No other company provides the full 360 degree-style products and services like Broadridge, which presents a unique advantage. Some of the competitors will be outlined in the valuation section.Data by YChartsBroadridge has had its ups and downs in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, the forward P/E is largely within historical range, albeit at the lower end. This might be reasonable given the downward modification in total revenue and EPS expectations. Similarly, the stock price is lower than the 2019 trading range for the same reasons. Given the strength in its recurring revenues and GTO segment, and the long-term tailwinds, this may be a buying opportunity. If event-driven revenue perks up, this may provide a near-term pop in the stock price.First of all, I would like to apologize for the huge table. The metrics enclosed are important for analyzing and investment. On a high-level analysis, BR is largely overvalued compared to its peers when comparing on a forward P/E basis. However, when the EV/EBITDA metric is used for comparison, BR looks to be fairly valued. Its forward revenue and EBITDA growth rate are on the low-end when compared to its peers. This appears reasonable given the lower revenue expectations in the current environment.There may be some near-term headwinds, but thus far, the company has been resilient. I believe there is pent-up demand within the financial markets to make some moves that could be a near-term pop for Broadridge. That is without regard to the long-term trends the company is striving to capture.Based on 3% year-over-growth rate and 130bps EBITDA margin improvement over the next five years, I come up with a stock price of $131 per share. This is about 5% higher than the current stock price. The 3% growth rate is slightly higher than expectations, but the EBITDA growth rate is at a 4% CAGR. Based on the DCF model, the stock is fairly valued.By applying the TTM EV/EBITDA to projected FY21 EBITDA, the stock price is $163 per share. The potential 1-year price target is somewhere in the middle, around $150 per share.Management clearly laid out risks to near-term price appreciation. The stock price may be fairly valued if event-driven revenues do not pick up, customers pull back on spending on digitizing information and margins continue to compress. If trends seen in the latest quarter continue, management may need to rein in guidance once again. Right now, the stock is priced for these events to occur, but investors may overreact if these trends continue. I believe there is safety within the company's balance sheet and the importance of Broadridge to the financial industry.Broadridge has laid out plans and expectations for near-term growth and has capable management, as evidenced by operating margin expansion. Management has been a good steward of capital, but investors might be wary given the lowering of EPS growth expectations. Broadridge has grown through acquisitions and now has runway to grow organically. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the company in the near term. Management was conservative in the cadence of its latest conference call that has spooked investors. Based on the DCF model, the stock is fairly valued. But based on the projected EV/EBITDA multiple, there is room for price appreciation. There may be upside if the near-term headwinds abate and if management paints a more colorful picture of future expectations. Broadridge does provide steady performance with decent capital return to shareholders. Overall, this is a good company with a low near-term growth outlook. Investors might be interested in its capital deployment and margin expansion story. Broadridge may provide a solid return for investors willing to ride out the soggy weather."
4368933,102170,2020-08-14T19:49:39-04:00,"Despite softness in Q3, financial performance improved from the prior year.Company hit almost all of its long-term goals.FY21 guidance remains solid against macro headwinds.","Broadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE:BR) really nailed the 4Q20 after a soft third quarter. This is important to investors because it shows the resiliency of the business model, and the spending on acquisitions and technology has paid off. BR has guided for solid financial performance for 2021 despite management feeling conservative, given an expected weaker global environment for their next fiscal year. Given the FY20 financial performance, FY21 guidance and management cadence, I believe there is more upside for stock appreciation.There is a lot of good stuff here. Actual performance vs. guidance is within range and shows investors that management has the pulse of the company. The sad part is that there may be no upside surprises.Jim Young, the outgoing CFO, speaks about some more good stuff during the FY20 conference call.Investors were rewarded with a 1-year stock appreciation of ~12% along with dividends and share repurchases. On top of that, the dividend is raised six percent! Perhaps, more importantly, BR has strong liquidity and a balance sheet that has low to moderate leverage. The income statement is good, and the balance sheet is solid. This is a sight for sore eyes.Total revenue growth was solid in the 4Q that led to overall strong results despite challenges in Q3, especially with lower event-driven transactions (down 26% yoy). In total, GTO grew 18% to $1,174MM due to strong organic growth. Organic in 1H20 was 3% and 10% in 2H20. The organic growth in GTO may be one time in nature due to the increase in trading volumes as a result of market volatility.Source: FY20 Earnings PresentationEvent-driven transactions are near historically low levels and were soft in the first three quarters before picking up in the fourth quarter.Source: FY20 Earnings PresentationGAAP operating profit declined slightly yoy, but adjusted operating profit improved. Adjusted operating profit growth was driven by higher recurring revenue. This demonstrates why recurring revenue growth is a key metric for management and one to be monitored by investors.Source: FY20 Earnings PresentationAt first look, one would expect the guidance to be higher. Management notes that their guidance is conservative, and the ranges are higher than normal due to what they expect to be a soft fiscal year. Given the perceived challenges, performance still looks good. Jim Young explains during the conference call:Source: FY20 Earnings PresentationAlthough it is not noted in the commentary above, event-driven revenue is expected to remain at levels that were experienced this year. This is a positive if it stabilizes as it will not be a drag on revenue in FY21.I was curious to find out if BR noted an increase in customers focusing on digitalization. Some other companies I follow had a surge in revenue growth as their customers increased their technology spend as a result of the pandemic. BR has noted a pull forward in spending as described by Tim Gokey CEO during the conference call.I am going to quote myself from my last article to provide context on the projected stock price.I believe the guidance provided is conservative, especially with revenue growth. BR should continue to benefit from the pull forward in technology spend, and the markets should continue to be volatile. Both of which will contribute to organic growth. Management is expected to tighten their operating expenses and rationalize their real estate footprint through leases not being renewed. The increase in recurring revenue/total revenue and margin improvement sets up a good case for stock appreciation.My model has been updated to reflect a slightly higher growth rate than previous, and margins have been expanded to account for tighter controls and lower lease payments. This has led to a price of $148 per share. Based on the EV/EBITDA multiple, the projected price is $171. Once again, the stock price is probably somewhere in the middle, let's say $155-$160.Despite earlier challenges related to the pandemic, BR has executed on their plans and has improved financial performance. Management believes that there are macro headwinds that could slow growth and margin expansion when compared to a normal operating environment. There are tailwinds to support growth included guiding their customers through bank governance and the digitalization of the financial industry. Investors can hold steady in this stock with a modest dividend and share repurchase plan, solid liquidity and a moderately levered balance sheet. The share price could appreciate to the $155-$160 range."
4304283,102551,2019-11-08T08:52:14-05:00,"Broadridge reported weaker Q1 results than in Q1 2019, but this is because it benefited from a proxy campaign at a significant mutual fund complex in Q1 2019.BR continues to increase the extent to which recurring revenue is generated.Tuck-in acquisitions continue to be made with $0.179B in tuck-in M&A investments made YTD across governance, capital markets, and wealth management.","Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (BR) is a company in which 504 shares are currently held within a 'Side Account' in the FFJ Portfolio and additional shares are held in an account for which I do not disclose details.In my August 7th article at Financial Freedom is a Journey, I indicated 'I would be looking to increase my position if BR drops to $115 (or lower)' but indicated this is not a hard and fast dollar value.Well… with the recent pullback in BR's share price following the November 6th release of Q1 2019 results, I added to my existing position in the account which currently holds BR shares for which I do not disclose details.If BR is a company with which you are unfamiliar, I highly encourage you to read the Business and Risk Factors components of BR's FY2019 10-K to obtain a good overview of BR's business, strategy, clients, competition, etc.BR's Q1 results can be found in its November 6th Earnings Release, Earnings Presentation, and in the Q1 2020 10-Q.BR reported record Q1 sales and it completed tuck-in acquisitions across each of its franchises so as to strengthen the company and to drive long-term growth.While some investment articles in cyberspace indicate that BR missed earnings and revenue estimates, they may have neglected to reflect that Q1 is typically the weakest quarter. In fact, BR typically generates only 12-14% of its full year adjusted EPS in Q1 and this is right where BR ended this past quarter.In addition, in Q1 2020, BR did not benefit from event-driven activity and corresponding revenue as it did in Q1 2019; event-driven revenues declined significantly because, in 2019, BR benefited from a proxy campaign at a significant mutual fund complex. It is important to remember that event-driven fee revenues carry significant levels of incremental profitability as they leverage an existing cost infrastructure.In addition to organic growth, it is important that investors take note that BR continues to make headway in increasing the degree of recurring fee revenue. While Q1 has historically been weakest quarter, look at page 7 of the Earnings Presentation. Here, we see the extent to which recurring revenue relative to total revenue increased relative to Q1 2019. Naturally, the greater the degree of recurring (auto-pilot) revenue, the better management can deploy its resources toward generating incremental business.Slide 6 of the Earnings Presentation reflects how active BR has been on the tuck-in acquisition front. In fact, acquisitions are an integral part of BR's capital stewardship and investment strategy and are tightly aligned with the franchise strategy.On the governance side of BR's business, the strategy is to build the next generation of governance communications and to expand services across the governance network. BR has, in fact, invested more than $0.3B in the past 24 months to help accelerate this strategy. It significantly extended the data-driven solutions business with the relatively recent Fi360 acquisition and the purchase of TD Ameritrade assets.BR has also added to its issuer product suite, broadened its regulatory communications footprint, and strengthened its digital capabilities.On the wealth side of the business, BR is creating the open architecture solution of the future for investors, advisers, and operations with its largest acquisition being that of RPM Technologies. This acquisition strengthened BR's wealth business in Canada and extends its capabilities to integrate banking into wealth management. BR has also acquired new capabilities around securities-based lending, and most recently, adviser compensation.Growth in the capital markets segment of the business has been mostly organic but in October, BR acquired Shadow Financial Systems so as to broaden its presence into new asset classes, including exchange-traded derivatives and cryptocurrencies.In a nutshell, strategic acquisitions will continue to be a normal course of BR's business. The expectations are that acquisitions will continue to deepen BR's relationships with key clients, allow it to acquire talent, and bring new capabilities that it can use to generate additional business. In fact, on the Q1 2020 call with analysts, BR indicated these investments should contribute ~$0.175B of FY2020 recurring revenue.I pay particularly close attention to a company's Free Cash Flow as this provides management with flexibility. While BR generated $0.1067B of negative Free Cash Flow in Q1, this quarter is typically a negative Free Cash Flow quarter; looking at slide 15 of the Q1 Earnings Presentation, we see that BR generated $0.111B in negative Free Cash Flow in the first 3 months of FY2019.On the leverage front, BR's leverage ratio using adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR at September 30 was 2.2x, and a slight uptick is anticipated in Q2, reflecting the $0.120B purchase price for Fi360. This temporary spike above the long-term target of 2.0x is a result of the seasonally negative Q1 free cash flow and the timing of M&A closings.There has been no change to BR's capital allocation strategy and leverage target and BR has historically benefitted from the seasonally stronger free cash flows in the second half of the year. BR is confident it will delever and generate additional flexibility to pursue attractive tuck-in M&A opportunities and/or repurchase shares while finishing the year in line with its 2.0x leverage target.NOTE: EBITDAR can be calculated as EBITDAR = Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization + Rent/RestructuringIt is useful for companies undertaking restructuring efforts since restructuring charges are typically one-time or non-recurring expenses. Removing the restructuring costs shows a clearer picture of the operating performance of the company and perhaps might help with obtaining financing from a creditor.Looking at BR's Q1 2020 Balance Sheet, we see $0.399B appearing as a current portion of long-term debt. This is because BR has $0.4B in senior notes coming due in September 2020. BR has indicated it will consider opportunistically raising additional debt capital at some point over the next couple of quarters in order to appropriately manage upcoming maturities while keeping in mind plans to grow via acquisition.BR's FY2020 guidance is reflected below.Source: BR - Q1 2020 Earnings Presentation - November 6, 2019On the Q1 earnings call, management reiterated that BR remains on track to deliver another strong year of top and bottom line growth. Closed sales are expected to be strong and 8-10% recurring fee revenue growth and 8-12% adjusted EPS growth for the fiscal year are expected. With this outlook, it appears BR will deliver on the 3-year growth objectives shared with the investment community at its 2017 Investor Day.Management has indicated that ongoing industry trends have brought increasing evidence that the financial services industry is facing significant structural cost pressures. Examples of this include moves by online brokers to slash trading commissions and by global banks realigning their strategic focus.Regulatory change remains the constant with the SEC moving rapidly to implement Regulation Best Interest and the moves in Europe towards The Shareholder Rights Directive are a couple of the challenges helping drive BR's growth. Financial services firms must move rapidly to adapt their businesses and evolve how they serve their clients which is causing them to embrace industry solutions to mutualize critical non-differentiating functions, to tap into more and better data, and to raise the effectiveness of their communications.There has been no change to BR's credit ratings from Moody's and S&P Global subsequent to my last article and the credit ratings are not under review.Moody's continues to rate BR's long-term debt as Baa1 which is classified as lower medium grade. Standard & Poor's continues to rate the debt BBB+ which is also lower medium grade.These ratings are satisfactory for my purposes.BR's valuation at the time I wrote previous articles can be found in my August 7th article at Financial Freedom Is A Journey.We see from BR's August 1, 2019, Earnings Release that BR generated FY2019 diluted EPS of $4.06 and adjusted diluted EPS of $4.66. When I wrote my August 7th article, BR was trading at $123.60 thus giving us a forward diluted PE of ~30.44 and a forward adjusted diluted PE of ~26.52.With BR continuing to project FY2020 diluted EPS growth of 5 - 9% we arrive at a projected range of ~$4.26 - ~$4.43. Using the current $120.48 share price we get a forward diluted PE of ~27.2 - ~28.28.Using FY2020 adjusted EPS projections of 8 - 12% we get a range of ~$5.03 - ~$5.22 giving us a forward adjusted diluted PE range of ~23.08 - ~23.94.In my previous article I wrote:BR's share price dropped pretty close to this level which is why I acquired more shares.Despite the uptick in BR's share price on November 7th to $120.48, I think BR stands a good chance of being worth far more several years from now. Depending on your investment time horizon and other personal factors, I think acquiring BR shares for the long-term at the current level is not a bad decision.I am puzzled as to why BR does not keep the dividend history segment of its website current. The company's site reflects the most recent dividend as being $0.365 and having been paid July 3, 2018. As a long-time BR shareholder I know that BR's quarterly dividend has been increased twice subsequent to what the company's website reflects. A more accurate dividend history can be found here and below.Source: BR - FY2019 10-KSubsequent to BR's June 30th fiscal year end, it announced an increase to its quarterly dividend to $0.54/share. This provides investors with a ~1.8% dividend yield on the basis of the current $120.48 share price.Yield hungry investors will likely pass on BR given this low yield but as an investor desiring a well-balanced portfolio, I am prepared to invest in low dividend-yielding stocks if I have a reasonable degree of confidence that the company's share price will appreciate in value over the long-term.You will also note from the image above that the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is declining very gradually. Given that BR is in growth mode, I would not expect a significant reduction in the number of shares outstanding as a reduction in share count is not a strategic priority.I have been a BR shareholder since it became a publicly-traded entity in March 2007. Over this timeframe, I have had the opportunity to read several earnings call transcripts, 10-Qs, 10-Ks, and Earnings Presentations. Not once have I walked away wondering why the company is not executing on the strategy being communicated to the investment community.I fully intend to remain a long-term shareholder and my plan is to continue to periodically acquire shares as funds permit and depending on what other investment opportunities are presented.I wish you much success on your journey to financial freedom.Thanks for reading!"
4351544,60561,2020-06-02T14:28:27-04:00,Broadridge Financial Solutions is a Dividend Contender with 13 consecutive years of dividend growth. Shares currently yield 1.78%.Broadridge Financial Solutions does the behind-the-scenes work for publicly traded businesses.The business is relatively sticky with recurring fee revenue showing continued growth.Broadridge Financial Solutions appears fairly valued at current prices.,"Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR) provides investor communications for the financial services industry. The business handles processing and distributing proxy materials as well as proxy voting solutions for equities as well as mutual funds. Broadridge also handles direct stock purchase plans for companies. It's the epitome of boring being beautiful as the business is far from the core competency of most businesses that managers would prefer to outsource this mundane activity.My primary investment strategy falls under the dividend growth investing category. That means that I want to invest my capital in businesses that have a history of paying and growing their dividend payments over time.Image by author; data source Broadridge Financial Solutions Investor RelationsAccording to the CCC list, Broadridge is a Dividend Contender with 13 consecutive years of dividend growth. That's every year of Broadridge's existence as a publicly traded company after being spun off from Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) in 2007.While Broadridge doesn't have the longest dividend growth streak around, the dividend growth has been strong thus far.Year-over-year dividend growth has ranged from 7.0% to 108.3% with an average of 27.4% and a median of 16.6%.Looking at the 9 rolling 5-year periods during the streak, annualized dividend growth has ranged from 14.2% to 40.6% with an average of 19.8% and a median of 16.0%.Thus far in Broadridge's dividend growth streak, the quarterly payout has increased from $0.06 up to $0.54 or 800%.The 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year rolling annualized dividend growth rates since 2007 can be found in the following table.Table and calculations by author; data source Broadridge Financial Solutions Investor Relations*Based on calendar year payouts.The payout ratio is a quick way to gauge the safety of the dividend. A rising payout ratio means that dividend growth has outpaced growth of the underlying business and suggests that future dividend growth could slow down. The payout ratio also let's you know how ""at risk"" the dividend is due to a disruption in the business. Image by author; data source Broadridge Financial Solutions SEC filingsDespite the fantastic dividend growth, Broadridge's payout ratio has been quite steady over the last decade. The average payout ratio based on net income comes to 44% for the last decade and 43% for the most recent 5 years. Likewise, the free cash flow payout ratio has averages of 32% and 34% for the same periods, respectively.When I invest my savings into a business the goal is to identify a business that I believe is sustainable and has a high probability of being even better in the future. The way I view it the quality of the business tells you what to buy and the valuation tells you when.Image by author; data source Broadridge Financial Solutions SEC filingsThe first thing I check is how a business' revenues have performed. The total growth has come in at a solid 97.5% over the last decade or ~7.9% annualized. Much of that growth came in FY 2017 with the completion of DST Systems' NACC business. Excluding the jump in FY 2017 due to the acquisition, the average year-over-year revenue growth rate has come in at 4% per year.Operating income has seen total growth of 85.9% over that same time or 7.1% annualized. Meanwhile, operating cash flow has only grown 25.0% or ~2.5% annualized with free cash flow seeing growth of 25.6% or ~2.6% annualized.Image by author; data source Broadridge Financial Solutions SEC filingsOf course, sales are only part of the equation because the business needs to generate cash flow from those sales. I typically want to see a free cash flow margin of 10% which Broadridge has comfortably hit in all but 2 years over the last decade. Broadridge has a 10-year average free cash flow margin of 12.8% and a 5-year average of 13.0%.My preferred profitability metric is the free cash flow return on invested capital, ""FCF ROIC"". The FCF ROIC represents the annual cash return that a business generates based on the capital invested in the business. Image by author; data source Broadridge Financial Solutions SEC filingsBroadridge's FCF ROIC has been excellent over the last decade with every year well above my 10% threshold. Both the 10-year and 5-year average FCF ROIC for Broadridge sit at 22.6%.I like to invest in businesses with management teams that use their cash flows in ways that make sense to me as a part owner. That means that the first priority is reinvesting in the business via capital expenditures. If there's cash flow left over, I then want to see some of that cash flow returned to owners via dividends. Any remaining cash flow should go towards reducing debt, share repurchases, building up a war chest or strategic acquisitions.To understand how Broadridge uses its free cash flow, I calculate 3 variations of the metric, defined below:Strong businesses with conservative management teams should show positive FCFaDB more often than not. I'm not concerned about any given year being negative, rather it's the trend over time that I use as a gauge of the quality of the management team. Image by author; data source Broadridge Financial Solutions SEC filingsAs we saw earlier, Broadridge has shown positive FCF each year over the last decade. Cumulatively, Broadridge has produced $3.84B in FCF which has allowed management to pay out $1.19B in dividends to shareholders.That puts the cumulative FCFaD at a healthy $2.65B over the last decade. Broadridge has also managed positive FCFaD every year over the last 10 years as well.Management has also spent a total of $2.35B on share buybacks over the last decade which puts the cumulative FCFaDB at $0.30B. Image by author; data source Broadridge Financial Solutions SEC filingsIn total, Broadridge has reduced its share count by 11.5% over the last decade. That's good for a ~1.4% reduction annually. Image by author; data source Broadridge Financial Solutions SEC filingsBroadridge's balance sheet has worsened slightly over the last decade with a debt to capitalization ratio climbing from 29% in FY 2010 up to 57% by FY 2019.While the total debt levels have increased, the debt is still very manageable with a debt to EBITDA ratio of just 1.59 for FY 2019.Data by YChartsAt the end of FY 2019, all of the debt that was on balance sheet could be paid off with just 2.6 years of FY 2019 FCF.One valuation method that I like to use is the minimum acceptable rate of return, ""MARR"", analysis. A MARR analysis requires you to estimate the future earnings and dividends that a business will generate, apply a reasonable multiple to those future earnings and then determine if the expected return exceeds your hurdle rate.Current analyst estimates put Broadridge's FY 2020 EPS at $5.04 and FY 2021's estimate of $5.54. Analysts also expect earnings growth to come in at 10% per year for the next 5 years. I then assumed that Broadridge would be able to manage 4% annual earnings growth for the following 5 years. Dividends are assumed to target a 45% payout ratio.To determine a reasonable multiple on those future earnings, I let history be my guide. Over the last decade, market participants have valued Broadridge's TTM EPS between ~15x and ~30x. For the MARR analysis, I'll use expected P/E ratios covering that range.Data by YChartsThe following table shows the potential internal rates of return that an investment in Broadridge could produce given that the assumptions listed above play out. Returns include dividends taken in cash and are calculated assuming a purchase price near the $122 level. Returns are run through the end of calendar year 2024, ""5 Year"", and the end of calendar year 2029, ""10 Year"".Alternatively, I want to know at what price I could purchase shares to generate the returns I desire from my investments. My typical investment threshold is 10%. I also calculated the price targets based on an 11% IRR which is derived from the ~7.3% estimated annualized earnings growth over the next 10 years plus the 1.8% starting dividend yield and an additional 2.3% annualized to account for 25% undervaluation normalizing over 10 years.Additionally, I like to use dividend yield theory as a quick gauge for the current valuation. The idea behind dividend yield theory is that the 5-year average dividend yield is a good proxy for the fair value of the business.Image by author; data source Broadridge Financial Solutions Investor Relations and Yahoo FinanceShares of Broadridge currently yield 1.78%. The 5-year average dividend yield sits at 1.82% suggesting a fair price around $118Another valuation method that I like to use is a simplified reverse DCF. Using the three-year average unlevered free cash flow of $514M, terminal growth rate of 4% and a WACC of 9.3%, Broadridge would need to grow its UFCF 9.5% per year for the next 10 years to justify the current price. Using the same inputs except with the TTM UFCF of $664M, UFCF growth would need to hit just 6.3% annual growth for the next 10 years to justify the current price.Broadridge is an underfollowed steady grower with revenues growing 8 years in a row. On top of that, the business is a strong cash flow generator with operating cash flow margins routinely around 14% and free cash flow margins of 12-13%. Put that with a relatively capital light business and Broadridge is able to see FCF ROICs >20%.Dividend yield theory suggests a fair value range of $108 to $132. My fair value range based on MARR analysis is $106-$128, while the reverse DCF valuation suggests a fair value around $120.Broadridge is a interesting business in that they take care of a lot of the ""dirty"" work for publicly traded businesses. At the current price around $121 I'm very much considering initiating a position in this strong company."
4324907,22201,2020-02-18T09:30:03-05:00,"Broadridge stock pulled back again after a recent underwhelming earnings report.However, the business's long-term trajectory is fine.I expect the stock to reach new all-time highs over the next year.","I last wrote about Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR), the dominant proxy services company, in October, suggesting that the stock would make further gains in 2020. That call appeared to be off to a good start, as the stock rallied sharply into January. However, shares fell back significantly after the most recent earnings report. While those earnings certainly dampened short-term momentum, it might drop it back toward a fair entry point for folks that haven't taken a position in Broadridge yet:Ultimately, I see BR stock reaching news highs (above the 2018 levels). From the current $122 price, that's some decent upside in coming months. But's let's back up. What's Broadridge, and why did the stock drop a few weeks ago?For those unfamiliar, Broadridge describes itself as a ""Fintech grownup."" That is to say that it is still an innovative company and is expanding into new industries. Unlike rivals, however, Broadridge has been in the game a long time - it started doing brokerage services as part of Automatic Data Processing (ADP) back in 1962. So it already has reputation, prestige, and well-established client relationships in its core businesses that have spanned the decades. ADP spun off the Broadridge business in 2007 as an already highly profitable and successful outfit. The success has continued. Broadridge has paid a rising dividend every year since then, and shares are up 508% since the spin-off.The company has a lock on its core proxy services business, delivering vital - if mundane - documents to shareholders (both through mail and digitally). It also handles a lot of other brokerage back-office services, such as trade confirmations and dividend reinvestment programs. The company estimates that it reaches 75% of North American households with its services, and it helps oversee shareholder voting in 90 countries. This is a large, mission-critical business that throws off tons of cash and grows consistently, if at a modest rate organically.I was reminded of my initial reasons for taking an interest in Broadridge stock when I read the latest from Ensemble Capital. They offered an updated take on the company, which they've been long for many years. Ensemble may not be especially well-known, but they own a lot of steady compounder stocks like this (they're also big holders of First American Financial (FAF) – another off-the-radar company I own) and have earned strong returns. Thus, it's nice to see them continuing to support Broadridge even as shares have advanced in recent years.Here is the crux of Ensemble's pitch for Broadridge, though it's worth reading the whole write-up if you're interested as they add more nuance:Ensemble goes on to explain how that due to these mechanics, Broadridge keeps 98% of its clients retained every year. When it's important that a product be delivered correctly and without issue, and it doesn't cost much to fulfill, it's hard for competition to go after your position.The writer further explains how this success in existing fields such as proxy statements should pave the way for them to win in adjacent fields. For example, Broadridge is making a big push on software and services for wealth advisers and has already won key clients like UBS. If they are able to replicate the same structure they've achieved in the proxy business, the company will have many more great years ahead of it.Broadridge is a classic capital-light business model – you don't need to put in much money to keep the proxy services humming – which ensures there is plenty of cash available for dividend hikes (it's an annual double-digit yield increaser) and buybacks in addition to M&A.Data by YChartsI'd also note that the company just raised $750 million in a senior note offering at an attractive 2.9% interest rate for a 10-year duration. Broadridge is an active acquirer, constantly bolting on more businesses to its core. Needless to say, a skilled M&A department can do a lot of good with nearly a billion dollars of additional firepower at such a low interest rate.I'm of the view that Broadridge is undervalued compared to other rivals - particularly software consolidator shops like Roper (ROP) or Constellation Software (OTCPK:CNSWF) to say nothing of fintech plays like ADP because people view Broadridge as a lower-growth option. And that may be true just on the core proxy business. But something like Roper or Constellation doesn't tend to have explosive organic growth either; instead you have a robust cash-flow spinning core business attached to an M&A machine. In 2019 alone, Broadridge made a ton of acquisitions such as RPM Technologies for wealth advisers in Canada, Shadow Financial for derivatives and cryptocurrency, and Fi360 which brings in more data analytics for asset managers.Broadridge shares were unusually discounted this time last year because 2018 had been an active year for proxy fights. As a result, Broadridge earned substantial non-standard revenue from servicing all that activity. 2019 was a more normal year, which led to a near-term earnings decline, and the market overreacted, sending BR stock down 25%. I got involved at that point, and the stock soon started to recover.However, the rally stopped just short of the old 2018 highs, and shares found themselves again on the retreat following the most recent earnings report. That earnings report came up short for two reasons. For one, the company has a large agreement with IBM (IBM) related to setting up a private cloud, and experienced heavy costs related to that. Second, event-driven proxy activity came in much lower than usual.Neither of these is ideal, by any means, but they don't seem like long-term deal-breakers. For the second quarter, for example, revenues grew 2%. Doesn't sound great. However, recurring revenues grew 5%, offset by losses in event-driven revenues and foreign exchange. Event-driven and FX tends to come and go, whereas recurring revenues flowing into a business with client retention rates in the high 90s are a very sticky thing indeed.Overall, the company slightly lowered guidance, mainly for earnings. However, as long as revenues and sales remain on track, it's hard for me to get too bothered about the quarter:SourceAnd let's take a look at the long-term chart:Data by YChartsClearly, the 2019 dip under $100/share was a great entry. The stock had gotten ahead of itself in 2018 on that unusually profitable period tied to strong proxy activity. Following the steep pullback in 2019, the stock is now consolidating within striking range of the old 2018 high despite the momentarily weak operating results. Once that breaks, it should be a clean technical move after that to $150 or higher.I continue to stand by Broadridge as a favorable way to get 10-12% range returns going forward as its core business continues to churn out large piles of cash while the company grows into adjacent businesses via M&A. If some of those M&A moves hit – particularly with the company's move into wealth management services, upside could be significantly higher than that 10-12%/year range.In any case, it's a nice baseline given that downside risk is pretty small – Broadridge's business was barely affected even in the Great Financial Crisis (earnings dropped only 5% and immediately recovered thereafter).The stock could drop due to further PE compression in the short term, but as long as earnings keep growing around 10%/year compounded long term, the stock price will be a lot higher than it is now within a few years. And on the other hand, the valuation multiple could expand significantly. Keep in mind, Broadridge traded up to $140 on $4 a share of earnings in 2018. So the stock could go significantly higher than that as Broadridge's earnings are forecast to top $5 a share in 2021."
4332280,25941,2020-03-16T15:13:27-04:00,"Due to the recurring nature of equity proxies and the mutual fund/ETF interims business, Broadridge has built a relatively recession-proof revenue stream.A large portion of the business is built on regulation requirements for their clients and is typically seen as the cost of being a publicly traded company.The selloff in equities has caused Broadridge to fall ~20% in the past couple of months, however, their business is relatively insulated from the economic fears driving the selloff.","Broadridge (BR) is the dominant provider in proxy and interim services for broker/dealers, and has been for the past several decades. Proxy voting requires coordination between the broker/dealer, the issuer, and the beneficial owner. Nearly all broker/dealers hire Broadridge to fulfill this role. The company processes over 80% of outstanding shares in the United States and processes in over 120 international markets. Broadridge has been dragged down with the rest of the market in the past several weeks, however, the core business will likely be unaffected by the economic ramifications caused by the coronavirus.Data by YChartsStarting each year with revenue already in the pipeline is one the largest advantages of Broadridge's business model. Nearly half of Broadridge’s revenue is considered recurring, which the company expects will continue to grow at ~8-10% for 2020. Acquisitions have helped fuel this growth in the past. Over the past 10 years, the company has completed 20+ acquisitions (the most notable and recent being RPM Technologies last year). Broadridge will likely continue pursuing acquisitions in order to further grow stable revenue streams.Source: BroadridgeDue to the recurring nature of equity proxies and the mutual fund/ETF interims business, Broadridge has built a relatively recession-proof revenue stream. Working within a heavily regulated industry has its pros and cons, but one of the big advantages is that the majority of the services that the company provides to issuers (corporations, ETFs, mutual funds) must be done by law. Since issuers are not allowed to communicate directly with their beneficial owners, the demand for Broadridge’s services are a necessity and do not depend on the health of the economy.Source: BroadridgeIn addition, proxy fees, from the issuer’s perspective, are simply the cost of being a publically traded company. These fees are relatively negligible to their bottom line. For example, McDonald’s recently disclosed that it has about 2 million beneficial owners, which is roughly $2 million in fees (using Broadridge’s average of $1 per delivery). To put this into perspective, McDonald’s made $6 billion in net income in 2019. Typically the amount of beneficial owners scale up or down relative to the company’s market cap as well. Because of this, issuers are not likely to exhaust resources in order to attempt to reduce these costs, and thus can be considered stable and dependable to the company.Broadridge is able to leverage the strengths of both its business and industry, and as a result has a 97% client retention rate. This is due to multiple factors. First, Broadridge has spent decades cultivating relationships with clients. The experience and trust that they provide is highly valuable to the business yet difficult to quantify. To supplement this, multi-year contracts provide the company with stable and predictable future revenue. The time and effort it takes to find a different solution is often not a task that clients want to add to their list of things to do.Broadridge has also developed various services by simply talking to and understanding their clients. It allows the company to truly understand what their clients need, and to internally decide what markets are worth pursing. This is also why the acquisition strategy has worked out so well for them. Each acquisition allows them to gain more market share and lock in multi-year contracts, or to boost capabilities in order to offer or complement other services.Broadridge is a company that offers steady, recurring revenues in an industry where switching costs are high. Their business is highly regulated, and is not dependent on interest rates, the stock market, or the general health of the economy. Because of this, the business is essentially recession proof.That doesn’t mean there aren’t risks. The acquisition strategy appears to be successful given the state of their business. However, this may not continue to be the case in the future as management has not always gotten it right. For example, in 2005 before Broadridge split from ADP, they purchased Bank of America’s clearing and broker/dealer services business for $344 million. 5 years later it was sold for $40 million.M&A from clients could also negatively affect future revenues, as consolidation continues throughout the industry. Broadridge could have two of their clients merge, effectively cutting revenues in half. Regulation could also negatively impact the prices that they can charge clients. Despite these risks, and given the broad equity selloff, Broadridge appears to be an attractive opportunity."

It was subsequently spun off from ADP on March 30, 2007. Broadridge provides technology solutions for parts of the infrastructure that powers the financial services industry. These are mission-critical yet non-differentiating back-office type functions.Source: Broadridge’s September 2019 investor presentationThe slide above breaks down the revenue for Broadridge’s two reportable business segments:Broadridge is building a solid spread of recurring fee revenue streams in its ICS business. In this segment, all recurring fee revenues grew year-over-year except for customer communications and fulfillment which has struggled in recent quarters while Broadridge off-loads a large customer after which revenues should stabilize. GTO revenues have benefited from the acquisitions of Rockall (May 2019) and RPM Technologies (June 2019) which strengthened Broadridge’s Canadian wealth management business by widening its product offering and onboarding new client relationships. Source: Broadridge’s September 2019 investor presentationAs shown in the slide above, topline revenue growth grew a very modest 1% from FY2018 to FY2019 but this masks a 3% contribution from recurring fee revenues offset by lower event-driven and distribution revenues and currency headwinds. However when comparing FY2019 to FY2018, adjusted operating income rose 8% to USD746 million due largely to margin expansion and adjusted EPS rose 11% to USD4.66.Source: Broadridge’s September 2019 investor presentationWhat Broadridge likes to highlight is their recurring fee revenues which reached USD2.8 billion in FY2019 with a 97% customer retention rate. This is up 6% year-over-year driven by closed sales (an estimate for the expected annual recurring fee revenue for new client contracts), organic and acquisitive growth offset by client losses. Broadridge’s bread and butter sales growth comes from up-selling products to existing clients. Bolstered by the strong FY2019 results, Broadridge announced an 11% annual dividend increase to USD2.16 marking the 8th consecutive double-digit dividend increase. Management’s first use of excess cash is its dividend.Broadridge has a 3 year recurring revenue growth objective of 5-7% with growth coming from the following platforms:FY2020 Guidance:Source: Yahoo financeThe graph above looks at Broadridge’s share price performance over the last 5 years. Considering that the financial industry breaks down into many broad categories (e.g. exchanges, technology providers, liquidity providers, asset managers, banks and alternative managers), Broadridge more than holds its own against one of the best performing groups over the last 5 years, exchanges. It indicates that its business model is extracting a disproportionate share of the economics from many of its clients and investors are rewarding it for this through superior share price performance. With a FY2019 free cash yield of about 4%, revenue multiple of 3.5x and an unadjusted PE ratio of 30x, Broadridge looks fairly valued in my view. EPS is forecast to rise 8-12% in FY2020 and assuming no multiple contract/expansion this should translate into share price growth. Broadridge ticks many boxes on my investment criteria list. It is a leader in its field and has a broad product offering much of which is essential to its client’s operations. It benefits from the tailwinds of evolving regulatory requirements, global institutions’ need for technology enabled infrastructure support, digitization and the increasingly sophisticated ways to analyze and leverage data. It has a large addressable market that Broadridge estimates is USD25 billion to USD40 billion in size. It has very manageable debt levels supported by a cash generative business model. Supported by operating leverage and share buybacks, Broadridge’s guidance towards FY2020 adjusted EPS growth of 8-12% looks achievable.Though topline growth is currently modest, its recurring fee revenue business now represents 60%+ of total revenues and is growing at a faster pace. Broadridge has a sensible and proven bolt-on acquisition strategy that onboards expertise, clients and geographies without straining the overall business. It should also show some resilience during a recession given its sizable recurring fee revenue business, mission-critical/regulatory nature of its solutions and solid balance sheet. Unsurprisingly, most of these positives are already recognized by the market and Broadridge trades at a fair value in my view. It is a quality business that should prove to be a solid holding for the long-term shareholder. However, I would prefer a better entry level so remain neutral on the stock."
4295703,22201,2019-10-09T09:28:12-04:00,"Since my original recommendation in March, Broadridge stock has rallied nicely.Shares have pulled back over the past month, offering another opportunity in Broadridge stock.The company is reasonably priced given its growth profile.","This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ Income subscribers - find out more here.I highlighted the bullish case for Broadridge Financial (BR) earlier this year. The former ADP (ADP) spin-off has long been the leader in proxy services management and has recently been expanding into other adjacent fields. It may not be in the most flashy market, but that has kept BR stock cheaper than other more glamorous FinTech names. In particular, Broadridge had a strong first half of 2018 thanks to an unusually lively series of activist-investor led proxy battles. This caused Broadridge's more recent results come up short by comparison which led to a sharp sell-off in Broadridge's stock price late last year. Since my original buy call in March, BR stock has surged as much as 30% higher, however, it still trades below its 2018 peak. Additionally, shares have gotten dinged up a bit over the past month during the market's broader rotation from growth stocks back to value. As a result, it's worth taking another look at Broadridge as shares now trade at $120.The company's general strategic agenda remains on course. While the core proxy business is humming, Broadridge continues its move into wealth management services. It has done so, as it likes to do, by keeping up its M&A activities. It picked up Financial Database Services for an undisclosed sum. This company offers software for managing adviser compensation within fund offices. Additionally, in a bigger move, Broadridge bought RPM Technologies for about $300 million. RPM offers capabilities for managing retail banking and mutual fund services in Canada. RPM is projected to add $40-$50 million in 2020 revenues meaning Broadridge paid around 6-7x sales for the entity.In any case, M&A has been a core competency for Broadridge over the years; if you are a long-term bull on the stock, you should have confidence in management's ability to keep finding and sourcing more deals on reasonable terms. CEO Timothy Gokey made it clear that the company will remain active in M&A going forward:Moving on to operating results, in August, Broadridge reported its full-year fiscal 2019 results, as its financial year ends in June.Through Q2, Broadridge had reported fairly lackluster results, given the tough comparisons to 2018. There was unusually strong proxy activity in 2018 driven by high-profile activist battles that had temporarily boosted revenues. As these rolled off, the weak results tanked BR stock. As I had anticipated, however, results picked up over the past two quarters of the year, leading to another solid year for the firm overall. For the full-year, revenues were up just 1%, which isn't great, though things picked up as the year progressed. Notably, recurring revenues were up significantly more, while other revenues declined slightly. Broadridge's business continues to transition to digital proxies, which should be a long-term benefit to the business. For example look at margins. As the move to recurring revenues continues, Broadridge's full-year operating margin surged from 13.8% in 2018 to 15.0% in 2019. When you can add 120 basis points there, it makes up for slower top-line growth. Powered by those improving margins, earnings rose 14% despite the top-line weakness. Heading into 2020, the business' recent improving momentum should continue. For fiscal 2020, Broadridge sees something in the range of 3-6% total revenue growth for the year. However, in the more desirable recurring revenue category, growth should be closer to 8-10%, with EPS growth projected to come in around 10% as well.As I noted in my previous article, that sort of EPS growth rate is attractive because the company's business is quite recession-resistant. Even in 2009, revenues only dropped 3% with earnings down 5%. That's amazing resiliency for a financial services firm during the Great Financial Crisis.A consistent 8-10% growth rate is worth a lot in terms of compounding if a recession year results in you being down marginally rather than down double digits.23x forward earnings is not a bad price for Broadridge given its EPS growth rate since it is less likely to face a big setback when the next recession/bear market does arrive, be it next quarter or years from now. To be sure, 23x forward earnings isn't particularly cheap either, but if you're looking for businesses with strong growth - both in earnings and dividends - that will fare alright over the next five to ten years even if the economy hits a prolonged rough patch, Broadridge is an attractive option.One thing worth paying attention to is Broadridge's quality of service. I've seen some comments that Broadridge's consumer-facing products such as its dividend reinvestment ""DRIP"" services are clunkier than rivals' offerings. See this comment for example, though there are several I could pick from.I'd also note negative comments such as you see here for CDK Global (CDK). CDK, for those unfamiliar, was another spin-off from ADP which focuses on automotive sales software. You see folks suggesting that CDK is skating off past client lock-in and that it hasn't done enough to modernize its product, potentially leaving it open to more nimble competition. I had considered investing in CDK but saw enough to concern me about whether or not their product has a sustainable durable advantage. Given that both companies are ADP spin-offs, there could be elements of similar corporate culture between the two.As it is, with Broadridge, I'm not as concerned, as the core proxy services business has a high moat, minimal competition, and is hard for consumers to switch away from. That said, as Broadridge tries to branch out into more competitive markets such as wealth management, we'll need to watch and see if they invest enough to keep their products attractive for end users. It's far easier to dominate a business to business niche with ""good enough"" software, but Broadridge may need to step up its game as it goes after more mass market services.While Broadridge is not technically a Dividend Aristocrat, it has about as good a record as you can have without being part of that club. That's because Broadridge is a spin-off of ADP, which itself is a Dividend Aristocrat. Broadridge, since becoming independent, has hiked its dividend every year. Impressively, 2019 marked the eighth year in a row where it increased its dividend at a double-digit clip, and the growth rate continues to run well into the double-digits:Source: Seeking AlphaOftentimes, you see this sort of fantastic dividend growth driven by a one-time spike in a company's dividend payout ratio as a company transitions from being a young growth company to a more mature one. That's not been the case for BR stock at all.Since 2011, Broadridge's payout ratio hasn't budged - it was at 44% then and is still at that level now. Meanwhile, the dividend has more than tripled over that stretch - all driven by rapidly rising earnings power:Data by YChartsWhile the price of BR stock has been more volatile - particularly over the past 18 months - the core earnings engine has been remarkably smooth. And the company shares a steady portion of those earnings gains with shareholders. It's easy for people to look at a company like Broadridge with a 1.8% dividend yield and say, I'll pass, the yield is too low. However, don't underestimate the impact of rapid compounding dividend growth; you could have bought Broadridge stock as recently as 2012 and already have a 10% yield on cost on your investment today.As I noted in my recent IMF portfolio buys article, I've added again to my position in BR stock on this recent pullback. A lot of software, cloud, and related stocks have been selling off lately, in large part, I believe, due to the implosion of the tech unicorns and recent IPOs. Ultimately though, the troubles over at the likes of Uber (UBER) and WeWork have next to nothing to do with the prospects for a fast-growing highly profitable firm like Broadridge. If you value Broadridge more like a software company, it's quite cheap here at 3x sales given its profit margins, recurring revenues profile and the like.On an earnings basis, in March, I argued Broadridge should be valued more like ADP and other leading financial technology companies. Here's how things have gone since then in fintech:Data by YChartsBroadridge has in fact almost caught up to ADP on an earnings basis, with ADP at 25x forward now compared to Broadridge at 23x forward earnings. As you can see, however, Broadridge has traded right in line with other peers like Fiserv (FISV) and Mastercard (MA) over the past two quarters while remaining significantly cheaper than them on both earnings and Price/sales. If you want exposure to the fintech sector, Broadridge stock continues to be an appealing option, particularly once you factor its sizzling dividend growth record into account."

Broadridge’s stock performance over the past 12-month period has been tepid.With the deal for RPM, perhaps BR can rev up its future performance as investors watch for improved results."
4261451,24443,2019-05-08T12:52:15-04:00,"Broadridge is attempting to grow by adding a wealth management platform business to it core proxy business.Broadridge's core business is still a nice and consistent money maker.Broadridge has increased its dividend for over a decade and will likely be an aristocrat in another two decades.Broadridge appears to be priced almost exclusively on their existing business, and should increase significantly if their wealth management platform proves successful.","Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR) is a financial services firm that is best known for proxy services, where it is the dominant provider. The company's core business has proven to be reasonably resilient and consistent, and it is now attempting an ambitious expansion into operations services for investment management companies. If successful, Broadridge could undergo considerable growth, and a diversified business that could be more profitable than their continuing core business.Last year, Broadridge launched its wealth management platform, with UBS (UBS) as its anchor client. Broadridge described its wealth platform as ""a next-generation open platform that will solve a key financial services challenge by creating a modern, industry-level wealth management best-in-class technology solution.""The platform is designed to mutualize investments in technology, innovation and security. Another way of stating that is that the tremendous burden of keeping up with regulations has become so expensive that Broadridge seeks to develop a solution where wealth managers can share costs. I believe that they can have some serious success with a platform that effectively cuts costs.If UBS is happy with the services and other wealth managers follow them onto the platform, Broadridge and existing wealth managers on the platform should benefit from sharing costs.UBS was a great first client to get. It is a massive wealth manager. Further, Broadridge continues to make acquisitions to enhance the platform's capabilities. Broadridge just recently reported it acquired Rockall, a securities-based lending and collateral management technologies company, for an undisclosed amount.Rockall presently manages over $3 trillion of collateral, and does business with major banks that include Wells Fargo (WFC), US Bank (USB) and Barclays (BCS), among others.In Broadridge's press release, Michael Alexander, head of Broadridge's North American Wealth and Capital Markets Group, commented:Securities-based lending is a growing business that has become more of an essential offering for wealth management firms. As a growing number of investors are come to value securities-based lines of credit, financial services firms will need to automate and scale their operations in a manner that makes sense for this platform.Further, since many wealth management firms are already customers of Rockall's securities-based lending services, it is possible that some of them are now more likely to utilize Broadridge's platform.Broadridge valuations may have become frothy last year, in anticipation of this new business line, but they have since returned to more reasonable levels. Though Broadridge does have a high P/E, that is because their business produces strong cash flow and is asset light. Broadridge actually traded at far richer valuations for most of the past two years.(Source: SeekingAlpha)At the same time, leveraged free cash flow is at all-time highs:(Source: SeekingAlpha)As is the companies EBIDTA:(Source: SeekingAlpha)This performance indicates Broadridge may continue to maintain existing multiples and possibly deserve a higher valuation upon the meaningful participation of their new platform.Broadridge is not a household name and it tends to move with financials, so it is susceptible to broad sector moves. Moreover, because it is in the process of building a new platform, and it is acquiring businesses to enrich that platform, the company has the potential to decline on increased spending and costs related to integrating these businesses.Broadridge could end up spending a considerable amount on this wealth management platform and it could end up failing. It is also possible the company will lower future revenue expectations from the platform, or its profitability. Broadridge also could find integrating acquired components to be more difficult or costly than anticipated.Broadridge's core business is very secure, which gives the company the ability to take chances on growing a new business line. At the same time, it is possible a competitor can emerge to any of their business lines, including proxy voting services. Even an unsuccessful entrant could have significant effects upon margins.Broadridge is not a dividend aristocrat, but it will probably end up one. It was it was spun off of ADP, which is an aristocrat, and it has increased its dividend every year since.Broadridge's dividend is not enormous, but it is growing and is fueled by the company's EPS growth. Broadridge was already able to consistently increase its dividend on the strength of its core business, and now it has the potential to supplement that growth from an entirely new business.(Source: SeekingAlpha)Broadridge appears committed to returning capital to shareholders. The company has been a consistent repurchaser of shares too.Broadridge is a high quality business that has a history of growing and returning capital to shareholders. The company is attempting to enter a new business line with a wealth management platform that has tremendous potential. It is still unclear how successful the platform may be, if at all. As a result, shares have the potential to increase significantly upon news of continued platform adoption."

The company operates two distinct segments: Investor Communication Solutions (≈80 of revenue) and Global Technology & Operations (≈20% of revenue).The Investor Communication Solutions business encompasses the distribution of proxy materials and regulated communications (annual reports, fund interims, corporate events…) to investors. Most investors own their securities through brokerage accounts, which makes it impossible for issuers (corporates, mutual funds, and ETFs) to communicate directly with them (they do not know who they are). However, brokerage firms are paid by issuers to handle communications on their behalf. The majority of brokerage firms outsource this critical mission to Broadridge. As a result, Broadridge processes communications for over 80% of shares in the US and 75% of shares internationally, which translates to over 2 billion of proxies and investors communications processed. Besides, the company also provides additional communication services to corporates such as shareholders analytics, virtual shareholder meeting organizations, and the distribution of essential communications including transactional (bills and statements), regulatory (explanations of benefits, notices, and trade confirmations), and marketing (direct mail) communications.The Global Technology & Operations segment is a mix of software sales and managed services. The company provides investment operations technology solutions to financial institutions such as broker-dealers, asset managers, and wealth management firms. Broadridge's software solutions deal with all the steps of the securities transaction lifecycle, including functions such as trade order, trade confirmation, regulatory compliance reporting, performance monitoring, and accounting. In addition, the company has recently developed an integrated front to back wealth management platform supporting the entire wealth management lifecycle. Broadridge is again very well positioned as it serves 19 of 24 US primary fixed income dealers and processes equities for 7 of the top 10 global investment banks and, as a result, processes over $7 trillion in equity and fixed income trades per day. In the wealth management business, over 25% of US financial advisors utilize Broadridge's front-office solutions.Even though these two businesses are different, they both offer attractive features such as leading positions, multi-year contracts with a high retention rate (97%), and growth opportunities.The governance market is very resilient and highly cash generative. Indeed, competition is almost non-existent and proxies are held on a yearly basis, no matter what. Besides, the business scale is very important and, given Broadridge's scale, no one could successfully compete with them.Finally, the number of positions held by investors tends to be relatively inelastic to market conditions as highlighted by the 2% decline in total positions eligible for equity proxies during the global financial crisis. This decline was driven by a lower number of retail investors active in the financial markets (mutual fund and ETF positions continued to grow). As a result, this business offers stable recurring revenue.The business should benefit from several growth drivers going forward. First of all, Broadridge will keep increasing the penetration of e-delivery solutions. In addition, to be environmental-friendly, digital solutions are cost-effective solutions for issuers and profit-accretive for Broadridge. Indeed, issuers save money on print, paper, and postage costs and share this cost-saving with Broadridge by paying additional fees. Whereas 65%/70% of regulated communications (proxies and interims) are digital, there are still tremendous opportunities among bills and statements because most of them are still delivered under paper format.Besides, the company will leverage its core competencies in order to deliver additional services to corporate issuers. For instance, the company offers document management services as well as shareholder and channel analytics. Finally, they will target adjacent markets in which its services can be valuable. For example, the company could help utilities in its implementation from paper to digital communication.Even though more competitive, the technology and operations business provides also revenue stability. Indeed, once a solution has been developed with a client, clients tend to use it for many years. Besides, these solutions are essential in the day-to-day operations of their clients, thus clients tend to be very sticky.The profitability of financial institutions has been under pressure for years due to the low-interest rate environment and the competitive nature of the industry. As a result, many banks are restructuring their organization by focusing on their core activities, which should lead to an increase in non-core functions outsourcing. Besides, many banks have to improve their technology infrastructures in order to improve their profitability and face threats from fintechs, which is positive for the development of IT budgets. Besides, a large portion of broker-dealers still process their trades in-house. As a result, we believe that the demand for third-parties' IT outsourcing solutions should remain strong.The international partnership with Accenture (NYSE:ACN), a leading consulting firm, in which Broadridge provides the software and Accenture provides the workforce, should help Broadridge to develop internationally. The company generates only 10% of its revenues from abroad. Finally, the development and the growth of the wealth management franchise should be supported by the desire of financial institutions to develop their fee business. Indeed, the wealth management business is ROE accretive as it requires very low capital, and several banks have allocated more resources to this business in the last couple of years.In addition to revenue growth, the margin should continue to expand. First of all, a large part of the business is highly scalable and does not require a lot of investments. Indeed, once you have the shareholders list for a company because you distribute proxy materials, distributing additional communications does not require additional resources. Besides, you can easily gather the data to provide valuable data & analytics to clients. Moreover, the transition to digital delivery is margin accretive as the company receives additional fees for similar services.In terms of valuation, the company is trading at roughly 20x earnings. Even though not cheap, we believe such valuation is justified by the strength and resilience of the business model as well as the growth profile.- A negative evolution of pricing.- A reduction in the number of companies listed.- A reduction in the number of stocks owned by investors.- Client consolidation increases the risk of clients deciding to insource trade processing functions.- Broadridge derives a significant portion of revenue from a few clients active in the same industry. The five largest clients account for 22% of total revenue (the largest client account for 6% of revenue)."

4256004,66733,2019-04-23T14:21:15-04:00,Broadridge Financial provides investor communications and technology-centric solutions to financial institutions and corporate issuers.This article focuses on Broadridge’s corporate issuer business as it is a strong player in the regulatory compliance sector that I am currently researching.Its Corporate Issuer Solutions business is a key growth area for Broadridge where it has been expanding into adjacent services with the help of targeted acquisitions.I examine the competitive landscape to determine future potential acquisition targets.,"I have been working through the regulatory compliance and communications sector in search of attractive investment opportunities and previously wrote articles on Donnelley Financial Solutions (DFIN) and Workiva (WK) found here and here. I like this sector because it has defensive qualities (i.e. even in a recession SEC filings are necessary) and revenues naturally re-occur as they follow the corporate investor communication cycle (e.g. quarterly and annual reports, proxy filings etc…). It is hard to get very far in this sector without coming across Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR). With a market cap of USD13 billion it provides solutions to corporate issuers, mutual funds, banks and broker-dealers and institutional shareholders. In this article, I am only going to focus on one area which is Broadridge’s corporate issuer business as this falls into my wider regulatory compliance sector analysis.Broadridge is the former Brokerage Services division of Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) and was spun off in 2007. Its origins go back much further to 1962 when it started processing trades for one ADP client. It began offering proxy services in 1989 and in 1994, Broadridge launched its ProxyEdge electronic proxy delivery and voting solutions offering to institutional investors. Today it operates through two main divisions, Investor Communication Solutions (80% of FY2018 revenues) and Global Technology and Operations (20% of FY2018 revenues). Broadridge has made numerous acquisitions over the years as a core part of its growth strategy and continues to do so. As shown in the slide below, by powering parts of its client’s critical infrastructure it has come to dominate many of the markets it operates in.Source: Company Dec 2017 Investor Day PresentationAn important growth area in the Investor Communication Solutions segment is providing corporate issuer clients with an end-to-end corporate governance solution that simplifies shareholder communications. Its corporate issuer services include a suite of annual meeting products such as ShareLink (proxy management) and Virtual Shareholder Meeting allowing clients to host their annual meeting on the Internet in conjunction with the physical annual meetings.Broadridge leverages its shareholder proxy processing relationships with banks and brokerage firms to provide corporates with shareholder validation and voting services and shareholder meeting attendance planning through pre-registration. Its Document Management solution deals with annual report design, digitization, SEC filing, printing and web hosting. The slide below provides an insight into the value Broadridge adds to the annual meeting process.Source: Company Dec 2017 Investor Day Presentation (Note: N&A stands for Notice & Access)Its Shareholder Data Services combines three solutions for corporate issuers: (1) a company shareholder base analytics engine, (2) targeted communications to reach niche shareholder segments, and (3) assessing the effectiveness of shareholder mailings. By using these solutions companies can understand previous patterns of shareholder participation, monitor proxy voting progress (e.g. voting thresholds) and gauge communication responsiveness.In 2017, Broadridge bought Summit Financial Disclosure to provide SEC document and filing services for transactional (capital market activity like IPOs, M&A, debt/equity offerings) and year-round SEC disclosure services including reports, proxy statements, annual reports and Section 16 reporting. Broadridge’s aim is to provide a complete solution for the entire corporate disclosure and shareholder communications lifecycle.Broadridge bought Summit Financial for an aggregate consideration of USD30.6 million. On the surface an acquisition of this size seems inconsequential in the context of Broadridge’s USD13 billion market cap. Why did Broadridge even bother? As highlighted in its 2017 Investor Day webcast, Broadridge considers its corporate issuer segment as a key overall revenue driver having grown at a historic 3-year revenue CAGR of 16%. Its issuer growth strategy involves expanding its client base and expanding into adjacent services to the ones it currently offers.Source: Company Dec 2017 Investor Day presentationThe slide above demonstrates the potential value impact of expanding into adjacencies. It is a real client example. This client started off generating about USD5,000 in beneficial proxy value for Broadridge. Broadridge used the initial relationship to cross-sell a whole range of additional services including transfer agent, shareholder data services, issuer print and document management which represents the enhancement to their offering from the Summit acquisition.Collectively, expanding into adjacencies turns a USD5,000 client into a potential USD67,000 client. If this example is extrapolated across the 5,000+ issuers Broadridge is targeting then this becomes a very large opportunity and the document management value enhancement of USD10,000, which includes Summit, is a material contributor. This explains Broadridge’s willingness to acquire even small companies operating in areas that will complement its existing offering.In the chart below, I have listed some of the main players in the corporate issuer compliance and communications industry. In addition, I estimated the relative market strength of each company’s offering in each of the main product categories. This is not an absolute representation by any means and at certain levels is really just a “best guess” on my part as many of the industry participants are private or relatively minor divisions of much larger corporations. However, despite its limitations, the chart remains a useful sector analysis tool. Broadridge is attempting to offer a complete end-to-end solution and though it is already a key player in some areas gaps remain to be filled or strengthened.Sources: Company filings and author’s estimatesTo strengthen its offering in what it calls the document management market Broadridge acquired Summit Financial. Donnelley Financial Solutions and Merrill Corp. (private) are key players in that market. In addition, Summit’s SmartRoom virtual data room service is powered by a different company, BMC Group. An acquisition, of Donnelley Financial would make Broadridge a leader in SEC filings and capital market compliance solutions. With a market cap of around USD2 billion Workiva would be quite a sizeable acquisition. However, it is a key player in the SEC filings market and is leveraging its Wdesk SaaS software to enter adjacent markets such as risk and audit management. It also has 3,340 customers and announced a printing and distribution alliance with Broadridge in December 2018.Issuer Direct would be an acquisition much closer to the size of Summit. Its product range complements Broadridge’s with the notable addition of ACCESSWIRE, a small newswire service but still a strong differentiator and value driver for Issuer Direct. In addition to the companies named above there are a whole range of private companies that focus mainly on one area. For example, in corporate filings there is: Certent, RDG Filings (Thunderdome Portal), M2 Compliance, S2 Filings and Novaworks - Gofiler/GoXBRL to name a few.Broadridge is an impressive business dominating many of the markets it serves and using its recurring revenue base to compound value. Its return on capital employed is an impressive 21%. Though Broadridge covers a broad swathe of industries, it is a significant player in the corporate issuer market and has aggressive plans to grow this segment through expanding into adjacencies and expanding its client base. It will probably continue to grow through acquisitions and there remain a number of attractive companies available in the corporate issuer compliance and communications space."

BR is an investment for the growth investor who also wants a reasonable income in the information technology sector.Broadridge Financial Solutions will be reviewed using the Good Business Portfolio Guidelines. The company has steady growth and has cash it uses to increase the dividends each year and grow the company. Right now with the market relatively high, BR is beating the market.

For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article "" The Good Business Portfolio: Update to Guidelines, August 2018"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Broadridge Financial Solutions passes 11 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guidelines, a good score (a good score is 10 or 11). These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. Broadridge Financial Solutions beats against the Dow baseline in my 49.0-month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 49.0 month test period (starting January 1, 2015, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017, and other years that had fair and bad performance. The great total return of 122.22% makes Broadridge Financial Solutions a great investment for the total return investor that also wants a steadily increasing income. BR has a slightly below average dividend yield of 1.9% and has had increases for 11 years, making BR also a good choice for the dividend growth investor. The dividend was last increased in August 2018 to $0.485/Qtr. up from $0.365/Qtr. or a 33% increase with increases expected to continue for years.DOW's 49.0 Month total return baseline is 39.41%Click to enlargeFor the last quarter on November 6, 2018, Broadridge Financial Solutions reported earnings that beat expected by $0.10 at $0.79, compared to last year at $0.54.

The slightly below average dividend income brings you cash as we continue to see further growth as the economy grows.The FED has kept interest rates low for some years, and on December 19, 2018, they raised the base rate 0.25%, which was expected. I believe that they will go slow in 2019, which should help keep the economy on a growth path. If infrastructure spending can be increased, this will even increase the United States growth going forward with better economics for the consumer. The FED lowered GDP projection for 2019 which may mean they are getting to neutral on the economy, projecting two rate increases for 2019. The recent volatility may keep the FED on hold. At the FED meeting in January, the statement was a wait and see and a bit more dovish than the last meeting.Excerpts from November 6, 2018, earnings call Richard J.

The four top companies in the portfolio are, Johnson & Johnson is 8.1% of the portfolio, Omega Health Investors (OHI) is 8.7% of the portfolio, Home Depot (HD) is 8.9% of the portfolio and Boeing is 14.8% of the portfolio. Therefore BA, OHI, JNJ, and Home Depot are now in trim position, but I am letting them run a bit since they are great companies.Boeing is going to be pressed to 14% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $316 Million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase from the fourth quarter. The first quarter earnings for 2018 were unbelievable at $3.64 compared too expected at $2.64. Farnborough Air Show sales in dollar value just beat out Air-Bus by about $6 Billion, and both companies had a great number of orders. Boeing received an order for 18 more KC-46A planes. The second quarter 2018 earnings beat expectations by $0.06 at $3.33, but a good report was hurt by a write off expense on the KC-46 which has started delivery in 2019. Two KC-46A tankers were delivered in January 2019. As a result of the good fourth-quarter earnings, S&P CFRA raised the one-year price target to $500 for a possible 32% upside potential.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line and Mr. Market did nothing. JNJ has an estimated dividend increase to $0.97/Qtr. in April 2019, which will be 57 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever; it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector remains under pressure.For the total Good Business Portfolio, please see my article on The Good Business Portfolio: 2018 3rd Quarter Earnings and Performance Review for the complete portfolio list and performance.

If you have an interest, please look for them on my list of previous articles.Of course, this is not a recommendation to buy or sell, and you should always do your own research and talk to your financial advisor before any purchase or sale.

4116608,89805,2017-10-26T00:33:42-04:00,,"Sometimes, the most boring, under-the-radar businesses prove to be the best long-term investments, and Broadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE:BR) could be one of them. In fact, Broadridge was called ""the most important firm on Wall Street that you've never heard of"" by Dick Grasso, the former CEO and chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.Paying higher dividends every year since 2007 and recording double-digit annualized dividend growth, Broadridge is a Dividend Achiever that boasts an impressive track record.Let's take a closer look at this high-quality dividend growth stock to see if the company's future remains bright and if today could be a reasonable time to consider adding to the stock to a diversified dividend portfolio.Broadridge Financial serves banks, brokerage firms, mutual funds, clearing firms, bond issuers, hedge funds, and financial advisors by handling many of their administrative but mission-critical tasks, such as shareholder record keeping, investor communications, billing, tax reporting, clearing and settling trades, and more.The company has been in business for more than 50 years, but it operated as a division of Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) until spinning out as an independent company in 2007.Broadridge operates in two segments.Investor Communication Solutions accounts for 80% of total sales. The majority of this segment processes and distributes proxy materials to investors in equity securities and mutual funds and helps with vote processing.Many public companies have thousands or even millions of shareholders, but the companies do not know who they all are because that data is held across many different brokers. It would be impractical for companies to work with all of the brokers through which their shares are held beneficially, so they turn to Broadridge to ensure that proxy materials are distributed to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported.The SEC requires public companies to reimburse brokers for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners, so Broadridge bills the public company for its proxy services using fees established by the NYSE, takes its cut, and submits to the broker its portion of the fees.Broadridge Financial dominates this market, processing over 80% of the outstanding shares in the U.S. last year (up from 70% in 2007). The company also processed over two billion investor communications through either paper or electronic channels and offers dozens of other services - prospectus fulfillment services; electronic delivery solutions for documents including trade confirmations, tax documents, and account statements; marketing communications; tax services; and much more.The Global Technology and Operations segment accounts for the remaining 20% of Broadridge Financial's sales and provides systems that support real-time processing of securities transactions. Its services automate the transaction lifecycle of trading operations, from order capture and execution through trade confirmation, settlement, custody, and accounting. Essentially, Broadridge allows brokers to avoid building out costly infrastructure to support the basic back-end processes of electronic trading.Broadridge Financial processes over $5 trillion in equity and fixed-income trades per day of U.S. and Canadian securities, including 60% of U.S. fixed-income trades and providing services to 18 of the 23 primary dealers of fixed-income securities in the U.S.(Source: Broadridge Financial)Across both of its segments, Broadridge has made numerous bolt-on acquisitions over the years to expand its suite of services into adjacent markets, the latest being Spence Johnson, which is a leading provider of global institutional data and intelligence to the asset management industry. While most investors associate Broadridge Financial with proxy services and securities processing, the company has over 150 additional products that are increasingly driving incremental growth.Altogether, about 91% of Broadridge Financial's total revenue is recurring, and the company regularly achieves a client revenue retention rate in excess of 98%. From a geographical perspective, over 80% of its income is generated in the U.S.With 91% of its sales recurring and a client retention rate of 98% (100% of Broadridge Financial's associates have a bonus tied to customer satisfaction), the company has one of the sturdiest business models you can find. Serving the financial services area comes with some extra regulatory risk, but the benefits the industry offers have far outweighed them so far.Financial services firms demand accuracy, reliability, and security. All shareholders must have the opportunity to vote their proxy form. All trades must be fairly settled and accounted for. All account statements need to be correct for tax purposes. All data contains extremely sensitive personal information and must be kept private. You get the point - these tasks are mundane, complex, and well outside of financial services firms' core operations, but each is mission-critical.Broadridge Financial has spent approximately $2 billion the last decade to broaden its product lineup and enhance technical offerings. The company continues to invest several hundred million dollars in technology each year and, in some cases, has spent over 50 years perfecting the features available in its products.The company now has a dominant market share in a number of its products, represents a relatively small proportion of clients' overall operating expenses, and, most importantly, has earned their trust. It's not worth switching to another vendor for many of these reasons alone.To reinforce the importance of Broadridge Financial's services to the financial industry, consider its securities processing business. After the financial crisis, the Fed agreed that Broadridge's processing platform would serve as the industry's ""too big to fail"" platform.MF Global provides another example of Broadridge Financial's importance. MF Global was not a client, but after the firm went under in 2011, its customer positions were moved to Broadridge's platform to unwind the transactions so that the industry could have the reliability of a known processor.From a growth perspective, it is easy to assume Broadridge Financial's prospects are more limited given the mature state of the proxy processing market and the company's substantial market share.While this is partially true, it is looking in the rear-view mirror where Broadridge came from, not where it is going. In the last three years, company management had a target to grow recurring revenue (91% of total revenues) at a 7-10% annual rate, while compounding earnings at a 9-11% annual clip. The company has achieved annualized revenue and earnings growth of 14% and 11%, respectively, over that period.Broadridge Financial recorded about $4.1 billion in revenue last fiscal year itself, representing a little over 17% of its $24 billion addressable market. Roughly $16 billion of the opportunity is in its Global Technology & Operations segment, where it generated over $800 million in sales last year. This large addressable market presents a long runway for growth propelled by key market trends of digitization, mutualization, and data & analytics.The company has deployed $539 million on acquisitions so far, extending its reach into adjacent products and markets that can continue developing into sizeable revenue drivers over time. As Broadridge Financial continues executing in these newer areas, higher-margin recurring fee revenue will become a larger part of overall mix and make the company less reliant on market-based activity.This is already playing out when you look at the composition of Broadridge Financial's incremental recurring revenue sales. The proportion of these closed sales that come from its Emerging and Acquired products increased by 25% in fiscal year 2017, for example. Broadridge's strong brand and trust in the market provide a competitive advantage to allow it to more easily expand its wallet share with existing and new clients.Data and analytics are newer areas that Broadridge Financial is leveraging to achieve higher-margin, long-term growth opportunities. Revenue from data and analytics, which is a potentially overlooked area by investors, could serve as a very nice tailwind for the business.Broadridge Financial's existing businesses provide the company with some very unique data assets - for example, it has data on every beneficial equity position for over 140 million investors.The company also acquired the fiduciary services and competitive intelligence unit of Thomson Reuters Lipper (now known as Broadridge Fund Information Services) in 2015. When combined with Broadridge Financial's existing market intelligence and compliance solutions, the company can now provide a comprehensive view of fund flows across the globe, helping guide product development and marketing and distribution to funds' boards of directors in support of their regulatory obligations.The company is improving its technology platform and now runs a back office trade processing utility for more than 30 clients in the financial services industry.It is also investing in new product development areas like blockchain and tax reporting. For example, in 2016 Broadridge acquired the technology assets of Inveshare to develop blockchain applications for its proxy business, and it also recently completed a blockchain pilot for the bilateral repo market.Finally, as more communications move digital, Broadridge Financial should enjoy higher margins and additional business opportunities.From a profit growth perspective, digital communications are much less costly to implement than purchasing the materials and postage needed for direct mail campaigns. Digital communication allows for a much greater collection of data as well, allowing Broadridge to enhance its data analytics tools to help firms better prepare for and execute the proxy process and more effectively communicate with their shareholders outside the proxy process.Opportunities can open up outside of financial services as well - take a look at the company's new digital communications product Inlet, for example.Despite Broadridge's numerous competitive advantages and opportunities for long-term growth, there are several risks to be aware of.Regulatory changes and technological shifts seem to pose the most risk to Broadridge Financial's business.First, the fees the company collects for its proxy services are predetermined by the NYSE and SEC. Should a change in rules occur, Broadridge's business could be adversely impacted.However, any changes generally take years to be decided upon, and the SEC recently approved rule changes in January 2014, outlining the reimbursements broker-dealers and custodian banks receive for the work they perform in connection with forwarding proxy communications to their client accounts. Ultimately, the NYSE estimated that the new fee schedule would reduce issuers' costs by 4%.Fortunately, Broadridge's business has continued to perform just fine so far, growing sales by 5%, 8%, and 43%, respectively, over the past three years. Another fee ruling seems unlikely for at least a few more years, if not much longer (prior to the 2014 change, the fee structure was untouched since 2002).Beyond proxy fees, the SEC can propose other rules that could change different elements of Broadridge Financial's business. For example, in 2015, the SEC also proposed rules to require mutual funds to make new filings and to provide the option of mailing a notice of a fund report's availability on a website instead of physically mailing a complete report to those investors that have not enrolled in e-delivery. However, the rule did not lead any changes to the report distribution method when passed.Having said that, Broadridge not only has the experience of successfully implementing regulatory changes, but is also investing heavily in digital offerings and platforms. The company is well equipped to launch products and solutions for almost any regulatory change. For example, it recently launched a trade reporting solution for the European Securities and Markets Authority's (ESMA) forthcoming Securities Financing Transaction Regulation.Technology trends are driving regulatory and business changes as well. In addition to the proxy distribution fee changes previously discussed, the SEC passed guidelines supporting the use by institutions of an Enhanced Broker Internet Platform (EBIP).EBIPs would build on individual shareholders' reliance on brokers' websites as their primary source for information by also allowing shareholders to vote their positions on those sites. The goal is to utilize more technology in order to increase voter participation and streamline the proxy voting process. As you might have guessed, Broadridge Financial is already leading the way in this transition with its Investor Mailbox EBIP solution, entitling the company to earn additional fees for the new customers going digital.Looking at the bigger picture, it seems clear that digital technologies will reduce print communications, open up new content channels, and transform all types of investor communications - from proxy and regulatory documents to marketing materials and customer account statements. Over $20 billion is spent on paper and postage in financial services, so there is a long runway for this transformation to play out.Broadridge Financial has invested in digital technologies for many years to protect and grow its business. As fewer bulky forms go through the mail, Broadridge's gross margins and free cash flow should continue improving, since it no longer needs to deal with as many postal costs. This profitable transition is already taking effect in some instances, with gross margins improving from 25.7% in 2007 to 32.1% in FY'16, while traditional distribution revenues declined over that same time period.Broadridge's R&D efforts are also taking advantage of digital technology to drive future growth. Inlet is a digital document distribution solution that allows for financial services companies to deliver documents to their customers through the online channels their customers already use, for example.Inlet was developed in 2014 and started rolling out to the market in 2015. Over time, this product is expected to play an important role in the continued adoption of paperless delivery solutions, decreased delivery costs, and enhanced customer loyalty. If successful, it could meaningfully expand Broadridge's reach outside of the financial services vertical.Beyond Inlet, the company is also investing in a number of digital technologies to make content more engaging and interactive. As a result of its efforts, Broadridge reported an increase in e-delivery from 19% in 2010 to 46% in 2016, with 24% cost savings since 2010.Finally, many investors wonder about what impact, if any, the health of the stock market has on the company's business. Fortunately, Broadridge Financial has a low correlation with the stock market's direction (sales fell just 3% in fiscal year 2009). Its sales volume is more related to overall transactions, processing needs, and trading volume.We analyze 25+ years of dividend data and 10+ years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend.Our Dividend Safety Score answers the question, ""Is the current dividend payment safe?"" We look at some of the most important financial factors, such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more.Dividend Safety Scores range from 0 to 100, and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least 60. Since tracking the data, companies cutting their dividends had an average Dividend Safety Score below 20 at the time of their dividend reduction announcements.We wrote a detailed analysis reviewing how Dividend Safety Scores are calculated, what their real-time track record has been, and how to use them for your portfolio here.Broadridge Financial has a Dividend Safety Score of 83, a strong ranking that suggests its dividend is safer than most other companies'. With rock-solid client retention rates, almost all recurring revenue, and a very strong market position, Broadridge's high score doesn't come as a big surprise.Over the trailing twelve months, the company's dividend has consumed 50% of its earnings and 41% of its free cash flow. For a business as stable as Broadridge's, these payout ratios are excellent and provide plenty of room for continued dividend growth.Going forward, Broadridge Financial expects to maintain an EPS payout ratio of at least 45%, which provides plenty of cushion to support the dividend.For dividend companies with enough operating history, it's always a prudent exercise to observe how their businesses performed during the financial crisis.Broadridge Financial's reported sales were down just 3% in fiscal year 2009, and earnings actually grew. Despite serving clients in the financial services industry, most of its products are mission-critical and don't depend on the market's direction.High-quality companies are able to generate cash flow year in and year out. Rising cash flow is very important because it supports continued dividend growth without expanding the payout ratio.Broadridge's business model has very low capital intensity (capital expenditure as a percentage of sales is typically below 2%), throwing off plenty of cash each year and recording solid growth over the last five years to pay a steadily growing dividend:While payout ratios, industry cyclicality, free cash flow generation, and business performance during the recession provide a better sense of a dividend's safety, the balance sheet is an extremely important indicator as well. Companies will also meet their debt obligations before paying dividends.As seen below, Broadridge Financial's long-term debt-to-capital ratio has remained fairly steady over the last decade, generally hovering between 30% and 40%, which is quite reasonable.However, it recently increased to more than 50% after its handful of acquisitions. Fortunately, none of the company's long-term debt is due before September 2020, and Broadridge's strong recurring cash flows suggest that the company's increased debt won't pose any challenges to the company's operations or dividend payments.Overall, its dividend appears to be very safe. The company's payout ratios are low, its business is very predictable and throws off tons of cash, and the balance sheet is healthy.The company has delivered excellent dividend growth for shareholders since it started making payouts in 2007.In fact, Broadridge Financial has increased its dividend each year since spinning off from ADP in 2007 (ten straight years), and most recently raised its dividend by 11%, marking the sixth consecutive double-digit increase.Broadridge's dividend has grown at a 15% compound annual growth rate over the past five fiscal years and appears to have solid potential to continue growing at a low-double digit rate going forward, thanks to the company's relatively low payout ratio, solid business stability, and numerous opportunities for long-term earnings growth.Shares of BR trade at a forward P/E ratio of 23, which is a significant premium to the S&P 500's forward P/E ratio of 17.9, as well as the tech sector's 18.8 multiple.Investors are clearly acknowledging Broadridge Financial's resilient business model (91% recurring revenue, 98% client retention rate), very healthy free cash flow generation, and opportunities for continued earnings growth going forward.From a dividend yield perspective, BR's 1.7% yield is meaningfully below its five-year average dividend yield of 2.1%.From a P/E ratio and dividend yield perspective, shares of BR do not appear to be a bargain today.However, should the company continue generating double-digit annual earnings growth over the coming years, Broadridge will quickly grow into its premium multiple and offer double-digit total return potential (1.7% dividend yield plus 9-11% annual earnings growth = 10.7-12.7% annual returns).Broadridge Financial possesses many of the traits of an excellent business - low capital intensity, high returns on capital, a long runway for growth in adjacent products and markets, limited competition, high switching costs, dominant market share, and more.While it faces higher regulatory and technological risks than some other companies, its core competitive advantages and the generally favorable industry themes playing out (e.g., digitalization, data & analytics) seem to far outweigh any concerns.Broadridge Financial's current valuation doesn't look cheap, but it rarely will given the extremely high quality and stability of the business (91% recurring revenue; 98% client retention rate). Broadridge Financial is a company worth watching for any type of meaningful pullback and a wonderful business to continue holding for existing shareholders.Investors seeking more yield should review the best high dividend stocks list here."

Are you too late to the party?","If there is one thing I like about working in the investing field is that I discover new companies each week. Sometimes, I’m shocked to find such a stellar business like Broadridge Finance (NYSE:BR). How could this marvel have slipped through my screeners over the past 5 years? One thing is for sure, if you have picked some shares of this beauty, you are smiling right now.Source: YchartsNow that BR has jumped by more than 350% in the past 5 years, is there more growth to come? And most importantly, how can this anonymous company have reached those levels? Let’s see what BR has under its hood.Broadridge began as the brokerage services division of ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) in 1962. It was spun-off in 2007… right before the financial crisis. Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. provides investor communications & technology-driven solutions to banks, broker-dealers and corporate issuers. Its services include investor & customer communications, securities processing, and data & analytics solutions. In other words, the company offers to financiers to take care of their boring stuff for them.In a world where data (management, analysis and storage) is everything, BR plays a crucial role for many businesses. For example, it is BR’s job to make sure that proxy materials are distributed to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported. In fact, BR handles millions of trades a day and supports communication that reaches 75% of North American households and manages shareholder voting in 90 countries.Source: BR investors’ presentationSource: YchartsIt is not a coincidence that BR stock price surged over the past 5 years. It is because it shows an impressive basket of growth vectors. First, this is the type of business that grows naturally. Financial documents handling just naturally increase as governance issues rise. BR has built its business model around the right idea, recurring fees. Once a client is tied to BR and its services, it keeps paying on a regular basis to insure BR's continuing support. Recurring fees now represent 59% of their revenue and it grows at a very strong rate:Source: BR investors’ presentationSecond, the demand is also growing naturally. In their latest investors presentations, BR presented that projected global IT and Operations spending should reach $143 billion by 2020. Out of this business, Broadridge will aim at a $25-40 billion market.Third, Broadridge support its clients to move towards cloud-based solutions. The cloud is definitely the new buzzword among tech stocks. As many clients need a cloud-based platform to manage their data, BR will act as a facilitator and offer them solutions to their needs.Since its IPO in 2007, BR has increased its payout each year. This makes it part of the elite Dividend Achievers list. The Dividend Achievers Index refers to all public companies that have successfully increased their dividend payments for at least 10 consecutive years. At the time of writing this article, there were 265 companies that achieved this milestone. You can get the complete list of Dividend Achievers with comprehensive metrics here.Source: YchartsOn top of showing 11 consecutive years of dividend increase, BR shows a total dividend increase of 508% for an impressive 17.83% CAGR. This is what we call a super-powered dividend growth stock. As the stock surged by over 350% in the past 5 years, BR’s yield dropped from an acceptable 2.50%-2.80% yield to 1.33% You can’t really blame BR for being a low yielder.Source: YchartsThe beauty in this story is that BR still shows a payout ratio that is well under control. Therefore, shareholders should expect another round of double-digit dividend growth for the next 10 years. BR meets my 7 dividend growth principles.As I started, I could mention 350 reasons that the stock could drop. Companies showing such a strong uptrend in such a short period of time could end-up being catastrophic during a market sell-off. This is even worse when the company is directly linked to the financial industry. The need to handle financial data will remain tough. Therefore, I’m more concerned about catching this great company at a high price than seeing its business model collapse.BR could also suffer from any regulations change. We all know that the SEC could be active to protect investors and the market. While BR has plenty of experience in dealing with those changes, we can’t assess the cost and impact of future regulations.While BR shows strong earnings growth, we are facing a classic case of P/E expansion. The stock used to trade well under 10 times its profit upon the spin-off. Today, we are looking at a 12-month forward P/E of 26. Unfortunately, it may be too late to pick-up some shares.Source: YchartsHowever, when I use the dividend discount model to find its fair value, I don’t get a catastrophic scenario. Yet, there is no value in picking shares close to $110.Please read the Dividend Discount Model limitations to fully understand my calculations.BR's fair value should be around $100. I bet that if you are patient enough, you’ll be able to have a better deal.What I like the most about Broadridge is its growing recurring revenues. This is the type of business that will keep generating more money quarter after quarter. Unfortunately, I am late for the party and for this reason, I will not buy shares of this great Achiever.

(NYSE:BR) is a globally focused company providing investor communications and technology-driven solutions for the financial services industry.The company has a sound business model that ensures its revenue stream even during periods of economic weakness. Management has plans to actively pursue new markets and has made significant inroads into the wealth management industry. Broadridge has a solid history of growth and is heavily focused on organic growth.The company's stock price has increased significantly over the last decade and has pulled back in recent months along with the broader market indices. The stock is still expensive, but many growth stocks are expensive as investors are happy to pay for future growth.Given the company's strong growth and sound business model, I think that the stock price will continue to make new highs over the long-term.Broadridge has reported financial results for the third quarter of 2018 (data from Seeking Alpha and Morningstar).Earnings were up 51 percent and revenue up 5.2 percent from the third quarter of 2017. Historically, from 2014 to 2018, Broadridge's revenue has grown 14 percent per year, and its earnings also increased by 14 percent per year.The return on equity is very high at 40 percent, and the profit margin (profit to revenue ratio) is reasonable at 10 percent.The total ratio (total liabilities to total assets) is 65 percent, which means that Broadridge's total debt is 65 percent of the value of everything the company owns (note that the asset value is the book value and not the liquidated value of its assets).The company's book value is currently around $11 and with a stock price of $101, Broadridge is trading at 9.2x book value.The analysts' consensus forecast for 2020 is $4.7 billion in revenue and earnings of $5.13 per share (up 5 percent and 10 percent respectively). The 2020 PE ratio is 20x.The financials indicate that Broadridge is a company in strong financial health; however, analysts are expecting the company's growth to slow through 2020.According to Broadridge's press release, the company sees significant growth in the wealth management market to bolster its future growth. The report stated that Broadridge has signed an agreement with the world's largest wealth manager UBS, which marks a significant milestone in the development of its wealth management franchise.Many growth companies tend to focus heavily on acquisitions to generate growth and that's fair enough. After all, as investors, we need a company to increase in size if we want the stock price increase over the long-term, but it's a nice to see a company that is focused on generating organic growth by pursuing new markets and expanding existing markets using its own resources.Broadridge's main source of revenue is from its investor communications business, which provides public companies with proxy statements, annual reports and other financial documents, and shareholder communications solutions, such as virtual annual meetings.As such its future revenue stream is dependent on the structure of businesses - such as public companies which must meet regulatory requirements for their governance. Private companies do not have any governance requirements.Thus Broadridge's revenue growth is tied to the increase in companies listing on stock exchanges around the globe. As the population and economy expands, more companies tend to form and list on stock exchanges.If in the future the trend shifts away from companies listing on stock exchanges and instead remaining private companies (which do not require the services of investor communications companies), then this will adversely impact Broadridge's earnings.Broadridge ensures its future revenue by signing agreements with the public companies it services. This helps ensure that these public companies continue to use Broadridge's services rather than attempting to conduct these services on their own in an attempt to reduce corporate governance costs.In an expanding global economy, even if the proportion of public companies to private companies remains constant, over the long-term, Broadridge should at least manage to continue increasing its earnings in line with the increase in the number of globally listed public companies.In the short-term, an economic recession will likely see the demand for Broadridge's services stagnate. During times of economic weakness, there's a tendency for private companies looking to list publicly to hold off until the economy recovers.From the private companies' perspective, this is fair enough. As economic weakness naturally results in stock prices falling, if these companies list, then the share price obtainable from an IPO (initial public offering) can be considerably less than the stock price obtained if listed while the economy is strong and stock prices are high.Again, the problem to Broadridge is that there are virtually no new companies listing while the economy is weak and thereby no growth in revenue.Fortunately for BR, its existing customer base is tied in with signed agreements, thus ensuring a revenue source during periods of economic weakness. This will provide some buffering to its earnings should the economy weaken.Based on its financials, Broadridge has a solid history of growth stock with lower growth expected in 2020. An appropriate valuation technique for growth companies is the PEG (PE divided by the earnings growth rate).The historical earnings growth using reported data from 2014 to 2018 is 14 percent per year, and the forward annual earnings growth using forecast data is 10 percent for 2020.Given that earnings growth may be slowing, using the lower 2020 annual earnings growth of 10 percent will lead to a more conservative valuation, and this lower growth rate is more likely to be sustained into the future. This gives a forward PEG of 2.0 with a 2020 PE of 20x.A forward PEG of 2.0 means that Broadridge is overvalued with a current stock price of $100.80. It is commonly accepted that a stock is fairly valued when its forward PEG is 1.0, which gives Broadridge a fair value stock price of around $50.While a forward PEG of 2.0 is high, most growth stocks do have high forward PEG ratios.As an active investor, I personally like to determine some likely price targets. This gives me a feel for how high the stock price could go in the short-term and how soon it could get there.Broadridge chart by StockCharts.comExamining the stock chart reveals that Broadridge has had a stellar run-up over the last decade and recently pulled back.Should the stock resume its rally, in the short-term, the likely price target would be the 2018 high of $138. Over the longer term, the stock could trade well past the 2018 high and may well do so as long as the company's earnings continue to grow.The stock has run up strongly over the last decade and pulled back with most of this coinciding with the broader market indices having pulled back from their highs in recent months.Broadridge's stock price faces several risks:Over the longer term, I would expect the stock price to continue higher. I believe this to be the case as Broadridge's earnings growth is expected to continue well into the future.Broadridge is an expanding company that has a sound business model and is well positioned to continue its growth into the future.While the earnings growth may be less heading into 2020, the company is actively seeking out new markets to bolster its future growth.Broadridge is still overvalued even with the lowered growth rate for 2020, but many growth stocks are expensive.Investors who are concerned that the stock price may have topped out can consider utilizing stop-loss techniques. For the buy-and-hold investors, I personally think that over the long-term, Broadridge's stock price will continue heading upwards in line with its future earnings growth potential."
4246279,22201,2019-03-04T17:42:51-05:00,"Despite being a $11 billion market cap firm that has clobbered the market, most investors aren't aware of Broadridge.That's even despite you using its services as an investor.The stock is surprisingly cheap compared to its closest peers.The recent 25% pullback creates a significant buying opportunity.Broadridge is a compelling dividend growth stock with a 19% 10-year CAGR dividend growth rate and a 33% hike this past year.","Looking for a backdoor Dividend Aristocrat that has put up 4x the returns of the S&P 500 over the past decade and which has a remarkably stable low-risk business? Meet Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR).Broadridge has been an operating entity for more than 50 years, as it started processing brokerage transactions in 1962. Over the years, it grew as a financial services division within Automatic Data Processing (ADP). ADP spun off Broadridge in 2007, setting up what's been a tremendous opportunity for investors:Data by YChartsIn the 1980s, Broadridge started with its proxy services - that is, helping shareholders participate in corporate democracy. This would become its primary line of business over time.In 1994, the company launched its ProxyEdge digital service for this category. By 1999, Broadridge had established a 90% market share within the field of proxy services. That number has only continued to grow over the years, as it now has 95% share and a 98% client retention rate:Source: Corporate WebsiteLooking past just the proxy business, Broadridge keeps expanding its business by picking up more and more back-office business for brokerage firms. As one Forbes columnist put it:This is a great sort of business to be in, as it is mission-critical but not a major cost center. Compared to the amount of revenues that brokerages generate, these sorts of clerical functions constitute a small part of overall expense but are vital to get right. This is a category of business where you can establish a large moat. Changing to a different service provider is unlikely to save enough money to offset the risk of reputation-damaging errors if these back-office functions stop working seamlessly.Notably, more broadly outside of just the proxy market, most investment banks still handle much of these operations on their own. While Broadridge is the industry leader among third-party service providers, most of the market is still left to be taken as banks are still shifting away from handling these operations themselves.Data by YChartsIn recent years, Broadridge stock has traded steadily higher. However, 2018 finally represented a break in the trading pattern, with the stock losing a quarter of its value from peak to trough in the fall of last year. Some of that was due to market volatility, to be sure. However, BR stock hasn't bounced back strongly with the rest of the market so far in 2019; shares dipped again in February following the company's most recent earnings report.That is a mistake, however. Just read what CEO Tim Gokey had to say in discussing the most recent quarter on the latest conference call:This is a classic example of looking at headline numbers versus details. The headline numbers for this most recent quarter seem bad at first glance. Revenues dropped more than 5% year-over-year along with EPS missing analyst expectations. However, this sort of thing can happen with a growth stock that has an unusually good quarter or year. In Broadridge's case, there was unusually strong proxy activity related to a few high-profile corporate activism battles in the prior year.Analysts tend to model out that unusually strong growth as though it will continue for a time, the stock experiences an exponential spike - see Broadridge's 40% run in the first half of 2018 - and then there is a letdown when the company returns to its more standard long-term growth rate.Once you get past the event-driven revenues from 2018, you see record new recurring sales and a healthy 7% growth rate along with 2019 guidance being maintained despite the apparent earnings miss. It's noteworthy that 2019 guidance was established in late 2017, and the company is sticking with it. The whole rally and then big correction in Broadridge stock last year occurred while the business' fundamentals remained the same. Thus, for anyone that looked at the stock last year and wanted to buy into its compelling story, the time to actually make your investment would be now.It'd be tempting to suggest that Broadridge will not deliver compelling returns going forward, even though it (and its corporate parent ADP) has consistently topped the market. After all, how much further room is there for growth in proxy services? The company already owns virtually all of the U.S. market and most of the overseas ones within its leading niche. Growth is unlikely to be particularly fast, especially as the number of listed public companies (in the U.S. at least) is shrinking.However, there are two issues with that line of thinking. For one, the business will be stable, and likely to at least match the inflation rate. That, for a capital-light business, is still fine. The company doesn't have to invest much to keep its proxy business humming along, thus it throws off a ton of free cash flow for buybacks, dividends, and acquisitions. Companies will still need to have shareholder votes, and as long as Broadridge essentially has a monopoly there, there will be plenty of free cash flow for shareholders.Additionally, Broadridge is acquiring other financial service providers at a rapid clip. This is allowing it to move into more SaaS applications in various fields related to back office, mutual fund disclosures, and software solutions for wealth management among other applications. Arguably, the most exciting of this is Broadridge's efforts to make a software solution to automate much of the clerical work within the brokerage industry. The CEO described this on the latest conference call:At this point, it's hard to handicap how much of the market Broadridge will end up controlling. However, UBS is a highly credible client, and Broadridge is making acquisitions left and right to shore up its capacities in this area. This line of product offerings, if even moderately successful, can create many years of aggressive revenue growth.The most important risk, at least as a long-term investor, is whether this business can be disrupted or not. There are always threats, from the technological end (remember blockchain enthusiasm?) through to the mundane, such as the SEC changing the amount of fees that Broadridge is allowed to charge for some of its services.However, within the core proxy market, Broadridge seems to face a low level of business disruption risk anytime soon. Its service is indispensable to clients, doesn't have much direct cost to any particular customer, and there is little in the way of meaningful competition. On the wealth management side, there is clearly more competition, but Broadridge is a much smaller piece of the overall market, offering more upside as well. Additionally, Broadridge's ability to make numerous value-adding acquisitions over the years speaks well of its capacity to build this business out successfully.To be clear, there is the risk that the company makes bad acquisitions and/or runs out of things to buy. Since 2014, according to the 10-K, the company has made at least 17 different deals to bring in new operating firms or assets from other companies. This is a high rate of deal-making. It must be said that most of these acquisitions are not particularly large in comparison with the core Broadridge proxy business. However, the usual disclaimer that comes with roll-up businesses having more operating and accounting risk should probably apply here as well.One thing you don't have to worry about with this, unlikely most financials stocks, is a deep recession. Part of what makes Broadridge compelling is that it was close to immune to the Great Financial Crisis. In 2009, it reported revenues which declined just 3% while earnings only fell 5%. Even when times are tough, companies still have to communicate with their shareholders and effectively manage their back-office needs. This spending is difficult to cut, even during a depression within the financial services industry.Thus, when looking at Broadridge stock, realize that you're getting the upside of financial services companies without the jarring downside risk if the stock market collapses again. Since the company's results aren't closely linked to returns, AUM, or other market-sensitive metrics, it is one of the most defensive options you can find that still gives you significant exposure to the growing lucrative FinTech market.The problem with BR stock, at least for a lot of people, is that it always looks expensive. Even with the drop from $130 to $90 late last year, the stock only gave back a year's worth of gains. It is selling just under 20x forward earnings now, assuming the company earns $5.10 in 2019.That said, I see 20 as a completely reasonable, if not slightly cheap P/E ratio for this sort of business. As Intrinsic Investing noted, businesses in this field tend to trade at a high 20s P/E ratio:You are unlikely to find many tech businesses that sell for less than 20x earnings which generate huge free cash flow, and that are more than 90% recurring revenue-based with nearly no customer losses on a year-to-year basis.The company's capital allocation is also compelling. It sets, as a threshold, a 20% return on its capital from new acquisitions, running far ahead of what we investors can obtain on our money in most other places. It generously shares the rest of the capital it doesn't reinvest in the business back with us.To start with, while the share buyback is substantially slower than in the financial crisis days, it is ongoing. Since 2012, Broadridge has shrunk its share count more than 5%, and continues buying back around 1% of the float each year. That's not a huge value driver, but it does incrementally help with earnings.The more attractive capital return lever is the dividend. Now Broadridge is not a Dividend Aristocrat, as it was spun off in 2007, thus giving it just 12 years as a standalone operation. However, the company that spun it off, ADP, has been a long-standing Dividend Aristocrat with 44 years in a row of dividend hikes. Broadridge, for what it's worth, has also increased its dividend every year in a row since its public debut. Thus, I'd consider Broadridge to essentially be a Dividend Aristocrat, as it was birthed by one, and has carried on with the same consistency as its previous operator.Broadridge's dividend has quintupled since the financial crisis. In 2018 alone, the company hiked its dividend by 33%. Combine that with the recent share price decline, and BR stock's yield is up from the low 1% range to 1.9% now. Of course, a 1.9% dividend yield today isn't going to be a huge income source - but it is quite nice coming from a company with a consistent history of double-digit EPS growth and dividend increases. As a long-term growth and income play, Broadridge is a solid pick at present prices.Just 12% annualized earnings growth - well below the company's 17% pace over the past five years - gets us to $10 in earnings in 2025, or a 10x P/E ratio at today's price. Figure the company doubles the dividend again in conjunction with earnings to maintain a steady payout ratio, and you have a 4% yield on cost as well.While there could certainly be a cheaper price ahead for Broadridge stock in the near term, over the long haul, it's hard to see much risk of permanent capital impairment. The company's core proxy business isn't going anywhere anytime soon. And given the attractive cash flow it throws off, there will be plenty of money for more dividends and buybacks going forward. Even in 2009, a most terrible year for Wall Street, Broadridge's results were nearly flat.And on the upside, the wealth management operation and other new services represent significant drivers of further growth going forward. I don't have a firm forecast on how much additional value Broadridge will be able to create here. But with the core business so healthy, this represents a significant further option that could supercharge returns. With double-digit earnings growth ahead, starting at a 20x forward PE ratio, it's easy to see a path to sustained 12-15% total annual compounded returns on the stock as well."

It is delivered for 12 institutional market sectors.Spence Johnson’s clients are a veritable ‘who’s who’ of asset management firms and include the following:(Source: Spence Johnson)Acquisition Terms and RationaleNeither company provided details on the acquisition price or terms, and Broadridge did not file an 8-K or indicate any change in financial guidance or effect on its financial condition, so the acquisition amount appears to be not material to its financial condition.Broadridge has acquired Spence Johnson as part of an initiative to expand its capabilities in research and consultancy as an adjunct to its historical focus on investor communications and securities transaction processing for the asset management industry.While Spence Johnson is a relatively small firm in terms of size, it has an impressive client base. Many of its top tier clients are no doubt clients of the much larger Broadridge, but there will be cross-selling opportunities.The deal represents Broadridge’s effort to provide its clients with a more ‘holistic global market view enabling identification and analysis of growth opportunities.’As Broadridge stated in the deal announcement,As data becomes more central to the investing and allocation functions of asset management firms, the move by Broadridge to further develop its expertise and offerings in the area of data analysis is critical to accessing the more valuable parts of the relationship with asset managers.Processing transactions and investor communications are certainly the bread and butter of BR’s business, but management is smart to begin moving ‘up the value chain’ to offer more value-add services such as analytics and consultancy.I view the deal as a definite positive for Broadridge as it seeks to provide a deeper set of capabilities to prospects and its existing customer base.I write about M&A deals, public companies that invest in technology startups and IPOs.

4073028,102551,2017-05-14T02:51:09-04:00,"Broadridge Financial continues to grow its business and the NACC acquisition made in mid 2016 is already making significant contributions.Adjusted net earnings increased 11% to $0.174B of the current FY compared to $0.156B for the prior year period (9 months).Diluted EPS increased 2% to $1.15 compared to $1.13 for the prior year period (9 months).Adjusted EPS increased 12% to $1.43 from $1.28 for the prior year period (9 months).Trends in Capital Markets, Wealth Management, Asset Management, and Corporate Issuers present significant long-term growth opportunities for BR.","IntroductionThis is a follow up to my February 9, 2017 Broadridge Financial (NYSE: BR) post. At the time I wrote that post, BR was trading at $68.18. This price was very similar to the price I had paid in August 2016 to acquire additional BR shares; BR is currently trading at $71.07.Should you be unfamiliar with BR, I suggest you review BR's March 14, 2017 presentation made at Barclays Emerging Payments Forum.In my February 9, 2017 post I indicated BR had acquired the North American Customer Communications (""NACC"") business of DST Systems, Inc. (NSYE: DST). Upon acquiring this business, BR renamed the NACC business ""Broadridge Customer Communications"" and integrated it into BR's Investor Communication Solutions segment. By doing so, BR created North America's premier customer communications technology platform for print and digital solutions to banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds and corporate issuers.At the time of my February post, Google Finance reflected a PE of 26.89. Generally I would hesitate to recommend a stock valued at this level but based on my analysis I concluded BR had a forward PE of sub 22 and that growth prospects supported a slightly elevated PE.BR recently released its Q3 results. I, therefore, thought it would be an opportune to revisit BR.Q3 2017 Results and Outlook for Remainder of Fiscal 2017BR released its Q3 2017 and YTD results and its forecast for the remainder of the current fiscal year on May 10, 2017; its Earnings Release can be found here.I enclose the following images from BR's Q3 2017 Earnings call with analysts since they are currently only accessible if you view the webcast and you do not have the time to do so.I also encourage you to listen to the webcast which can currently be accessed at:http://www.broadridge-ir.com/While it is 55 minutes in length, it is well worth listening to.On several occasions during the conference call, management stressed how successful the NACC acquisition has been to date. This is borne out in the dramatic growth in YTD revenue.BR continues to ""fire on all cylinders"" and is seeing strong demand for its solutions and services. There have been no new ""significant wins"" but rather ""a bunch of singles"". Furthermore, BR is not dependent on any single product for its growth. In essence, growth is well balanced.BR likes ""spin-offs"" and IPOs because this increases the size of the pool of companies requiring its services; BR has witnessed an increase in both these areas as well as dramatic growth in the number of individual investors. In essence conditions have, and continue to be, favorable for BR's growth.One thing I truly like about BR is that customer satisfaction is a key performance related metric in that all associates are tied to measurable customer satisfaction levels. In addition, over 50% of all BR associates can only earn a bonus if customer satisfaction levels increase.BR continues to focus on offering more services to clients in an industry which is extremely focused on driving costs out of the process. This puts BR in a strong position for future growth.Rather than develop products and services to dramatically help its clients drive out costs, BR is focused on ""bite sized"" enhancements to its product/service offering. Once again, I strongly encourage readers to listen to the webcast where Richard Daly (President and CEO) explains the reasoning for this approach. Should you not have time to listen to the entire webcast, you may wish to start listening at the 35 minute mark which is when the Q&A period with analysts begins.As far as BR's acquisition strategy goes, BR is presented with roughly 10 acquisition opportunities per year. Only 1 or 2, however, may meet BR's stringent acquisition criteria:BR's long-term debt has increased dramatically in the last few years as a result of its string of acquisitions and repurchase of its shares.As at its fiscal YE 2102 (page 25 of 100), LTD was $524MM, Treasury Shares was $580MM, and Goodwill and Intangible Assets was $923MM.As at March 31, 2017, LTD was $1.142B, Treasury Shares was $1.292B, and Goodwill and Intangible Assets was $1.645B.While BR's risk profile has changed within the last few years as a result of this additional debt, it continues to meet all conditions under its credit facilities. In addition, interest rates on the new debt taken on in recent years have actually come down from debt incurred within the first few years of being a stand-alone entity.I also note that FCF levels in 2012 - 2016 were $0.244B, $0.22B, $0.334B, $0.365B, and $0.362B. For the 9 months ending March 31 st 2016 and 2017, FCF amounted to $0.093B and $0.105B. BR's FCF guidance for the full FY2017 is $0.35B - $0.4B. On May 10, 2017, BR reiterated that this target remains unchanged.Given the above, I am comfortable with BR's current debt levels.ValuationAs previously noted, BR closed today at $71.07. Google Finance reflects a PE of 27.77 which implies an EPS level of $2.56. FY2016's Diluted EPS was $2.53 and management has forecast 2 - 7% growth giving us a range of $2.58 - $2.71. If we use the mid-point of this range ($2.645) then we get a PE closer to 26.9.From an Adjusted Diluted EPS perspective, BR achieved $2.73 in FY2016. Management has reiterated that it expects this metric to grow 12 - 17% in FY2017 giving us a range of $3.06 - $3.19 or a mid-point of $3.125. This is slightly lower than the mean estimate of $3.14 from 6 brokers.Source: TD WebBrokerIf I use today's closing price of $71.07 and an Adjusted Diluted EPS of $3.125 I get a 22.74 forward PE. This is slightly higher than the forward PE of 21.85 I calculated in my February 9 th post. Having said this, I do not view this new level as entirely excessive based on BR's growth potential.DividendsThe following reflects BR's dividend history for the past few years.Source: TD WebBrokerWhile the $1.32 annualized dividend works out to a sub 2% dividend yield based on the current price of $71.07, BR has the wherewithal to steadily and conservatively grow its dividend.It is not for me to tell others how to manage their investments but I notice an increasingly greater number of investors who are chasing yield. One recent post I read provided a lengthy list of US listed companies with dividend yields in excess of 5%; several companies had dividend yields in the double digits.I performed a quick review of the financial statements for at least a dozen of the companies on this list. In my opinion, investors in these companies are taking undue risk of dividend cuts or a permanent impairment to their capital.Personally, I would much rather invest in a low dividend yield company like BR where I have some level of confidence that the dividend is sustainable and there is a strong possibility of future increases on at least an annual basis.Before you completely rule out BR because of its low dividend yield you may want to read my Low or No Dividend Yield Companies Belong in Your Portfolio post.Final ThoughtsWhile definitely not ""on sale"", I continue to view BR as a ""buy"". My reasons for this recommendation are that it:In BR's May 10, 2017 conference call, the President and CEO stated that while it is imperative the business be managed with short-term objectives in mind, the company is very clearly focused on the long-term. In this regard, I suggest investors conduct their own due diligence and decide whether this is a company worthy of being held in a portfolio for several years.I have owned BR shares (not in the FFJ Portfolio) from the time BR was spun-off from ADP in 2007. I have no intention of parting ways with these shares and, at the moment, intend to acquire more shares within the next 30 days. I would also make a much larger purchase should we experience a market correction and BR gets caught in the downdraft.As at the time of writing this post I am long a few hundred shares of NYSE: BR. This holding represents ~0.4% of our overall holdings and not just the FFJ Portfolio."
3981961,96536,2016-06-14T13:27:18-04:00,"Broadridge has pulled back from 52-week highs, but remains in an uptrend.A unique competitive positioning and intriguing economic moat make BR look interesting.BR shares look expensive but might still be worth a buy.","Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (NYSE:BR) is a company you might rely on without even knowing it. In my experience, these companies that provide hidden essential services are almost always worth a closer look. Plus, with BR pulling back from all-time highs, I wanted to find out what the financial and operating metrics underpinning this growth look like.So what exactly does Broadridge do? I think their ""About us"" page really says it best:Basically, Broadridge provides a bunch of near-essential financial services to financial institutions. From what I understand, the brokerage industry would be hard-pressed to function without BR. Just look at their client retention rate and market share percentages. This unique competitive positioning makes BR a tough stock for me to ignore.But before I get too excited, I want to take a much closer look at the historical financial statements. I'm curious to learn if the appreciation in share price and dividend growth are supported by fundamentals. Or are they about to run out of steam?A Brief History of Broadridge:When looking back at historical financial statements, I always like to start with the top line. It's an unobstructed look at demand. So how does BR stack up? Here's the free data from Morningstar (source):As you can see, BR has shown very consistent growth the last 4-5 years. But prior to that, growth was a little slower. At least BR hasn't taken any steps backwards. Looking ahead, BR can continue to grow organically and through acquisition. In the near term at least, management sounds optimistic about sales performance (source).But revenue is only a small part of the picture. How do bottom line results look? See for yourself.In this case, it looks like EPS is tracking revenue, albeit a bit more dramatically. So in addition to the growing revenue, I suspect margin improvements are also driving earnings. A quick glance at the data seems to confirm. The improvement in gross margins is particularly impressive.It's not hard to imagine why BR might be a company classified as a price maker, rather than a price taker. Given they offer essential services to financial institutions across the globe, it's unlikely their customers would want to do business without them. This competitive positioning likely bestows pricing power and could allow BR to maintain margin strength.One word of caution I would like to note is that BR has been taking on more debt lately. And although working capital is a healthy $350M, check out the recent run-up in the debt/equity numbers:While I typically don't like companies taking on too much debt, I'm willing to give BR a pass so long as interest expense stays low. For now, it's only about 6% of operating income so I'm not too concerned. BR may just be opportunistic in this low interest rate environment.One other way that debt does show up in accounting sometimes is via ROE. And while the ROE numbers are good over the entire period, at a glance, the correlation between debt and ROE looks convincing. I'll be watching to see if BR can maintain this ROE level without levering up the balance sheet any further.While I'm cautious about the debt load and valuation, I think the future for BR looks pretty bright. I'll be watching for the trend in revenue and earnings to continue up and to the right. And of interest to long-term shareholders, BR does seem dedicated to returning cash to equity owners.Here's the dividend and payout ratio record:It's encouraging to see the payout ratio decreasing over the last few years, as dividends continue to grow. Given the nature of BR's business, it's conceivable that this company could end up being worthwhile as part of a dividend growth portfolio.Admittedly, the current yield is only around 1.8%, so this would be more attractive on any sustained pullback in share price. The strong earnings quality - operating cash flow is consistently higher than net income - might further indicate the dividend growth is secure. Recent comments by President and CEO Richard Daly are also encouraging (source):So given this outlook from management, the unique competitive niche and all the historical data above, is it worth buying BR?Conclusion: Broadridge is worth considerationTo be honest, I'm impressed with both the quantitative operating metrics of this business, as well as the qualitative competitive traits. If BR can continue to execute their business model and hit their growth targets, this could prove to be a fruitful investment in terms of capital return and dividends.Unfortunately, shares of BR are expensive by most metrics. And to make matters worse, they've been pricey almost without pause for the past 5 years. While I'd love to wait patiently for a pullback, I'm eager to put new money to work, rather than hoping to time the market. I'm comfortable with this as I have a long investment horizon and regular cash coming in to dollar cost average on a pullback. I appreciate not everyone would be in my circumstance.So what do you think? Is BR a company that you'd be interested to invest in? Or is it too expensive to warrant a place in your portfolio?"
3555006,89805,2015-10-06T18:09:59-04:00,"BR has been called ""the most important firm on Wall Street that you’ve never heard"" - it's services are very boring but sticky.90% of revenue is recurring, and BR's client retention rate is 97% - not so boring!The stock yields over 2% and offers solid dividend growth potential.","Dick Grasso, the former CEO and chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, called Broadridge (NYSE:BR) ""the most important firm on Wall Street that you've never heard of."" Sometimes, the most boring, under-the-radar businesses prove to be the best long-term investments. We think could be one of them and include it in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks list.Business OverviewBR serves banks, brokerage firms, mutual funds, clearing firms, bond issuers, hedge funds, and financial advisors by handling many of their administrative but mission-critical tasks such as shareholder record keeping, investor communications, billing, tax reporting, clearing and settling trades, and more. The company has been in business for more than 50 years, but it operated as a division of Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) until spinning out as an independent company in 2007.BR operates in two segments. Investor Communication Solutions accounts for 75% of total sales and 76% of operating profits. The majority of this segment processes and distributes proxy materials to investors in equity securities and mutual funds and helps with vote processing. Many public companies have thousands or even millions of shareholders, but the company does not know who they all are because that data is held across many different brokers. It would be impractical for companies to work with all of the brokers through which their shares are held beneficially, so they turn to BR to ensure that proxy materials are distributed to all beneficial owners and that their votes are accurately reported. The SEC requires public companies to reimburse brokers for the expense of distributing stockholder communications to beneficial owners, so BR bills the public company for its proxy services using fees established by the NYSE, takes its cut, and submits to the broker its portion of the fees.BR dominates this market, processing over 80% of the outstanding shares in the U.S. last year (up from 70% in 2007). The company also processed over two billion investor communications through either paper or electronic channels and offers dozens of other services - prospectus fulfilment services; electronic delivery solutions for documents including trade confirmations, tax documents, and account statements; marketing communications; tax services; and much more.The Global Technology and Operations segment accounts for the remaining 25% of BR's sales and provides systems that support real-time processing of securities transactions. Its services automate the transaction lifecycle of trading operations, from order capture and execution through trade confirmation, settlement, custody, and accounting. Essentially, BR allows brokers to avoid building out costly infrastructure to support the basic back-end processes of electronic trading.In 2014, BR processed over $5 trillion in equity and fixed income trades per day of U.S. and Canadian securities, including 60% of U.S. fixed income trades and providing services to 16 of the 22 primary dealers of fixed income securities in the U.S.Across both of its segments, BR has made numerous bolt-on acquisitions over the years to expand its suite of services into adjacent markets. While most investors associate BR with proxy services and securities processing, the company has over 150 additional products that are increasingly driving incremental growth. Altogether, about 90% of BR's total revenue is recurring, and the company regularly achieves a client revenue retention rate in excess of 97%. From a geographical perspective, over 80% of BR's income is generated in the United States.Business AnalysisWith 90% of its sales recurring and a client retention rate of 98% (100% of BR's associates have a bonus tied to customer satisfaction), BR has one of the sturdiest business models you can find. Serving the financial services area comes with some extra regulatory risk, but the benefits the industry offers have far outweighed them so far.Financial services firms demand accuracy, reliability, and security. All shareholders must have the opportunity to vote their proxy form. All trades must be fairly settled and accounted for. All account statements need to be correct for tax purposes. All data contains extremely sensitive personal information and must be kept private. You get the point - these tasks are mundane, complex, and well outside of financial services firms' core operations, but each is mission-critical. BR invests several hundred million dollars in technology each year and, in some cases, has spent over 50 years perfecting the features available in its products. The company now has a dominant market share in a number of its products, represents a relatively proportion of clients' overall operating expenses, and, most importantly, has earned their trust. It's not worth switching to another vendor for many of these reasons alone.To reinforce the importance of BR's services to the financial industry, consider its securities processing business. After the financial crisis, the Fed agreed that BR's processing platform would serve as the industry's ""too big to fail"" platform. MF Global provides an example of BR's importance. MF Global was not a client, but after the firm went under in 2011, its customer positions were moved to BR's platform to unwind the transactions so that the industry could have the reliability of a known processor.From a growth perspective, it is easy to assume BR's prospects are more limited given the mature state of the proxy processing market and the company's substantial market share. While this is partially true, it is looking in the rearview mirror where BR came from, not where it is going. Management expects the company to grow revenue at a 5-7% annual rate going forward while compounding earnings at a 9-11% annual clip. BR recorded about $2.7 billion in revenue last fiscal year, representing less than 12% of its $24 billion addressable market and presenting a long runway for growth. Roughly $16 billion of the opportunity is in BR's Global Technology & Operations segment, where it generated only $500 million in sales last year.The company has invested well over $500 million in bolt-on acquisitions since going public in 2007, extending its reach into adjacent products and markets. These growth products are building into a sizable revenue driver - growth products contributed 25% of recurring fee revenue in fiscal year 2014 compared to just 10% in fiscal year 2010. As BR continues executing in these newer areas, higher-margin recurring fee revenue will become a larger part of overall mix and make BR less reliant on market-based activity. This is already playing out when you look at the composition of BR's incremental recurring revenue sales. The proportion of these closed sales that come from BR's Emerging and Acquired products reached 50% in fiscal year 2014. We believe BR's strong brand and trust in the market provide a competitive advantage to allow it to more easily expand its wallet share with existing and new clients.Data and analytics are newer areas that provide BR with higher-margin long-term growth opportunities. We estimate data and analytics revenue of about $70 million in BR's most recent fiscal year, a small piece of the company's total sales but a potentially overlooked area by investors as we think about BR's long-term future. BR's existing businesses provide the company with some very unique data assets - for example, BR has data on every beneficial equity position for over 140 million investors. The company also recently acquired the fiduciary services and competitive intelligence unit of Thomson Reuters Lipper. When combined with BR's existing market intelligence and compliance solutions, the company can now provide a comprehensive view of fund flows across the globe, helping guide product development and marketing and distribution to fund boards of directors in support of their regulatory obligations.Finally, as more communications move digital, BR should enjoy higher margins and additional business opportunities. From a profit growth perspective, digital communications are much less costly to implement than purchasing the materials and postage needed for direct mail campaigns. Digital communication allows for much greater collection of data as well, allowing BR to enhance its data analytics tools to help firms better prepare for and execute the proxy process and more effectively communicate with their shareholders outside the proxy process. Opportunities can open up outside of financial services as well - take a look at BR's new digital communications product Inlet, for example (click here).Key RisksRegulatory changes and technological shifts seem to pose the most risk to BR's business. First, the fees BR collects for its proxy services are predetermined by the NYSE and SEC. Should a change in rules occur, BR's business could be adversely impacted. However, any changes generally take years to decide, and the SEC recently approved rule changes in January 2014, outlining the reimbursements broker dealers and custodian banks receive for the work they perform in connection with forwarding proxy communications to their client accounts. Ultimately, the NYSE estimated that the new fee schedule would reduce issuers' costs by 4%. BR's business continued to perform just fine the next year, growing sales by 5% and free cash flow by 10%. Given how recent the fee ruling was, we wouldn't anticipate another one for at least five more years (prior to the 2014 change, the fee structure was untouched since 2002).Beyond proxy fees, the SEC can propose other rules that could change different elements of BR's business. For example, the SEC recently proposed rules to require mutual funds to make new filings and to provide the option of mailing a notice of a fund report's availability on a website instead of physically mailing a complete report to those investors that have not enrolled in e-delivery. If approved, the rule would presumably reduce the revenue BR receives from mailing out massive mutual fund report documents. However, because BR's margins are higher on digital communications, the company expects the impact to be neutral to slightly positive, if the rule is approved.Technology trends are also driving regulatory and business changes. In addition to the proxy distribution fee changes previously discussed, the SEC passed guidelines supporting the use by institutions of an Enhanced Broker Internet Platform (EBIP). EBIPs would build on individual shareholders' reliance on brokers' websites as their primary source for information by also allowing shareholders to vote their positions on those sites. The goal is to utilize more technology in order to increase voter participation and streamline the proxy voting process. As you might have guessed, BR is already leading the way with this transition with its Investor Mailbox EBIP solution, entitling the company to earn additional fees for the new customers going digital.Looking bigger picture, it seems clear that digital technologies will reduce print communications, open up new content channels, and transform all types of investor communications - from proxy and regulatory documents to marketing materials and customer account statements. Over $20 billion is spent on paper and postage in financial services, so there is a long runway for this transformation to play out.BR has invested in digital technologies for many years to protect and grow its business. As fewer bulky forms go through the mail, BR's gross margins and free cash flow should continue improving since it no longer needs to deal with as many postal costs. We have already seen this start taking effect in some instances, with gross margins improving from 25.7% in 2007 to 32.1% last year while traditional distribution revenues declined over that same time period. R&D efforts are also taking advantage of digital technology to drive future growth. Inlet is a digital document distribution solution that allows for financial services companies to deliver documents to their customers through the online channels their customers already use. Inlet was developed in 2014 and started rolling out to the market in 2015. Over time, this product is expected to play an important role in the continued adoption of paperless delivery solutions, decreased delivery costs, and enhanced customer loyalty. If successful, we believe Inlet could meaningfully expand BR's reach outside of the financial services vertical.Finally, many investors wonder about the impact, if any, the health of the stock market has on BR's business. Fortunately, BR has a low correlation with the stock market's direction (sales fell just 3% in fiscal year 2009). Its sales volume is more related to overall transactions, processing needs, and trading volume.Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25+ years of dividend data and 10+ years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend. BR's long-term dividend and fundamental data charts can all be seen here and support the following analysis.Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question, ""Is the current dividend payment safe?"" We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.BR scored a Safety Score of 73, a very strong ranking that suggests BR's dividend is safer than 73% of all other dividend stocks. With rock solid client retention rates, almost all recurring revenue, and a very strong market position, BR's high score doesn't come as a big surprise.Over the trailing twelve months, BR's dividend has consumed 48% of its GAAP earnings and 36% of its free cash flow. For a business as stable as BR's, these payout ratios are excellent and provide plenty of room for continued dividend growth.Looking at longer-term trends in payout ratios can be even more helpful. Our dividend tools let you view a stock's EPS and free cash flow payout ratios over the last decade. As seen below, BR's payout ratios have remained pretty stable, generally between 30% and 40%. Going forward, BR expects to maintain an EPS payout ratio of at least 45%.Source: Simply Safe DividendsFor dividend companies with enough operating history, it's always a prudent exercise to observe how their businesses performed during the financial crisis. Our Stock Analyzer tool lets us see how a company performed during the financial crisis in one click. BR's reported sales were down just 3% in fiscal year 2009, and earnings actually grew. Despite serving clients in the financial services industry, most of BR's products are mission-critical and don't depend on the market's direction.Source: Simply Safe DividendsHigh quality companies are able to generate cash flow year in and year out. Rising cash flow is very important because it supports continued dividend growth without expanding the payout ratio. BR's business model has very low capital intensity (capital expenditures as a percentage of sales is typically below 2%), throwing off plenty cash each year and recording solid growth over the last five years:Source: Simply Safe DividendsSteady sales growth and consistent cash flow generation are two signs of an excellent business. One of the quickest ways to assess the strength of a business model is to evaluate the level and durability of a company's return on invested capital. Generally speaking, returns maintained in the teens or higher can suggest a competitively advantaged business. As seen below, BR has generated an 18% return almost every single year since fiscal year 2006. Few businesses can say that.Source: Simply Safe DividendsWhile payout ratios, margins, industry cyclicality, free cash flow generation, and business performance during the recession help give us a better sense of a dividend's safety, the balance sheet is an extremely important indicator as well.As seen below, BR's long-term debt to capital ratio has remained fairly steady over the last decade, generally hovering between 30% and 40%, a very reasonable level. The company also has $324 million cash on hand compared to $689 million book debt - one year of free cash flow could cover its entire net debt balance. With very low business volatility and consistent free cash flow generation, BR has a conservative balance sheet that can be used over the coming years to finance bolt-on acquisitions.Source: Simply Safe DividendsAltogether, BR's dividend is very safe. The company's payout ratios are low, its business is very predictable and throws off tons of cash, and the balance sheet is very healthy.Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question, ""How fast is the dividend likely to grow?"" It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth-centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.BR's Growth Score is 96, meaning its dividend's growth potential ranks higher than 96% of all other dividend stocks we monitor. The company's low payout ratios, flexible balance sheet, business stability, and opportunities for long-term earnings growth support a very positive outlook for continued dividend growth.BR has increased its dividend each year since spinning off from ADP in 2007 (eight straight years) and most recently raised its dividend by 10%. Including the most recent hike, BR's dividend has grown at a 15% compound annual growth rate over the last five years and appears to have potential to continue growing 8-12% per year going forward. While it's impossible to predict so far into the future, BR's business has some of the characteristics seen in many of the dividend aristocrats, which should support dividend growth for some time to come.ValuationBR trades at 20x forward earnings. Given BR's resilient business model (90% recurring revenue; 97%+ client retention rate), very healthy free cash flow generation, and opportunities for continued earnings growth going forward, we believe the company remains attractive today for long-term dividend growth investors.The company's dividend yield sits at 2.2%, good for a Yield Score of 38 which means that BR's dividend yield is only higher than 38% of all other dividend stocks. However, given the company's strong potential for double-digit dividend increases going forward, a lower Yield Score is not surprising.ConclusionBR possesses many of the traits of an excellent business - low capital intensity, high returns on capital, a long runway for growth in adjacent products and markets, limited competition, high switching costs, dominant market share, a healthy balance sheet, and more. While the company faces higher regulatory and technological risks than some other companies, we believe its core competitive advantages and the generally favorable industry themes playing out (e.g. digitalization, data & analytics) far outweigh any concerns. For dividend growth investors, BR's dividend yield of 2.2% offers a reasonable starting point considering the long-term double-digit growth potential. Trading at about 20x forward earnings, the stock isn't super cheap but we wouldn't expect it to ever be given the extremely high quality and stability of the business (90% recurring revenue; 98% client retention rate). We believe BR is an example of buying a wonderful business at a reasonable price."

How do these posts all tie in with Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:BR)? Well...Judging from the daily average number of shares traded (423,000), I venture to guess that BR with its sub $10B market cap is overlooked by many investors. This really is a shame since its performance subsequent to being spun off from ADP in 2007 has been impressive.The following graph compares BR's performance from the date it started trading as a publicly traded entity with the performance of the Dow Jones, S&P 500, Russell 1000 ETF, Russell 2000 ETF and Russell 3000 ETF. BR's performance relative to all these ETFs has been far superior.Industry OverviewBR is classified by Google Finance as being a member of the Professional Information Services - NEC industry within the Industrials sector. Thomson Reuters classifies BR as a member of the Professional Information Services group within the Industrials Sector. When I perform various searches within various stock screeners, the ""peer groups"" are composed of companies that might compete against BR in some areas of its business. I have been unable to locate any companies that compete against BR in all the areas of its business.Business OverviewIf you manage your own investments and are registered to receive Proxy Voting Material by email you likely receive emails containing an image similar to that below where BR is referenced at the bottom of the email in very small print. If that is the extent of your familiarity with BR you may wish to read up on its Strategic Vision and Journey to Drive Top Quartile Stockholder Returns.BR has two business segments.1. Investor Communication Solutions through which it offers:2. Global Technology and OperationsBR offers a middle- and back-office securities processing platform for North American and global broker-dealers in which it provides investor and customer communications, securities processing, and data and analytics solutions. In essence, BR delivers a range of solutions that helps its clients serve their retail and institutional customers across the entire investment lifecycle, including pre-trade, trade, and post-trade processing functionality.Looking at BR's history you will see it began as the brokerage services division of ADP in 1962 and became a public company in 2007. During this period BR had a number of prominent achievements and notable innovations.As you can see from BR's history, its growth has been achieved organically and through strategic acquisitions. The link to BR's history page does not appear to have been updated to include its most recent sizable acquisition and that completed in Q2 2017.On July 1, 2016, BR completed the acquisition of the North American Customer Communications (""NACC"") business of DST Systems, Inc. (NSYE: DST) for $410MM in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments - in fiscal 2015 the NACC business generated $1.1B in revenue and $445MM of fee revenue.In June 2016, when BR announced its intent to acquire NACC, it expected to achieve approximately $20MM in annualized cost synergies within 18-30 months of closing. In addition, the NACC business would be immediately accretive to its GAAP and adjusted earnings, inclusive of incremental interest expense. Based on recently announced results, BR's expectations are materializing.Upon acquiring this business, BR renamed the NACC business Broadridge Customer Communications and integrated it into BR's Investor Communication Solutions segment. By doing so, BR created North America's premier customer communications technology platform for print and digital solutions to banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds and corporate issuers.In Q2 2017, Broadridge completed the acquisition of M&O Systems, Inc. (""M&O""). M&O is a provider of SaaS-based compensation management and related solutions for broker-dealers and registered investment advisors. The aggregate purchase price was $25 million in cash, subject to customary working capital and other closing adjustments.Q2 2017 and Six-Month Ending December 31, 2016, ResultsBR released its Q2 2017 and first half of FY 2017 results on February 8, 2017. Its Earnings release can be found here.Q2 2017Six Months Ending December 31, 2016BR's long-term debt has definitely ballooned in the last few years as a result of its string of acquisitions and repurchase of its shares.As at its fiscal YE 2102, LTD was $524MM, Treasury Shares was $580MM, and Goodwill and Intangible Assets was $923MM.As at December 31, 2016, LTD was $1.081B, Treasury Shares was $1.190B, and Goodwill and Intangible Assets was $1.626B.BR's risk profile has changed within the last four years given that it has acquired a considerable number of its shares and has used debt to assist in the acquisition of various businesses for growth purposes. Despite the added level of risk, I'm comfortable that BR's debt load is not at the level to give me heartburn.With the added annual debt service obligation, I clearly understand why management has such a focus on growing its recurring fee revenue.Outlook for Fiscal 2017BR has slightly revised downward its total revenue growth. There are two drivers for this revision. The first is the NACC business where it expects lower volumes from a couple of large clients - this business exhibits a high ratio of distribution to fee revenue.The second reason is that the prospects for meaningful mutual fund proxy driven activity is strong but some of the business originally anticipated to occur in fiscal 2017 is more likely to happen in early fiscal 2018.Diluted EPS growth has been revised downward as a result of higher non-cash related expenses and higher acquisition related expenses. Adjusted EPS excludes these expenses, and therefore, adjusted EPS and FCF projections remain unchanged.As an investor, I view FCF as a key metric in that it provides an indication as to how much cash is generated after accounting for capital expenditures. In essence, it is what can be used for expansion, dividends, debt reduction or the repurchase of shares.Some investors may follow a more stringent form of FCF and will include dividend payments as a capital expenditure. I don't follow this stringent definition.All in all, on the February 8, 2017, conference call, management was upbeat about the remainder of FY 2017 and the outlook for 2018 as it continues to:ValuationAs I compose this post, BR is trading at $68.18 and Google Finance reflects a PE of 26.89 which would imply an EPS level of $2.54. This doesn't seem right to me given that analysts have a mean estimated EPS for FY2016 of $3.12. If I use the estimate from the analysts, I get a forward PE of 21.85.I like to acquire shares in companies if their PE is in the mid - high teens but I know it is unrealistic to expect BR's PE to drop to this level unless some catastrophic event occurs. I am, therefore, willing to pay up to acquire additional shares. In fact, I acquired additional shares in mid August 2016 at $68.31 which increased the average cost of our BR holdings to $34.0611.Source: TD Bank WebBrokerSource: ValuEngineIf you are a dividend yield hungry investor, BR will likely be of no interest to you as its quarterly and annual dividend of $0.33 and $1.32 only generates a yield of 1.94%. BR, however, is consistently increasing its annual dividend. On February 2, 2017, it announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.33/share payable on April 3, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2017.Before you completely rule out BR because of its low dividend yield you may want to read my Do Low or No Dividend Yield Companies Belong in Your Portfolio? post.As I noted in my recent Church & Dwight (NYSE: CHD) post, I recognize the market will likely correct at some stage. If and when it does, BR's stock price may be caught in the downdraft. If you are inclined to think the same way, you may likely decide that you will patiently wait on the sidelines.If you do decide to initiate a position in BR, my suggestion is that it be a small position given that market conditions just seem to be, in my humble opinion, too vulnerable for a correction. If/when there is a market correction, you can certainly decide at that point in time whether you wish to acquire more shares.Final ThoughtsBR is a company that just quietly operates in the background and to which you never/rarely give it a second thought. It does, however, provide services that are critical to keeping bond and equity markets functioning properly and it is the leading provider of investor communications and technology-driven solutions for wealth management, asset management and capital markets firms. In essence, BR's clients require its critical services - there are no other service providers which can provide the same suite of services to the same degree of efficiency as that provided by BR.We currently own BR, but not in the FFJ Portfolio. As pointed out in the introduction section of this post, one quick look at BR's stock chart from the date in which it went public (and the date we initially owned shares) shows this has definitely been a worthwhile investment.BR is a wonderful business and that is why I was willing to acquire more shares a few months ago at a price similar to the current price. You may wish to familiarize yourself with BR so you have a good understanding of the business. This way, if there is a market correction and BR's stock price is caught in the downdraft you will not need to start your due diligence from scratch.Please click the + icon next to my user name and follow me at Financial Freedom is a Journey as I work to keep you informed on further developments in the world of dividend stocks."
4098092,102551,2017-08-11T14:00:30-04:00,"As a long-term Broadridge investor I am pleased with its FY2017 results and optimistic it will meet its FY2018 projections. Both were released August 10, 2017.Broadridge continues to make bolt-on acquisitions to enhance its product/service offering with the Spence Johnson acquisition being the most recent.The repurchase of Issued and Outstanding shares and Dividend increase trends continue.BR’s shares are very rarely inexpensive but are currently reasonably valued if you use consensus adjusted EPS estimated for FY2018.","This is a follow up to my February 9, 2017 and May 13, 2017 Broadridge Financial (NYSE: BR) posts. Should you be unfamiliar with the company you may wish to go here to familiarize yourself with its service/product offerings.BR is a company which flies under the radar. Its market cap is only ~$8.5B and it is not a name that makes the headlines. It does, however, provide services that are integral to publicly traded companies. For example, it handles millions of trades a day involving trillions of dollars. It also provides support communications that reach 75% of North American households and it manages shareholder voting in 90 countries.BR continues to expand its service offering by making tuck-in acquisitions. An example of this is its July 2017 acquisition of Spence Johnson Limited (""Spence Johnson"") which is a leading provider of global institutional data and intelligence to the asset management industry.This acquisition is another example of what BR President and CEO (Richard Daly) means about focusing on “bite sized” enhancements to its product/service offering versus the development of products and services.While BR is presented with roughly 10 acquisition opportunities per year, only 1 or 2 may meet BR’s stringent acquisition criteria:Clearly, Spence Johnson met these hurdles.On August 10, 2017, BR released its FY2017 results and forecast for FY2018 which can be found here.Highlights of FY2017 are as follows.You can see recurring fee revenue grew substantially this past fiscal year.This is a good sign in that it means clients are pleased with BR’s services and service levels. In addition, it is also much less costly to upsell and to service existing clients than it is to acquire new clients. While BR needs new clients, it definitely makes it much easier to manage a business when you know that a substantial portion of your revenue is reasonably certain to materialize.Fiscal Year 2017 Operating Income and EPS on a diluted and on an adjusted basis grew nicely this past fiscal year.FCF levels in 2012 – 2016 were $0.244B, $0.22B, $0.334B, $0.365B, and $0.362B. In FY2017, FCF amounted to $0.4B which ended up being at the upper end of guidance.The drawback I see is that BR’s long-term debt has increased dramatically in the last few years as a result of its string of acquisitions and repurchase of its shares. On a positive note, none of the long-term debt is due within the next 12 months. Another positive is that interest rates on the debt taken on in recent years is lower than that on the debt incurred within the first few years of being a stand-alone entity.I am satisfied that BR has the wherewithal to meet its debt obligations and am comfortable with BR’s current debt levels.BR is projecting another steady year of growth and is calling for another “ Broadridge type of year"".As at the time I compose this post, the dividend history on the company’s website has not been updated subsequent to the December 14, 2015 record date; you will also note the payable date is incorrect in that it should reflect January 4, 2016 versus 2015. I very recently emailed the company requesting they update this section of the site but at the moment this information is stale dated.Having said this, rest assured BR has increased its dividend from the $0.30 last reflected. It has been paying $0.33/quarter and on August 10, 2017 it was announced that the Board had approved an 11% increase in BR’s annual dividend to $1.46/share or $0.365/share/quarter. This means BR has raised its dividend every year since becoming a public company in 2007 and that FY2018 marks the 6 th consecutive year of double digit percentage increase and the 10th consecutive increase in the annual dividend.BR closed at $72.28 on August 10, 2017. If I take the FY2017 adjusted EPS of $3.13 and use management’s 15% - 19% growth expectations for FY2018, the projected adjusted EPS range is $3.60 - $3.72. Using the mid-point of this range ($3.66) and today’s closing stock price, I get a forward PE of 19.75. This is a far cry from the current PE which is in the upper 20s.Coincidentally, my $3.66 mid point is the current mean adjusted EPS estimate from 5 brokers and does not seem excessive to me given BR’s growth potential.BR is a leader in its space and continues to make bolt-on acquisitions to expand the range of services it can offer clients. I perceive its success in retaining clients as a huge plus and am willing to pay up for the predictability of BR’s relatively stable growth in earnings.In addition, I view BR as an attractive investment because it has a track record of increasing its annual dividend and it buys back more shares than what are issued by way of stock options. I am, in essence, being paid to be patient long-term investor; over the course of the FY2008 - FY 2017 period, BR’s share count has dropped from 141 million shares to 116.5 million shares.I have owned BR shares outside the FFJ Portfolio from the time BR was spun-off from ADP in 2007. I have no intention of parting ways with these shares in the foreseeable future. In fact, I acquired additional shares subsequent to my May 13, 2017 post and intend to acquire a few additional BR shares within the next 72 hours. Note: I appreciate the time you took to read this article and hope you got something out of it. As always, please leave any feedback and questions you may have and follow me at Financial Freedom is a Journey."
1927581,20568,2014-01-03T15:28:17-05:00,,"Broadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE:BR) is a provider of technology solutions including investor communications, securities processing and operations to banks, broker-dealers, mutual funds, and corporate issuers globally.It is the former Brokerage Services division of ADP and was spun-off from ADP in 2007. The company has seen a compounded annual fee growth of 6% since it was spun-off.BR processes 85% of all outstanding shares voted in the US and 72% of shares voted outside of the US.Solid Third Quarter Results Broadridge reported financial results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2014 on November 7, 2013. Total Revenues increased 10% to $545 million from $496 million, primarily due to growth in net new business and by internal growth.Non-GAAP Diluted earnings increased 117% to $0.39 per share, substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.20 per share.The management reaffirmed their full year guidance provided in August 2013--total revenue growth in the range of 2% to 4% and diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.00 to $2.10.Earnings Estimates RevisionsAfter excellent results and reaffirmation of guidance, analysts have increased their estimates for BR.Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current and next fiscal year are now at $2.29 per share and $2.47 per share respectively, up from $2.06 per share and $2.26 per share, 60 days ago. Rising estimates sent BR to Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) on November 14, 2013.Shareholder Value CreationThe company plans to pay out 40% of its net earnings in dividends. It also plans using its excess cash for buybacks. Since its inception in 2007, the company has returned over $800 million of capital to its shareholders via dividends and buybacks.Bottom LineBR is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. It also has a longer-term Zacks recommendation of “Outperform”. Further Zacks Industry Rank of 31 out of 265 (top 12%) suggests strong chances of outperformance in the coming months.With its leadership position in a number of attractive markets in the investor communications and securities processing space and a diversified revenue base across large financial institutions, the company should continue to reward its investors in the coming months."
3440216,54942,2015-08-15T09:25:31-04:00,"Recurring revenue as a percentage of total ICS and consolidated revenues reached 50% and 40%, respectively in the latest quarter.The growth in ICS and recurring revenue is being augmented by strategic tuck-in acquisitions building a powerhouse in the space.We think this is a rare combination of solid 2+% yield, 10% EPS growth, and steady consistent revenue generation trading at a fair price.","Broadridge (NYSE:BR) continues their acquisitions-based strategy augmenting their growth while creating a free cash flow inflection. The firm's inflection started last year when we highlighted the potential in our top idea with their new Accenture (NYSE:ACN) joint venture to scale overseas.The company reported respectable second quarter results which boosted the shares by over 4% (on a down tape) despite an overall mixed fourth quarter. But the steady growth story along with a dividend raise was enough for the market as we believe the risks are still to the upside as general weakness is likely still embedded into the operating expectations.Scale Getting ReachedEBITDA margins in the fiscal fourth quarter improved by nearly 500 bps over last year with pre-tax margins in the quarter hitting 28.4%. We think the company has significant scale potential that they can turn on at any point simply by reducing their growth capex. The upside in margins in the quarter appears to be at least partially from that with strategic initiative expense and selling expenses being reduced as they focused more on acquisitions.We think adjusted EBITDA margins could eventually reach 25% over the next two years should the management team tone down the investments they are making. Operating expenses have risen from $299 million in fiscal 2012 to the current $412 million, an increase of 107%- while revenue has risen just 17%. A lot of this expansion has been an increase and restructuring of the sales force which we think could reap dividends over the next few years with upside catalyst potential from big new client wins.Mutual Fund Regulation UpdateRevenues for their investor communications solutions segment increased another $48 million or 7% to $766 million in their fiscal fourth quarter ending early August. Recurring fee revenue posted another high single digit number rising 8% to $429 million in the fourth quarter and 9% for all of fiscal 2015. This piece of the business now constitutes just over half of their total investor communications solutions business (ICS).The SEC provided a regulatory update with new proposed rules that require mutual funds to make new filings and to provide funds the option of mailing a notice of fund report availability on a website, instead of mailing a complete report to those investors whom haven't signed up for e-delivery. If adopted, we believe the rule will at least be neutral to Broadridge and very likely a small positive to their ICS business.The company is highly experienced in navigating these regulatory changes and we think the market is finally recognizing this. In the past, any SEC proposed rule surrounding a change in investor communication was typically viewed negatively given the unknowns surrounding implementation. However, we think there is enough sell-side coverage and investor experience since going public over five years ago that this is no longer the case.The company is set to comment directly to the SEC regarding the changes at the end of this month with management noting that better savings (on postage) and greater investor readership are available through digital communications and through the implementation of summary documents. The shift towards e-delivery is ongoing with younger investors preferring not to receive paper documents. A new summary report would require additional SEC rules and likely lead to additional communications boosting the division.Non-Transparent ETFsETFs are a 'Street distributed play' as opposed to a 'registered play' so regardless of the underlying ETF model or strategy, the investors within the ETF are going to require information as regulated by the SEC. Management hinted at a recent conference that a shift from mutual fund investors to non-transparent ETFs (something that is in the works with the SEC in the process of ruling on their creation) should be viewed positively. While the company recently entered the transfer agency business, they are not in the mutual fund transfer agency business, creating less of a disruption threat should non-transparent ETFs be approved.Acquisitions Power GrowthBroadridge continues to focus on growing the firm through tuck-in acquisitions using the 20% IRR hurdle as their benchmark. In the second quarter they closed on two additional acquisitions, buying the trade processing business of M&T Banks Wilmington Trust and purchasing the fiduciary services and competitive intelligence unit from Thomson Reuters in June for $77 million. The latter is a $20 million per year revenue business with both acquisitions overall contributing small to the fiscal fourth quarter.Overall, the four businesses that they've purchased year-to-date has contributed less than 1% of revenue growth and were slightly dilutive (less than $0.01) to adjusted EPS for fiscal 2015. However, management noted that these businesses will contribute approximately 3% of recurring fee growth next year even though they are likely to be margin dilutive by approximately 30-40 bps. This, however, will be a near-term phenomenon and typical of the Broadridge business model as they ramp up the acquired businesses and achieve sales targets and product synergies.We think acquisitions will continue to add approximately 2% to recurring revenue growth over the next three years, similar to what it has added over the prior three. Management had a slide in their recent investor day where they noted that their capital stewardship priorities including a continued tuck-in acquisition strategy and were selectively targeting about $400 - $600 million over the time period. We actually believe this will be too low, especially given the firm has already conducted $200 million in the first two calendar quarters of this year.The growth from their acquisitions is unassailable as the portfolio of acquired businesses is generating IRRs well in excess of 20% and contributed $220 million in recurring fee revenue and $75 million in EBITDA. As the company continues to focus on these recurring revenue tuck-ins, the risk of the company will continue to subside, lowering their cost of capital, and improving their returns on invested capital.ValuationThe company continues to increase shareholder returns with the spending of $123 million in the quarter to buyback their own common. The board recently increased their share buyback authorization from 5.3 million shares to 10 million total. They also boosted the annual dividend payout to $1.20 which will take the yield from the current 1.9% to over 2.2%, well above the peer group average of 1.7% and the broader market at 2.1%. We like to compare the name to the market in general with the shares trading at a 4x P/E multiple premium, but Broadridge growing at a substantially higher rate.Our long thesis is predicated on multiple expansion as they build their base of recurring revenue and lower their risk profile essentially becoming a staple in the technology sector. We think that occurs as they garner greater sell-side attention. We tweaked our estimate for fiscal 2016 EBITDA generation to account for some slight weakness in the last two quarters of fiscal 2015 but also to include larger multiple expansion. In addition, net debt is trending much lower due to strong cash generation and some debt pay down- we had also forecast some greater leverage to the balance sheet due to acquisitions.ConclusionWe continue to believe in the Broadridge story and forecast EPS growth in the low double-digits for at least the next three years. EBITDA growth should be approximately 7%-8% per year (with the rest of EPS growth coming from their share buyback program) which we believe gets augmented by further EV/EBITDA multiple expansion. We believe the shares represent a compelling holding over the next several years as regulatory changes are likely to be positive catalysts to the ICS segment. Meanwhile, recurring revenue continues to build and the firm's overall risk levels decline, moving them into a steady-growing, dividend payer with utility or consumer staples'-like defensibility."

SPS provides a unique suite of computerized, real-time transaction processing services that automate the securities transaction lifecycle and accounts for the remaining 31% of revenues.Broadridge has been referred to as the most important financial services company you've never heard of in a recent article by Forbes magazine. The quintessential outsourcing company, it operates in a near monopolist fashion and benefits from a recurring revenue business model. The company was spun off from ADP in 2008, and since then has experienced annual compounded growth of 6% in recurring revenues.Investment CatalystsEconomies of Scale in Investor Communications SolutionsProxyEdge is BR's electronic proxy delivery and voting solution, geared towards institutional investors and financial advisers to ensure the participation of the large stockholders in a company. Given the large number of voting proxies that must be sent out in any given year, most nominees contract out this administrative work through power of attorney to firms like Broadridge, who then distribute the proxy materials and voting instructions to the beneficial owners/shareholders. The SEC requires companies reimburse nominees for the expense of distributing shareholder communications to the beneficial owners. Broadridge's role is a billing and collecting agent with respect to this reimbursement. Revenues are recurring in nature due to the transactions where BR bills public companies on behalf of the nominees, collects fees, and remits to the nominee the difference between what the nominee is entitled and the amount the nominee has agreed to pay BR for its services. For banks and brokerages, BR handles the entire process online and in real-time. This business model yields a diverse revenue source and broad client base. According to the company's annual report, Broadridge is the leader in corporate governance activities, and processes approximately 85% of the outstanding shares in the US and approximately 72% of the shares voted outside the US.BR is the only full service provider of shareholder communications to all types of shareholders. Management feels the company can effectively leverage the one billion plus shareholder communications annually as well as record keeping, corporate actions, and other shareholder account servicing practices.Near Monopolistic Position in growing Securities Processing SolutionsAccording to company management, securities and investment firms' overall technology and operations spend is over $100 billion and growing at 5%. This adds approximately $14B to the SPS addressable market. Broadridge already benefits from a dominating market share:In addition to a dominating market share position, BR's SPS client base is diversified across large financial institutions. It covers 8 of the top 15 retail and 11 of the top 15 institutional clients in equity processing, as well as all 15 in Fixed Income processing. BR's clients benefit from a breadth of asset class offerings on a single platform and a trusted brand. This yields a leading market position and scalability as well as a flexible business model that can be tailored to unique client needs.The Enhanced Broker Internet Platform (EBIP)Recently, the SEC approved fee changes proposed by the NYSE for the distribution of proxies to shareholders. Fees for the Enhanced Broker Internet Platform (EBIP) were adopted as part of this change. The EBIP is essentially the same as BR's Investor Mailbox product, which has been rolled out to 16 firms thus far, with another eight firms in the process of implantation, according to a ValueLine report. The approval of EBIP should accelerate its adoption.Risks and CompetitionWhile Broadridge offers a unique, full suite offering, it competes with many firms who chose to perform trade processing in-house and with numerous other outsourcing vendors. Furthermore, consolidation in the financial services industry could negatively affect revenues by eliminating potential clients who cannot process in-house. Additionally, 25% of revenues are derived from five companies.Financial OverviewFor the full year 2013, BR reported solid revenue growth as total revenues and recurring revenues increased 6% and 4% respectively. This was primarily due to new business. This company also announced it has repurchased 7% of shares outstanding at an average cost of $24.52 per share. The company guided fiscal year 2014 recurring revenue growth of 5-7% and free cash flow of $250-300 million and plans to increase the annual dividend by ~17% to $0.84 per share. This represents a CAGR of ~23% since 2008, the company's first full year as a stand-alone entity after the completion of the spin-off from ADP.Other HighlightsMargins have been steady-to-improving overall since the crises, and have only in the last year eclipsed pre-crises levels. Management guided operating margin to increase from 14.8% in 2013 to ~16% in 2014.Broadridge targets a minimum 40% payout ratio and expects to pay a per-share dividend of $0.84 in 2014, an increase of ~17%. The company boasts a 26% ROE, which would imply an internal growth rate of 15.6%. With these figures, the dividend policy seems reasonable. Since 2008, the payout ratio has averaged 42%, in-line with company expectations. I am also impressed by the company's ability to increase the dividend in 2008 and 2009. This shows the company's relatively low correlation with the overall health of the stock market; rather, Broadridge sales volume is more related to overall transactions, processing needs and trading volume, which do not depend on the direction of the market.Broadridge generates significant free cash flows. As a percentage of sales, FCF generation has averaged roughly 13% since 2008. I typically consider a figure over 5% to be very strong, so BR does an excellent job converting sales into cash.Looking at the most recent quarter, revenues were up 10% on a year-over-year basis, driven by recurring fee revenue, with additions from Net New Business, higher distribution revenue fees, and event0driven fee revenues. ICS revenues increased 10.8% and SPS revenues increased 9.6%. On top of this, the company reported quarterly EPS of $0.39 versus $0.18 in the prior year's quarter.ValuationUsing a conservative 3.5% revenue growth rate and 15% FCF/Sales ratio, a value of $46 was calculated. Using P/E and EV-EBIT models, valuations ranged from $41 to $49, for a weighted average value of $45. Shares currently trade at approximately $37, and using a 33% margin of safety, a $33.70 buy price was generated. The stock has appreciated roughly 50% since breaking above $25 in mid 2013. I would prefer a sizeable pullback in the stock before I become overly aggressive, perhaps waiting for as much as a 10% breather, representing an entry target of $34, slightly above my margin of entry target.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2128063,54942,2014-04-08T05:00:00-04:00,"Joint venture with Accenture to scale in Europe and Asia.Market leading position with large, defensible moats.Technologically advanced leading to disruption in the space.Low cost provider adding value to clients in the fixed income space.","Large changes continue to afflict financial services firms around the world as they face increasing regulatory compliance challenges, increased competition, rising costs, pressures to transform their operations, and significant shifts in how they communicate with their clients. Broadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE:BR) is a sleepy, under-the-radar name that commands a large competitive advantage. The company was spun off from Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) back in 2007. The company, which controls a significant share of the US market, recently announced plans to partner with Accenture (NYSE:ACN) to expand their operations overseas targeting European and Asian banks.Business OverviewBroadridge is actually a fifty-year old provider of outsourcing solutions to financial service firms. In 1989, they began offering proxy services which is the predecessor for their Investor Communication Solutions business. In the 1990's, they made a couple of larger acquisitions to grow their Securities Processing business. By 1999, they were processing over 90% of the investor communication distributions- proxy statements, prospectuses, annual reports, etc.- for all securities held of record by banks and broker dealers in the US. In 2004, they purchased Bank of America's US Clearing and Broker-Dealer Services businesses, which facilitated their securities clearing and operations outsourcing services.From their 10-K:The company is split into two divisions: Investor Communication Solutions (ICS), their proxy and distribution services division, and Securities Processing Solutions (SPS) which handles securities transaction processes. ICS accounts for approximately 72% of all revenues while SPS is the remaining 27%.In fiscal year 2013, ended June 30, 2013, they processed approximately 85% of the outstanding shares in the US in proxy services, processed approximately 2 billion investor communications through either paper or electronic channels, processed on average over $5 trillion in equity and fixed income trades per day of US and Canadian securities including approximately 60% of fixed income trades, and provided fixed income trade processing to 15 of the 21 primary dealers of fixed income securities in the US.Strategic AllianceAs trading volumes at investment banks in both equity and fixed income markets shrink, they are increasingly looking for ways to address the high fixed costs and lower returns on capital. This is coupled with an increasing complexity within the regulatory environment with new rules such as the CSDR/T+2 settlement, TARGET2 (T2S) and tripartite netting. Investment banks will need to reduce operational costs and operate much more efficiently in order to continue to earn even marginal returns on capital within the new market paradigm.Accenture Post-Trade Processing is a new strategic venture with Broadridge that combines Accenture's business process outsourcing capabilities with Broadridge's advanced technological knowledge. Post trade processing takes place after a trade is complete and the buyer and seller compare trade details, approve the transaction, change records of ownership and arrange for the transfer of securities and cash.The new venture will launch this service for investment banks operating in Europe and Asia to complement their already strong domestic business. The first client to sign on for the service was Société Générale Corporate and Investment Banking. The company noted on their conference call back in August 2013 that the relationship would generate, on average, over $10 million per year during its term. The initial focus for the company will be the top 50 global financial institutions that are looking for ways to focus their resources on revenue generation while lowering operating costs and increasing scale.As CEO Richard Daly put it on their fourth quarter conference call:Broadridge (and Accenture) has created the platform to also address several other functions that are driving costs for investment banks including reconciliations and corporate actions processing. Overall, the joint venture will supplant investment banks from having to hire, invest in the technology, and acquire the expertise for key post-trade processing functions such as settlement, books and records, asset servicing, operational management and control, real-time data access and administrative accounting.This is a similar outsourcing initiative that Accenture, IBM, and Cognizant are performing for corporations' IT departments to lower overhead and increase expertise and market research capabilities. It is becoming more common across the entire IT spectrum as organizations like the cost structure and lower human capital inputs needed.Given the strong market position within the US financial system, the company should not have an issue breaking into overseas financial industries. This will provide another ramp up of revenue creation and a significant upside catalyst for the firm.ICS Market Position and OpportunityThe company controls over 90% of the US proxy market, one-third of the US equity processing market, and nearly 60% of the US fixed income markets. There are large regulatory barriers that make it difficult for competitors to break into the space and compete with Broadridge providing them a massive moat.The company believes that the addressable ICS market is worth up to $10 billion or more in fee revenue. In 2013, ICS earned $1.76 billion in fee revenue, up 8% over 2012. The slide below shows a great breakdown of the opportunities within the various sub-sectors of the investment and banking industries. Today, the bank/broker dealer segment is their core market but they have made significant inroads over the last several years to get footholds, either by acquisitions or natural extensions of their current business, to enter and compete in the other ""natural adjacency"" markets.(Source: Company Investor Presentation)Overall, the segment has become significantly more diversified with distribution now just 43% of revenue within ICS. Proxy services are now just 20% of revenue. The client base has also broadened to include mutual funds and corporate issuers in addition to their base of banks and broker-dealers.As regulations continue to explode both domestically and internationally, the number of communications to clients continues to increase. Not only do they send proxy communications, but the ever-increasing class action securities communications, transaction statements, trade confirmations, and tax reporting.Their ICS platform has a strong competitive advantage over their fragmented competition. Their crucial data center has the established relationships with the majority of the US's banks and broker-dealers. They are the most innovative in the space with the only e-delivery, web, phone, and mobile voting platform for proxies called Broadridge Fluent. In addition, their ProxyEdge institutional voting and record keeping platform is unique within the industry.Outside of the proxy services, over the last decade they have expanded to Issuer Services and Mutual Fund and Retirement Solutions. Within these businesses, they have horizontally integrated other client communications and functions such as virtual shareholder meetings, shareholder forums, stock share registry, ownership transfers and dividend calculations mostly within their Transfer agency which business they entered three years ago.Today, they are the only full service provider of shareholder communications to all types of shareholders. The current run rate of communications are over 1 billion in addition to record keeping, corporate actions and other shareholder account servicing. Their purchase of Matrix Financial Solutions in early 2011 added mutual fund processing services for financial advisers, banks, and other wealth management offices, to their product offering.In other words, their breadth and scope of expertise provides the firm a significant competitive advantage that is unrivaled within the industry. Additionally, their scale and innovative technological advantage allows them to provide services at a much lower cost than the competition. As they expand overseas, this expertise and technological savvy will garner them the credibility to ramp up their customer base quickly.SPS Market OpportunityTheir securities processing solutions business represents roughly 27% of the firm's total revenues. The total addressable market as assessed by Broadridge is actually larger than the ICS business with the potential for $14 billion in fee revenue. In 2013, the segment generated $661 million in revenues while their net margins were 12.9% last year.The core of the business is US brokerage processing solutions, both fixed income and equities. However, in recent years they have moved into other areas of the market expanding their scope and service to augment their value-add. These include global processing, business process outsourcing, and adjacent markets like middle office, buy-side services, derivatives processing (an area of explosive growth) and fixed income market data and analytics.In 2013, the segment processed on average of $5 trillion of fixed income and equity trades per day of US and Canadian securities. They can generate for customers significant savings with management noting that they can process fixed income trades at approximately a quarter below what it costs a firm to do it in-house. That kind of savings is a compelling draw as these banks and investment houses look to offload non-core functions and reduce expenses.This functionality is going to be expanded worldwide and the division should see some significant ramp in their growth over the next several years. Last year, they added Bloomberg Tradebook, Bloomberg's agency broker that partners with buy side and sell side organizations to provide liquidity, market insight, and customized trading solutions, among their BPO clients to power their clearing and settlement services for its institutional clients.As the slide below shows, there is ample room for Broadridge to gain market share from the firms that process their equities transactions in-house. There's another 43% of fixed income organizations that process those transactions in-house while a smaller but definitely accretive untapped market within operations outsourcing remains to be captured.(Source: Company Investor Presentation)Emerging and Acquired Portfolio TailwindThere are five drivers for the business: 1) stock record growth which is a very stable business and tends to be a low single-digit grower, 2) event-driven revenues, which can be more volatile but where the company expects more stability over the next few years, 3) trading volumes and related trade support activities which have risen over most time periods, 4) the emerging and acquired (E&A) portfolio, and 5) solid net new businesses tied to their sales execution.The acquisitions within this portfolio are on pace to generate $210 million in revenues and $65 million in adjusted EBITDA this year. The strategy remains the same as they hunt for strategic tuck-in acquisitions that meet their investment criteria. Essentially, they want a clear growth profile that will be accretive to growth, margins and earnings plus a greater than 20% IRR in their conservative case scenario. While that criteria may be stringent and rule out many potentially profitable acquisitions, management has stated several times that Broadridge will likely only buy companies that are more valuable under the Broadridge umbrella than as a standalone entity.The emerging product portfolio is another area of potential growth for the firm. These include natural product and service adjacencies or extensions of their core businesses such as tax services, securities class actions, and mortgage-backed trading systems. Management believes the E&P piece of the business will account for approximately 50% of their recurring revenue closed sales. While none of these product lines are particularly large, they are accretive in the aggregate and are fast growing areas of the business. The business provides a nice tailwind and belies the notion that the company is tapped out for growth.Strategic InvestmentsThe company is focusing on addressing 3 disruptive key macro trends to which they are devoting more capital investment in the second half of the fiscal year. They are 1) the digital transformation of investor communications, 2) Cost/Capability mutualization, and 3) Intelligence created from their unique data.Last November, they announced a partnership with Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI), that creates ""an interactive digital communications exchange that will make it easier for businesses to communicate with consumers about their most important transactions"" utilizing Amazon Web Services. Management believes that the platform has the potential to save billions of dollars per year by reducing static paper consumption. The move is a positive step for the digital mail market which attempts to simplify the management of the commercial aspect of a person's life.The new exchange approach will increase efficiency and enhance the benefits to all participants within the system. Producers of communications like banks, insurance companies or mutual fund firms, can efficiently and more cost effectively reach their customers. They can also use the platform to build their audience and market their products by adding compelling information and product offerings. Many of the early digital mail solutions (NYSE:DMS) providers like Doxo, Volly, and Manilla took an approach whereby they attempted to build a new consumer destination. This solution has mostly failed due to the consumer being forced to manage yet another website log-in and password. The new exchange will allow consumers to securely sign in to receive, manage, and even pay all of their bills with a single user ID and password.On cost or capability mutualization, they are planning to accelerate sales and marketing activities, product enhancements and global talent acquisition. The alliance with Accenture gives the firm new credibility as a global platform and will likely be a game changer for the company. I've spoken about this above so won't duplicate that here.Within data solutions, there is significant demand for business intelligence to utilize some of their unique data. The company hopes to use their accelerated investment focus to explore additional product lines including data analytics. This could add incremental revenue to the firm without significant up-front costs.Originally, the company had planned on approximately $8 million over their normal run rate in new strategic investment spend. However, because of their string of successes and the opportunities they see in the space, they revised that budget to approximately $20 million of one-time expenditures to be made in relation to the three disruptive macro trends mentioned above. This will equate to roughly $0.14 per share in fiscal 2014 mostly occurring in the second half of the year.(Source: Company Investor Presentation)ValuationBroadridge is fairly cheap in an absolute sense, but given the upside catalysts and optionality with the new joint venture to greatly expand outside of North America, it's very compelling and presents a great entry point for investors. The company sports a 2.3% dividend yield, net debt of $284 million, and free cash flow of $243 million. This is despite a decent move in the shares over the last year. However, there is still plenty of upside left as I shall detail.Given the potential for upside acceleration in both earnings and revenues aided by decent margin expansion, I ran several scenarios for the next few years. The below base case scenario projects mid single digit top line growth and decent margin expansion of 400 bps which is driven by lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues and operating leverage due to scaling.Base Case(Source: Author's Calculation)The upside is over 40% as the company begins to realize greater free cash flow and operating leverage boosts EBITDA margins. Additionally, the company has been reducing shares through company buybacks. Since 2009, diluted weighted average shares outstanding have been reduced by approximately 13%. As the company throws off more cash, I expect to see them expend more on their buybacks given their cost of debt. Given they are now investment grade, having been upgraded in 2009, they can now borrow at lower rates and repurchase their shares. For instance, they could buy back $500 million worth of shares that are paying 2.3% in dividends by issuing $500 million of 5-year debt and pay a similar rate (2.3% to 2.4%) while capturing an interest deduction. See the yield curves for corporate credits of similar rating:(Source: Bloomberg)Financial engineering aside, the company still is very shareholder friendly using any excess cash to reduce share count while increasing their dividend payout by 44% per year since they initiated the distribution back in 2007. Excluding the initial low payout, they have still increased their dividend payout at a 22% annual growth rate.Bull CaseThe more favorable case simply extends the potential success of their overseas expansion and creates more margin expansion from operating leverage. You can see that I'm not forecasting outrageous top line growth or necessarily tremendous margin expansion either.(Source: Author's Calculation)Bear CaseThe bear case is the most compelling as it details where the market believes the stock is likely headed. The analysis below simply uses a terminal rate for future top line growth and assumes zero operating leverage, which in my mind would require a major stumble either macro-economically or a company-specific risk occurring. However, given how well Broadridge performed during the last recession with revenue only falling by 7% peak-to-trough, this assumption is just too hard to accept.The intrinsic value under this overly conservative scenario comes out at approximately $36 per share, just 2% below the current trading price. This clearly illustrates the potential asymmetric risk-return opportunity that exists in the shares.(Source: Author's Calculation)Below is Bloomberg's calculation for the weighted average cost of capital which is used in my discounted cash flow models above and can be a primary driver of ridiculous intrinsic values. The screen also shows the value creation generated by the firm with an ROIC of 18.2% creating an EVA spread of 9.25%.(Source: Bloomberg Terminal's WACC Function)Another potential cause for investor caution has been the wait for SEC approval of the NYSE Proxy Working Group's fee recommendations. This has been hanging over the firm for a year as some analysts and investors claimed they may reject the proposal and increase anxiety over potential pricing pressures over the next several years. Here are comments from CEO Richard Daly on the first quarter conference call regarding the approval:Clearly, the market is not appreciating the potential of the company and is unmistakably ignoring the potential of the new joint venture that will expand their operations overseas.CatalystsUpside catalysts to realize their intrinsic value include:RisksConclusionThe firm stands to benefit substantially from banks and investment houses cutting costs and outsourcing more non-core functions. Broadridge management attempts to paint the picture of a company with very stable, recurring revenue that is partially protected from volatility within the financial markets. While that may be true, I do think that they have a tendency to understate future potential by doing so. Investors also have an inclination to believe the industry headwinds that banks and investment firms face will harm Broadridge's profitability when just the opposite is true. The new trading regulatory requirements like TARGET2-securities (T2S) and CSDR/T+2, are likely to continue the trend towards more compliance and regulatory costs for banks and other financial institutions. The new joint venture with Accenture expands their BPO capabilities to address these very issues on a global scale and are potentially a significant upside catalyst to the shares going forward. I can see the stock trading somewhere in the $50's by this time next year with very little market help.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1333651,21523,2013-04-10T18:46:54-04:00,,"Broadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE:BR) is a provider of services to the financial industry, particularly broker-dealers, mutual fund management firms and publicly reporting companies. The firm has two business units. The first is Investor Communication Services (ICS), by far the larger at 71% of revenues and 73% of earnings. ICS deals largely with the processing and distribution of proxy materials, from paper or electronic delivery to tabulating votes on shareholder actions. This is not the only service though, with other offerings including distributing regulatory reports, corporate event notices, marketing communications, fund prospectuses, account statements, trade confirmations, and so forth.The second unit is Securities Processing Solutions, or SPS, which was 29% of sales and 27% of earnings in fiscal 2012. SPS consists of an outsourced set of services for trade order execution, confirmation and accounting, as well as tools for aggregating and reporting portfolio data and performance. Using Broadridge allows brokers to avoid building out costly and troublesome infrastructure to support the basic back-end processes of electronic trading.If I had to pick one word to describe Broadridge, it would be ""stable."" The company has some very strong competitive advantages. ICS handles proxies for 85% of the outstanding shares in the U.S., and 60% globally, dwarfing any competitors. SPS offerings are involved in $4.5 trillion in trades per day. The vast majority of revenues are recurring in nature, and Broadridge sports a nifty 99% client retention ratio. While event-driven communications and trading volumes affect revenues year-to-year, Broadridge rarely sees more than mid-single digit percentage fluctuations in sales. Stability, again, is the word here.Growth, on the other hand, is more difficult. The securities and brokerage industries are quite mature in the U.S., and with increasing consolidation, there is little in the way of organic growth opportunity for Broadridge. The company has responded by looking for ""tuck-in"" acquisitions, such as Paladyne and Matrix, to build out SPS offerings in 2011. However, Broadridge is not an aggressive acquirer, and as such I don't expect a lot of revenue growth here, perhaps in the 5-7% range annually moving forward.As a slow growing, cash producing, competitively advantaged company should do, Broadridge rewards its shareholders mainly by returning cash. The firm has reduced shares by a 3.4% annual rate over the past few years, and pays a 3.1% dividend that is well-covered and easily raised, at just a 26% payout of free cash flow. In fact, the company has tripled its dividend since going public in 2007, raising it each year along the way. I expect both share buybacks and dividend hikes to continue.Broadridge is no doubt a solid company, but as an investment opportunity it comes down to the price. And here is where I feel the investment case comes up short. At just an 8% EBIT/EV earnings yield, Broadridge is not especially cheap. Even assuming Broadridge returns to 13-15% margins after posting a 12% figure last year (largely on short-term transitional issues related to Penson's bankruptcy), the stock isn't that cheap against its historical 9.5% yield average. Even a discounted free cash flow calculation, assuming about 5% long-term growth, gives me a price of about $25. With the stock in the mid-$23 range, that's not enough margin of safety. I'd get interested if Broadridge got under $20. But for now we'll just throw out the ""neutral"" opinion - it looks about fairly valued. We're looking for better opportunities.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

286440,20568,2011-08-10T15:26:44-04:00,,"Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (NYSE:BR) is scheduled to announce its fourth quarter fiscal 2011 results on  August 11, 2011. There were no changes in analysts’ estimates in recent  months.Third Quarter OverviewBroadridge delivered decent third quarter results, beating the Zacks  Consensus Estimate on both the top and bottom lines. The quarter’s  adjusted earnings came in at 25 cents per share, which was 6 cents above  of our expectation. The quarter’s beat was attributed to higher  recurring revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses and a  higher tax rate.Broadridge reported a 38.4% year-over-year increase in its quarterly  revenue, aided by recurring revenues from acquisitions. However, the  improvement was partially offset by lower contribution from event-driven  mutual fund proxy fee revenues. The Investor Communication Solutions  segment posted marginal growth due to dampening of event-driven mutual  fund proxy revenues. But the Securities Processing Solutions segment  showed decent growth on the strength in new business, offset by the  carryover impact of fiscal 2009 client losses and price concessions.Increased investment in acquisitions, lower event-driven mutual fund  proxy revenues and higher operating expenses were responsible for the  margin contraction.Full Year GuidanceFor fiscal 2011, Broadridge reiterated its earnings guidance of $1.30  to $1.40 per share. Management expects free cash flow (including costs  related to the Penson transaction and the International Business Machines Inc. (NYSE:IBM) data center services agreement) in the range of $140.0 million to $200.0 million (previously $131.0–$189.0 million).Agreement of AnalystsOut of the four analysts providing estimates for the fourth quarter and  fiscal 2011, none revised estimates in the last seven days. A similar  situation was noticed for fiscal 2012 and there were no changes to  estimates since the third quarter results.The analysts expect continued weakness in mutual fund event-driven  revenue and associated distribution revenue to lead to lower top-line  generation for Broadridge in the coming quarters.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsOver the past ninety days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  was reduced by a penny to 91 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate  increased 2 cents to $1.36 for fiscal 2011 and dropped 3 cents for  fiscal 2012 in the same time period.RecommendationWe remain optimistic on Broadridge’s strategic acquisitions and  potential product launches. But management’s commentary on lackluster  event-driven mutual fund proxy revenue keeps us cautious.Some analysts are of the opinion that Broadridge has a number of  drivers that will benefit earnings over the next two years. They find  themselves confident on BR's ability to earn roughly 30 cents per share  in 2013 due to its strategic initiatives. The analysts believe revenue  could benefit as the company's strategic acquisitions continue to do  well.Stiff competition from HD Supply, DST Systems Inc. (NYSE:DST) and State Street Corp. (NYSE:STT) is a concern.Currently, Broadridge has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold recommendation."
2902536,54942,2015-02-11T16:00:00-05:00,"Management has re-positioned the company towards higher growth areas dispelling the notion that it's a mature, slow-growth business.The company's recent investor day highlighted a continued commitment to strong shareholder returns with substantial dividend payouts.Valuation has come closer into line with our expectations for future growth. We still think the shares are a compelling investment, just not asymmetric any longer.","Our call on Broadridge Solutions (NYSE:BR) last April was well timed as since then, the shares have returned nearly 40%. Our thesis was predicated on the cheap valuation, accelerated strategic investments broadening out the portfolio, SEC approval of NYSE Proxy Working Group's fee recommendations, and the joint venture with Accenture to expand BR's overseas footprint. Some of those catalysts have begun to play out which we believe is the fundamental reasoning for the shares moving higher.Commitment to Strong Shareholder ReturnsWe pointed to the company's strong commitment to shareholder returns with a strong use of cash flow to buy back shares and payout dividends. On its recent investor day - its first in over three years - the company pledged top quartile total shareholder returns in the low-to-mid teens by achieving approximately 10% EPS growth, plus a dividend yield in the 3% to 4% range when including share buybacks. Since going public, Broadridge management noted the 13% CAGR in total shareholder return compared to the 7% for the broader index.We think the business model is a key factor in those returns as the company is a cash generating machine with strong and steady free cash flows. The use of those free cash flows has allowed the firm to retire over 12% of its outstanding shares since the end of 2009. At the same time, it has increased its dividend payout from $0.28 per share to the current $0.96 run rate, a 25% CAGR.The company noted that it expects to generate an additional $1.2 billion in cash generation through 2017 after dividends through the increased free cash flow generation and some additional leverage. We think the free cash flow generation will allow the firm to target additional acquisitions over the next few years, some of which could be strongly accretive. We also believe that the additional cash and leverage will be used to drive the business faster towards the opportunities within the secular trends within the industry.Concentrating On Industry Evolution A Focus of ManagementThe company focused on the industry landscape which has been evolving due to the regulatory pressures within the financial services industry. Financial institutions are suffering from reduced ROEs due to increased costs and lower leverage ratios. Broadridge management noted a strong drive towards streamlining non-differentiating industry capabilities. This is the largest piece of the $24 billion addressable market opportunity that management has assessed.The second aspect of the evolution that they are witnessing resides within the digitization of technologies that enable lower cost but offer better customer service through higher touch interactions. Management estimates that clients still spend around $20 billion annually on paper and could benefit tremendously from a shift towards digitization. The last piece is within the growth in Data and Analytics which create value through unique intelligence that allows managers to make better and more timely decisions in real-time.We have noted in several of our pieces how the financial industry is being shackled with balls and chains in order to attempt to avert another financial crisis. This has led to greater costs and lower returns on equity due to depressed profitability. Company figures within its investor day presentation estimate that Basel 2.5 and 3 have depressed ROEs by 700 bps and that upcoming regulations will decline ROEs by another 300 to 700 bps. Thus, we think the industry will need these new industry technologies more than ever.(Source: Investor Presentation Dec 2014)Second Quarter Results Point To Continued MomentumThe company posted strong revenue growth in the quarter besting the Street's expectations by 4.3% with adjusted EPS also nicely ahead by 14% at $0.32 per share. The growth was mainly attributable to EBIT margin growth which hit 10.2%. Management believes that puts them on track to achieve their full-year target of 17.4% to 17.8% with the seasonally-higher second half margins yet to arrive.We estimate that the company was able to grow margins through product mix shift, operating leverage, and productivity initiatives that from 2011 to 2014, grew EBIT margins by 110 bps. We think the company can achieve another 50-75 bps over the next three years - conservatively estimating. Most of that will come from operating leverage given its new $600 million of debt issuance in order to raise the operating leverage from 1.0x to 2.0x.The business has clearly turned a corner with strong closed recurring sales revenue in the quarter, rising 111% to $49 million. This was a record second quarter result and added to the year-to-date total of +112% or $81 million. We were impressed by the quarter's big win with Scottrade, to provide both trade processing and client communication solutions. This was a large win for the company and likely to lead to additional client wins. Included in the quarter was the second client for the APTP (Accenture Post-Trade Processing Platform), the overseas joint venture with Accenture that were referred to in our prior write-up.The company also announced two acquisitions in the quarter, TwoFour and M&T Wilmington Trade Processing. While both are small tuck-ins, they will add approximately $20 million in total revenue to the consolidated company. As we noted above, the company is targeting between $400 million and $600 million of acquisition spend through 2017. Broadridge did not disclose the purchase price of the acquisitions, but given revenue generations, we would be surprised if they exceeded $100 million.ValuationGiven that the share price has hit our 'base case' scenario target of $52, we would argue that they are now better (more accurately) priced. While no longer an asymmetric risk-reward opportunity, we think the shares still represent significant value for investors. This is due to the shifting dynamics of the company which now contains a much better growth profile. From fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2014, the company, through acquisitions and structural shifts, was able to reposition towards faster growing areas of the industry. The growth portion of its profile rose from 10% to 25% over that time period. Management indicates that this can be increased another 1000 bps to 35% by 2017.When we first looked at the company, the shares traded at less than 9.0x EV/EBITDA, a paltry sum for a quality business with strong recurring revenue and upside catalysts. Fiscal 2016 EBITDA has been moving higher by the sell-side, which we anticipated would happen. Over the last four weeks, EBITDA estimates have risen to $645 million, up from $620 million at the start of the calendar year. We think there is still some leg room there as our estimates would argue for another 2%-3% increase in that figure.Our intrinsic value target has moved up a bit to $60, mostly on the calendar roll as nearly a year has passed since our original analysis. We think the firm can earn $665 million in adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2016, which starts July 1 of this year. We used a 11.9x multiple on that, compared to 12.5x for the peer group - in order to ensure some conservatism in the shares. In addition, we used net debt of $686 million, which forecasts $476 million of debt issuance between now and the end of fiscal 2016.ConclusionThe run in Broadridge has been strong with significant earnings growth along with multiple expansion. In fact, the EV/EBITDA ratio has risen from 7.0x at the start of 2011 to the current 12.9x. We estimate that EPS growth over the next three years will average 12.5%, thus our assessment is that the outsized gains are likely gone from here. However, the stock still represents a compelling core holding for portfolios looking for defensive, well-run businesses that are generating strong cash flows and who are optimizing their balance sheets for prime operating performance. What was once a mature and stagnant business is now being rightly recognized for the evolution into more of a growth industry. We just think it is now accurately priced as such."

237975,20069,2010-11-21T07:23:49-05:00,,"Broadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE:BR), the former Brokerage Services  division of ADP spun off in 2007, wields inordinate power (a near  absolute monopoly) in the realm of proxy services — an unsexy but  crucial component of capital markets. Most disturbing is Broadridge’s  heretofore ostensible disregard of shareholder concerns about its web  delivery platform for virtual annual meetings. For background and  evidence of the perils of virtual (especially virtual-only) shareholder  meetings, please see my recent coverage of Symantec  (SYMC). To its credit, Symantec has since listened to shareholders and  shareholder rights activists, all capital market stakeholders, and will  offer a hybrid (live, in-person and virtual) meeting format.Nevertheless, Broadridge’s inferior technology for delivering virtual  meetings remains an unresolved matter, and it was conspicuously on  display this past Tuesday at Broadridge’s own virtual-only annual  meeting. Glyn Holton, founder and executive director of the United States Proxy Exchange (USPX), was granted a proxy to attend. He documents his precarious experience in “Broadridge Smokes Their Own Dope (pdf).”  With such far reaching consequences given the inadequacy of  Broadridge’s technology, and unfortunately the potential for more  virtual-only meetings, this is a must-read; and after all, most  individuals own stocks in some shape or form. While technology  should be affording shareholders ever greater transparency and  accessibility, in fact, in this case it is insidiously driving  disenfranchisement.Disclosure: No positions in BR, ADP, or SYMC. Author is a member  of the United States Proxy Exchange. USPX is a grassroots movement  funded entirely by individual investors seeking to facilitate shareowner  rights."
239706,20643,2010-12-02T09:38:13-05:00,,"For the past two years, Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (NYSE:BR) CEO Richard Daly has been talking to analysts about the promise of his pet project – the company’s proprietary Investor Network shareholder forum that has failed to gain market acceptance.Now he is ratcheting up the rhetoric and angling to have the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issue a mandate that all companies be required to offer a shareholder forum, for which his company would conveniently be the only service provider, at fees ranging between $20,000 and $50,000 per company per year.In an unusually direct and strongly worded news release yesterday, the Broadridge CEO “called on the SEC to give public companies the right to social media technology to communicate with their shareholders.”That apparent right for public companies is little more than spin for giving investors a universal right to shareholder forums — and giving Broadridge the exclusive role of gatekeeper and the ability to print money due to its monopoly access to brokerage client records.SEC Already Approved Shareholder Forums NetworksAs things stand, nothing prevents companies from sponsoring a shareholder forum or using Broadridge’s Investor Network. They already have the “right” because on January 18, 2008,  the SEC adopted new Rule 14a-17 and an amendment to Rule 14a-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to “facilitate the use of electronic shareholder forums by public companies and their shareholders.” In fact, it was following the adoption of that rule that Broadridge developed its proprietary Investor Network, using expensive software from white label social networking provider Telligent Systems in Dallas, Texas. However, the Investor Network has never taken off. Only a handful of companies have used the shareholder forum feature as part of their full or hybrid virtual annual meetings. And investors have never taken to the service in any meaningful way. In fact, as I write this, there has only been one comment on the public Investor Network site in the past 3 months. The Investor Network’s failure to gain organic adoption is most likely because it is created to serve Broadridge’s proprietary interests, which run counter to the fundamental principles of a successful social network. Mandate Strategy Discussed in 2008 Call With Analysts Now Broadridge’s Daly is acting on a strategy he first discussed more than two years ago in a conference call on August 14, 2008. In the call, he made it clear that if the Investor Network did not take off via an “opt-in” process, then an SEC mandate would be his other option. To quote from a transcript of that conference call (emphasis added): “The activity here is really going to be driven by, is the SEC going to deem that this is something that shareholders need to have the right to. And if that was the case, then I can’t imagine it getting done any other way than through the plumbing we have in place, and again that’s a chasm between us and any one else, no one else is close to connecting every investor to every public company.”Note the difference in emphasis between yesterday and two years ago. While Daly was yesterday talking about companies having a right, what he was telling investors two years ago is that the SEC would need to give shareholders the right — and if they did so, Broadridge would have the market almost to itself.Had Conversations With SEC Chair In the release and a speech yesterday at a conference held by Hofstra University’s Frank Zarb School of Business, Daly made it clear that he want’s the SEC to mandate shareholder forums. “Some believe we can wait and see. They believe these developments, if they have merit, will take hold by themselves,” he told a crowd of business people. “But the truth is that changing the paradigm rapidly for all investors will require regulatory support. ” Previously, the Broadridge CEO has let it be known that he has been talking about this at the highest levels of the SEC. Last month in an earnings call with analysts, he said: “I have actually had conversations directly… I am relatively certain with every commissioner and, of course, Mary, the chair, Mary Shapiro.” It would be a big mistake for the SEC to mandate a forum anything like Broadridge’s Investor Forum. The success of any social network or forum is driven by market dynamics. It cannot be created by regulators, no matter how good their intentions. Anonymity on Investor Network Undermines Accountability What is clear is that without a regulatory mandate from the SEC, Broadridge’s Investor Network will never be successful because it fails to recognize fundamental social media principles. Broadridge has built its system around anonymous participation. Using its monopoly access to Street Name shareholder records, Broadridge validates that individuals are indeed shareholders, but it permits them to be nameless by default. This reliance on anonymity, which helps to protect Broadridge’s exclusive access to the shareholders’  information, is a fundamental flaw in their approach to social networking.  Anonymity is widely recognized as the root cause of what causes traditional chat message boards to be so unreliable and unruly. Anonymity undermines accountability, trust and confidence. When someone attends an annual meeting, they cannot be totally anonymous. That lack of anonymity is what gives the proceedings legitimacy. The only aspect of an annual meeting that requires anonymity is the actual voting process. Discussion, questions and conversation cannot be conducted with any legitimacy in an anonymous forum. The reason social networks like Facebook and Twitter work is because they promote personal accountability by creating disincentives for people to be anonymous. Indeed, Facebook does not permit users to be anonymous. And while people can be anonymous on Twitter, such accounts rarely gain much influence. Investor Network is Not a Neutral Venue In an anonymous forum, especially one paid for by companies and controlled by their agent Broadridge, opportunities for abuse are real. Company employees can influence the forum without shareholders having any idea who they are. As things stand, Broadridge’s shareholder forums are typically held in private and are not accessible to the public at large, even as observers. This further undermines their legitimacy and leaves them vulnerable to abuse. Another fundamental flaw is that Broadridge’s system classifies participants based on the size of their ownership stake. This exacerbates retail shareholders’ perceptionsthat their participation in the annual meeting process is meaningless because they have little economic or voting influence. Real social networks are level playing fields, where identifiable participants have a reasonably equal say and are judged by the substance and coherence of their arguments, not by the size of their bank accounts. Yet, Broadridge’s Daly wants regulators, investors and company executives to believe that his Investor Network is the answer to dwindling retail participation in the annual meeting process. It’s a hollow argument. The fact is, nothing prevents companies and their directors from directly engaging with shareholders and other stakeholders in neutral venues like Facebook or Twitter if they are willing to abide by the SEC’s rules and the community’s expectations. The only time Broadridge needs to validate a shareowner is when it comes time for them to cast their ballots. Based on recent problems at the company’s own annual meeting, that’s where Daly and Broadridge’s board should focus their attention.      Disclosure: None"

The purpose of the model is to establish a baseline for identifying  surprises, positive or negative, in the quarterly results the company  will report.  Estimates for each line of the Income Statement are derived from management's guidance, the company's historical financial results, and other publicly available data.We begin by reviewing background information about Broadridge and the business environment in which it is currently operating.Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. provides brokerage and other services to financial companies.  In 2009, Broadridge was ranked the top Brokerage Services Outsourcing Provider for the second consecutive year in the Black Book of Outsourcing. Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ: ADP) spun off Broadridge on 30 March 2007.  (GCFR articles related to ADP can be found here.)  Broadridge earned $190 million ($225 million from continuing operations)  in fiscal 2010, which ended in June, on revenue of $2.2 billion.  The  company earned $223 million and had revenue of $2.1 billion in 2009. The market value of Broadridge is currently about $3.1 billion. Broadridge, for financial data reporting, divides its operations into two business segments:  Investor Communication Solutions (ICS) and Securities Processing Solutions (SPS).   The ICS segment, which contributed more than 75 percent of Broadridge's revenue and pretax earnings in fiscal 2010, distributes and processes proxies for public companies and mutual funds.The  SPS business, as described by the company, provides real-time transaction processing services,  including order capture and execution, trade confirmation, settlement  and accounting to financial institutions to support global trading of  equity, option, mutual fund, and fixed income securities.  Broadridge in  fiscal 2010 ""processed on average over 1.5 million equity trades per day and over $3.5 trillion in fixed income trades per day of U.S. and Canadian securities."" [emphasis added]Last year, Broadridge reached a seven-year agreement with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney to provide ""customer communications services.""  MSSB combines the wealth management businesses of Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) with those of Citi Smith Barney.Broadridge sold its Securities Clearing business, in a deal that closed in June 2010, to Penson Worldwide (NASDAQ: PNSN).   The final purchase price, in income and equity securities, was $35.2  million.  As part of the transaction, Penson has hired Broadridge to  provide securities processing and other services.In May 2010, Standard & Poor's raised Broadridge's credit rating to BBB-/A-2 from BBB-/A-3, with a stable outlook.  Fitch Ratings on 1 July 2010 upgraded Broadridge's credit rating from ""BBB"" to ""BBB+,"" with a stable outlook.  Fitch noted that  Broadridge's cash flow should be more stable as a result of the deal  with Penson.Broadridge's board in August hiked its annual dividend 7 percent to $0.60 per share.  The board also authorized the repurchase  of 10 million shares of the company's common stock.  Broadridge had  138 million shares outstanding, on a fully diluted basis, in June 2010.Broadridge Financial earned $0.76 per diluted share on a GAAP basis in fiscal 2010's fourth quarter, which ended 30 June.  Earnings per share were 7.5 percent less than the $0.83 Broadridge made in the same quarter of 2009.Earnings  from continuing operations were $0.84 per share in the June 2010  quarter, up from $0.82 one year earlier.  The securities clearing  business, which was treated as a discontinued operation, lost $0.08 per  share, after tax, in the quarter.Broadridge's earnings are always highest in the June quarter of each year. Readers wanting to take another look at Broadridge's June 2010 quarter might wish to review our Income Statement analysis. We're now ready to look specifically at the September 2010 quarter.Broadridge provided its guidance for fiscal 2011, which will end next June, when it reported fourth-quarter results in August.The one-to-four percent Revenue  growth guidance, applied to fiscal 2010's Revenue of $2.209 billion,  yields a fiscal 2011 range between $2.23 billion and $2.30 billion.  We  have selected $2.25 billion as a Revenue target for the year.September  quarters, which are the first of each new fiscal year, have provided  between 19 percent and 22 percent of Broadridge's annual Revenue since  the company became independent.For the September 2010 quarter,  we are estimating that Revenue will equal 20.5 percent of the year's  forecast total.  This translates into 0.205 * $2.25 billion = $461  million.Broadridge's Gross Margin  has been close to 23 percent of Revenue in most of its September  quarters.  We would have assumed a similar margin in the September 2010  quarter, but the company's guidance refers to additional costs and lower  profits, especially in the first half of the fiscal year.  We are,  therefore, using a slightly more conservative 22 percent Gross Margin in  our estimates.  This percentage translates into a Cost of Goods Sold -- called Cost of Net Revenues by Broadridge -- equal to (1 - 0.22) * $461 million = $360 million.Sales, General, and Administrative  expenses in previous September quarters have been between 11 and 12  percent of Revenue, with an average value closer to the top of the  range.   We will stick with 12 percent for the most recent quarter, so  our estimate for SG&A is 0.12 * $461 million = $55 million.We are also making a provision for $5 million in restructuring expenses related to the Penson deal.Rolling up these estimates for Revenue and Operating Expenses, we arrive at a projected Operating Income of $41 million.  This is 11 percent less than Operating Income of $46 million in the September 2009 quarter.If we assume a $3 million net expense for non-operating items, pretax income would be $38 million.  If the Income Tax Rate is 38 percent, Net Income  in the quarter will be $23.6 million (about $0.18 per share), compared  to $26.4 million ($0.19 per share) in the September 2009 quarter.We haven't assumed any income or loss from the discontinued Securities Clearing business.Please click here  to see a normalized depiction of the projected results next to  Broadridge's quarterly Income Statements for the last couple of years.   Please note that our organization of revenues, expenses, gains, and  losses, which we use for all analyses, can and often does differ in  material respects from company-used formats.  The standardization  facilitates cross-company comparisons.Full disclosure: Long BR and ADP at time of writing."

This amount of  shares is presently worth approximately $200 million.  Broadridge had  about 140 million shares outstanding in March 2010.In  May 2010, Standard & Poor's raised Broadridge's credit rating  to BBB-/A-2 from BBB-/A-3, with a stable outlook.

City Networks is a ""provider of reconciliation, multi-asset  process automation and operational risk management solutions to the  global financial services industry.""In  the third quarter of fiscal 2010,  which ended 31 March, Broadridge earned $0.18 per diluted share on a GAAP basis, down from $0.29 per share in the  same quarter of 2009. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.22 in  the latest quarter. We are now ready to look specifically  at the fourth fiscal quarter.Broadridge updated its guidance for  the remainder of fiscal 2010, which will end in June, when it reported third quarter results in May.Broadridge's Revenue is much higher in June quarters  than in any other period.Before doing anything with the  guidance for revenue growth, we needed to learn whether it applied to  revenue from the Securities Clearing business in either the current year  or in fiscal 2009.  The answer was found in a presentation given by Broadridge during its last earnings conference call:  the guidance, refined to 7 ±  0.5 percent, applies to continuing operations only, and the 2009 Revenue  baseline is $2.073 billion.The company's Revenue guidance for  the entirety of fiscal 2010 is, therefore, $2.218 billion, give or take  about $10 million.  Revenue from continuing operations in the first  three quarters of fiscal 2010 was $1.459 billion.  This leaves $2.218  billion - $1.459 billion = $759 million for the fourth quarter.The  Gross Margin has  been between 31 and 33 percent of Revenue in the four previous June  quarters.  We will assume a 32 percent margin for the latest quarter,  which leads to an estimate for the Cost of  Goods Sold -- called Cost of Net Revenues by Broadridge -- of (1 -  0.32) * $759 million = $516.1 million.With these estimates, we project  Operating Income of $182.2 million.  This is 5.7 percent less than Operating Income in  the June 2009 quarter.If we assume a $4 million net expense for  non-operating items, pretax income would be $178.2 million.  If the  Income Tax Rate is 37 percent,  Net Income in the  quarter will be $112.2 million ($0.81 per share), compared to $116.9  million ($0.83 per share) in the June 2009 quarter.Our  fourth-quarter estimate would lead to full-year Net Income from  continuing operations of $221.1 million, about $1.59 per share.  This is  near the bottom of the company's guidance.  Perhaps we were a little  conservative with some estimates, but we've sharpened our pencils and  are comfortable with the numbers used.We  haven't assumed any income or loss from the discontinued Securities  Clearing business.Please  click here to see a full-sized,  normalized depiction of the projected results next to Broadridge's  quarterly Income Statements for the last couple of years.

In November, we   examined Broadridge's Income Statement for the September quarter and compared the entries on each line to our ""look-ahead"" estimates.  We later performed a financial gauge analysis of Broadridge, which determined that the GCFR Overall gauge fell from 51 to 35 of the 100 possible points.   We have now modeled Broadridge's Income Statement for the quarter that will end on 31 December 2009.  The intent of this exercise was to produce a baseline for identifying deviations, positive or negative, in the actual data that the company will announce in February 2010.  GCFR estimates are derived from trends in the historical financial results and guidance provided by company management.   First, we set the stage with some background information about Broadridge and the business environment in which it is currently operating.    Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. provides investor communication, securities processing, and clearing services to financial companies.  Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADP) spun off Broadridge on 30 March 2007.    The Investor Communication Solutions business segment contributed more than 70 percent of Broadridge's revenue and pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2009.  This segment distributes and processes proxies for public companies and mutual funds.   Broadridge was listed as  the top         Brokerage Services Outsourcing Provider for the second consecutive year in the Black Book of Outsourcing.  According to the company's 10-K annual report, Broadridge's Securities Processing business in fiscal 2009 ""processed on average over 1.6 million equity trades and over $3 trillion in trades of United States (U.S.) fixed income securities per day."" [emphasis added]  Broadridge is selling its securities clearing business to Penson Worldwide (NASDAQ: PNSN) and a related company.  Broadridge will receive Penson debt and shares.  As part of this transaction, which is expected to close in 2010, Broadridge will provide specified securities processing and other services to Penson.   In addition, Broadridge announced it had reached a new seven-year agreement to provide ""customer communications services"" to  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.  This firm combines the wealth management businesses of Morgan Stanley with those of  Citi Smith Barney.  Earlier in 2009, the company said it lost out on almost $20 million in annual Revenue when Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) decided to ""perform its equity securities processing in-house after its acquisition of a firm [Merrill Lynch] that has its own processing capabilities.""  In April, Standard & Poor's raised Broadridge's credit rating to BBB-/A-3 from BB+/B, with a positive outlook.   Broadridge doubled its dividend in August and authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock.   We are now ready to look specifically at the current quarter.    Broadridge revised its  guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2010, which will end next June, when it reported first quarter results last November.In fiscal 2009, Revenue was $2.15 billion.  Given the guidance of 6 to 8 percent growth, Broadridge expects Revenue in the new fiscal year between $2.28 billion and $2.32 billion. Note that Broadridge's annual Revenue is not distributed evenly across the year.  In the last four years, the December quarter contributed an average of 20.7 percent of annual Revenue.  Our Revenue target for the quarter, $476 million, was calculated by applying the seasonality factor (20.7 percent) to the midpoint of the Revenue range ($2.3 billion).The Gross Margin has averaged 24.2 percent in the previous four December quarters, and we will assume a similar proportion in the current quarter.  Given our Revenue estimate, the Cost of Goods Sold -- called Cost of Net Revenues on Broadridge's Income Statement -- is estimated to be (1 - 0.242) * $476 million = $361 million.  Sales, General, and Administrative expenses are typically around 13 percent of Revenue in December.  Therefore, our estimate for SG&A is 0.13 * $476 million = $62 million. With these estimates, we project Operating Income of $53.3 million.  This is 12.9 percent more than Operating Income in the December 2008 quarter.Over the last eight quarters, Broadridge's non-operating income and expenses averaged a net loss of about $4 million.  This figure, if realized in the current quarter, would bring pretax income down to $49.6 million.  If the Income Tax Rate is 37.5 percent, Net Income in the quarter would be $31 million ($0.22 per share), compared to $29.9 million ($0.21 per share) in the December 2008 quarter.Please note that we have not made any provisions in the current quarter for the Penson loss or the foreign tax credit.Please click here to see a full-sized, normalized depiction of the projected results next to Broadridge's quarterly Income Statements for the last couple of years.

This post examines the Income Statement for the quarter in the earnings announcement, and it compares the entries on each line to our ""look-ahead"" estimates. Our target for Broadridge's Net Income in the latest quarter was $0.22 per share.  In a second article, we will report Broadridge's  scores as measured by the GCFR financial gauges.  The follow-up post will also provide the latest figures for the various financial metrics we use to analyze Cash Management, Growth, Profitability and Value.

Please note that our organization of revenues, expenses, gains, and losses, which we use for all analyses, can and often does differ in material respects from company-used formats.  The standardization facilitates cross-company comparisons. Revenue in the September 2009 quarter was 3.1 percent less than in the year-earlier period.  We expected Revenue to fall only 0.5 percent. Our estimate was based on the company's guidance for the fiscal year (4 to 8 percent growth) and a seasonality factor that accounts for the uneven distribution of Revenue over the year.   Broadridge blamed the Revenue decline on decreased distribution activities in the Investor Communication Solutions business, the loss of some clients, price concessions to retain other clients, and unfavorable foreign currency exchanges.   On a more positive note, new business activities brought in higher fees, and there were more Revenue-producing ""events"" such as mutual fund proxies.  Cost of Net Revenues -- we call it Cost of Goods Sold -- was 77.6 percent of Revenue. This translates into a Gross Margin of 22.4 percent, down from 23.2 percent last year. We had expected the margin to be 23.5 percent in the latest quarter.  The lower-than-expected margin may be due to the loss of high-margin customer services and to price concessions.  Sales, General, and Administrative expenses were 12.3 percent of Revenue in the quarter, up from 12.0 percent in the year-earlier quarter.  Our target for the SG&A expenses was 11.5 percent of Revenue, so actual costs were more than we expected.  Operating Income, which we define as   the difference between Revenue and the operating expenses identified above, was 12.5 percent less than the amount attained in last year's September quarter. We were overly optimistic in expecting a 7.0 percent gain. Revenue was less than our estimate, the Gross Margin was lower than expected, and SG&A expenses were more than we forecast.  Other, non-operating items such as interest and foreign exchange summed to a $3.8 million net expense in the September quarter, a little better than we expected.   The Income Tax Rate was 37.6 percent in the quarter, slightly less burdensome than the 38 percent we expected.  At the bottom line, Net Income was 25.8 percent below its value in the September 2008 period. We had projected a decrease of 9.4 percent.    The earnings announcement repeatedly mentions that the results of the September quarter were consistent with expectations. We had forecast better numbers, from top to bottom, based on our interpretation of the guidance for the fiscal year and historical trends.  Along with the earnings news, Broadridge announced it agreed to sell ""clearing client contracts"" to Penson Worldwide (NASDAQ: PNSN) and a related company.  As part of this arrangement, Broadridge to will provide specified securities processing and other services to Penson.  Broadridge reported that this transaction is a part of the company's ""strategy to exit the securities clearing business.""  In addition, Broadridge announced it had reached a new seven-year agreement to provide ""customer communications services"" to  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.  This firm combines the wealth management businesses of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) with those of Citi (NYSE:C) Smith Barney.  Full disclosure: Long BR at time of writing."
196881,23050,2010-04-04T02:18:32-04:00,,"We begin by reviewing  background information about Broadridge and  the business environment in  which it is currently operating.   Broadridge  Financial Solutions, Inc. provides investor   communication, securities processing, and clearing services to financial   companies.  Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ: ADP) spun off Broadridge on 30 March   2007.  (GCFR articles related to ADP can be   found here.)  Broadridge earned $223 million on Revenue  of $2.1 billion in fiscal  2009, which ended last June.  The Investor Communication Solutions business, which   distributes and processes proxies for public companies and mutual funds, contributed   more than 70 percent of Broadridge's revenue and pre-tax earnings in   fiscal 2009.  In 2009, Broadridge was listed as the   top Brokerage Services Outsourcing Provider for the second   consecutive year in the Black Book of  Outsourcing.  According to the company's  10-K annual  report, Broadridge's Securities   Processing business in fiscal 2009 ""processed on average over 1.6   million equity trades and over $3 trillion in trades of United   States (U.S.) fixed income securities per day."" [emphasis added]  The  company's current market  capitalization is  about $2.9 billion.  In April 2009, Standard  & Poor's raised  Broadridge's credit   rating to BBB-/A-3 from BB+/B, with a positive outlook. Broadridge  doubled its dividend in August   2009 and authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of its   outstanding common stock.   The Securities Clearing business is being sold to Penson Worldwide (NASDAQ: PNSN)  and a related company.   Broadridge will receive Penson debt and  shares.  As part of this  transaction, which is expected to close before  fiscal 2010 concludes in  June, Broadridge will provide specified  securities processing and  other services to Penson.  Broadridge has  started to treat the results  of the securities clearing business as a  discontinued operation.    In addition, Broadridge announced it  had reached a new seven-year  agreement to provide ""customer  communications services"" to Morgan  Stanley Smith  Barney.  This firm combines the wealth management  businesses of  Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) with those of Citi (NYSE:C) Smith Barney.  On  31 March 2010, Broadridge contracted with IBM for 10 years of data center   services.  We are now ready to look  specifically at the current quarter.   Broadridge updated its  guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2010, which  will end in June, when  it reported second quarter results in   February.The Revenue  growth rate guidance is up from 6-to-8 percent three  months earlier and  from 4-to-8 percent before that. The GAAP EPS  guidance decreased by  $0.02 because of an expected loss on the sale of  the securities clearing  business.  In fiscal 2009, Revenue from  continuing operations was $2.07  billion.  Given the guidance of 7 to 9  percent growth, Broadridge  expects Revenue in fiscal 2010 between $2.21  billion and $2.27  billion.  We'll use $2.24 billion.  Since  Revenue in the first half of fiscal 2010 was $438.2 million +  $529.7  million = $967.9 million, this leaves $2.24 billion - $967.9  million =  $1.27 billion for the second half of the year.  It would be  unwise to  assume this amount will be split equally over the March and  June  quarters because Broadridge's Revenue is not distributed evenly.   June  Revenue is usually about 50 percent greater than March Revenue.  Given  this data, our target for Broadridge's Revenue in the March 2010   quarter is $1.27 billion * 0.40 = $509 million.  The Gross Margin has  averaged 23 percent in the  previous four March quarters, and we will  assume a similar proportion  in the latest quarter.  Given our Revenue  estimate, the Cost of Goods Sold - called Cost of Net  Revenues on Broadridge's Income Statement - is  estimated to be (1 -  0.23) * $509 million = $392 million.  Sales, General, and  Administrative expenses have  been between 10 and 12 percent of  Revenue in March.  Splitting the  difference, our estimate for SG&A is 0.11 * $509  million = $56 million. With  these  estimates, we project Operating Income  of $61.1 million.  This  is 6.8 percent more than Operating Income in  the March 2009 quarter.  If we assume a $4 million net expense for  non-operating items, pretax  income down to $57.1 million.  If the Income Tax Rate  is 37.5 percent, Net Income in the  quarter will be $35.7 million  ($0.26 per share), compared to $40.9  million ($0.29 per share) in the  March 2009 quarter.  The  year-earlier period benefited by about $0.05 per share from a state  tax  credit.

155604,23050,2009-08-12T05:29:45-04:00,,"Earnings for Broadridge Financial (NYSE: BR) were $0.83 per share in the three months that ended on 30 June 2009, up from $0.69 in the same quarter of last year. The April-to-June period is the fourth quarter of Broadridge's fiscal year.  Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., provides investor communication, securities processing, and clearing services to financial companies.  This post examines Broadridge's Income Statement for the quarter and compares it to our ""look-ahead"" estimates. Our target for Net Income in the latest quarter was $0.77  per share.  In a second article, we will report Broadridge's  scores as measured by the GCFR Financial Gauges. The follow-up post will also provide the latest figures for the financial metrics we use to analyze Cash Management, Growth, Profitability and Value.  The principal sources for this post were the earnings announcement, management's presentation, the conference call transcript at SeekingAlpha, and the rapidly filed 10-K annual report. Our summary of  background information about Broadridge Financial and the business environment in which it is currently operating can be found in the look-ahead.  Please click here to see a full-sized, normalized depiction of the actual and projected results for the just-concluded quarter, as well as the quarterly Income Statements for the last couple of years. Please note that our organization of revenues, expenses, gains, and losses, which we use for all analyses, can and often does differ in material respects from company-used formats.  The standardization facilitates cross-company comparisons. Revenue in the June 2009 quarter was 7.1 percent less than in the year-earlier period.  We expected, based on the company's guidance for the fiscal year, a 5.3-percent Revenue decline. As a result, our estimate was too high by 1.9 percent.  With respect to the Revenue, Broadridge's management reported: Fiscal 2009 Revenue was 2.6 percent less than in fiscal 2008. This growth rate was close to the bottom of the ""-3% to flat"" range forecast by Broadridge in May.  Note that Broadridge's Revenue exhibits a seasonal pattern in which the June quarter is much stronger than any other. Revenue in the June 2009 quarter was 34 percent of fiscal year's total.  Cost of Net Revenues -- we call it Cost of Goods Sold --  was 66.9 percent of Revenue. This translates into a Gross Margin of 33.1 percent, up rather nicely from 31.4 percent last year. We had only expected the margin to be 31 percent.  Sales, General, and Administrative expenses were 6.9 percent of Revenue in the quarter, down from 9.2 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Our target for the SG&A expenses was 8.0 percent of Revenue, so actual costs were significantly less than we expected.  Operating Income, as we define it, was a robust 9.6 percent greater than the amount attained in last year's June quarter. Our prediction for Operating Income was 10.7 percent too low. The better-than-expected Gross Margin and the lower-than-expectedSG&A expenses more than compensated for the weaker-than-expected Revenue.   Other, non-operating items such as interest and foreign exchange are typically minor for Broadridge, but these items summed to a greater-than-anticipated $7.7 million net expense in the recent quarter. The largest element of this expense was a $5 million loss on foreign currency exchange.   Despite the foreign currency loss, pretax income remained 5 percent higher than our target.  The Income Tax Rate was 37 percent in the quarter, one percent less than expected.  Taking all of the above into consideration, Net Income was a remarkable 19.5 percent above its value in the June 2008 period. We had projected an increase of 12 percent. For the fiscal year as a whole, Net Income grew by 16.2 percent. In summary, although Revenue was down in the June quarter (and the year), the improved Gross Margin and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher non-operating expenses, enabled Broadridge to ring up a profitable quarter that beat expectations handily.    Broadridge management is certainly optimistic. They stated; And, in keeping with the theory that actions speak louder than words, they doubled the company's dividend from $0.28 to $0.56 per share. The company also authorized the purchase of up to 10 million common shares.  Full disclosure: Long BR at time of writing."

(YHOO) vote, there was a large protest made by Gordy Crawford of Capital Research who questioned the veracity of the results. Because of Mr. Crawford’s stature, the fact the Cap Re was one of the largest Yahoo! investors, and the intense media interest in the Yahoo! voting results, Broadridge was forced to verify the results and admitted their results had been far off the mark.Although Broadridge said the problem was a simple “truncation error” made by a computer, it’s clear when you look at the actual results and the ones first reported that there was human error involved. What was shocking about the incident was that it likely would never have been reported had Gordy Crawford not spoken up. It makes me wonder how many other errors made by Broadridge are never reported or acknowledged.I understand that the only check and balance over Broadridge’s monopoly is that they have to submit regular “updates” to the SEC. I don’t believe this is sufficient, given the importance of these voting results. What does it matter if the SEC allows proxy access or gets rid of broker votes, if investors can’t trust the final voting results because of future Broadridge “truncation errors”?In my view, investors would be best served by allowing another company to compete with Broadridge. Let the best provider to companies and shareholders be successful.I also note that Broadridge appears to be much more company-centric (i.e., management) than shareholder-centric.I hope you will consider adding further examination of Broadridge to your already busy list of plans.Sincerely,Eric JacksonEric M.

157478,23050,2009-08-21T03:05:10-04:00,,"In an earlier post, we examined Broadridge Financial's (NYSE: BR) Income Statement for the June quarter  and compared the figures to our ""look-ahead"" estimates.  Broadridge earned $0.83 per share in this fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, up from $0.69 in the comparable period of 2008.  Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., provides investor communication, securities processing, and clearing services to financial companies.  We have now  mined Broadridge's financial statements in its 10-K annual report to update the metrics we  use to assess Cash Management, Growth, Profitability and Value.  This post reports on these metrics and the  Financial Gauge scores.  In summary, Broadridge's latest GCFR gauge scores are as follows:The variability of Broadridge's scores from quarter to quarter has been magnified because the company's relatively short existence as an independent entity.The current and historical values for the financial metrics that determine the gauge scores are listed below, with some brief commentary.With the exception of the Current Ratio, Broadridge's liquidity and debt ratios have improved.  Debt/Equity has been slashed in the last year.  Even though Cash Flow from Operations has declined, Debt was reduced even more.  In other words, the Debt can be covered with the Cash Flow from a shorter period.Days of Sales Outstanding and the Cash Conversion Cycle Time, which are related measures of Cash efficiency, have also improved compared to last year.1. Revenue, CFO, and Net Income growth rates compare the last four quarters to the four previous quarters.   2. The Operating Profit rate is the annualized rate of growth in Operating Profit after Taxes over the last 16 quarters. 3. Cash Flow from Operations excludes securities clearing activities.Revenue and Cash Flow have been under pressure.  The decline in Revenue for the fiscal year was close to the bottom of the ""-3% to flat"" range forecast by the company.However, lower expenses and a tax benefit boosted Operating Profits and Net Income.The ROIC and FCF/IC ratios are impressive and have kept the Profitability score high.  The rise in the Accrual Ratio indicates that there is less Cash Flow backing up Net Income and that signals weaker Earnings Quality).Broadridge's share price fell 10.9 percent during the June quarter, from $18.61 to $16.58.  The lower price was much more pleasing to the Value gauge.  (The gauge scores in the table above were calculated using the quarter-end prices, per GCFR standard practice.)However, the shares have already moved over $20, which is a price that would trim several points from the Value score.  We didn't recognize this opportunity quickly enough.  C'est la vie.Broadridge's valuation ratios can be compared with other companies providing Business Services. The Cash Management and Value gauges responded well to the financial data from the June quarter, and the Profitability gauge was already giving a favorable reading.  Growth, as for many companies, lagged.The recent earnings announcement, which included a rare doubling of the annual dividend, triggered an 11-percent rise in Broadridge's share price over the next few trading days.  The price surge wiped several points from the Value gauge score, which has a ripple effect on the Overall gauge.  At this point, we think value investors considering this company would be better off waiting to see if the shares retrace some of the recent gains.Full disclosure: Long BR at time of writing."
137746,23050,2009-05-14T12:48:22-04:00,,"Broadridge (BR) earned $0.29 per share in the three months that ended on 31 March 2009, compared to earnings of $0.21 per share in the year-earlier quarter. The results were announced in this press release and this 10-Q report.This post provides the GCFR analysis for the period, which was the third quarter of the company's fiscal 2009.First, we present some background information.Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: BR) provides investor communication, securities processing, and clearing services to financial companies. Although not a household name, Broadridge received ""Top Overall Honors"" in the 2008 survey of brokerage process service providers.Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADP) spun off Broadridge on 30 March 2007.This is challenging time to be serving the financial industry, which has been significantly undermined by the credit crisis and the recession it spawned. However, according to its 10-K, Broadridges's Securities Processing business in fiscal 2008 handled fixed income trades valued at approximately $3 trillion per day.The Investor Communication Solutions business segment was responsible for more than 70 percent of Broadridge's revenue in fiscal 2008, according to the 10-K, and an even greater share of pre-tax earnings. The services provided by this segment include the distribution and processing of proxies for public companies and mutual funds.Lehman Brothers was a Broadridge client. Broadridge made the best of the situation by signing a three-year contract for clearing services with asset manager Neuberger Berman, an erstwhile Lehman subsidiary.Standard & Poor's in February 2009 revised its ratings outlook on Broadridge Financial to positive from stable. S&P recognized ""the company's focus on reducing debt and its stable profitability.""The share price fell a disheartening 44 percent in 2008, sinking as low as $9.72 in late November. However, the shares rebounded in early 2009, reaching $19.82 in early April.In March 2009, Broadridge announced an alliance with Beacon Capital Strategies, Inc. Beacon ""operates a marketplace dedicated to providing liquidity and electronic trading in the less-liquid fixed-income market."" The alliance is intended to ""help the firms' clients locate difficult-to-find securities."" The types of securities involved include mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and collateralized mortgage obligations.Broadridge had one unfortunate moment in the spotlight. A Broadridge error caused Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO) to under-report votes withheld from board members at its highly publicized shareholder meeting. Votes withheld often signify lack of support for management, and Yahoo leaders were roundly criticized for their critical response to the purchase offer from Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT).In the three months that ended last December, Revenue fell 1.3 percent compared to the year-earlier period. Higher SG&A expenses had a greater effect on Operating Income, which dropped 17.0 percent. One significant reason SG&A costs increased, according to the 10-Q, was that the company recorded a $2.2 million compensation expense ""related special stock option grants to corporate officers."" Despite the decline in Operating Income, a $4.7 million gain on foreign currency exchange enabled Net Income to eke out a small gain.The GCFR Overall Gauge rose from 49 to 60 points when December's results were considered. The increase was driven by a three-point increase in the Cash Management gauge and a five-point increase in the double-weighted Value gauge. The latter measure responded positively to the big drop in Broadridge's share price during 2008.Now, with the available data from the March 2009 quarter, our gauges are displaying the following scores:We are seeing atypical variability in the GCFR gauges because Broadridge does not have a long financial record as an independent company.Before we examine the factors that affected each gauge, we will review the latest quarterly Income Statement and compare it to our previously communicated expectations.Please also note that the tabular format below, which we use for all analyses, can and often does differ in material respects from company-used formats. A common difference is the classification of income and expenses as Operating and Non-Operating. The standardization is simply for convenience and to facilitate cross-company comparisons. (Also available here.) Revenue in the March 2009 quarter was 3.5 percent less than in the year-earlier period. Our target for the Revenue, which assumed a decline of 2.8 percent, was too high by less than one percent. Revenue in the last four quarters was just slightly less than Revenue in the four previous quarters.Cost of Goods Sold -- called Cost of Net Revenues on Broadridge's Income Statement -- was 77.5 percent of Revenue. This translates into a Gross Margin of 22.5 percent, down from 23.2 percent last year. Our 24-percent expectation for the margin was too optimistic by 1.5 percent.Sales, General, and Administrative expenses were 10.7 percent of Revenue in the quarter, down from 12.0 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Our target for the SG&A expenses was 12.5 percent of Revenue, so the actual costs were much less than we expected.Operating Income, as we defined it, was 2.7 percent more than the amount attained one year earlier. Our prediction for Operating Income was 2.5-percent too pessimistic because the savings from lower-than-expected SG&A expenses were more significant than the costs of a weaker-than-expected Gross Margin.Other expenses were $1.3 million more than we expected, but they were still $4 million less than the value last year.The Income Tax Rate was only 24.3 percent in the quarter. The tax rate was unexpectedly low (we anticipated 39.0 percent) because of a state tax credit that had retroactive benefits.Net Income was 39 percent above its value in the March 2008 period. We had projected an increase of 11.5 percent.Now for the gauges:Although Revenue was down in the March quarter, Net Income got a boost from a state tax credit. Cash Flow from Operations was particularly weak. Our Value gauge reacted with disappointment. It wanted much, much, more, given a 48 percent increase in the share price.Disclosure: Long BR at time of writing"
105572,20643,2008-11-12T06:59:42-05:00,,"That statement was made by Rich Daly, CEO of Broadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE: BR) on his company’s Q1 2009 earnings conference call on November 6.He said that 11 days after we publicized the fact that The Investor Network was live on the web.In fact, at the very time he uttered those words, any of the analysts on the call could have found that Broadridge was actually advertising on Google for people to join The Investor Network. (See the screenshot below)Hardly what you would call an “internal pilot for family and friends.”Of course, Mr. Daly not pointing analysts to www.theinvestornetwork.com has nothing at all to do with the fact that this new project has been unable to attract even 250 members yet.Nor does it have anything to do with the fact that individuals so obviously connected to Broadridge are anonymously touting the company’s stock, something regulators don’t look upon kindly.And it definitely has nothing to do with it being a flop that won’t fly unless Broadridge manages to somehow convince a certain regulator to force every company in America to use and pay for it.And that could well happen, according to Daly’s comments on the prior quarter’s call (Seeking Alpha transcript).I really hope it doesn’t because Broadridge’s investor network is a poorly conceived concept that adds no more value than can be achieved using free software that is widely available on the web. And, judging by the lack of interest thus far, no one really cares.A CEO who directly contradicts what is plainly visible to anyone who cares to look doesn’t inspire confidence in me.  I’m no longer a shareholder.Disclosure: no positions"

Two-thirds of Broadridge's revenues come from handling investor communications for businesses. With all the shareholder activism and corporate buyouts, this has been a solid business in the past couple of years, and Broadridge is dominant, with around 70% U.S. market share. Broadridge also does trade settlement and clearing for securities transactions. The primary negative with this story is that effective July 1, the SEC is implementing a new rule which will accelerate digital delivery of proxy and other investor communications. As this will push down the amount of paperwork Broadridge sends out, it will also pressure their revenue to an unknown degree. Management has not estimated, but is forecasting overall mid-single digit revenue growth. Pro-forma, we estimate Broadridge will have operating cash flow of around $2/share and free cash flow of $1.70 or so a share. Leverage is modest, and the business has strong returns on capital with little required capital investment. Their competitive position is relatively strong. Even at $25, the business would be valued at less than a market multiple to free cash flow.    Disclosure: We own shares of Broadridge Financial Solutions. BR 1 month chart"

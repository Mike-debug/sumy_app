At the time, BroadVision's (NASDAQ:BVSN) cash assets were last reported at $36.3m and in February 2016 were reported at $29.7m.The company's sales of a once profitable legacy business continue to wind down, and the turnaround plan to launch a cloud based social communication tool called Vmoso means competing with the world's largest software companies.Quarterly earnings call transcripts from management have essentially been like re-reading the same novel over and over. It's almost as if management of this company is on autopilot collecting salary for basically doing nothing.Maybe I'm going a bit too far. Management has (from an outside perspective) appeared to have built an enterprise social communication tool (Vmoso) that, if it functions as it appears in corporate videos, honestly looks like it could be valuable. Only problem is Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and a plethora of other providers are swimming in this space. Not to mention, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and other mega giants could disrupt this space if they felt like it.Also, from what I understand, in China, a large portion of business communication is done via WeChat, which BVSN has partnered with. However, in my experience the big giant tech company almost always wins any partnership deals it makes. Bottom line is Vmoso might be a better solution than anything out there, but the big gigantic software companies know they can squeeze BroadVision's neck by making it impossible to acquire any market share.That means BroadVision will need to get scrappy and really build up a sales channel. However, that doesn't seem to be a priority or something that management is even emphasizing on calls.Long story short. BroadVision hasn't gone anywhere in 9 months, and I doubt management is in any hurry to change that.There is however a story brewing here.Since August 2015, a company under the name ESW Capital has been acquiring shares of BVSN on the open market. ESW filed a statement of ownership of nearly 500,000 shares of BVSN back in August 2015. Since that time, ESW has fairly religiously bought shares of BVSN around the $6 range along with shares of another public company called Upland (NASDAQ:UPLD).While it's difficult to speculate on the motivation of both purchases, ESW has reported an overall stake in BVSN of 768,974 shares to date - becoming BVSN's overwhelmingly #1 shareholder in a matter of months. For reference, BVSN has 4.88m shares outstanding with a float of 3.13m according to Morningstar. So a 768,974 stake by an outsider over the course of a few months (I feel) is a big development for BVSN, a company seemingly on autopilot.First of all, who is ESW?ESW appears to be a company set up by legendary tech entrepreneur Joseph Liemandt, since it's his name that appears on all the SEC filings. This is a person who was a software billionaire at age 32. While I don't get too wrapped up in press related praise, I researched Mr. Liemandt for several hours, and he does appear to have an extensive track record of success. Aside from building a successful software company named Trilogy, Mr. Liemandt is known for his rigorous recruiting process - which has spawned a large network of ex-employees who all seem to credit Mr. Liemandt.People ask me all the time, what's the secret to finding good stocks? I tell them you find good leaders, not stocks. So stop trying to find good stocks. Without knowing Mr. Liemandt personally, I can't say if he's an elite leader, but on the surface he appears to be.While the mere fact that Mr. Liemandt could become personally involved with BVSN doesn't automatically make it a buying opportunity (more on why below). I will say that it could potentially be a big (or only) reason why someone would want to invest in BVSN later on in the future because he is an individual who has proven he has elite level leadership ability. And as someone who searches for elite level leadership on a daily basis, trust me, it's not easy to find.Why is ESW buying shares of BVSN and UPLD?Pure speculation here. Honestly, I haven't examined UPLD enough to know what ESW/Liemandt is seeing there. It's a company that is valued around $100m, and does mirror the roll-up type strategy that Mr. Liemandt has been involved in recently. ESW appears to have been an early investor in UPLD, as it's mentioned as one of a few early investors, which hold preferred shares in the company's S-1 filings. Also among analysis of those filings, at least at the time, ESW had an affiliate company that was benefiting from a relationship with UPLD. So it makes a bit of sense to me that ESW/Liemandt has essentially chased the price of UPLD down buying the entire way.BVSN makes more sense with what is outlined on ESW Capital's website. A software company that is basically on autopilot and in need of some fresh leadership/streamlining. I'm not exactly sure ESW is interested in Vmoso or one of BVSN's other products, but I doubt the products at BVSN are the only reason why ESW is buying shares of BVSN. What often happened in the past at ESW (or one of its other subsidiaries) is that it will roll up technology it acquires with one of its other brands. In February for example, one of ESW's portfolio companies Ignite Technologies was given the assets of another one of ESW's brands.At the current moment, it's tough to speculate if ESW wants to roll all its subsidiary brands into one conglomerate of a public company. Exposing all those financials and business models might not make sense to investors. Those types of situations don't always benefit common shareholders as new management could create different classes of shares - or simply the newly formed company just isn't appealing to investors. ESW's other significant public investment at this time, Upland, certainly seems to be plagued by this after reading some investor analysis. I've also analyzed another nano-cap company called Sysorex (NASDAQ:SYRX) which is loosely a big-data tech roll-up and shares have gone nowhere except into penny-stock status.So I've probably seen the roll-up strategy drive down share prices in micro-cap tech names more often than I've seen it drive shares upward. But we're getting ahead of ourselves a bit because we're not even sure the roll-up strategy is what ESW has in mind. It's possible it wants to quietly take BVSN private and milk the cash assets in a similar fashion it has carried out with the other companies it has acquired.But for some reason, I simply don't believe ESW is buying shares of BVSN because it's interested in the cash, the existing (small) revenue stream or even growing Vmoso - which is the current plan of attack laid out by current management of BVSN. I would assume there's likely more distressed valuations in the private markets for social enterprise software companies - and I simply don't think there's a need for ESW to open itself up to regulatory scrutiny if it wasn't planning to do something much larger. Someone with the experience and team Mr. Liemandt has assembled (or could assemble) I don't think is after BVSN because he simply thinks the software is great and just isn't being properly sold.In short, it's hard to know exactly why ESW is buying shares of BVSN. Its stake in UPLD appears to derive from an earlier investment when the company was private. Until any facts are laid out by anyone involved, it's all speculation, but as we all know, speculation can move stock prices more than facts.So How Do I (you) benefit as an investor?I believe these circumstances turn BVSN into a special situation type investment. In other words, it's more of a trade, than an investment in my opinion at this point. Personally, I believe I'm better at analyzing and providing some insight into the story surrounding BVSN, rather than giving you entry/exit points to trade. I'm not trying to take the easy route and tell you I have no idea if you can benefit buying shares of BVSN or not. I just want you to know, until further notice, BVSN stock is a trade, not an investment. Those looking to avoid risk should avoid this stock like a drug habit. Those looking for risky upside (and downside) trades of stocks with potential catalysts not easily telegraphed can continue reading on.Okay, so how do you benefit? Honestly, you never really know how these (potential) corporate takeover type situations can turn out for the common shareholder. It's possible there's board seat battles, proxy fights to get those board seats and other things that can actually hurt the value of the company and shares in the meantime. If the current management of BVSN feels like the writing is on the wall for them, odd things can materialize in an attempt to thwart off a takeover attempt.Remember, most people who analyze BVSN believe the bulk of the value is the cash, and the fact it's a publicly traded symbol. There's likely some value in the customer relationships BVSN has built up over the years as well. But we're not talking about a multibillion-dollar company here that has some safety nets to fall back on. In an attempt to keep the status quo going, average buy and hold investors can get hurt along the way, so that's why BVSN has turned into a special situation type trade.Upside can happen if ESW can successfully change the path of BVSN, which like I stated earlier, is a company essentially on autopilot. If nothing is done at BVSN, the cash balance will slowly be whittled down to the point where shares would start trading more in line with what the company generates to the bottom line, which is zero. Any pivot from this path will likely be seen as beneficial by shareholders, which could create some short-term bounces in the share price as shares might trade more on speculation than cash-asset valuation. Even just the potential of ESW cleaning house at BVSN could be enough to send the shares higher temporarily.However, your timing needs to be impeccable during this process. Any lengthy battle between a status quo management and a potential shakeup acquisition could mean some volatile trading ranges. Not to mention the one valuable asset the company has (CASH) will be depleted during this time.I would advise long(er)-term investors to stay on the sidelines and let reality play out. Remember, what I have gone over in most of this article is 10% facts mixed with 90% speculation. While investing on speculation can yield some spectacular results in a short time frame, a long(er)-term investor will want to wait for more facts to materialize. Some of those facts can/will be:What should you do?If you own shares of BVSN already, it's likely you've held on this long so you might as well hold on for the ride that's about to begin. Obviously, have stop-losses in place and make sure your allocation of BVSN is in range with a speculative investment relative to the size of your own portfolio.For those that have been keeping BVSN on a watchlist like I have for the past 9 months, I think you have to start evaluating the valuation of BVSN since larger outside investors with an extensive track record of buying software companies are doing the same.Remember that this (I believe) is a software guy buying stocks, not an institutional/private equity type buyer. Not that either one is better than the other at picking stocks, but you want to formulate your own opinion/valuation here on BVSN. Personally, I think you can throw out the window any/much value in current BVSN products. Honestly, the only reason to buy BVSN is for some kind of outside catalyst, and if you believe ESW getting involved is that catalyst, then it could become a valuable trade.ValuationOkay, so when someone who's made billions selling software goes on a buying spree of BVSN stock - you simply have to take notice. Examining filings, ESW has been a buyer anytime BVSN was in the $6/share level. The $6/share price level, not coincidentally, puts BVSN's valuation (market cap) around where the cash balance is, or roughly $29m. I think if a company was so inclined, they could buy this company today for not much more than that.Again, just because ESW finds BVSN shares attractive at $6 doesn't necessarily make me want to run out and buy some myself. However, the cash level is going to act as a key area of support, especially if you have ESW re-buying at those levels too. That's why your timing as an investor really needs to be accurate when buying shares of BVSN, because there's no guarantee on the timetable of what ESW's impact will be. If BVSN continues on the same path, one year from today, cash could easily be 30% lower than it is today, which likely would mean shares would be trading down in that valuation as well.So I'm not breaking any news here saying valuation is tied to cash, but projecting that forward on the current path is going to mean shares trade lower too. That's why any upside in the valuation will need to be carefully telegraphed with any potential impact that might come from ESW becoming a major shareholder.ConclusionsStill more questions than answers right now with BVSN. Will current status quo management go quietly into the night if there was a potential shakeup? ESW buying shares of two different public companies at the same time seems to thwart a 'go public' theory somewhat, especially given that UPLD is still fairly fresh off a November 2014 IPO. But for an otherwise forgotten company, BVSN appears to have some things quietly brewing. Stay tuned.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

3265245,77545,2015-06-18T12:24:04-04:00,"BroadVision's shares trade below cash value and the company has no debt.Company has been trying to penetrate Social Enterprise Software space since 2009.Competition is bigger, stronger and faster.","Conventional wisdom might teach you that if a company's market cap is near, equal or below its cash on hand, the company might be undervalued. I can see how that could be the case, especially with a company that doesn't generate a significant amount of analyst coverage. However, when I come across companies trading near or below cash balance, I want to further investigate other assets of the company to figure out why the market doesn't value them. Just because BroadVision (NASDAQ:BVSN) has cash in the bank doesn't make it an attractive investment until we analyze the business model and specific drivers that generate revenue.First, let's take a look at the numbers.FinancialsData Source: Company DocumentsOkay, so BroadVision experienced YoY revenue declines during the most recent quarter. However, what alarms me the most is the very small amount of revenue BVSN is generating on a yearly basis ... especially for a company that has been around since the 1990's.Data Source: Company 10-KsI've read some analysis about BVSN on this site and others that discusses how the company's cash pile means shares should trade at a higher multiple in the marketplace. I believe when making this judgment, taking a look at the working capital is a better judge considering the company's short-term investments tends to rise and fall more frequently. As we can see, BroadVision's working capital has declined YoY for the last 6 years as the company has racked up losses every year since 2010.Due to these declining numbers across the board, any current or potential investor needs to be concerned what management's reasons for the declines are, and (more importantly) what management's plan is going forward to reverse that trend.During the company's latest conference call, management stated:In summary, BroadVision is phasing out legacy software and pivoting to newly developed software to better meet the needs of the changing business environment.On the conference call, management indicated BroadVision:The social and collaboration product that the company has developed is called Vmoso, which I will discuss more in depth later. However, BroadVision has no track record of generating much revenue from social collaboration software it has developed in the past prior to launching Vmoso.BroadVision launched Clearvale in 2009, which was the company's first foray into the enterprise social communication software. Several years later in 2013 BroadVision merged Clearvale capabilities with its legacy software offerings as BroadVision 9. BroadVision outlines its success with this software fairly clearly in company documents:In summary, BroadVision has no track record of creating a successful social enterprise communication software platform - and it's this type of software which the company is relying on to stop the YoY revenue declines the company has been experiencing. Not to mention competitors in this space already are much larger and quite possibly have solutions that are at least on par with Vmoso, some of which I will discuss more later.Given we know that management is transitioning away from legacy software and focusing on Vmoso, let's give management the benefit of the doubt it will successfully grow that business and take a closer look at the social enterprise software model, since it's going to be the key driver to shareholder value (or destruction) in the near future.VmosoBroadVision launched Vmoso in July 2014, but the software wasn't widely available until February 2015. The company describes Vmoso as being able to unify email, instant messaging, content sharing, workflow and social networking all in one software application. To better understand what Vmoso is capable of doing, I suggest trying the product for free like I did and/or view the company videos which outline the main features.To be honest, I could see how Vmoso could be beneficial to companies of various sizes and it performs as well or better than others that I have tried over the years. The real issue is BVSN being able to sell it to enough enterprises to generate significant income. To better understand what the financial impact Vmoso could make on BVSN shares, let's examine the pricing model and the marketing challenges.Pricing Model:Source: Company WebsiteAs is customary with the SaaS business model, the pricing ranges from a free single use option to $10/mo per user. Given that BVSN is a micro-cap company with limited revenues, any marginal adoption of Vmoso would be beneficial to top line numbers. However, for BVSN to generate significant revenues and/or net income to the bottom line, the company would need to acquire tens of thousands of users. That is the challenge with any SaaS business models at this price point ... in order to generate significant revenue, the company needs lots of customers. To acquire lots of customers, BVSN needs a sales staff capable of reaching potential clients on a daily basis.By comparison, BroadVision has 94 employees in research & development. That might explain why BroadVision has a software that appears to be highly functional, but doesn't generate significant revenues in comparison to other publicly traded SaaS companies. Comparing BVSN's sales representatives to another social enterprise software company, Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) has 195 employees in the sales & marketing department. (p. 8 10-K)The other challenge facing Vmoso is that the software is not what I would consider to be an end-to-end Customer Relationship Management (or CRM) software platform. Instead, it's more of a tool for communication among groups of employees and customers - which is likely a tough sell to enterprise customers. I'm not the only one who thinks Vmoso (or similar) piece of software is a tough sell to clients. BroadVision actually describes most of the challenges facing software like Vmoso in a company YouTube video.The company states in the video that organizations are 'not ready' to implement software like Vmoso and this is for a number of reasons. The #1 reason I believe is cost. While the monthly subscription to a large organization at around $10 per employee isn't the issue or a huge cost barrier, the manpower and training that would be required to implement and maintain the use of the software would be significant for a large company. Companies are simply not ready to absorb that cost and manpower for a software that is likely seen as not necessary to the core of the business model. This is a challenge that not only BroadVision faces, but any enterprise software maker faces when the tool isn't essential to the business process (making money).BroadVision's second reason for lack of adoption for software like Vmoso is that organizations are 'reluctant to change' to adopt software like Vmoso. Unless a company is starting from the ground up, it's likely to have processes and ways of doing things that are baked into the company. Even if Vmoso is a better option, organizations will always be slow to change from processes and/or software that are already producing results. Startup, smaller/more nimble organizations could implement this type of software - but to scale up to tens of thousands of users quickly, BVSN will need to acquire much larger organizations that are even more reluctant to change due to their already massive size.Finally, BroadVision states that implementing social enterprise software like Vmoso isn't happening because it's 'not a priority' for many organizations. I believe this to be the case because software like Vmoso have not traditionally been a part of most business models and organizations likely have IT issues/needs that are more important/urgent to implement.In short, selling software like Vmoso is a huge challenge for any company - but especially one like BroadVision which doesn't have the scale, staffing, or resources like many of its competitors already have. The company recently hired Ty Levine as VP of marketing & business development, and Mr. Levine spoke on the company's Q1 2015 conference call.Mr. Levine commented that ""80,000 users migrated to Vmoso"" so we'll assume the company is achieving some traction in the marketplace; but it's likely many (or most) of those users aren't paying or were existing clients. When detailing the specific 'go-to-market strategy' for Vmoso, Mr. Levine's plan isn't particularly complex with building out content/videos on broadvision.com as being one idea, and centering the sales call efforts around ""productivity discussions."" If those two things are all that is required to sell software these days, I'm probably in the wrong business.So the fact BVSN shares trade below cash asset value could mean shares are undervalued. However, the fact that BroadVision is in the early stages of developing/marketing software that the company admits is a tough sell to enterprise customers - I'm highly concerned the company will ever scale up to enough customers to realize a profit.The other thing I'd be worried about is if BroadVision is capable of acquiring the number of customers needed to grow the low-priced SaaS model to scale. One way a software company attracts clients is by offering a solution that goes above and beyond what competitors have to offer. Take a look at a direct quote from the risk factors section of the company's latest 10-Q filing with the SEC:I get that the risk factor segment of SEC filings are often ""doom & gloom"" type scenarios, but any large client BVSN tries to sell to is going to query the company about back-up/redundancy. When BroadVision states inside its own financial statements it doesn't have adequate back-up processes in place, what do you think its sales staff will have to tell potential clients? Unless sales staff is trained to lie, they'll have to inform potential clients that adequate back-up processes are not in place at BroadVision. That's not going to attract the large enterprise clients BroadVision will need to scale up Vmoso into a profitable software solution.CompetitionThe purest competitor in the CRM space is Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), which, according to Gartner, holds over 18% of the overall market in 2014. Competitors like SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and IBM (NYSE:IBM) aren't pure CRM software providers, but have a distinct advantage over virtually every other competitor because of existing relationships with enterprises and large clients. With recent rumors of a possible Salesforce.com buyout by Microsoft, IBM, Oracle or similar competitor, the largest CRM software company could become even more dominant under the wings of a mega-cap software provider. A Salesforce.com buyout/merger could trigger further consolidation in the CRM software space ... which could benefit a company like BroadVision even if it can't establish some market share for Vmoso.Source: Gartner (via Forbes)The bottom line for BroadVision and its shareholders is the SaaS enterprise software space is fairly crowded already and gigantic competitors are likely going to succeed either through developing their own solutions, or by acquiring/merging with smaller companies to capture market share. Given that BroadVision has very little paying customers and the fact that Vmoso isn't an end-to-end CRM solution, I believe the company's chances of being an acquisition target by a large competitor to be slim.Valuation (based on 4.85M shares outstanding)Let's first take a look at what I refer to as 'text-book' valuation ratios. They teach you these valuations in business school, but if all you had to do was look at ratios to invest in stocks, we'd all be rich and wealthy. However, I find they are a good starting point, and we can get an idea how the market values similar companies. For comparisons, we'll take a look at CRM, Jive Software, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), and NetSuite (NYSE:N).Data Source: MorningstarThe number that really stands out on this chart is that BroadVision has a negative revenue growth rate, whereas competitors are growing in the double digits. Gartner estimated that the CRM software industry grew 13% YoY in 2014, so BroadVision's competitors are not only achieving positive revenue growth rates, but actually outpacing the industry growth rate. For BVSN shares to appreciate over current levels, the company would need to start growing revenues. We know BroadVision's plan to grow revenues revolves around Vmoso - a social enterprise software that just recently launched and hasn't generated any revenue. We also know that BroadVision's legacy software business is likely to continue revenue declines, so not only will Vmoso need to grow to replace existing declining sales but also enough to grow revenues beyond where they stand today.Because BroadVision is achieving a negative revenue growth rate from its legacy software and hasn't proven it can generate significant revenues from newly developed software, the market is correct to assume BVSN's most attractive asset is cash. Given that cash assets are declining YoY as well, I fully anticipate BVSN share price to decline with it. With that being the case, I think it's somewhat useless to value BVSN shares on where the company stands today. Looking 8-12 months out, I anticipate BroadVision struggling to gain market share for Vmoso, therefore the cash balance should continue to decline as well. If these events play out as anticipated, I could easily see BVSN shares trading down as the cash balance drops.Wild CardsIf you look at the long-term chart of BVSN, you'll notice a large spike in value during the first part of 2012. The only plausible reason for this spike was a stock promotion campaign that appeared to have worked. I don't advise anyone to invest in a company based on stock promotion (pump & dump), but it's certainly possible my bearish arguments are proven moot because the stock is pumped again in the future.I've argued already that I don't think BroadVision makes an ideal buyout candidate, but based on BVSN's below cash valuation it's plausible BroadVision could be acquired by another company simply because a company could argue that it's getting the company's assets 'for free.' With that being the case, a potential private company with no interest in BroadVision other than the fact that it can 'go public' could possibly materialize.Many of the competitors in this space already have software that are similar to Vmoso, but given that Salesforce.com is rumored to be on the block, I could see a Salesforce.com sale triggering further consolidation in this space (or at least a knee-jerk reaction to buy other stocks in this sector by other investors).It's also possible BVSN could land a large client that really moves the needle on the revenue side. Based on the facts today, I believe most of the wild card scenarios I describe are more or less hopes and dreams. When I think about my next vacation or sports car purchase, I like having hopes and dreams, but when I invest in companies I like making decisions based on reality. Reality is BroadVision's sales, revenues, and cash balance continue to dwindle year after year. Additionally, there's no guarantee that even if a wild card scenario materializes that it would be beneficial to shareholders.ConclusionsOwning BVSN shares appears to be risky given the current state of the company. BVSN is transitioning away from some of its legacy software offerings in favor of social enterprise software. In order for revenues to increase and possibly generate net income, sales of Vmoso would need to gain traction in an already crowded field of competitors. Not only that, BVSN has never penetrated this market to any significant degree, meaning you'd be hoping the company could execute sales despite no track record against competitors who are already much larger. I could see owning a small portion of BVSN shares if you were creating a basket of stocks in this sector, but even that might be like throwing money away.Shorting BVSN shares is a possibility as well; however, I feel shorting shares of any company is more of a trade, rather than an investment and requires the proper timing for entry and exit. For the sake of my analysis I like focusing on long(er) term investments - rather than short(er) term trades. However, if BroadVision's poor track record of launching social enterprise software continues, I envision revenue, cash and interest in this stock to continue to decline.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

2272273,48671,2014-06-18T09:01:00-04:00,"Broadvision is currently undervalued based on its cash alone, as the company has a $44.3 million market cap and $46 million in cash with no debt.
        The company’s additional assets could total over $100 million, bringing Broadvision’s fair valuation closer to $150 million, over 3 times today’s valuation.
        Broadvision’s Clearvale technology may be gaining traction as it has been validated by Nissan, Softbank, and numerous other international technology companies. This is the big upside opportunity.","Broadvision (NASDAQ:BVSN) is currently providing investors with an ideal asymmetrical trade: limited downside risk as it trades below cash with tremendous upside potential. Broadvision's current market cap is $44.8 million based on 4.79 million shares outstanding and a closing share price today of $9.36, but combining all of the company's assets could yield a valuation closer to $150 million. The $9.36 share price today could be closer to $30 based on the sum of Broadvision's parts. With some positive developments in its Clearvale or Vmoso technology solution business lines, the stock has even further upside over the next two years with limited downside based on its cash and its low burn. Broadvision presents a prime example of a current market inefficiency.Broadvision's Clearvale Solution Primed for UpsideThe big upside for Broadvision can be found in its Clearvale business. Clearvale is operating in two of today's fastest-growing sectors: enterprise social networking and cloud computing. As a valuation reference for this space as a whole, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) bought one of Clearvale's competitors, Yammer, for $1.1 billion in July 2012. Another Clearvale competitor, Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE), is a public company currently valued close to $600 million.The reason I see such potential for upside with Clearvale is that it has validation already from Fortune 500 clients. Clearvale's current customers for its technology include Nissan, SoftBank Telecom, and $60 billion telecom company NTT. In my mind, Broadvision's Clearvale asset alone could be worth well more than Broadvision's current market capitalization.Clearvale and the Size of its MarketClearvale is a next-generation social networking platform that enables customers to do business on the web with its social enterprise ecosystem. Clearvale allows businesses to connect blogs, files, forums, videos, wikis, and photos on enterprise social networks for wireless devices and computers, all of which are running on the cloud. By connecting this all in one cloud system for a company, Clearvale can help dramatically improve a company's performance. It is almost similar to a combination of Facebook, Twitter, and Dropbox as a single intra-enterprise solution for a company.http://www.broadvision.com/en/clearvale.phphttp://www.clearvale.com/mkt/en/The Global Enterprise Social Networking Software market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 61% from now until 2016 and is expected to generate $6.4 billion in 2016. This is up from $600 million in 2010.One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the increased requirement of intranet interactivity among multiple teams within a company. The market has also witnessed an increased use of mobile enterprise social networking for sales activities. As this sector develops, enterprise social collaboration software will overshadow demand for more traditional communications and collaboration products, according to a new study from Forrester Research.Clearvale's Life Cycle StageIn order to help determine Clearvale's value, it helps to understand where Clearvale is in its development process. Let's take a look at the following typical four stages of a development/commercialization cycle:Stage I: An idea is formulated and engineers begin developing a prototype.Stage II: Beta product is released.Stage III: Company begins selling the product, but the company is not yet profitable.Stage IV: Product gains traction and Company becomes profitable.As a product moves through the four development stages, a company's value can increase significantly as it develops and gains traction. At the idea stage, the product has very little monetary value, because the concept has not been developed or proven. At stage III, if a product can achieve validation through use by industry leaders, the company's value can start becoming significant if there is a large addressable market. By the time a company reaches stage IV, with the right multi-billion addressable market a company can rightfully be worth billions. In the tech space these days, revenues and profitability are sometimes far less important than validation and addressable market.Clearvale is currently in stage III and already has Fortune 500 corporations as customers. It is hard to predict when or if Broadvision will progress from stage III to stage IV. The company provides very little guidance, so this could happen in six months, two years, or potentially never. I believe the tight lid that Broadvision keeps on communications to shareholders is part of the reason for its severe mispricing.If Clearvale is not profitable within two years, it could raise a red flag as there could be issues that are preventing mass-market adoption. Right now, though, Clearvale is in a strong position given its level of development and validation by industry leaders. If Broadvision were to spin off Clearvale via the sale of this asset, I believe Clearvale alone could fetch far more than $50 million based just on the traction it has shown already and how hungry some larger companies may be to enter this growing space.Yammer, for instance, was acquired by Microsoft in July 2012 for $1.2 billion in an all cash deal. Karl Keirstead, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, estimated Yammer's yearly revenue at around $25 million. Microsoft paid a multiple of 50 times revenue for the company. Yammer was not profitable at the time of the purchase, putting it in stage III of its life cycle at the time it was acquired, just as Clearvale is now.Jive Software, also in the same space as Yammer and Clearvale, had $145 million in sales the past twelve months and currently sports a market capitalization of $570 million, a little over three times sales. Jive is also not yet profitable, hence also falling in stage III.Yammer and Jive are good examples of other social business software platform companies with publicly available metrics that put them in stage III of development. Even though Clearvale is also a social business software platform that is in stage III of development, it is significantly earlier in its revenue cycle hence it garners a much lower valuation. Still, a much lower valuation from a $570 million market cap company and a $1 billion buyout could be significant for a business that is just one part of the $44.8 million market cap Broadvision.Broadvision as a whole is on pace to do $12 million in revenue this year. My analysis shows likely at least $1 million of that comes from Clearvale. Using the 50x multiple that was paid for Yammer would place a valuation on Clearvale alone that is more than Broadvision's current market cap.Clearvale Customer and Revenue AnalysisBroadvision does not break out its revenues by its businesses in any of its filings so it is difficult to determine exactly what portion of its revenue is currently derived from Clearvale. Looking at Yammer's website shows the pricing breakdown for Yammer's Office 365 Enterprise. There are two options, its Enterprise E1 for $8 per user/month or its Enterprise E3 for $20 per user/month. I believe the $8 per user/month is a conservative and fair estimate for what Clearvale may be charging.Looking at Clearvale's sample list of customers on its website, SoftBank Telecom is a prominent one. SoftBank Telecom has 4,400 employees. With 4,400 employees at $8 per user/month, this equates to $422,000 per year in revenue to Clearvale. At $20 per user/month, it would equate to just over $1 million in revenue for the year from this one customer. Based on these numbers and looking through the size of other customer examples provided, I believe $1 million in revenue for the year from Clearvale is conservative. Broadvision as a whole is on pace for $12 million in revenue for 2014. As I will get into further, its revenue is a mix of its older, legacy solutions and Clearvale. If more revenue is coming from Clearvale as opposed to Broadvision's legacy business solutions, it is a positive for Broadvision as Clearvale's revenue will garner a higher multiple at its lifecycle stage than a declining legacy business. So I am more comfortable erring on the lower side for Clearvale.The large size of several of Clearvale's customers can be a big plus in its quest to gain more traction and market share. SoftBank Telecom's Chief Operations Officer, Ken Miyauchi, stated ""By using Broadvission social networking in the cloud, powered by VMware, we can significantly improve business productivity and our customers' ability to innovate across their entire business ecosystem."" This type of support from a company doing ~$500 million a year in revenue that is a subsidiary of the much larger SoftBank Group should give Broadvision a high layer of credibility in discussions with potential new customers.There is likely a lot of room for growth just within its current customers' organizations as well. SoftBank Telecom has 4,400 employees while SoftBank Group has 70,000 employees. With a seemingly satisfied customer and partner in SoftBank Telecom, perhaps it could lead to SoftBank Group implementing Clearvale in more business areas. If SoftBank Group were to implement across all 70,000 of its employees, that one client could be generating $7 million per year in revenue at $8 per user/month.Another quote of praise from the CEO of Aeroxchange, a large, global supply chain company, six months into integration of Clearvale:""For some time, we've understood that a social networking solution might provide the foundation for future development and expanded collaboration. But we had a few tough requirements. First, the network would need to be hosted in the cloud providing security and worldwide availability. Second, the platform would need to be DIY (do-it-yourself), so as to minimize the learning curve and time-to-market. Finally, the platform would need to enable us to easily navigate across a network of both public and private groups, because that reflects the way business is done in our world. Clearvale met all three requirements. We are only six months into this project, and already we are seeing results across the ecosystem.""- Al Koszarek, President and CEO of AeroxchangePotential New Entrants to MarketThe Global Enterprise Social Networking Software market is currently dominated by IBM, Jive, Communispace, and Telligent System. Other potential players should be looking to compete in this projected $6 billion per year market in 2016. Thinking more outside of the box, I believe that for both Facebook and LinkedIn entering this market would be a logical extension. Entering via the acquisition of an existing, validated technology makes sense.Thinking more in line with what the market has already shown, Broadvision is a software development and licensing company. Perhaps even if its product is a superior product, Broadvision is not well equipped for the marketing and sales of its products. A large software company with a built in marketing and sales force would be able to package a new product offering more quickly and easily to sell to its existing customers. This is why the acquisition of Yammer by Microsoft made sense.Broadvision already works closely with VMware on the development side, as noted in this case study. VMware is the 5th largest software company in the world, on a list where Microsoft is the first. VMware did $5.2 billion in revenue in 2013 and is much better suited to monetize new software products than Broadvision. Based on the existing business relationship here and the seemingly well-received feedback Clearvale has received from its customers, VMware could be a very logical suitor.Determining Broadvision's Sum of the Parts Fair ValueAlthough Clearvale is Broadvision's upside asset, the company has other assets that add to its intrinsic valuation which I will breakdown. These primary assets include:Adding up Broadvision's cash, a 3x multiple on its legacy business, and a small portion of its large NOLs yields a valuation for Broadvision of $94.5-$103.5 million. At this valuation alone (assigning no value to its Clearvale business, its Vmoso business, or its Nasdaq listing) the company should trade at $19.70-$21.60 per share.Adding in a possible $50 million valuation for Clearvale brings the valuation number for Broadvision as a whole to the $150 million market cap neighborhood, equating to a share price over $30. To further show this point, below breaks down the derivation for the rest of Broadvision's assets. (Note that I believe a $50 million valuation for Clearvale at this point would be high. This is just based on a 50x multiple derived from the Yammer sale and what I calculate Clearvale to be on pace for this year in revenue. If Clearvale continues to gain any traction, though, this is a realistic number for a future valuation)Legacy business valuation: $33 millionBroadvision's legacy business appears to be profitable today and could be worth 3x revenue. Broadvision is on pace to spend $7.2 million on Research and Development and $6 million on Sales and Marketing for 2014. This combined $13.2 million in expenses is what prevents Broadvision from currently being profitable. Broadvision does not break out sales or expenses between its Business and Commerce Agility Suites, Clearvale, and Quicksilver solutions, so we have to make estimates regarding where revenue is coming from and where expenses are going.I believe it is safe to say the majority of that $13.2 million between R&D and Sales and Marketing for 2014 is going to the continued development and marketing of Clearvale and Vmoso. Broadvision's Business and Commerce Agility Suites have been around for years and combine the company's 18 years of experience deploying e-commerce applications. According to the company, they power some of the world's most sophisticated public and private web sites. The past few earnings releases for Broadvision, the only communication shareholders usually receive from the company, the focus has been on Clearvale and, more recently, Vmoso. From my research into Broadvision's other solutions outside of Clearvale and Vmoso, I believe they are more entrenched with the customers who have been using them for some time but that the revenues there will steadily decline as it is not an area of growth. It is a legacy side to the business that requires maintenance for existing clients, but that will lose revenue as clients upgrade to other solutions.Broadvision's revenues the past two years were consistent, at ~$15 million each year in 2012 and 2013, but dropped off in Q1 2014 to $3 million for the quarter from $3.8 million for the same quarter in 2013. The ramp up in revenues from Broadvision's newer solutions needs to outpace the decline in revenues from its more outdated technology solutions, but last quarter that was not the case. This would be a larger point of focus if not for Broadvision's roughly 10 years of runway in cash. It has time to effectuate this ramp up that is needed.There is a bit of a seesaw effect in play here with Broadvision's revenues, as it is more conservative from a valuation perspective to assume more revenue is coming from Broadvision's legacy business then from one of its newer solutions. The more revenue attributable to Clearvale or Vmoso will yield a higher valuation since those should both be valued as growth businesses at this point.I came to the conservation analysis that Clearvale is doing at least $1 million in revenue. This would give Broadvision's legacy solutions $11 million in profitable revenue, and a potential valuation of $33 million using a 3x revenue multiple. Software companies can trade anywhere from 1x-10x+ revenue. On the lower end of that multiple scale are under-performing, unprofitable companies. On the higher end are hyper-growth companies in booming areas. Software companies with smaller revenues in the $10-15 million range typically garner higher multiples on revenue, especially if profitable. Broadvision's legacy business has kept consistent revenue the past two years and is likely quite profitable, so a 3x revenue multiple seems justifiably fair.Broadvision has not publicly discussed continued development of its legacy solutions, any sort of focus on marketing the solutions, or adding any additional customers in a long time. This leads me to the conclusion that a minimal amount of the R&D or Sales and Marketing expense can be going to this part of its business. Software licensing margins are typically high, so I believe it is safe to assume that the revenue from just this side of the business is profitable. Unless the revenue for its legacy solutions start dropping at a faster rate, I believe 3x revenue remains a fair multiple. Revenues from entrenched software solutions typically do not fall fast as it is costly and time-consuming for a customer to switch to a new solution.If Clearvale is generating a higher percentage of Broadvision's revenue, it would be better for shareholders. The valuation of the legacy business would be reduced, but Clearvale's valuation would be enhanced given the size and growth of the enterprise social networking market.Value of Broadvision's NOLs: $12.5 million-$21.5 millionBroadvision has over $500 million in Net Operating Losses (NOLs), which could be of great value should Broadvision become profitable. These NOLs could also possibly be valuable to another company in a takeover situation. At a 25% tax rate, the NOLs could provide $125 million in tax savings. At a 43% tax rate, this number would increase to $215 million.How do those numbers apply to Broadvision's valuation today? To be conservative, let's assume Broadvision will only ever be able to take advantage of 10% of its Net Operating Losses. This would give Broadvision's NOLs a value of $12.5 million to $21.5 million today.Broadvision could be profitable at any timeBroadvision is on pace for $12 million in revenue this year with a burn rate of ~$4 million for the year. The company is pacing to put $13 million of back into R&D and marketing. If the company were to scale back on R&D and marketing, it could start profitably putting millions to its bottom line.Given that Broadvision is choosing to reinvest in R&D and marketing rather than turn a profit now, it implies that the company has a longer-term strategy to create greater shareholder value. The CEO, Pehong Chen, owns 34% of this company and could make the decision at any point to make Broadvision profitable. He is choosing not to focus on profitability at this time. Chen could also choose to dividend out Broadvision's cash to the shareholders, which would put ~$15 million in Chen's own pocket. He is also deciding against cashing out. Chen must believe investing in Clearvale and Vmoso will ultimately deliver a higher return for a reason.The natural evolution of Clearvale and Vmoso should include significant reduction in R&D spending in the near future. The primary expense comes up front when developing a product, but at this stage, the expenses should start declining as the products progress towards profitability.Potential catalystsWhy is Broadvision so undervalued?Broadvision is unique, in that it intentionally keeps itself under Wall Street's radar. This company appears to have no investor relations program and runs the company as if it were private, focusing on building the fundamental business with heads down. It discloses the bare minimum required by SEC regulations, and offers investors very little insight into Clearvale's revenue and expenses. Wall Street is thus currently valuing most of Broadvision's assets at zero, which is a distortion of reality and provides a potential opportunity. The big risk to keep in mind is that Broadvision could remain flat for the forseeable future (as it has in recent years) if none of the potential catalysts occurs to ignite a renewed interest in the company. I believe the company is finally close to that inflection point where one of these potential catalysts happens. The company has seemingly positioned itself to land some large contracts that could spark some life and generate momentum, but with the company's historic lack of communication it is difficult to say.Low float could amplify share price appreciation on any of these catalystsI know traders who only invest in low float companies, because of the potential for extreme momentum driven price fluctuations. Broadvision only has 3 million shares in the float, which could be purchased by one or two institutions within a very short time frame. Supply and demand is a primary driver in share price appreciation. With a limited supply and a large demand, share prices can more than double overnight, regardless of a company's fundamentals. With Broadvision, investors benefit from the exposure to both strong fundamentals and a low float.Risks Include Watching Paint DryThe biggest risk is that Clearvale and Vmoso do not develop as anticipated, and do not continue capturing market share. Much of Clearvale's current estimated valuation is based on strong demand within this sector, and the possibility that Clearvale will capture a meaningful percentage of this market. It is not close to a done deal at this point. Clearvale is basically a startup, and investors must realize the risks associated with backing early-stage ventures. Right now, the outcome is unknown and impossible to predict. Vmoso is even earlier than Clearvale, having just been announced last quarter.If Clearvale does not take off, and Broadvision continues to pump money into R&D, the company will continue to burn through its cash reserves. At this rate, Broadvision has sufficient cash for 10 years. The downside is none of the catalysts occur, the company remains quiet, and the stock drifts lower. Based on cash in the bank and other assets, though, I think the absolute max on the downside for the forseeable future from its current price is 20%.Broadvision has been relatively flat for an extended period of time, outside of a large spur in the stock price based on a takeout offer and what appeared to be a stock promotion following that by notorious promoter Jonathan Lebed. Lebed was the same promoter hyping Midway Gold four months ago and was one of several reasons I correctly predicted that Midway appeared to be a good short following a runup.If Broadvision's legacy business starts experiencing a sharper decline and its Clearvale and Vmoso businesses do not ramp up in revenue, the company could start burning through cash faster while the value of its other assets drops substantially as well. This would put more of a dent in Broadvision's market cap and start eating to its most hard asset, its cash.The real opportunity here at this price point is that you can buy Broadvision and only have at most that 20% exposure to the downside if the company continues its lack of communication with shareholders and none of the potential catalysts listed come to fruition. This is based on the company's cash position alone and looking at the stock's all time historic lows. While positioned in the stock, though, and understanding this risk, Broadvision could realistically be $30 overnight based on its fundamentals if any positive news starts to be released by the company. If the company starts communicating better with investors and providing more transparency on the updates of its new businesses, I also believe several funds could be enticed to position themselves in the stock based on this undervaluation and there is not much supply.ConclusionIt is rare to find such a level of mispricing in today's market. Today's investors are getting all of Broadvision's assets apart from its cash for free. Broadvision's non-cash assets could potentially be worth more than $100 million, and if Clearvale and Vmoso gain more traction this number could grow larger.Broadvision provides the ideal asymmetrical trade. The downside is the stock drifting down 10-20% further with no immediate catalyst. The upside while waiting at a below cash valuation is that this is the type of company and the type of stock that can double or triple overnight.Disclosure: The author is long BVSN.

1659592,30951,2013-08-27T11:55:42-04:00,,"BroadVision (NASDAQ:BVSN) develops, markets, and supports enterprise portal applications. While the stock has been the unfortunate target of a penny-stock promotion by the National Inflation Association which has left many investors burned and bruised, this is not your typical ""pump and dump"" - there is a legitimate business underlying the equity, albeit one that I believe still suffers from significant structural problems. While the shares trade at just a hair over net-cash on the books, I don't see a substantial amount of downside from here, but a material upside catalyst may prove elusive.What Does BroadVision Do (And How Well Does It Do It)?At its highest level, BroadVision develops three major products: Clearvale, which is essentially a ""social network for business"", QuickSilver which is a set of document creation and management tools, and K2 which is a portal and e-commerce product. These products technically fall under ""social networking"", which has historically made it a very easy target for stock promotion given the successes of social networking giants Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and LinkedIn (LNKD).Unfortunately, despite what on the surface seems an apropos set of products for the era of social media, BroadVision's financial performance has been nothing but lackluster. While the firm has occasionally enjoyed quarters of brief profitability, it has continued to post net losses on a yearly basis. Now, over the last year, the company has managed to somwhat narrow its net-losses, although it has done so by keeping both R&D and SG&A spend in-check. This is a classic red-flag for a company that looks to compete in highly competive tech environments. Unfortunately, this leads to a negative feedback loop, as Broadvision's R&D and SG&A have tracked the decline in revenue quite closely:BVSN R&D Expense TTM data by YChartsWhere Art Thou, Buyback?The really frustrating thing about BroadVision is that it essentially trades at cash value, meaning that the business itself is valued at $0. Now, in light of this as well as the substantial cash position on the books, BroadVision could very much afford to buy back a substantial amount of shares while still remaining highly liquid. However, on the most recent call this was brought up and summarily dismissed by Dr. Shin-Yuan Tzou, CFO,The problem here is that BroadVision really played up the fact that it was seeing significant customer momentum and that despite small bookings in the near-term (as many of these customers start with a limited trial), that there could be substantial upside should these ""try-outs"" materialize into a broad adoption of BroadVision's products. The problem here is that, if BroadVision believes that its products are viable and likely to see success, then buying back shares at an EV of $0 is the perfect use of capital, since the $49.5M on the books is certainly not required to finance operations (cash burn on an annual basis has been ~$4M - $5M). If the company does not believe that buying shares at an EV of $0 is a good use of capital, then that would signal that all of the R&D spending and destruction of shareholder value has been largely for naught and that going forward things won't be much better.I'm not so concerned about a lack of special dividend because that is a one-time cash distribution that doesn't really create a whole lot of value. But buying back shares when they are ""obviously"" dirt cheap ahead of an inflection point in the business certainly does create value (as the value of those shares bought back are likely to appreciate).Beware The MomentumShares of BroadVision are up 20% or so in the last month, likely on the news item that SugarCRM will be partnering with BroadVision to offer its Clearvale platform. While it remains to be seen what sort of financial impact this will have going forward, I would beware the current momentum in the shares on this particular news. While the shares aren't nose-bleed expensive, the shares look extremely overbought. Further, until I see some evidence that the company can actually become consistently profitable, and can do so via organic revenue expansion rather than cutting into its R&D life-blood, I remain hesitant to be long the shares and as a result remain on the side-lines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

There are no analyst projections, so market share comparisons should be made to its primary public competitor, Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE).Analysts are expecting JIVE's Q1 revenue to be up more than 50% to $24.4 million versus $16.1 million in Q1 of 2011. The company has been executing extremely well, giving us confidence in its ability to meet or beat analyst expectations. JIVE will report Q1 earnings on May 8.In contrast, BVSN will have to report revenue of $7.7 million to match JIVE's growth trajectory. By definition, matching its rival's growth is required to maintain market share. Thus, anything less than 50% year-over-year growth will imply continued loss of market share at a critical point in the market development.While Broadvision continues to make progress with its Clearvale platform, we believe that the company is unlikely to hit the aforementioned $7.7 million number. Accordingly, we continue to believe that BVSN would be more appropriately priced in the mid-teens.We will revisit this price target after the call, subject to how close BVSN comes to maintaining its market share relative to JIVE.Disclosure: I am short BVSN."
445311,21815,2012-03-20T08:57:27-04:00,,"Well, there is something of a robbery going on at broad daylight. It really is an object lesson of a financial scam, and with that, it should also serve as an example for those that think that financial markets are 'efficient,' and don't need regulation.It is the story of BroadVision (NASDAQ:BVSN). The shares got in the hands of a notorious small caps pumper called Jonathan Lebed last autumn, and it's not hard to see why. It has a small float (only some 2.5M shares), an no options are traded in the stock. It is also operative in an industry that is hypable, the social media business space.Broadvision's hope of revival (the company has been shrinking revenues at almost 20% per year for a decade, see figure below) depend on the combination of social media software and business applications. That is, it could (with considerable imagination), be associated with stuff like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Jive (NASDAQ:JIVE).We have already argued extensively why we think the shares are worth no more than the $8 they were trading before Lebed started his campaign, and others have done so as well (see links below).The company has done terrible the last decade and their hope of a turn-around is invested on ClearVale, a software platform in the social media business (a sort of Facebook for company purposes, enabling employees to contact one another and form informal groups). However, there are few, if any barriers to entry for the social-media business space, and there are other, much better placed competitors already, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), EMC (EMC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), HP (NYSE:HPQ), Jive, Yammer, Lithium, IdeaPlane and a host of others.Since Clearvale isn't a new product but has been available since 2009, it hasn't racked up much traction (although they did have a deal with Softbank, but that could have been helped by the fact that BroadVision's CEO Chen sits on the board).Here is what we believe a summary of happened:The people behind this obvious pump are gathering very large profits:With the float so small and the stock not being optionable, it could go on for some time more. But sooner or later they will run out of mail addresses and sooner rather than later, BroadVision is likely to have another quarter with shrinking sales, cash-burn, and little to no traction of their ClearVale platform.After several extremely damaging exposes by Peter Schiff, NIA cofounder George Hemminger (see link above), AlphaVolume, ShareholdersUnite (see link above), and the Association of International Deflation Society (indeed, a wordplay on the NIA), the stock has only given back a little from it's high in the 50s.However, they are getting so cocky that Gerard Adams (the NIA front man, also a penny stock pumper at WallStreetGrand) signed up at Seeking Alpha and produced a rather stunning piece. It's pretty obvious from that piece that they don't take anything they say too seriously themselves anymore (we doubt very much they ever did) and they make only razor thin efforts to hide that.All of it has already been refuted multiple times, by the exposes mentioned above (and the comment section has a few additional tidbits to that effect), and even by the CEO Chen himself (in the latest 10K), who is at a complete loss to relate the six-folding stock price to anything happening in the business:Adams claims to have thoroughly researched all the other offerings in the crowded social enterprise space and arrived at the conclusion that:Too bad he's not willing to share even a single morsel of that ""research."" If he had, he would have arrived at the same conclusion of the 10K, ClearVale hasn't generated significant revenue. With entry barriers in the industry so low and the space so crowded with much more established players (see above) it's very unlikely this will happen. Here is the 10K again, if you still had any doubts:But meanwhile Lebed and Adams (and perhaps the people from Marlin Capital) are laughing all the way to the bank. The curious thing is, by now, more or less everybody knows this is a complete scam, and even the perpetrators make only token gestures to pretend otherwise.Yet, the stock keeps up relatively well. After another disaster of a quarter with more losses and shrinking revenues published on January 26, the stock is now probably worth even less than the $8 it traded at before the pumping began.Since ClearVale hasn't raked in any significant sales, one might wonder whether this all too visible stock pump is doing the company any good. Who would want to buy software from a company that is the subject of this much obvious hype? Especially since there is a host of ready made alternatives available from much more reputable companies.Apart from stating that there isn't any corresponding change in the business, the company has been silent. It's a pretty awkward dilemma for them since they're substantial holders of equity in their own company (the CEO has 35% and the CFO seems to have filed shares to sell.ConclusionThis is a rather curious situation. Anyone who has given this even a casual glance will have arrived at the fact that the stock price has come completely detached from the business reality. What's more, even those that tout the company are hardly making an effort to hide this. So we've entered an almost Baudrillard-like world of self-referential simulacra detached from reality.This isn't the first time we see something like this. It happened on a much grander scale during the dot.com bubble early in the century.The touters basically dare us, almost giving up even the pretense that this company is going places. That has so comprehensively been refuted by critics and, more important, the company filings itself that it would be useless to pretend otherwise.What's left is their grip on the stock price, however temporary or tenuous, and the threat that the shorts will be squeezed out. Buyers are latching on thinking they can hatch a ride on this for a quick buck. But apart from the all too real issue of the legality (let alone morality) of all this, reality has a habit of biting people in the back when they least expect it. It always does.Disclosure: I am short BVSN."
525031,23563,2012-04-25T02:45:04-04:00,,"Broadvision (NASDAQ:BVSN) is overvalued, and Wednesday's earnings release should further demonstrate that. The company's shares have been inflated by the efforts of several stock promoters who have been hyping the company's enterprise social networking initiative, Clearvale.But in our opinion, Clearvale remains unproven and faces substantial competition from larger and well-funded players. Given the number of companies that have entered the enterprise social networking competitive landscape, we think Clearvale will fall short in its attempts to generate value for Broadvision shareholders.As a result, we expect today's earnings release to remind investors that Broadvision is in very much a transitory mode. Earnings per share and operating profit could very well be negative in 2012, if recent history is any indication. The company's legacy products are in decline and unlikely to re-enter a growth mode. In the meantime, the company's Clearvale product did not generate material revenue in 2011 and should remain unprofitable throughout 2012, given that Clearvale remains in a development phase where R&D and marketing costs will likely outweigh any initial revenue. As such, we expect continued losses at BVSN.Legacy Businesses in Rapid DeclineFirst, let's discuss Broadvision as a whole. The business has been in serious decline over the past five years, with both revenue and profit on a steep downward trajectory, as we can see below.Revenue has declined at a compounded annual growth rate of -19% over the past four years. Operating profit has turned negative for the past two years, coming in at -$3.4 million in 2010 and -$4.7 million in 2011.The company's drop in revenue has been caused by its troubled legacy products. These legacy products include a variety of software solutions that customers can implement for e-commerce, customer interaction and other functionalities on both intranet portals as well as external websites. Products include Broadvision's Business Agility Suite, Commerce Agility Suite and Quicksilver solutions, and descriptions of these products can be found here and here.These businesses have been suffering rapid decline and there appear to be few expectations of a turnaround. Management makes this relatively clear in both SEC filings and conference calls. For instance, in the company's most recent earnings call, CEO Pehong Chen commented that ""Market maturity and consolidation mean that all legacy solutions cannot sustain a growth business."" In the third quarter earnings call, Chen elaborated:Clearvale: A Small Player Competing Against Well-Funded GiantsGiven its declining legacy business, Broadvision has focused its turnaround efforts on its new Clearvale product. BVSN has substantial cash on its balance sheet, and Chen has signaled that much of this cash will be used to fund Clearvale's development. Clearvale is an enterprise social networking (""ESN"") product that is intended to enable customers to build the next generation of interactive internal portals and external websites.Unfortunately for Clearvale, it is competing with large competitors with deep pockets, many of whom currently have more advanced offerings and began developing their enterprise social networking solutions before Clearvale.For instance, type ""Enterprise Social Networking"" in Google. Paid ads include ones from Jive, Salesforce, Yammer, Socialcast, Spigit, etc. Clearvale does not appear until the second page. Below is a list of companies which have released enterprise social networking solutions:The list of industry titans devoting resources to the enterprise social networking market is daunting. IBM launched IBM Connections several years ago, and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) SharePoint, a broad content-centric collaboration offering, is increasingly becoming prevalent in a social enterprise context. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has made its Chatter social networking product a central focus, and given Salesforce.com's track record of forward-looking and innovative products, we think that Chatter may end up being the main enterprise social networking platform for customers who already use the Salesforce CRM platform.Putting these tech largecaps aside, Jive Software (NASDAQ:JIVE) is the leading enterprise social networking platform right now, and is increasingly running away from the competition. The company now sports a $1.5bn market cap and a blue chip customer base. Yammer has received more than $140 million in venture capital funding to-date, while SocialCast has been acquired and is now a subsidiary of tech giant VMWare, Inc. (NYSE:VMW). Finally, a slew of other competitors have viable offerings, including Intel Capital-backed Telligent, VC-funded Moxie Software, etc.We have reviewed many of the competitor platforms, and found quite a number superior to Clearvale. In a telling report, Forrester, a leading IT research firm, published a study reviewing the enterprise social networking sector. Throughout the report, there was not a single mention of Clearvale. In explaining why they excluded certain vendors in their report, Forrester wrote:Clearvale likely belongs under this classification, as it has apparently not won enough clients to put it on the map for Forrester. To better understand Clearvale's limited inroads thus far, it's instructive to compare Clearvale's customer testimonials with the customer lists of its competitors. These customer testimonials are available on the Clearvale website here, and provide a brief description of these companies in the table below:Compare Clearvale's customers to sample customers of competitors:Another way to examine how Clearvale stacks up to the competition is to compare revenue between Clearvale and JIVE, the only publicly traded pure-play enterprise social networking business. In FY 2011, JIVE generated $77m of revenue. In contrast, ""Clearvale did not generate material revenue in 2011"", according to the most recent 10K. Based on press reports on the internet, we also believe that SocialCast and Yammer are generating at least $10m+ in revenue.To be clear, we are not saying that Broadvision's Clearvale will be unable to transform itself into a viable player within the enterprise social networking sector. We are, however, arguing that thus far there is limited evidence supporting that, and the tripling of the BVSN stock price in the past four months is not justifiable when examining the current economic potential of Clearvale.Clearvale has a tough road ahead of itself. It is competing in a crowded sector against well-funded competitors, many of whom have more financial resources for R&D and marketing expenditures than Broadvision, even after accounting for the $54 million of cash on the company's balance sheet.From our review of the available service offerings, we would argue that quite a number of Clearvale's competitors have more user-friendly interfaces than Clearvale, and equally robust functionality. In examining the various leading enterprise social networking options, we were unable to find sufficiently differentiating factors with the Clearvale platform to become comfortable that Clearvale would be able to catch up to its competitors in market share.While Broadvision management may argue that the ESN revenue opportunity is vast enough to allow quite a number of providers to survive, Clearvale has yet to post meaningful revenue, whereas its competitors have already posted tens of millions. Clearvale needs to report more progress, in terms of sales, profit, customer wins and industry acknowledgement, before we can justify the current share price.Disclosure: The author is short BVSN.

438401,27561,2012-03-16T07:20:31-04:00,,"I believe there has never been a more opportune time in history to invest into the social enterprise space. This is an unprecedented time for investors and one that can not be missed. The question still lingers which company will capitalize the most in the upcoming months as the biggest IPO in the history of Wall Street nears with social media giant, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Facebook is said to IPO with a valuation as much as $100 billion and the social media sector could be set to explode. There have been many companies that have capitalized already from this social media boom and this is just the beginning. The problem is that the investors that will be making the most return on investment from the Facebook IPO have already been positioned long ago and will most likely be selling during the first few months of being public as the new sheep decide to jump on the bandwagon a bit late.I have been positioning myself in what I believe to be the new ""Social Boom"" which is the next mega-trend known as 'Social Enterprise.' The Social Enterprise space which is still very undiscovered combines three of the hottest sectors into one including cloud computing, social networking and mobile.The leader in the social enterprise space, JIVE Software (NASDAQ:JIVE), just hit a new 52 week high of $25.70 per share since its public debut December 13 at $12 per share. JIVE now has a market cap of $1.557 billion and after subtracting their net cash position of $167.5 million, JIVE's social enterprise 'Engage' platform is now receiving a valuation of $1.4 billion. After researching every competitor in this space, there is one company in particular that is way oversold and what I believe to be the most undervalued social enterprise stock in the world, Broadvision Inc. (BVSN).BVSN is currently trading at $44.47 giving it a market cap of $204.43 million. If you subtract BVSN's strong cash position of $54.4 million and $17 million of their legacy products, BVSN's social enterprise 'Clearvale' platform is currently receiving a valuation of only $133 million. This valuation is an artificially low 1/11 of JIVE's platform valuation of $1.4 billion.Not only is Broadvision's Clearvale being valued at a shocking 1/11 the valuation of JIVE's enterprise social platform, but Clearvale is also a much better platform. In BVSN's latest press release there are quotes from many top CEOs that validates this premise and I wouldn't be surprised to see leading social analysts rank Clearvale as the best social enterprise platform compared to competitors in the very near future. As Broadvision's CEO has recently stated, the company's Clearvale is ""NBC - newer, better, cheaper."" CEO Dr. Chen was quoted in a recent interview:Most investors don't realize that BVSN has been around for almost two decades and CEO Dr. Pehong Chen is an eCommerce pioneer and a Silicon Valley giant in the days before the dotcom bubble burst. BVSN has survived the first dot com bubble and with that experience it is set to create sustainability and real growth during this new social media phenomenon. Unlike many of the social enterprise companies today like Yammer and JIVE who have been trying to make changes to their platforms constantly to keep up with the future trend, BVSN is one step ahead of the competition.Just this week, the company was a founding partner of one of the biggest digital conferences this year along side Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Juniper (NYSE:JNPR). At the conference, BVSN announced breaking new features to their Clearvale platform which can be read in their latest press releases. Furthermore, BVSN has long-term experience dealing with big clients like the U.S. government, U.S. military, banks, and Fortune 500 companies.There has never been a better time to invest in such a solid long-term company taking this rapidly growing industry by storm then right now. I believe BVSN is set to bounce to new highs during the upcoming week now that the profit takers have sold on the news of BVSN headlining the Digital London Summit which ended Wednesday of this week.Now that the weak hands are out there could be another massive short squeeze headed into next week which could potentially send it past its recent 52-week high of $56.46 and to new highs above $60 per share. The technicals continue to show many short-term dips with an overall long-term bullish trend which can be seen here - BVSN 3 Month Chart. This is by far the best chart I have ever seen in all of the years I have been trading.Don't be left behind as a new paradigm shift of wealth is created with growing social companies like Broadvision. I have never seen such desperate measures taken before by short sellers and naked shorts but with the fundamentals, growth, management, booming industry and small float of BVSN, this is a shorter's worst nightmare. Currently, there are 428,893 shares short and this doesn't even include the naked short position which in my opinion is many times greater.Also, the stock has been on the Reg Sho list for 40 days and counting. BVSN has been on the regulation sho list more than any other stock in the market (not including two ETFs) and is now listed as 'imminent buying' which could lead to a massive short squeeze.Let the short squeeze begin.My company has published a special report on Social Network Stocks which is highly recommended to learn more about BVSN and why it is the most undervalued social enterprise stock in the world. This report also discusses Facebook and competitors like JIVE and Yammer. To receive this exclusive report please click here.Disclosure: I am long BVSN.Additional disclosure: I currently own 164,902 shares of BVSN and 108,700 shares of JIVE. I intend to sell my shares and can sell them at any time. I reserve the right to accumulate more shares at any time."
672301,21815,2012-06-20T12:00:26-04:00,,"There seems to be some life left in BroadVision, the enterprise software producer with a decade of slumping sales. This is nothing short of astounding. When the stock of BroadVision (NASDAQ:BVSN) surged on promotional activities from Lebed and the ""National Inflation Association"" (NIA) from $8 to $50+, we warned (here and here) that this was all hype and the stock would come back pretty soon.It did. But after briefly being back under $10 again, the stock surged 25% once again on high volume last Friday, this time not on any stock promotion but on the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) buyout of a (private) competitor Yammer:It continued to rise on Monday, although it closed well off its highs. Once again, hope has taken over from rational investing, we don't think there is much, if any, reason for that hope.Business model The reality is that ""social networking software for business"" isn't, and won't be a particularly profitable industry. Despite all the hype and despite combining it with concepts as the cloud, or Saas (software as a service).The realities are that the industry characteristics will prevent this from becoming very profitable. The quote above already indicates that the space for social networking applications for business is quite crowded. There are dozens of offerings, it's a near commodity.It isn't a terribly complex product so the barriers to entry are very low (witness the small private companies). There isn't much reason for a standard either, so you don't see a strong move towards one dominant player like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is in the consumer social network.It's simply a tool for business, and while useful, there are many vendors selling this tool.So even if there is strong growth (which is all that the hype ever mentions) in the use of social networking for business, this growth will be on low margins. The facts bare that out. Jive (NASDAQ:JIVE) a company that, unlike BroadVision, actually has a social networking product for business that generates sales growth, it makes no profit, and isn't expected to make a profit anytime soon.Jive is quite ridiculously valued at $1.27B, while its (loss-making) sales are just a fraction of that ($77M last year). Actually the loss (almost $51M) was 2/3 of revenues last year. And Jive can be considered a success, they actually manage to sell their social networking software to an increasing amount of businesses.BroadVision has yet to gain momentum for its Clearvale product while the company suffers from declining sales on its other products and losses accumulate. The Q1 figures published on April 25 this year were no exception. Revenues fell a whopping 25.4% compared to Q1 2011.Jive might well be a takeover target, as stated by Rick Aristotle from Motley Fool back in December:But BroadVision, that seems a very long shot to us. Yet, in a space that is dominated by hype and hope over a simple consideration of industry characteristics, one can still hope. The company still has cash to burn to try to turn things around but we keep wondering how many disappointing quarters with falling sales and losses we need for investors to see the reality.When Lebed and NIA started promoting this company, the shares were at $8. Since then, we had only more disappointing figures so we think the shares aren't worth even that anymore.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in BVSN over the next 72 hours."
422431,21815,2012-03-09T09:11:36-05:00,,"The stock has increased six-fold in a couple of months while there is absolutely nothing in the business development that even remotely warrants this. For starters, ponder over the following statement from their latest 10-Q SEC filing:However, let's first look at some fundamentals. BroadVision (NASDAQ:BVSN) is a company that develops so called business portal software for businesses:This is software that provides each user with a customized view of the company, (supposedly) all the info that his 'role' needs to know in order to function well. Although useful, this is pretty old hat and the sales are declining.Two years ago, they developed Clearvale, a business social media platform, but in the two years since, this hasn't gotten much traction either (see below).Some metrics (Yahoo):Now, our attention was simply attracted by the chart. In December, this was an $8 stock, it has increased six-fold in just over two months. It is now a 50+ stock. Really remarkable, as there hasn't been a single positive morsel of info from the business side, quite the contrary.Is this six-fold rise in the share price warranted? We're afraid we have to answer that question with a rather emphatic no. When revenue is shrinking and losses are increasing, we can't see any reason to warrant this dramatic rise in price. Absolutely nothing. In fact, insofar there is news out it's all bad.In fact, in the last 10 years, the stock is down 98% and revenues have shrunk from $416M in 2000 to $17.5M last year. Sealing the deal is the fact that even CEO Chen seems at a loss to explain the sudden dramatic change in the fortunes of the stock price:Maintenance revenue on existing software deals are declining fast:And this isn't made up by new license sales, rather the contrary:So their business is bad. Very bad. While their revenues are plunging, they're eating up their cash. Their new software platform, Clearvale (a business social enterprise platform) has been around since April 2009. It is supposed to provide new impetus, but after two years it obviously hasn't been close to being able to turn things around. Quite the contrary.It gained one notable win with Softbank in November 2010 (not such a surprise, considering CEO Chen sits on the board), but that hasn't made any financial, nor market impact.This isn't a surprise because entry barriers to the social enterprise system software are low and there are many better placed competitors, like Jive, and Lithium. One can find detailed analysis of how Clearvale unfavorably compares to the competition elsewhere on the web. Unlike Broadvision, the competition is growing strongly. Revenues at Jive, for instance, were up 67% for the year, not down.There was an announcement by Chief Marketing Officer Giovanni Rodriguez to 'relaunch' Clearvale, also on November 9 2010, but apparently nothing has come of that and Rodriguez is long gone from the company.The hard conclusion is that we couldn't detect anything remotely in the development of the business that would warrant any rise in the share price (and plenty that warrants a falling one). Instead, it has increased six-fold in a couple of months. So what's going on?Enter the promo peopleWe don't have to look far for a reason to explain the sudden rise. With the low float (2.4 out of 4.5M shares) and the possibility for making all kinds of fantastic claims on the basis of vague similarities to business models like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Jive (NASDAQ:JIVE), there is plenty of room to attract the gullible. And this is what seems to have been happening, as the 'National Inflation Association' (NIA) has been promoting the stock rather heavily with a barrage of daily emails.And it looks like they are sitting on huge profits, which can trigger selling at any time, the disclaimer from their promotional article:In that article, the NIA article simply compares BroadVision to Jive, but that is basically saying nothing. Unlike BroadVision, which has falling revenues, Jive's revenues are growing at 70%+ a year. It's comparing apples an pears.BroadVision might have an impressive client list, at least according to the NIA. The BroadVision website mentions only a few of these but it just could be that the website is out of date. But even if they did have an impressive client list, this should cause alarm. If they can't grow or make a profit with such good clients, perhaps their products aren't that good. Jive's client list is a lot better, by the way, and so is that of Lithium, another competitor with which the NIA likes to compare BroadVision.Apart from comparing BroadVision favorably to its competitors (which is entirely unwarranted), the promotion is extremely light on facts or any remote appreciation of the risks. One will also look in vain for any revenue or profit guidance (and considering the track record of the company, there seems to be a good reason for that) or any valuation calculation.Analysts aren't likely to help either, as the last one gave up in 2005 (a pretty bad sign in itself), which gives the field entirely to touters like NIA.If one really uses a lot of imagination, one could argue that their shift from perpetual licenses and related maintenance contracts (their present business model) to a cloud based SaaS (software as a service) model might offer the opportunity for somewhat higher margins. However, from the latest 10-Q filing:To some extent this is the usual filing blurb, but it nevertheless inspires little confidence. We simply can't see any reason why this company should be valued substantially above cash per share, unless they manage to turn their business around anytime soon. In fact, there is every reason to value them below cash per share, as they're bleeding cash without an end in sight.And there is nothing indicating that they will be able to pull that off. Once again, the latest 10-Q:The last company interested to take over BroadVision was Vector Capital (in July 2005):Yes, that is indeed a steep discount to the market price.Fun and gamesThe NIA wrote this article in December when the stock was at just over $8. Look at the volume increase since. Could the start of the stock promotion have something to do with that volume increase? If not, what else? Basically, there isn't any other explanation available.They have been trading the stock themselves though:You might want to check what the stock price did between January 22 and January 26. From a high of $44.75 on January 24, the price slumped to a close of $22.03 just two days later (and when we're writing this on Monday, there is another $9 plunge in minutes, followed by a Phoenix like rise to close above $50). This is what happens if these people sell even a small part of their holdings. You might want to keep that in mind before you take a long position. The rug can be pulled from underneath you at any moment.You also might want to check something else. In the article on the NIA website there is a disclaimer underneath, stating their position. It's not clear whether this is their current position or the position they took when writing that article. Here is the thing. In an earlier version of writing this article, that disclaimer said they hold 148,400 shares. We copy/pasted that quote on Friday morning, March 2 literally (see quote above).However, when adding new info to the article on Sunday morning, March 4, the same disclaimer now says that they hold 172,300 shares. Could Friday's stock price gain be a result of the NIA buying an additional 23,900 shares?There are several preliminary conclusions:Who is the National Inflation Association?This is an outfit that tapped into the libertarian crowd. It has produced slick videos (which must have cost a considerable degree to produce) warning about the coming hyperinflation. It's already quite noteworthy (to put it mildly) that they double as stock touters.According to Peter Schiff (see video links below), the well known fund manager and broker who even has his own YouTube channel, the NIA has used much of the same analysis as he did, but started to denounce him personally to create attention for themselves.So it's an organization that is tapping into the libertarian crowd (Ron Paul supporters and hyper-inflationistas), gaining trust, attention, and, more importantly, email addresses. Who is behind the NIA? Well, the site is registered to a certain Gerard Adams. This Gerard Adams is a known pennystock promotor and has another website called WallstreetGrand.com where he promotes dozens of pennystocks (note the first one, the National Bank of Greece!). One also might want to be careful with that website, because pretty soon we got the following warning.However, the real person behind the NIA is stock promotor Jonathan Lebed. He was the 15 year old guy that gained notoriety for using Yahoo (YHOO) as a forum for his pump and dumps and had to settle with the SEC as a consequence. Watch how Peter Schiff is accusing him of the BroadVision pump (and, after a reaction from the NIA, here is a follow up from Schiff).But more damaging still is the interview Peter Schiff has with the NIA co-founder George Hemminger. In this interview, the latter makes several very damaging claims:Hedge fund connection?On October 4 of last year, the SEC filed a 5.5% holding (248,771 shares) by Marlin Capital Investments, a hedge fund run by Barry Honig and Michael Brauser. But in fact, that filing mentions the following:And indeed, here is that previous filing. Now, apart from the NIA, Lebed is also pumping BVSN on his personal website. When did Jonathan Lebed start his BroadVision promotion campaign? Exactly, on September 21, according to his blog:That could just be a coincidence, albeit quite a noteworthy one. Lebed's personal promotion starts in earnest on the 9th of October, just a couple of days after the second Marlin filing.However, a subsequent filing shows a much reduce position (150,621 shares or 3.34%) as their take-over bid was refused:The coming crunchHere is a list of insiders that have every incentive to sell as they know the shares aren't worth anywhere near what they quote today.While Lebed and the NIA claim to be transparent about their holdings, what any of these other people and institutions do is up to them. All of them have rather strong incentives to sell sooner rather than later.The owners of Marlin Capital are somewhat controversial themselves, having been involved in numerous lawsuits (see here, here, here, here, here and here, for instance).Palo Alto Capital, which bought on September 30 last year is tied to Micro Cap Partners L.P. (see filing). This is a curious outfit, it pumped Absolute Health & Fitness (OTCPK:AHFI) unauthorized and received a cease and desist order for that.More to the point, why would both these two hedge funds take a position in BroadVision in September last year? As we've explained above, there isn't anything to even remotely suggest the business is about to turn around, and the subsequent quarterly figures have emphasized this once again (see the SEC filing).Is it a coincidence that Lebed started his tout on the exact day Marlin filed? Somewhat unusual for a stock promoter, Lebed argues he is not compensated for his BroadVision campaign (again from his blog):So he's just doing this referrer (and/or the client) a favor, but both are shareholders. What's more, the NIA site has a noteworthy item on the bottom of the BVSN article:This basically reduces the referrer to either Marlin or Palo Alto Investors. Both took large positions in the company when absolutely nothing in the business development seems to warrant such a position, and did so just before (or on the exact day) Lebed and the NIA started their promotion campaign for the stock.Five months later, the case for taking such a large position hasn't changed at all, the quarterly figures out on Jan 26 showed that the decline of the last 10 years in sales continues.In the interview with George Hemminger above you can listen to how Lebed tours the country with clients to see boxing matches. Could these clients b be Barry Honig, a boxing promotor in his spare time, and used to be a Golden Gloves boxer himself?The curious thing is that neither of these have filed (they have up to ten days after selling to file). They can't possibly have expected this kind of bonanza, unless they are in on the promotion.What we do know is this. There is an increasing number of investors sitting on large paper profits. The number of email addresses that the NIA can exploit must be dwindling, and before that happens, there are likely to be a few big holders wanting to take advantage of this bonanza.Sooner rather than later, the rug will be pulled from underneath the gullible or daring investors that bought at these levels, and when that happens, the decline will be swift.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in BVSN over the next 72 hours."
71928,21743,2008-04-11T03:27:01-04:00,,"The overlooked news out Wednesday from BroadVision (NASDAQ:BVSN) is more proof that their new Software as a Service (SaaS) business is gaining momentum. The stock is currently trading at a valuation of 3.9 times e/v to earnings. The sales and earnings are largely attributable to the company's enterprise e-commerce software offering. This traditional business has been turned around and the new product offering out late last year is a huge advancement over previous versions because it is completely standards based, is much easier to implement and also shifts the burden of site changes from programmers to business managers. The company is currently ramping up undersized sales and marketing to get the word out about their great new product offering.While the turnaround was taking place at BroadVision, they were investing in a new SaaS business for Workforce Relationship Management called CHRM. Their product offering was launched in China 4 months ago and within 2 months had grown to 30 customers totaling 20,000 subscribers (recently launched in the rest of the world). Wednesday, BroadVision announced that KongZhong will be using CHRM for its nearly 1,000 employees. Just more proof of continued growth of this new business. We should get more statistics out on the growth in CHRM when BroadVision reports their numbers on April 23rd. With the current valuation of the business you are getting a very cheap valuation on an enterprise software company and you are getting a SaaS business thrown in for free. Anyone who has been following the software space knows that SaaS has a very bright future. Pehong Chen's vision for the CHRM is quite incredible. The idea is to give away the lowest level of service and charge for more features and functionality. There might also be targeted ads in the free version eventually, since BroadVision understands how to give very relevant ads having been a pioneer of one to one marketing on the internet. The business model of giving something away and the money will follow has been hugely successful - just ask Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). The opportunity outside of upgrades and advertising that is being overlooked by everyone is payroll processing. There is currently no payroll processing in China. CHRM customers have their payroll information already in CHRM, so it is a very easy sell for BVOD to process their payroll. This is a multi-billion opportunity for BVOD. In my opinion, the value of BVOD is higher than the complete market capitalization of BVSN. Sales growth should be huge over the next couple years opening the doors to a possible spin off BVOD as an IPO. Any way you look at it, BVSN has huge upside potential and a huge margin of safety given its low valuation. Disclosure: Author holds a long position in BVSN"
407841,24789,2012-03-02T11:56:27-05:00,,"The most interesting and mischievous stock I've followed in my short investing career is BroadVision (BVSN). Every new trading day BVSN may move up or down as much as 40% on huge volume with large intraday reversals. BVSN's large volume increases and crazy price volatility is a result of a large and popular stock promotion. BVSN has been the highlighted stock for the popular political newsletter -- The National Association of Inflation (NIA). Since early December 2011, The NIA has been aggressively promoting BVSN as their strongest stock recommendation. The purpose of this article will be to critically analyze the NIA's investment pitch for BVSN and present factual information about the company. First, let's briefly learn about the National Inflation Association, their newsletter and also the company they are promoting - BroadVision Inc.The National Inflation Association or NIA is an organization dedicated to ""Preparing Americans for Hyperinflation"". The NIA has built a strong following with popular articles and videos about the United State's current debt issues and potential currency crisis. Honestly, I personally believe some of the NIA's work has a lot of merit to it. I initially found the NIA newsletter almost a year ago due to my political interests in Ron Paul, whom the NIA is a big supporter of. The NIA's newsletter typically recommends micro gold and silver stocks to help Americans hedge against the loss of value in the US dollar.BroadVision does not fall into the gold and silver sector and has little to do with inflation. Regardless, BroadVision is an online commerce and social networking solution company based in Redwood, Calif. BVSN's stock has gone parabolic in 2012 rising from $11.24 per share to $36.99 per share (as of 2/25/2012) for a fast and ample 240% gain YTD. The 178M market-cap company which employees 160 people, generates licensing and subscription revenue from primarily 4 e-commerce and social networking solutions to a handful companies.Getting back to the relationship between BVSN and the NIA, it is clear the NIA's stock recommendations have been influencing the stock. The first BVSN recommendation was sent on December 5th of 2011, since then the NIA has been sending BVSN pumps on a daily basis. Volume for BVSN was almost non-existent before December of 2011 and look at its recent price action.The volume surges clearly demonstrate the NIA has been manipulating the price action on BVSN. From late last year till now there has been no company news, no earnings surprises, or new product developments. Look what the company had to say in its most recent earnings release.So the company either honestly is not aware of The NIA's newsletter or is not afraid of an SEC investigation. Regardless, let's look at BVSN's fundamentals, financials and also evaluate the NIA's top BroadVision claims and decide for ourselves if a 240% YTD rise is justified.The first disconcerting thing about the NIA's research is how they neglect to mention anything about BroadVision's past, which is less than desirable. The company has had decreasing revenue figures for 11 years in a row. That's not a typo. the company has been losing sales for more than a decade. BVSN lost 1.8 million last quarter and since the company's inception has an accumulated deficit of $1.2 billion. BroadVision in its lifetime of operations has lost seven times more money than its current market cap. In fact, after the doc.com bust, BVSN was actually delisted for a short period of time. In 2005, when BroadVision was struggling with liquidity issues they almost sold the company at 35% discount to Vector Capitol at just $0.84 cents per share, the deal however fell through. In addition to decreasing revenue and consistent insolvency, BroadVision has manipulated its stock price and the number of shares outstanding four different times.Without these splits and reverse splits BroadVision would stand at just $1.50 per share today. The aggressive 1:9 and 1:25 reverse splits are responsible for the company's small float which has attracted short term momentum traders whom have contributed to the stock's recent volatility and volume.BroadVision's past and recent poor revenue is never mentioned in the NIA's newsletter and when one recognizes BroadVision's poor sales it automatically refutes the NIA's main stock thesis, which is, that compared to other social network stocks BVSN is significantly undervalued. In every NIA newsletter, they compare BroadVision and its newest product, Clearvale, to other social networking stocks like JIVE, SABA, Lithium.com and Newsgator.com. The problem with this kind of evaluation is that these other stocks all have impressive revenue growth, some as high as 70% year or year, where BroadVision has declining revenue of almost 20% year over year. BroadVision is currently not growing and certainly not to the tune of companies like JIVE and Lithium. Consequently, BVSN does not deserve the same multiples as JIVE, SABA and Lithium.The NIA's second most popular claim is its praise for BroadVision's newest social platform Clearvale, which they describe as a best of bread social network platform. This is hard to believe as Clearvale has been available to consumers for years and revenue continues to decline. Additionally, I cannot recognize one Clearvale customer, you can view them here. When comparing customers of BroadVision to those of Jive Software or Lithium there is no contest between who the more reputable and capitalized brands prefer. If Clearvale was truly an innovative product why would it lack the impressive growth that other social networking stocks are seeing? Why does Clearvale also lack the names and business of large reputable companies that other social networking solutions are attracting?There is another recent development in the NIA's news letter that should bring caution to any long term BVSN investor. In every newsletter the NIA states this disclaimer at the end of their recommendation.The above disclaimer was published on Feb 13th. To my surprise after this email, the NIA did not send out a newsletter for a full week. Before Feb 13th they were sending out BVSN emails on a daily basis, sometimes twice in the same 24 hours. A week later on Feb 20th The NIA's started its BVSN promotion again but this time disclaimer had changed.Between these two dates The NIA sold 47,800 shares or 1/3 of their BroadVision position. With a cost basis of roughly $9.00 per share The NIA made an estimated $1.2 million in BroadVision profits. The NIA continues to promote BVSN but has sold 1/3 of their position. With almost a 400% gain I would assume the NIA will continue to sell its shares sooner than later. Investors also need to recognize that the NIA may have a biased perspective on BVSN as they admit to having business relations with a large BroadVision shareholder.When one first reads the NIA's newsletter it is easy to be excited and anxious about owning BVSN as an investment. When spun the right way a small social networking stock with a new product and cash on the balance sheet can seem attractive to the average retail investor, but please use caution. People underestimate the power of momentum short term traders and stock promotions. Long term investors who choose stock promotions as a long term investment have a tendency to be left holding the bag.In conclusion, it is my opinion that the NIA's newsletter and stock recommendation neglects critical facts about BroadVision and its poor growth and insolvency. BVSN is up 350% outperforming every other social network stock in 3 months while reporting one of the company's worst quarters in its history. The company has negative cash flow, negative revenue growth and negative ROE. BroadVision's Clearvale social network platform lacks the reputable partners and growth that other social network competitors are currently seeing. With decreasing revenue and stagnant Clearvale growth, I believe a three month 350% rise is unwarranted and believe BroadVision's true value is where it traded before the NIA's promotion, which would be roughly $10.00 per share. If you are considering BVSN for a long term investment please do extensive research beyond just the NIA's opinion. If considering shorting BVSN, there is a possibility that additional newsletter momentum, Facebook.com hype, short covering and forced buy-ins propel BSVN much higher.Disclosure: I am short BVSN."
127952,21743,2009-03-26T06:22:01-04:00,,"In my last article I spoke of why we are so excited about one of our holdings, Linktone (NASDAQ:LTON). They announced a great quarter, highlighted by a return to profitability (not bad for a company that at the time was trading at ½ of cash value). The stock is breaking out (thanks in part to a shout out by James Altucher on a TheStreet.com video). My reason for writing this follow-up is not to toot my own horn, but really to recommend that anyone that liked the Linktone story take a look at another one of our holdings, BroadVision (NASDAQ:BVSN).BroadVision is another company that is profitable and is trading at less than just the cash that they have in the bank. They have no debt and cash of $61.9mm or $14.11/share and as I am writing this the last trade on the stock was $13.00. Here comes the part that will blow you away; are you sitting down for this? In Q4-08 they legitimately earned 64c/share!BroadVision continues to generate free cash flow quarter after quarter. We think that revenues bottomed out during 2008 and we expect continued profitability even in the worst case scenario. The company’s product offerings are better than ever and they have a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) HR company named CHRM that is growing like gangbusters in China. The company said on the Q4 conference call that they expect it to turn profitable as a stand alone entity (read: spin-off some day) by the end of the year.We’re all about risk adjusted return, and BVSN has virtually no risk and 300%+ potential. They’re handing out free money across the street; will you venture over to claim yours or will you just assume that it is too good to be true before you go over to check it out for yourself?Disclosure: Author holds long positions in LTON, BVSN.OB"

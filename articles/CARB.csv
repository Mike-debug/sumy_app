4293004,104952,2019-09-23T10:40:34-04:00,"Carbonite currently faces major issues which include leadership change, class-action lawsuit, lack of organic growth, and sales execution issue.
        Around 45% of Carbonite's revenue in Q2 comes from its recent M&As of Mozy, DoubleTake, and Webroot.
        In Q2 earnings call, Carbonite announced a lowered FY 2019 revenue guidance of $443.5 million to $448.5 million. Prior guidance is $457 million to $471 million.
        Carbonite's share price has dropped by almost 50% since the beginning of 2019.","There are a few reasons for investors to be more cautious following Carbonite (CARB)’s mixed results in its most recent Q2 earnings call in July. Carbonite beat the EPS estimates by $0.1 but missed on revenue estimates by $8.18 million. Furthermore, Carbonite also lowers its guidance for both Q3 and FY 2019. Shortly after its Q2 earnings call, Carbonite’s shares were down by 19.9%. It traded downside further to reach its all-time low of $12 per share before heading back to $15.48 in the second week of September. While the shares volatility and the bleak outlook for the full-year guidance may scare the investors enough already, we think that there are more severe headwinds ahead.First off, we feel that Carbonite’s misses on revenue in Q2 is a lesser issue. We have seen how Q2 has always been a challenging quarter for the company, given its consistent misses on Q2 revenue estimates in the last two years.(Source: Seeking Alpha.)The magnitude of the miss was a bigger issue this time around. It appears that the margin of recent Q2 revenue miss was the largest among the other misses over the last two years.Then, there was a question about organic growth. During the Q2 earnings call, we learned about Carbonite's organic growth being in the low-single-digit despite the 69% overall revenue growth YoY:A sizable chunk of Carbonite’s Q2 $135 million revenue indeed comes from the acquired businesses. Without the revenue contribution from its recent Webroot M&A, for instance, Carbonite would end up with only $75.2 million of revenue in Q2, which the company admitted was below the expectation. The major culprit here was the underlying technology quality and the challenge in sales execution of its virtual server product, the Server Backup VM Edition:The company withdrew the product from its marketplace in July 25th, which resulted in lower revenue guidance for the full year. Subsequently, its CEO, Mohamad S. Ali, resigned from the role following his differing view on the virtual server product. It appears that this will be an issue that carries on to the next few quarters. The worst part is that following the company’s decision to stop the sales activities for the virtual server product, investors filed a class-action lawsuit on September 16th due to the company’s misleading information about its underlying technology and its significance to the overall financial performance.As per its Q2 earnings call revision, Carbonite will expect to end the FY 2019 with estimated GAAP revenue of $443.5 million to $448.5 million, which is lower than the prior guidance of $457 million to $471 million. Having ended the FY 2018 with $296.4 million, Carbonite’s estimated revenue range means it will expect to realize roughly 50% YoY revenue growth. Following Carbonite’s recent acquisitions of Mozy and DoubleTake in 2017 in addition to Webroot in 2019, the catch here is much of the overall growth does not come from Carbonite’s core data protection business:(Source: stockrow)With Webroot driving almost half of the revenue in FY 2019, Carbonite will bring its expected annual revenue growth rate up by over 26 PPS. Besides, the management also expects to deliver $30 million in cost synergies over four years from the acquisition. Despite the seemingly optimistic outlook on the M&A integration, the company’s debt level and its capacity to service the debt are concerning. To finance its $618.5 million Webroot M&A, the company took $550 million loan facility in February 2019.(source: stockrow)As a result, the company’s debt-to-equity ratio has increased significantly to over 2.5 in the next two quarters following the acquisition from 0.46 in December 2018. Further, in Q2, Carbonite’s G&A cost increased by 30.5% YoY due to the Webroot M&A integration cost to put downward pressure on its EBIT and EBITDA. All these factors eventually affect the company’s ability to service its debt. As we could see in the chart, Carbonite’s interest coverage ratio has remained in the negatives at both ends of Q1 and Q2 2019.On the valuation side, Carbonite appears cheaper in terms of TTM P/S relative to its peers which include LogMeIn (LOGM), Mimecast (MIME), and Upland Software (UPLD). The company whose TTM P/S ratio trades closer to Carbonite’s 1.47 would be LogMeIn, which has a TTM P/S of 2.84. Carbonite is also expected to achieve around a 35% forward revenue growth, which is much faster than LogMeIn's 9.71%. LogMeIn and Carbonite (through Webroot) share a similar exposure to the endpoint data protection market. However, there are a few reasons why LogMeIn deserves the premium valuation relative to Carbonite: 1) LogMeIn is a much larger company with far more established product lines than Carbonite. 2) LogMeIn has spent the majority of the last decade being a profitable business in terms of FCF, gross, and net income. 3) As we recently discussed, Carbonite's organic growth YoY has been in low-single-digit. Among all of Carbonite's peers, Upland Software is the company most well-known for its M&A-oriented growth strategy. However, Upland Software's successful M&A track record seems to reward the stock with a premium valuation. Upland's TTM P/S is 4.15, which is higher than those of Carbonite and LogMeIn, while its YoY revenue growth is over 50%.Pricing in all the factors, we prefer to stay on the sidelines until the company addresses the major challenges in its operations and proves that it can consistently succeed in its M&A executions.In the Q2 earnings call, we learned that Carbonite is facing a significant headwind due to the major issues related to its sales execution, managerial change, a slowdown in organic growth, and a recent class-action lawsuit. Despite expecting to end the FY 2019 with lower GAAP revenue guidance in the range of $443.5 million to $448.5 million, Carbonite still offers an interesting over 50% YoY growth. The majority of the growth, however, has been inorganic. Overall, we lean towards the bearish side on the stock, though we may revise our position given an improved outlook in the next two quarters."
4292163,35181,2019-09-18T00:57:29-04:00,"Carbonite has had several disturbing events recently, including product quality issues, CEO resignation, and new executive management installed.The company acquired Webroot and took on massive debt as a result. They will have trouble financing any more acquisitions.The stock has been declining for the past year, resulting in a speculative trade opportunity.","When I first started looking at Carbonite, Inc. (CARB), I thought it would be a great investment. The stock price has been in decline for the past year, going from $42.80 to a recent $15.48. The stock price is operating within a descending channel as shown below.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)The company appeared to be an undervalued SaaS with the possibility of a quick price rebound. But once I started reading the company reports, I had second thoughts about this opportunity. It appears that Carbonite is in quite a pickle. Here is the Reader's Digest version of what is going on. The CEO quit unexpectedly, a new management team has been brought in, a product had to be retracted from the field due to poor quality and the company has missed revenue guidance four of the last five quarters. The new management team has reduced guidance for the year.Despite the very chaotic situation that the company is in, I still find this to be an interesting short-term trade. The stock is severely undervalued and the company has good margins and free cash flow which I will get into later in the article.The stock price has been severely beaten down and I am expecting a bit of a bounce up to the $20-21 range, perhaps piercing the upper trendline. Of course, the stock could also fall to $10 or less, down to the lower trendline but I believe that this is less likely given the undervaluation and good margins. It isn't likely that this company is going bankrupt any time soon.I am giving Carbonite a speculative bullish rating with a target of $20. This is more a trading opportunity than an investment. Conservative investors should avoid this stock due to the company’s situation.The events surrounding Carbonite are pretty exciting, to say the least, but not exciting in a positive sense. Let’s start with the data protection business. In the words of the interim CEO:These words were carefully chosen. A class-action lawsuit is being initiated with the following claims:The fallout from this screwup is that the CEO has resigned, or should I say disappeared, the Chairman of the Board has stepped in as the interim CEO, and the executive management team has been revamped, and the company now has a new COO, CTO, CPO, and an interim General Counsel.The product quality issue at least partially explains the revenue guidance miss for the latest quarter.(Source: Portfolio123)But analysts don’t like it when SaaS companies miss their guidance. Good SaaS companies always provide very conservative guidance. This miss was not the first time. In fact, in four out of the last five quarters, Carbonite missed analysts’ revenue estimates. I can fully understand the latest miss but the poor guidance over time is a reflection on the management.In the last quarterly earnings call, the interim CEO provided forward guidance that can surely be met: “low single-digit growth.” This guidance resulted in a dramatic 20% drop in the share price. The guidance has obviously been lowballed and I can understand why the CEO lowballed the guidance. It was to restore credibility. But I can also understand the investment community reaction which was to punish the share price.Carbonite has been acquiring companies at a rate of one per year. These include Datacastle, DoubleTake, Mozy, and most recently Webroot. What is surprising is not the number of acquisitions, but the price tag. Carbonite had TTM revenue of just $357 million but acquired Webroot for $618.5 million. In 2018, Carbonite bought Mozy for $144.6 million. It appears that Carbonite is reinventing itself at any cost. I have heard that Carbonite’s products are outdated, and this seems to confirm it.In any case, Carbonite has taken on significant debt that will impede the possibility of future acquisitions, meaning that the company will have a hard time adjusting to the constantly changing and very competitive data protection and security markets.I employ a novel method of determining stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. A scatter plot is created for the 93 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe, consisting of the enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth.(Source: Portfolio123)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Carbonite is significantly below the trendline, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is much lower than its peers', given its estimated future revenue growth rate.My interpretation is that Carbonite is extremely undervalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe. This, of course, is not surprising given that the stock price has been falling for the last year.SaaS companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40%,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40% is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40% is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate, plus profit, adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40%:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40% calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available, (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition, and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin. Others use the operating cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor's perspective.I find that it is difficult to calculate Carbonite's revenue growth given the problems with the virtual server, channel pipeline, acquisitions in 2017-2019, including Webroot, Mozy, Datacastle and DoubleTake, and lowballed forward guidance in the most recent quarter.(Source: Portfolio123)As can be seen from the above chart, revenue growth has been all over the map. For the purpose of calculating the Rule of 40% metric, I am going to use 14.9%, which is the analysts’ estimates for next fiscal year versus the current fiscal year. I believe that this is the fairest estimate and is equal to the lowest TTM revenue growth for the last three years.Carbonite had a free cash flow margin of 18% for the most recent 12-month period, up significantly from nearly -3% back in mid-2016. Management has indicated that they have worked hard to get expenses down, especially with regards to the data center and that effort is to continue.(Source: Portfolio123)Carbonite's revenue growth is estimated to be 14.9%, while free cash flow margin is 18%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 14.9% + 18% = 32.9%Despite Carbonite’s chaotic state of affairs, the company scores reasonably well on the Rule of 40% but does come up short.There are two factors to consider with regards to the Webroot acquisition that could affect the free cash flow margin. First, management expects to save approximately $30 million in costs over four years as a result of the merger.Second, management has indicated that the $529 million debt incurred by the Webroot acquisition will be paid down as fast as possible.These two factors will likely cancel out any effect on the free cash flow margin. Therefore, I have to conclude that the company has work to do in order to bring growth and profits into balance and thus put the company's financials into a healthier state.As an investor, one wants to make sure that if a company missed on the Rule of 40%, it is at least not burning cash. My favorite way of examining cash burn is to create a scatter plot that shows the operating margin/EV versus forward sales growth for SaaS stocks. Then I compare the target stock, in this case, Carbonite, against the rest of the custom stock universe. The operating margin for my purposes is calculated as follows:Operating Margin = Gross Margin TTM - SG&A Expense Margin TTM(Source: Portfolio123)Carbonite is situated substantially above the trendline, suggesting that the company’s operating margin (gross profit margin - SG&A expense margin) is much higher than its peers' based on its future growth expectations.I am giving Carbonite a speculative bullish rating, in spite of the circus surrounding the company and failing on the Rule of 40%. My rationale is as follows:There are a number of risks involved with this trading strategy. First of all, Carbonite has taken on a lot of debt and this may be a problem if interest rates rise, or if the company needs to fund more acquisitions.The company may have difficulties integrating Webroot with existing products. This could result in more issues with the sales pipeline.The quality issues with the virtual server may cause irreparable damage to Carbonite’s reputation and/or affect channel partners.Even a slight miss on guidance or drop in billings can result in a drastic share price revaluation.The market has been bearish with regards to SaaS stocks recently and Carbonite specifically. The attack on the share price may not be finished yet. Expect a lot of share price volatility.The trade dispute between President Trump and China is ongoing and has the potential to cause market turbulence or even drive the United States into a recession.Carbonite is in the business of data protection and endpoint management, including endpoint security. The company introduced a product into the market that had quality issues that affected sales and the pipeline. A lawsuit is in the works. The CEO resigned and new management was installed.Carbonite has acquired Webroot, a cloud-based security and threat intelligence provider for consumers and businesses. However, the acquisition cost was extremely high, and Carbonite has been forced to take on significant debt to fund the acquisition.The stock price has been beaten down over the last year due to several guidance misses and questionable acquisitions. I believe that the stock is now very undervalued relative to its peers. The company has good free cash flow and margins so I don't believe there is any chance of bankruptcy. The only real question is whether the new management is able to kickstart growth.I have assigned Carbonite a speculative bullish rating. Conservative investors should not partake in this opportunity."
4070928,102646,2017-05-09T02:10:03-04:00,"Box and Carbonite have a lot of similarities.They were started in the same year, but Box became a household name.I explain why it is better to invest in Carbonite than Box.The thesis assumes that Box won't be acquired.","In 2015, Box (BOX) launched its IPO, raising $175 million at a $1.6 billion valuation. Since then, not much has happened. Although its valuation has gone up to $2.5 billion, it’s stock has trailed the Nasdaq 100 index which is made up of technology companies. Its annual revenue has increased from $216 million in 2014 to $399 million in 2016. It has beaten analysts' estimates in both earnings and revenue since its IPO.Box has increased its total number of users to more than 52 million, although just 16% of them pay. More than 71,000 companies – including 64% of Fortune 500 companies – use its products for cloud storage and sharing. It has a churn rate of 3% and an impressive retention rate of about 115%.There are several reasons why Box has underperformed past the IPO. It competes with companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG) which have better economies of scale. For instance, Google Drive comes preinstalled on most Android phones. Also, as other SA contributors have mentioned, Box is a misunderstood company. While its product is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Onedrive, and Apple Drive, its main target is different from them. I believe that’s the reason why most Fortune 500 companies use its product over the others. Also, investors are concerned with the company’s growth prospects.Box has never turned a profit and its net loss has increased from $116 million in 2012 to $150 million in 2016. This increase is attributed to its OpEx which has gone up from $153 million to $437 million in the same period. For such companies, investors are always willing to take losses as the companies invest in growth. The question is, how long will it take for Box to make money for its investors.To better answer this question, we need to look at Carbonite (CARB) - a company that is very similar to Box.Carbonite is a cloud backup company that targets small and medium-sized businesses. To an extent, Carbonite competes with companies like Box and Dropbox (DROPB). In fact, Carbonite’s customers are unlikely to use Box’s services because they can access their files and documents remotely and across devices. Its other competitors are companies like International Business Machines (IBM), Oracle (ORCL), Mozy, and iDrive that offer cloud and hybrid backup solutions.Carbonite held its IPO in 2011 and is currently valued at $613 million. Just like Box, it was established in 2005. Its revenue has increased from $84 million in 2012 to $206 million in 2016, but it has never turned a profit. It does not publish its user statistics, but in 2011, the company had more than a million paid users.The table below compares the revenues and operating expenses for the two companies in the past four years.BoxCarboniteData from MorningstarAs you can see, in 2013, Box made $17 million more than Carbonite. The difference increased by $197 million in 2016. The devil is in the detail. In 2016, although Box’s revenue increased to $399 million, its operating expenses increased to $437 million. On the other hand, Carbonite’s total operating expenses were just $149 million. In short, Box is spending more money in operating expenses than it's making in revenues.Most of Box’s operating expenses are going to sales and marketing. In 2016, the company spent $226 million (or 56% of revenue) on sales and marketing. On the other hand, Carbonite spent just $73 million (or 35% of revenue) on sales and marketing. This means that Box is paying more costs on customer acquisition than Carbonite. For how long will this continue?The table below compares the percentage of sales and marketing costs to revenue for select SAAS companies in the past four years.Data from YChartsThe percentage of Carbonite’s sales and marketing expenses to revenue is lower than that of Box and other SAAS companies. Yet, its YoY revenue is growing by almost 20%. Remember, Carbonite is a small company that does not get a lot of media attention – thus free marketing – the same way Box does. For instance, in the past one year, Box has been mentioned in TechCrunch more than 200 times, while there was no mention of Carbonite. This means that Carbonite has managed to perform well compared to other companies.As I mentioned, Box and Carbonite are different companies with similar products that target different type of customers. For instance, if you are a paying Carbonite subscriber, you will have no need for Box’s services. This is because, in both services, your documents and files are backed up in the cloud and you can access them remotely across devices. Therefore, to stay relevant, and to attract new customers, the companies must invest in both research and development, and acquisitions. In the past 4 years, Box has spent $328 million on R&D (or 31.2% of revenue), while Carbonite has spent $105 million (or 18%) of revenue on R&D.Box has spent a lot of money on R&D, but the product remains the same, albeit with a few new features. The features are shown below. Therefore, Box remains largely a one-product company. This is what separates the company from its competitors. On the other hand, Carbonite has diversified its offerings to include storage, data protection, and disaster recovery through acquisitions. In 2015, the company spent $15 million to acquire eVault, and in January, it spent $65 million to acquire Double-Take Software. Therefore, Carbonite’s data storage customers might also use its other products for disaster recovery or data protection.Source: Box PresentationSince the two companies do not expect to make a profit this year, I will not compare their PE ratios. Using the (less-effective) forward PS ratio, it is evident that Carbonite is currently trading at a bargain. It has a PS ratio of 2.8, while Box has a ratio of 3.9. The SAAS companies mentioned above have a PS ratio of 7.4, 5.0, 5.7, and 4.95. Part of the reason why investors are paying a premium for Box is that they expect it to be acquired. A few months ago, a list of potential acquisitions by Salesforce showed that Box was under consideration. The leaked document can be found here. Another reason is that Box has a higher growth rate. It has a quarterly YoY growth rate of about 25%. However, as mentioned, this growth is coming at a higher cost compared to Carbonite, which has a growth rate of about 20%.Final ThoughtsCarbonite and Box were started in the same year, but the latter became more famous. Since the two companies operate in a similar niche, it is very easy to compare them. Their revenues have grown significantly in the past few years. However, as I have shown, Box spends more money to acquire customers than Carbonite. Its operating expenses as a percentage of revenue are higher. Carbonite has also achieved a positive EBITDA, which means that its profitability might be near. Box’s main advantage over Carbonite is the amount of free advertisement that it receives. Still, Box’s sales and marketing expenses as a share of revenue are much higher. Another advantage that Box has over Carbonite is its customer retention rate, which is at 115% compared to Carbonite’s 86%. Still, I believe this is a good number for a company that is not well known."
4208816,52932,2018-09-28T06:09:30-04:00,"The stock of Carbonite, Inc. has risen significantly in 2018.The combination of strong internal performance and M&A activity have boosted almost all key performance indicators.A recent pullback in the stock has made it even more attractive to investors.","Shares of Carbonite, Inc. (NASDAQ:CARB) enjoyed a tremendously strong 2018 and even despite two large pullbacks (one in June and one in September), the stock is up 43% YTD.CARB data by YChartsStocks that have run up a lot quickly often see pullbacks during those runs due to profit taking and hesitance from investors who do not currently own the stock due to a fear of having ""missed the rally."" While both of these are understandable perspectives to hold, neither should supersede the relative valuation of the company. Carbonite is a great example of a company that has run in over the course of the year, but has plenty of runway ahead of it.Markets initially jeered CARB's Second Quarter Earnings Release on August 3rd when the company announced its quarterly earnings after market close the preceding day. This quickly reversed and resulted in a continued uptrend in the stock which extended into early September. Shares hit their 52-week high of $43.60 on September 7th, but have subsequently fallen to a very attractive level for potential investors.CARB data by YChartsNo significant news had been released by the company over the time period represented in the chart above, yet the shares still fell 17% - not just a nominal decline. This pattern could possibly represent the aforementioned profit-taking behavior that often occurs in the market, but that doesn't mean it is a barometer of where the stock should trade. There have also been fears surrounding the company's July equity offering coupled by the sale of 700K shares from co-founder David Friend.Equity offerings often elicit a negative response from the market, however, it should be retained that this simply means the company needed to raise cash and that the equity markets provided a cheaper source of funding compared to debt markets. Admittedly, it is often a move made in panic when a company needs cash ASAP, but that isn't necessarily a uniform scenario. Also, insider selling can often be a misleading event for investors.When someone inside the company buys the stock, it naturally implies that that individual believes there is value to be had where shares currently trade, but the inverse does not hold true. Insider selling can be prompted by a host of things, many of which involve the personal fiscal situation of that employee, and does not imply that person thinks there is no more value in the stock. Also, this equity offering happened in July before the stock ran to its 52-week high. Fears stemming from either of these events should be quelled once the reality of the situation is considered, although the headlines can understandably sway opinion.Switching gears to what drove the stock higher through the summer: the company performance. Carbonite's Second Quarter Earnings Report was headlined by a large earnings beat and 32% year-over-year revenue growth. The data protection firm had such a great quarter due to three overarching factors: top line growth, expense management, and its acquisition of Mozy from Dell (DVMT).Thanks to organic and inorganic growth, Carbonite was able to enjoy the benefits of both revenue growth and expense decline. The image below from the company's Quarterly Investor Presentation shows not only the impressive year-over-year improvement in key operating metrics, but also the long-term trends that are exceptional:This chart proves that Q2 2018 as well as the stock's 2018 run wasn't a one-off, but rather the result of successful corporate governance for years. Not shown here but follows a similar trend is bookings growth, which grew 28% year over year.A ""soft skill"" that CARB has been continually bettering is its brand awareness. CEO Mohamad Ali highlighted the improvements seen in this area in the excerpt below sourced from the company's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call:These are the sort of things that a lot people don't pay enough attention to, but can reap material benefits in the future. Gaining recognition and respect as a small company will alleviate growing pains as the company moves further along its corporate life cycle. Given how potentially large of an industry data management and cybersecurity is, Carbonite certainly has the opportunity to keep growing.As mentioned, the recent fall in Carbonite's shares is both unsubstantiated and shortsighted. Nothing has changed in the company's fundamentals from when it traded at its 52-week high, yet it is 17% cheaper than that right now. According to the Wall Street Journal, the stock is currently trading at 19x 2019 EPS, which is very reasonable for a high-growth stock. The analyst community seems to agree with that assertion as of the 10 analysts covering the stock, 8 have a buy rating while the other 2 have a hold rating. The table below provides a breakdown of high, low, and median price targets among analysts compared to where shares trade at the time of writing ($35.45/share):Carbonite's stock has provided investors with a tremendous return YTD and has fallen to a level that provides a great opportunity to get the stock well below where it should be. The combination of revenue growth and expense cutting results in a compounding effect on earnings, exactly what is being seen at CARB.

Source: CrunchbaseAccording to a market research report by Global Market Insights, the global endpoint security market was valued at $4.0 billion in 2016 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7% between 2017 and 2024.The main drivers for this expected growth are the rising awareness and adoption of security measures due to increased cybersecurity threats.Major competitive vendors that provide endpoint security solutions include:Source: SentieoCarbonite disclosed the acquisition price as $618.5 million in an all-cash transaction that it will fund from available cash on hand and funds from a new credit facility that has been 'fully committed.'Management said the deal will be 'immediately accretive on an earnings and cash flow basis... based on Webroot's current operating plan and existing customer contract.'With Webroot's FYE 2018 revenues of $215.0 million, it appears CARB paid price/sale multiple of approximately 2.88x, which appears to be a reasonably low price on a revenue multiple basis, considering many security companies have sold for multiples in the 5-7x range.A review of the firm's most recent 10-Q filing indicates that as of September 30, 2018, it had $201 million in cash and equivalents and $301 million in total liabilities, of which $267.3 million were current liabilities and $28 million was deferred revenue.Free cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was $24.5 million.CARB is acquiring Webroot to combine its existing data protection solutions with Webroot's machine learning-optimized endpoint security software to provide customers with a more comprehensive solution.As Carbonite President and CEO Mohamad Ali stated in the deal announcement:In the past 12 months, CARB's stock price has dropped 14% vs. the S&P 500 Index rise of 0.42%, as the chart below indicates:Source: SentieoCARB has a recent history of positive earnings surprises between 5% to 30% above analyst estimates:Source: Seeking AlphaAnalyst ratings continue to remain either positive or neutral, and the consensus price target of $37.11 is approximately 36% above its current price as of press time.Source: Seeking AlphaHowever, research firm Rosenblatt downgraded CARB from Buy to Neutral after its most recent earnings report when the firm announced the acquisition of Webroot. The stock dropped markedly on the news.Analyst sentiment in recent earnings calls has dropped noticeably, as the linguistic analysis graphic shows below:Source: SentieoWith the acquisition, CARB is moving 'up the stack' and away from increasingly commodified SMB storage to now provide endpoint security offerings to its customer base.Cross-selling opportunities will also exist to sell storage services to Webroot's customer base.So, that's the story from this acquisition. Webroot's business is all subscription and provides a complementary installed base and security service offerings to Carbonite's base and storage offerings.One question is whether this deal will make a material difference to Carbonite's core business, which appears to be softening or otherwise feeling the effects of increased commoditization.We won't know until several quarters after the deal closes, which is expected by the end of Q1 2019."

The company was founded by CTO Gary Sumner.Below is a brief overview video about Datacastle’s RED product on the Microsoft (MSFT) Azure platform:(Source: DatacastleRED)Datacastle’s main offerings include,The company launched its Analytics system in November, 2016, possibly in connection with its earlier acquisition of Seagate Technology’s endpoint data protection assets.Datacastle had developed a robust partner program composed of OEMs, telecoms, ISPs and MSPs, as well as value-added resellers.The firm raised at least $13 million in separate rounds of equity financing from Talu Ventures, an Australia-based venture capital firm, and debt funding from an undisclosed investor.Acquisition Terms and RationaleNeither company disclosed the acquisition price or terms and Carbonite didn’t file an 8-K, which would have been required had the deal materially changed its financial condition.The deal was confirmed by Carbonite’s SVP Marketing, Norman Guadagno, but Carbonite has been otherwise tight-lipped about it.That posture is not surprising, given CARB’s past focus on small and medium sized businesses, since the current deal represents the beginnings of a move into providing larger enterprises with mobile endpoint backup and recovery offerings.According to a 2016 Markets and Markets Research Report on cloud storage, it forecasted the overall market to grow from $24 billion in 2016 to $75 billion in 2021, a tremendous CAGR of nearly 26% for the six-year period.One of the drivers for this demand growth was cited as the ‘growing need for enterprise mobility.’So, the deal for Datacastle appears to be a smart move by management intent on acquiring and developing an enterprise-grade mobility backup and recovery offering to take advantage of that growth opportunity.Earlier in 2017, CARB acquired Double-Take Software for $65.25 million in cash and stock. Double-Take had developed migration and disaster recovery software for small- and medium-sized businesses.With the Datacastle deal, CARB will have significant new opportunities ahead of it, as it seeks to offer backup, recovery and analytics solutions to businesses of all sizes.It’s an ambitious undertaking, so integration and execution will be key in the quarters ahead.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

Profit growth expectations embedded in the stock price are likely unfeasible in light of current financial performance and formidable competitive challenges.We think execution risk is high and the probability of upside to already high expectations is low. The firm lacks a clear competitive advantage amidst a sea of well-established rivals. Carbonite, Inc. (CARB) is this week’s Danger Zone pick.Carbonite Inc. (CARB) offers cloud-based data storage and back-up solutions to businesses and consumers. CARB was among the first to offer cloud back-up services to the masses and went public in 2011 at $10/share. Since the IPO, the proliferation of cloud storage options and lack of timely innovation has resulted in the loss of first mover advantage and a deteriorating competitive position.CARB’s legacy consumer data back-up business is in decline. The company is now repositioning itself through acquisitions to target the business continuity and disaster recovery markets. The two original founders remain on the Board of Directors, but their focus appears to be on outside endeavors. The duo has raised capital for a cloud data storage startup, called Wasabi, to compete directly against Amazon Web Services (AWS).CARB has grown revenue 24% compounded annually since 2012. Over 60% of this growth (in dollar terms) has come since the end of 2015 by way of two acquisitions, which totaled $80 million in deal value. Revenue growth had slowed to 11% in 2015 before jumping to 52% in 2016 and 29% over the trailing twelve months (TTM).Most recently, revenue growth slowed to 10% in 2Q17 vs. 2Q16. This increase was mainly driven by the recent Double-Take Software acquisition. Without this acquisition’s $5-$6 million quarterly revenue contribution (per company guidance), it appears CARB generated little-to-no organic revenue growth over the TTM.Figure 1: CARB’s Revenue Growth & NOPAT Margins  Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsCARB has not achieved consistent profitability since going public. The company posted a break-even 0% NOPAT margin in 2014. Profitability then swung between -7% and +2% NOPAT margins over the next two years. CARB’s current NOPAT margin has dipped to -2% (TTM) due to expense growth. 2Q17 total expenses increased 23% vs. 2Q16 while 2Q17 revenue increased only 10% vs. 2Q16.In addition, free cash flow (FCF) swung to -$76 million TTM from $10 million in 2016 due to the decline in NOPAT and capital investment in acquisitions.Per Figure 2 below, management’s focus on non-GAAP metrics creates an illusion of profitability. Specifically, management’s definition of ‘non-GAAP net income per share’ allows for the exclusion of purchase accounting adjustments, stock-based compensation, litigation expenses, acquisition expenses, intangible amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest expense, and the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments at a 13% effective rate.Removing so many expenses relevant to the operations of the business, especially with the new acquisition-driven strategy, is suspect.Figure 2: Non-GAAP EPS vs. Economic EPSSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsPoor Return on Invested CapitalCARB’s return on invested capital (ROIC) has averaged -5% over the past two years. The current ROIC of -9% is in the bottom quintile of our coverage universe and well below the median 5% ROIC generated by 230 companies in the software and services sector.The main impediment to higher ROIC is NOPAT margin as the balance sheet is relatively efficient. CARB’s capital turnover ratio (revenue divided by invested capital) is 2.6 compared to an average of 1.3 for the software and services sector. For the company to earn an adequate ROIC above the cost of capital, it would need to earn a 3% NOPAT margin on TTM revenue without growing invested capital.This hurdle appears manageable given the software sector’s median 5% NOPAT margin. However, a low single-digit profit margin provides little room to maneuver, while invested capital seems more likely to balloon than remain flat given the investment in new business lines and acquisition-driven strategy.Executive Comp Aligned with Misleading MetricsWe know from numerous case studies that changes in ROIC are directly correlated to changes in market value. Accordingly, we favor compensation plans that use ROIC to measure performance to ensure executives’ interests are aligned with shareholders’ interests. Revenue and non-GAAP performance targets can be an incentive to sacrifice profitability for volume, or worse, engage in acquisitions that destroy shareholder value.CARB management focusses exclusively on non-GAAP in their presentation of company performance and to determine executive compensation. CARB’s compensation structure consists of base salary (~20%), incentive cash bonus (~30%) and equity incentives (~50%).Incentive cash bonuses are based on non-GAAP metrics such new bookings (50%), renewal bookings (25%) and adjusted free cash flow (25%). Equity incentives are intended to align executive’s interest with shareholders, but the shares vest based solely on stock price performance.While the stock has done fine during the tech stock bull market, the company has generated -$38 million of economic profits over the past five years. Until CARB aligns its compensation plans with financial goals that actually constitute profits, we are not optimistic that shareholder value destruction will come to an end on its own.There are at least 50 competitors within the consumer data back-up and protection market. These companies fall into two main categories: a) the cloud services of industry giants such as Amazon (AWS), Apple (iCloud), Google (GoogleDrive) and Microsoft (OneDrive); and b) significantly smaller independent companies seeking to differentiate themselves through product customization and customer service. The largest and most visible of these independent competitors include Backblaze, Box, CrashPlan, DropBox, iDrive, Mozy and SOS. Each of these competitors offers products comparable to CARB in terms of capability and pricing.Competition for consumer business among smaller firms, where discounted promotions are the norm, is fierce. CARB currently offers computer back-up plans from $59.99/year. BackBlaze offers computer back-up plans for $5/month. iDrive currently offers the first-year of computer back-up plans for 90% off, or $6.95. iDrive has won PC Magazine editor’s choice award in the category for three consecutive years. iDrive currently receives a 4.5 out of 5 (Excellent) rating compared to 3.5 (Good) for Carbonite.The industry giants’ integrated cloud services have commoditized the consumer market to the point where firms such as CARB have been forced to adapt by developing enterprise service platforms. We believe CARB has been slow to adapt to this new competitive reality. Competitors such as Box, Inc. (BOX) are far ahead CARB in the enterprise market despite the two firms being founded in the same year. BOX has business relationships with 64% of Fortune 500 companies and a co-selling agreement with Microsoft. Competing directly against Amazon is already a lost cause in light of AWS’s rapid growth to $12 billion in revenue.Disaster recovery and business continuity seem to be maturing into distinct markets, but they remain difficult to quantify and separate from the $50 billion expected to be spent by 2018 in the overall Cloud Professional Services market. According to one study, the disaster recovery as service market (DRaaS) is estimated to grow to $12 billion in 2020 from $1.4 billion in 2015. While there is a demand to fuel growth in this market, there is no shortage of well-established competitors, such as International Business Machines (IBM), Iron Mountain (IRM), Vmware (VMW), Equinix (EQIX), FTI Consulting (FCN) and Sungard Systems (private).CARB lacks a clear competitive advantage at either the consumer or enterprise end of the cloud services market. The company has all but ceded the consumer data back-up segment (~50% of revenue) to competitors. This consumer surrender is evident in guidance for -10%-0% growth in consumer segment revenue and recent acquisitions which are entirely enterprise focused. This re-positioning effort is likely to require an investment that will prevent near-term improvement in lagging profitability metrics.Per Figure 3 below, CARB’s NOPAT margin and ROIC rank near the bottom of a peer group that comes mostly from CARB’s annual Proxy Statement. These thin margins give CARB little margin of safety against adverse business conditions or capacity to invest for future growth with diluting investors with outside capital.Figure 3: Competitive Advantage Not Apparent for CARBSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsThe bull case depends on CARB successfully repositioning from providing consumer cloud backup to providing disaster recovery and business continuity solutions to small/medium-sized businesses.To establish an enterprise services presence, CARB purchased EVault assets from Seagate Technology (STX) and Double-Take Software from Vision Solutions (private). EVault assets were purchased from STX for just $14 million. Double-Take’s $65 purchase price was 73% less than the $242 million Vision Solutions paid in 2010. Developing these relatively small investments in discarded assets into an edge over well-established competitors strikes us as a longshot. The current stock price implies it’s a high likelihood.Bulls assume that synergies from recent acquisitions will cause revenue to accelerate while expense growth moderates. It is far from certain that recent acquisitions will bring the advertised revenue synergies. We also believe the competitive landscape will prove too challenging for CARB to back off expenses. CARB is more likely to be forced to spend aggressively in the near term to integrate acquisitions and pursue revenue opportunities. Under this scenario, reaching the profitability levels implied by current market expectations seems very unlikely.As noted above, we believe the near-term investment required for CARB to reposition from consumer to enterprise is likely to prolong the current period of losses. As such, we believe that earnings expectations for next year (currently $1.00/share) are far too high and likely to be revised lower as actual earnings are reported.Market participants have shown themselves to be more than willing to fund operational losses that drive high revenue growth rates, however. Revenue growth, however, is where we believe CARB will truly disappoint investors.As noted previously, we argue that CARB’s organic revenue growth in 2Q17 vs. 2Q16 fell to near 0% excluding the revenue contribution of Double-Take Software. If the consumer segment was operating within negative 10% to 0% growth guidance and the enterprise segment was growing in line with “bookings” growth of 20%-30%, then CARB’s organic revenue growth (excluding Double-Take) should have been 5%-15% in 2Q17, not 0%.Given the intense competition on the consumer side and the company’s too-little-too-late entry into enterprise services, we believe that revenue growth is a high risk of disappointing over the coming year.CARB shares have risen 16% YTD and 46% over the past year to outperform the S&P 500 (+9% YTD, +13% 1Y). This appreciation occurred, despite the steep YTD decline in NOPAT, due to speculation that the company can successfully re-invent itself. Market expectations for 2017 profits (i.e. “consensus EPS”) have increased 33% over the past year to $0.75/per share. However, this estimate reflects company-defined “non-GAAP EPS” which excludes a host of real costs. For comparison, “non-GAAP EPS” has totaled $0.50 over the trailing twelve months compared to economic EPS of -$0.26.To justify its current price of $20/share, CARB must grow NOPAT by 11% compounded annually for the next 19 years. This scenario assumes CARB grows revenue to $910 million (from $220 million TTM) or 8% compounded annually. This scenario also assumes the NOPAT margin improves to the sector median of 5% (-2% TTM). Achieving this scenario seems highly unlikely given that the consumer half of the revenue base is in decline while the enterprise half has yet to display evidence of sustainable growth at levels consistent with investor expectations.Even if we assume CARB can grow NOPAT 18% compounded annually over the next decade, the stock is still worth only $13.50 today – a 33% downside risk. This scenario assumes CARB grows revenue to $533 million, or 10% compounded annually. This scenario also assumes an improvement in NOPAT margin to 5%.Each of these scenarios assumes CARB is able to grow revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or investing in fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create optimistic scenarios that demonstrate just how high expectations embedded in the current valuation really are. For reference, invested capital increased from $39 million in 2012 to $86 million TTM, or 19% compounded annually.The largest risk to any bear thesis is what we call “stupid money risk”, which means a strategic buyer acquires CARB at a higher price despite the stock already being overvalued. In our view, CARB is not currently an attractive acquisition target due to its questionable competitive position and lack of consistent free cash flow.We begin assessing acquisition value by adjusting for liabilities that would make an acquisition more expensive than accounting numbers suggest. For CARB, these liabilities equal 7% of market cap:After adjusting for hidden liabilities, and baking in meaningful revenue growth and margin synergies, CARB is worth less than its current share price even in the most optimistic scenario. As shown below, an acquisition of CARB above the current price is possible only if the acquirer is willing to destroy shareholder value.Figure 5 assumes an acquirer’s ROIC hurdle in an acquisition of CARB is equal to the software sector’s 6% weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Even if an acquirer can grow CARB’s revenue 20% compounded annually and operate at a 5% NOPAT margin over the next five years, the stock is currently overvalued by 18%. Any deal that only achieves a 6% ROIC would likely be value neutral and not accretive given the software sector’s average WACC of 6%.Figure 4: Implied Acquisition Prices to Achieve 6% ROIC Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 5 assumes an acquirer’s ROIC hurdle in an acquisition of CARB is 8%, or the software sector’s WAAC plus a 2% economic profit margin. An acquisition of CARB at these prices could be accretive to a firm with a 6% WACC, assuming the revenue and margin synergies come to pass. Even in the best-case scenario, an acquirer would destroy $240 million in shareholder value purchasing CARB at its current valuation. The most an acquirer should pay for CARB is $11/share (45% downside).Figure 5: Implied Acquisition Prices to Achieve 8% ROIC  Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.CARB does not pay a cash dividend. The company does have a repurchase authorization in place through May 2018 with $5.2 million of the original $30 million authorization remaining. No shares were repurchased in 2Q17 following the repurchase of 767,000 shares for $15 million in 1Q17. At the current price of $19/share, the remaining authorization amounts to 1% of outstanding shares and a 1% potential shareholder yield.While heavy 1Q17 repurchase activity appeared to lift the stock, going forward CARB offers little of the downside protection that a solid shareholder yield can provide. Given the level of risk we see in the valuation and forward expectations, this protection could be sorely missed.Insiders own 16% of outstanding shares. Insider activity has been universally on the sell side over the past year. The last significant insider buying occurred in early 2016 when the stock was trading at $6-$7/share. Short interest is currently 2.9 million shares, equating to 13% of the float and 7 days to cover. The number of shares sold short has increased significantly from 1.2 million shares at year end and 320,000 shares a year ago.Our Robo-Analyst technology enables us to perform forensic accounting with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill fiduciary duties. In order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and an accurate shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to Carbonite’s 2016 10-K:Income Statement: we made $10 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $9 in non-operating expense (4% of revenue). We removed $9 million related to non-operating expenses and $1 million related to non-operating income. See all the adjustments made to CARB’s income statement here.Balance Sheet: we made $89 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $19 million. The most notable adjustment was $24 million (73% of reported net assets) related to off-balance sheet operating leases. See all adjustments to CARB’s balance sheet here.Valuation: we made $262 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $34 million. We made $148 million of decrease adjustments for total debt and outstanding options which were partially offset by a $114 million increase adjustment for excess cash. The -$34 million net valuation adjustment represents 6% of CARB’s market cap.The following funds receive our Dangerous-or-worse rating and allocate significantly to CARB.This article originally published on August 29, 2017.Disclosure: David Trainer, Kenneth James, and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."
3962914,56112,2016-04-05T08:44:45-04:00,"Carbonite shares have been battered over the past year.The company's recent acquisition of EVault does help shore up its competitive position in the critically important medium-enterprise server backup market, but there are still a lot of questions.The outlook for the consumer business continues to be poor.While I see upside to $11-12 (from $8 currently) if the company executes, I'm skeptical that either product or management is good enough in a highly competitive market.Carbonite remains a show-me story for now.","Data backup company Carbonite (NASDAQ:CARB) has several of the characteristics that I look for in a prospective investment - a clean balance sheet, an undemanding valuation, insider ownership and the presence of a founder, and two segments that have vastly different outlooks (making screening/consolidated financials not necessarily helpful in understanding the future of the business). While the company is best known for its consumer offerings - dollars to donuts you've seen the commercials - its SMB business, built out through various acquisitions, is now over half of revenue.Unfortunately, after digging into the market as well as the financials, I don't come away impressed by the quality of Carbonite's product offering or its management. I also think the consumer business may decline faster than expected given the increasingly ""good enough"" nature of cheaper/free sync and backup products for consumers. While I see upside to $11 or $12 (from the current share price of $8) if management executes reasonably well, I don't think it's a lay-up, and thus view Carbonite shares as a show-me story rather than a compelling investment opportunity.Consumer Doing What Everyone Expected… SMB Is The QuestionWhile Carbonite's consumer business ended 2015 up slightly, the outlook for a 0-10% decline isn't really all that surprising. While Carbonite's backup offering is technically a different product than the plethora of cloud-sync or backup products like Box (NYSE:BOX), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Drive, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) OneDrive, Dropbox (DROPB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and so on, the differences in consumers' minds are likely to continue to fade over time as they increasingly become the same thing from a functional perspective.Data relating to PCs from HP (NYSE:HPQ), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), et al have hardly been robust, and the ongoing move towards thin-client continues (as an increasing percentage of devices are packaged with faster but lower-capacity SSDs, with data-hogging photos and music stored in the cloud). With that, the decline of the consumer business is really more a matter of when than if from my point of view. Given the low double-digit churn, in the absence of significant marketing investment, high single-digit declines don't seem unreasonable over the medium term, although it could be much faster (or slower) depending on how much Carbonite wants to put behind it in terms of resources and how rapidly consumers actively choose to cancel in favor of other, cheaper services.The SMB business, on the other hand, is now over half of bookings (thanks to the EVault acquisition). Parsing through forward guidance, one factor that jumped out at me is that organic growth in SMB bookings appears to be decelerating meaningfully. In contrast to the consumer market, the SMB market is growing at a rapid clip; commentary from industry analysts as well as peers like Barracuda (NYSE:CUDA) suggests that >25% growth over the medium term should be in the cards. Against this, Carbonite grew SMB bookings at 35% in 2015, although the organic rate was lower backing out the benefit from the late-2014 acquisition of Mailstore.Looking ahead to 2016, while the headline bookings growth number is impressive - the midpoint of $105 million in SMB bookings implies 90% growth y/y - the largest chunk of this is derived from the acquired EVault business (which I'll discuss extensively in the next section.) Backing out the ~$42.5 million midpoint of guidance for EVault, organic SMB bookings from the ""legacy"" Carbonite business only look to increase at around 15%, from $54.5 million in 2015 to $62.5 million in 2016. (Even at the high end of the company's range, I only get to around 20% growth - still a marked deceleration.)This is a rather surprising number to me, especially in light of the company's success in building out its channel partners. Given his background, the new CEO has been focused on building out the indirect channel, and the company ended 2015 with more than 8200 resellers, up over 40% y/y. You would assume that this would help maintain or accelerate sales growth, but that's just not happening.The question of whether this is a competitive issue is a worthwhile one. Going back to the consumer discussion earlier, the trends are similar on the business side - backing up endpoint devices is viewed as less critical as backing up servers and applications. While EVault should help here, integration will take some time. Either way, since this is the future of the business, its growth rate is important for investors to follow.EVault Acquisition: So Many QuestionsAs I referenced, the big story in 2016 will be how the company integrates the EVault business acquired from Seagate (NASDAQ:STX). Strategically, the deal fills a gap in EVault's product portfolio - while its simplicity-focused solution works well for the ""small"" end of the SMB space, it lacked critical features offered by competitors such as Barracuda and Veritas that larger businesses need. EVault brings many of these capabilities, although competition is still fierce. (For those who put stock in Gartner quadrants, Seagate was categorized as a ""Visionary."")Incredibly, management didn't know basic details about EVault's business on the call. At the time of announcement, for example, they didn't know how fast the business was growing. In response to an analyst question about the growth rate of EVault, CFO Anthony Folger replied:Management's credibility in terms of meeting expectations isn't the highest to begin with (or the stock wouldn't be trading for 50% less than the buyout offer a year ago). That said, even if you take Folger's explanation for their uncertainty about revenue growth at face value, CEO Mohamad Ali followed up with this doozy on the Q4 call in February (see transcript) in response to an analyst question about seasonality:If the answer about revenue growth didn't make sense, this one just jumps the shark. How can you buy a business, and three weeks after closing, not know, at least vaguely, which quarters are stronger and which ones are weaker? That is pretty much Business 101. That is something literally, anyone on the sales team could tell you if you asked them. ""Summer's slow, but year-end is big,"" or vice versa. You're the CEO. It's literally your job to know these things.On the one hand, given Carbonite's balance sheet and the fact, at $14 million, that this wasn't a ""transformative"" deal from a financial standpoint (though it's hoped to be from a product/go-to-market standpoint), you can argue that it's not so financially significant as to be a big deal either way. On the other hand, I am viewing this more through the lens of process than outcome - whether or not the deal ends up working out, it does not sound to me like the company did enough diligence here.Ali is no dilettante when it comes to corporate management - he was formerly the Chief Strategy Officer at HP and a senior executive at many other organizations including IBM (NYSE:IBM) - and it's frankly inexcusable to do a deal and try to figure out what you've bought after the check has already cleared. My concern is that he may have brought the HP/IBM M&A mentality along with him - i.e. who cares how much we spend, let's just go buy ourselves growth. That's all well and fine when you have functionally limitless discretionary cash flow to throw around, but with substantially more limited resources and a more precarious competitive position, Carbonite requires a much more judicious approach to capital allocation.I would also point out that Seagate sold the business for basically nothing, continuing the trend of purchasing somewhat flamed-out businesses. (Zmanda, which forms a lot of the basis for Carbonite's server product, clearly wasn't a hit for its VCs either.) Chris Mellor of The Register wrote a great timeline - while you should hit the link and review it in full, basically Seagate futzed around with the business for a decade and then sold it for less than a tenth of what they bought it for. Given that it did ~$50MM or so in bookings (guidance for $40 to $45 million excludes a few months of European revenues) at mid-60s gross margins (per both Seagate and CARB management), Carbonite paid less than a third of bookings and half of gross profit. If the company is able to extract meaningful synergies from data-center consolidation (a questionable proposition, in my view), you can certainly model a scenario where deal consideration was an absurdly low-to-mid single-digit multiple of post-synergies EBITDA.A transaction at this sort of price would not have occurred if EVault was knocking it out of the park. This isn't to say that EVault is a bad asset in the right hands, but in my experience, putting two somewhat challenged businesses together usually does not magically solve the problems of either one.I See Valuation Upside, But Not Enough To Be CompellingThe current stock price around $8 values the company at an enterprise value of around $165 million. (The difference between my number and the one you may see quoted in your preferred data provider is that I'm adjusting the balance sheet for cash outflow relating to the closing of the EVault deal.) That certainly doesn't put a high multiple on the company - less than 1x forward revenues, or less than ~2x the value of the SMB segment. If you assume that CARB can grow the SMB segment at 20% or higher over time, then it's certainly not hard to justify putting a >2x revenue multiple on that segment of the business and more or less ignoring consumer. I've read various bullish angles that take this approach.As a cautionary note, I would point out that the revenue multiple of Barracuda (one often-mentioned comp) has compressed pretty significantly, taking away some of the juicy upside opportunity, at least in the near term - particularly since Barracuda is executing a lot better than CARB.The problem, for me, is that Carbonite just isn't very profitable. Free cash flow is inflated by stock-based compensation that is very generous even if you exclude the impact of the CEO hire. Even on a non-GAAP basis, the high end of 2016 EPS guidance is merely 15 cents. Given that the SMB business is not going to organically grow at 30% this year per guidance, I also am not willing to give management credit for effective return on customer acquisition cost.Finally, I would point out that the real value in the backup market appears to be in the ""M"" rather than ""S"" part of SMB, and in the server rather than endpoint segment of the backup market. To supplement my earlier discussion, two different organizations I worked for in the 50-100 employee size range, for example, used Google Apps for all internal documents with limited (if any) meaningful data to back up on employee devices, and the same goes for the fund I used to work for. The larger organizations would have no use for endpoint solutions, but would have use for server backup.With that assessment, as well as Carbonite management's own acknowledgment that they basically weren't very competitive in that space prior to the EVault acquisition, it's hard to assign them a big multiple. Their SMB business has, more or less, been patched together via various acquisitions of not-particularly-spectacular companies over the years, and I don't see any indications that they've been improved so much as to now be worth premium multiples (as opposed to the fairly low multiples they were sold for).In particular, it's hard for me to mark EVault (nearly half of the SMB line) up to a high multiple of revenues when it was literally just sold for 0.3x - if the hoped-for synergies and growth materialize, that's one thing, but it's way too early to tell.Combine that with the fact that one year in, I simply don't like the CEO or have much confidence in his ability to manage this business, and it's hard for me to call Carbonite compelling (although it is cheap.) I do think there is plenty of upside opportunity for shareholders here if management executes - if they could post teens GAAP EBITDA margins, and continue to consistently grow the top line at a high single or low double-digit rate despite the drag from consumer, then I could justify a price around $11 or $12 (good for 40-50% upside from the current stock price).Setting aside the margin issues, this would require growing the SMB business at 20%+ every year while keeping Consumer segment declines to high-single digits at most. I don't personally have enough confidence in either Carbonite's product or its management to view that upside potential as likely to be achieved, but other investors with a more favorable view will likely see value here. Having watched other similar situations play out, I'm also cautious about the assumption on Consumer - often, it seems like there's a ""tipping point"" and the rate of decline ends up being higher than anyone initially expected.Finally, I suppose a takeover is still a possibility, although this also seems unlikely. The company has rebuffed multiple takeover offers at much higher prices and I don't think the third time will be the charm.Wrapping It UpCarbonite has interesting potential, and you certainly don't have to use aggressive assumptions to justify a price higher than $8, but the market is tough, the consumer business may decline even more rapidly than expected, and execution is necessary to succeed. If Carbonite achieves the hoped-for synergies with its EVault business and demonstrates clear traction in the server backup market for medium-sized enterprises, I would view shares a lot more constructively. Until then, though, I'm on the sidelines despite the valuation.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

Double-Take had originally been taken private for $242 million in 2010, so Carbonite paid a fraction of that price for the deal.Carbonite funded $20.55 million of the cash portion of the deal via cash on hand. As of September 30, 2016, the company had $49.1 million cash and cash equivalents (Unaudited). The remaining cash portion was funded via $39.2 million through a revolving credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank.Concurrently with the transaction announcement, the company announced updated guidance for 4Q and FY 2016 financial results with GAAP revenues for 4Q 2016 expected to be in a range of $53M to $53.5M vs. previous guidance of $46.6M to $51.6M.Carbonite provided five rationales for the acquisition:The acquisition will enhance Carbonite's offerings by providing real-time replication and disaster recovery capabilities to the SMB (small and midsized business) market. In the current online environment, SMBs need these capabilities that can provide real-time access, rather than hours or days.Double-Take's software accomplishes this for Windows and Linux SMB users, so adds to Carbonite's existing market penetration with individuals and small businesses. The seller, Vision Solutions, sold Double-Take because it wants to more tightly focus its operations on data protection, high availability and IT automation software functions.In Carbonite's acquisition presentation (PDF), management highlighted the addition of 6,000 customers and 500 partners that Double-Take will bring. In addition, Double-Take may add a midpoint of $25 million in 2017 bookings to Carbonite's current revenue run rate of $206 million. (Non-GAAP)Carbonite's existing focus is on the small and mid-market segments, and Double-Take will afford it opportunities to cross-sell its EVault service to Double-Take's mid-market and larger customer base. In sum, the deal is promising to Carbonite as it appears it paid about 2.6x forward revenues for a complementary business into which it can cross-sell.It will take 12 months of technology integration and sales team ramp-up to know whether it was a good move, but I am optimistic that a re-energized Carbonite will be able to capitalize on a low-price acquisition that expands its available market and offerings.I write about IPOs, M&A, follow-ons and secondaries.

3291585,63483,2015-06-29T15:38:17-04:00,"Cloud/hybrid backup solution provider.In the process of achieving scale and establishing competitive advantages.Large under-penetrated market, a word on differentiation.Unprofitability should not be the focus at the moment.Despite healthy top-line growth, valuation remains unjustified.","Landscape of data protectionGiven the literal explosion in the amount of data available (IDC estimates the amount to increase approximately ten-fold from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes over the 2013 to 2020 period), it is not unreasonable to suggest that data is largely the lifeblood of any business. Following that line of thought, it is not hard to imagine what would happen to a business that loses access to its data. Data protection is paramount.Traditionally, businesses of all sizes store their data on-site. They utilize hard disk drives, CDs, flash memory drives, inter alia, to achieve this objective. However, these methods present several problems. They are:Enter CarboniteCarbonite (NASDAQ:CARB) offers a solution. The company is a cloud/hybrid backup provider. Cloud/hybrid data protection solutions are on-demand solutions, hence capacity and scaling is a non-issue. They also are highly secure and not prone to failure. Most notably, thanks to the cloud delivery model, the data stored on these solutions are accessible anytime and anywhere on a mobile device (smartphone, laptops, etc). Given the narrative detailed in prior paragraphs, the astute reader would have quickly realized that CARB's solutions add tremendous value to businesses of all sizes. The picture below provides more detail on the firm's offerings.Source: Carbonite Q1 FY15 Earnings PresentationThe company's revenue model is relatively easy to understand. The firm books revenue through a subscription-based model (subscription periods can range from annual to multi-year). Fees are paid annually.In the process of achieving scale and establishing competitive advantagesThe clever reader reading the above narrative would have deduced that the main sources of competitive advantages with such a business model stem from scale and switching costs.A new entrant looking to enter the space would need to spend tens of millions developing a competitive offering (building out the infrastructure, acquiring data centers, etc.). Additionally, given that cloud/hybrid data protection solutions are largely commodities with little differentiation, the challenger would have an extremely difficult time convincing customers to switch from incumbent offerings. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that switching to an alternate provider would likely involve meaningful operational disruption.Hence, sales/marketing spend would likely be orders of magnitude greater than R&D spend, depending on how late the new entrant enters the space. Even if a new entrant spends hundreds of millions on sales/marketing, it may be largely futile.Once incumbents have solidified their market position, it becomes nigh impossible for new entrants to compete - without a large installed base of subscribers, significant economies of scale cannot be realized. Challengers would operate at a massive loss until they lose access to funding and go out of business.In the case of Carbonite, the company has yet to cement the above competitive advantages (scale/switching costs). However, it is well-positioned to do just that.In a nutshell, we have a business that:Not my cup of tea, but with the potential to be. Frequent readers of my work would be familiar with the type of companies that I like to allocate my capital to. Such companies tend to possess a highly-durable economic moat and generate predictable annuity-like cash flows. The majority of businesses (including Carbonite) that I cover do not pass the first test and barely pass the second. Having said that, due to my long-term horizon I'm comfortable playing the long game.Large under-penetrated market, a word on differentiationCARB has grown at a decent clip in recent years.Source: Carbonite Q1 FY15 Earnings PresentationHowever, the market that it serves (primarily SMBs) remains under-penetrated, as seen above. Considering the fact that the company clearly offers very relevant solutions to its customers, it is not a stretch to assume that CARB is poised to exploit the growth of this market.However, competition in the space remains intense. The company has yet to differentiate itself meaningfully from its competitors. Rivals have made progress in this area. As an example, Box (NYSE:BOX) has secured a partnership with IBM (NYSE:IBM) and acquired access to Watson Analytics, among other things. CARB needs to secure similar partnerships as well to ""de-commoditize"" its offerings. If it does not, growing or even maintaining its installed base would prove to be very difficult over time.Unprofitability should not be the focus at the momentI posit that making a GAAP profit should not be the focus at the moment. If one considers the fact that the market for cloud backup/storage/protection is relatively young and growing fast, it is prudent for players to focus on acquiring market share. This is exactly Carbonite's playbook. Sales/marketing spend remains the largest expense component, as it should be.Given its top-line growth in the past years, it is reasonable to conclude that ramping up sales/marketing has achieved the desired result. This also is the primary reason why CARB has been unprofitable. Once sales/marketing spend does not result in corresponding increases in the top-line, management should be able to dial back spending in this area and turn cash flow-positive.Despite healthy top-line growth, valuation remains unjustifiedCARB currently trades at 75x FY14 EBITDA (per Morningstar data). Companies that trade within this range tend to be growing at triple-digit growth rates. CARB is not one of them. Furthermore, growth is likely to slow down given the fact that rival offerings (like Box's) appear to be far more compelling compared to CARB due to their differentiation. As a result, I posit that it is unlikely that the company would be able to grow at the rates required in order to sustain its current valuation. Thus, I recommend investors to avoid CARB until better prospects emerge."
4240022,25120,2019-02-11T19:25:15-05:00,"Carbonite is acquiring Webroot in a $618 million deal.Investors are acting very cautious about the deal despite projected strategic and financial synergies.Investors are fearful about high leverage in combination with disappointing growth and rapid changes impacting the industry.Consequently, Carbonite remains a very easy avoid for me here despite the dip in the share price.","Carbonite (CARB) made a huge move in expanding the business to become a leading data protection business as it acquired Webroot in a $618 million deal. This transaction, which was announced at the same time as the release of the full-year results, were not welcomed by investors.The reason for that probably involves the massive leverage taken on with the deal as the combination sees just very modest organic growth in 2019, growth rates which are anything but impressive. High leverage, very ""adjusted"" earnings and rapid industry changes threatening to make part of the business obsolete all make Carbonite a very easy avoid for me.Carbonite has reached a deal with Webroot to acquire the latter for $618.5 million in cash. With the deal, Carbonite will have a comprehensive approach to protection through cloud-based security solutions. The company does so by adding the so-called ""endpoint"" with cloud-based backup and recovery options.Founded in 1997, Webroot has rapidly grown to become an important player in the cybersecurity space with its strengths in security of endpoints, network protection, security awareness training and threat intelligence services. The company generated $215 million in revenues from these services for its fiscal year of 2018, ending in the summer of that year. These sales are generated by a team of over 600 employees, with the business catering both to businesses and consumers.The endpoint solutions of Webroot and data protection services of Carbonite create an integrated approach and solution which the companies believe will make them a stronger force in the marketplace. The multiples look pretty reasonable, certainly as Webroot reports operating margins of 19%, suggesting operating earnings of $41 million, while sales growth came in at 14% last year.On top of reasonable multiple, the icing on the cake has to be anticipated cost synergies, seen at $20 million in the coming three years, while revenue synergies are seen at $50 million in the coming five years.Alongside the announcement of the deal, Carbonite announced its 2018 results. Sales grew by 24% to $296 million. The company reported GAAP net earnings of $7.5 million, or $0.22 per share, on these sales. This tiny profit is misleading for two reasons.For starters were earnings inflated by a tax refund, but on the other hand, earnings were depressed because of non-cash amortisation charges, among other factors. On a non-GAAP basis earnings came in at $1.66 per share, or $56 million in actual dollar terms, and this earnings number is misleading as well.The company took some adjustments which are quite aggressive, including nearly $18 million in stock-based compensation expenses (which is a real expense for shareholders) and $6 million in non-cash accrual on convertible bonds. Adjusting for these, while leaving many other adjustments intact, I peg normalised earnings power at some $35 million, or about a dollar per share.Operating with a diluted share count of 36 million shares and shares trading at $29 ahead of the deal announcement, Carbonite supported a market valuation of $1.04 billion ahead of the deal. Operating with $80 million in net cash, this valuation falls to $960 million, or about 3.2 times sales, more or less in line with the 2.9 times sales multiple paid for Webroot.Carbonite reported adjusted EBITDA of $77 million for the year, for margins equal to 26% of sales. With margins of Webroot being a bit lower, estimated at 20-25%, I peg the EBITDA of that business at $43-53 million. That makes for a combined adjusted EBITDA number of $120-130 million.The company itself reported a net leverage ratio of 4.3 times after incorporating the deal, although some confusion has arisen. Based on a $615 million purchase price and $80 million net cash position of Carbonite ahead of the deal, I end up with $535 million in net debt, for a 4.3 times leverage ratio based on $125 million in pro forma adjusted EBITDA.The company itself said on the conference call that net debt would be seen around $600 million. With a similar leverage ratio, as the company reported a 4.3 times leverage ratio, this calculation is based on roughly $140 million in adjusted EBITDA, suggesting that the guidance indeed includes some real costs synergies.The 36 million shares of Carbonite plunged 19% in response to the deal announcement and the release of the annual results. This $5.5 decline in the share price works down to $200 million, equivalent to a third of the deal value. Not only is the company paying a similar sales multiple for a business with slightly slower growth, Webroot is reporting lower margins as well. Furthermore, the 2019 guidance is perhaps not too comforting either.GAAP revenues for 2019 are seen at $468-482 million, or $475 million at the midpoint of the guidance. Working with $296 million in reported sales for Carbonite and $215 million for Webroot, I end up with a combined number of $457 million on a pro forma basis (assuming a 9-month sales contribution from Webroot). That suggests very modest sales growth this year.Adjusted EBITDA is seen at $129-134 million, after accounting for some growth and some realisation of synergies, yet these numbers are so adjusted that it is very hard to estimate what real earnings power can look like. After all, GAAP earnings amount to just $0.22 per share, as adjusted earnings of $1.60 are too high. Based on the midpoint of roughly a dollar per share, valuation multiples remain elevated at $24 per share, although realisation of synergies could really drive value in the long run.Carbonite is an easy avoid for me, although reasonable sales multiples (given the activity of the business and multiples at which peers trade) look relatively low. The reality is that Carbonite has taken on a lot of leverage with this deal, as the guidance for 2019 suggests very little ""organic"" revenue growth, sales growth in recent years is driven by M&A, and the products seem old-fashioned in a rapidly moving competitive environment. Rapid changes in the industry make it more challenging, so the business could be obsolete pretty quick, as the company is competing against the world's largest and most renowned technology players.Furthermore, companies operating in a rapidly moving industry are best served by relatively stable environment, as continued M&A and restructuring instead of team building and R&D could be very disruptive.Thus, I continue to watch the story with interest but by no means am inclined to buy into the dip just yet, as this is a ""complicated"" story. Deleveraging, improving (GAAP) earnings and lack of other adjustments could drive appeal, but this requires real execution - something which I doubt at this point in time."

It just opened a spiffy new headquarters in downtown Boston. It replaced co-founder David Friend as CEO with the former chief strategy officer for Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) CEO Meg Whitman named Mohamed Ali. (He said on taking over, after the J2 offer was announced, that Carbonite had the potential to be a ""huge company."") Finally, and perhaps most definitively, Carbonite bought a small e-mail archiving company called MailStore this week for $20 million.J2 could have been a decent fit. The company is nearly five times the size of Carbonite, and has something Carbonite has always lacked - profits. J2 has also not given up on its quest, calling Ali ""well-suited to oversee a sale to us"" and noting J2 already has a significant stake in Carbonite, adding ""the time to deliver value to J2 and our fellow Carbonite shareholders is past due.""J2 calls itself a ""cloud services"" company, but it's easier to understand as a roll-up of older communications services into data centers. It is best known for services such as eFax, which as the name implies does faxing via computers, and eVoice, an automated phone system also running through computers. Taking out Carbonite would help J2 go ""up the stack"" toward more truly computer-driven services.While J2 is profitable, it could use the profit boost of Carbonite's online backup tied to its systems and ability to market. While J2 was able to bring nearly one-third of its revenue to the net income line in 2012, it was bringing just one-fifth of its income to that line in 2013, and the margin for the most recent quarter was 21%. Carbonite, on the other hand, has never made an annual profit, but it has been getting closer, losing just $0.48 per share in the three months ending in September, while growing revenues 27% from the previous year.In its early days, Carbonite was a fixture on TV, selling directly to consumers, but more recently it has focused on selling its back-up services to small- and medium-sized businesses. It has no debt, and operating cash flow has been positive for three years.J2 has the asset base with which to increase its offer. It currently has a market cap of $2.84 billion. But it's hard to see a former chief strategist like Ali taking such a quick buyout. Plus, Mailstore is a German company that would not fit well with what J2 is doing. On its own, Carbonite is selling at four times sales, which would not be a bad price except for the lack of profit. It has an average rating of ""hold"" by the nine analysts following it so if you buy here and don't get a buyout you could quickly lose about $4/share.Do you think Ali will be the greatest CEO? Do you think a bigger offer is coming from J2 or elsewhere, an offer he will find impossible to refuse? If you do, buy."

4099349,69545,2017-08-16T08:36:58-04:00,The future of cloud computing belongs to Amazon and Microsoft rather than Carbonite and Cloudera.Carbonite's commoditized product is neither the cheapest nor the most capable offering on the market.No bull catalysts in sight. Insiders are selling.Valuation model suggests downside south of 40%.,"Carbonite’s (CARB) products are obsolete and commoditized. The company lacks operational and intellectual leverage against the bigger and more flexible competitors. The secular decline is masked behind a series of acquisitions and shady financial disclosure. Carbonite is forced to operate in a segment the big players don’t find attractive. Still, it is a matter of time until Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the likes decide it is time to take ownership of the niche Carbonite is claiming to specialize in.Following the wearables fiasco, the market desperately needed a new theme, a new Holy Grail. It didn’t take investors awhile to figure out the data storage is actually what society needs most. Out of the sudden, the cloud services were proclaimed the next big thing; data scientist was the sexiest job of the 21st century. The hype was on. The IPO pipeline changed. Typical for this part of the business cycle biotech and financial listings were replaced by descriptions like “<put corporate name> empowers organizations to become data­-driven enterprises in the newly hyper connected world”. Successful flotations justified the multi-billion price tags of companies that have consistently burned cash, spurring optimism across the industry. Long struggling incumbents are now looked with less scrutiny.So far, so good. Blue chips like Microsoft and IBM are deriving a substantial portion of their growth from the cloud, while small players are trying to find their sweet spot to excel. Despite the strong industry growth, only handful companies are making a buck, but who cares about profits in the Amazon/Tesla economy? The market is forward looking and so should we.Starting with the hardware, the data centers are undergoing a rapid transformation. Copper is giving a way to fiber optics; 3D NAND is replacing the old-fashioned hard drives – both accelerating the rate of data transfer. GPUs are reportedly better at data crunching compared to the traditional CPUs. The competition for best physical infrastructure is so severe, FANG is designing proprietary hardware in an attempt to inch ahead of the competition. And it is not just this node the supply chain in insulation – from semiconductor equipment manufacturers to hardware designers and contractors, all participants are adding capacity in an effort to monetize the trend.While the apparent supply/demand imbalance is accretive to producers’ margins right now, the million-dollar question is how long will this sustain. The short answer is until Amazon and co. stop adding five times the capacity they need or upstream manufacturers level up their output. In either case, the price per unit of operational capacity will decrease over time, albeit at a different pace.Given the commoditization of the cloud services and natural deflationary pressure on the initial investment required, in the long run, industry’s entry barrier will stay low, bounding profitability from above. Differentiation will only be possible on customer support and customization level – both features likely to be automated in the near future. The interchangeability of services combined with already saturated marketplace suggest price-sensitive customers and predispose price wars. Hence, despite the rapid growth in demand, the cloud industry will most likely operate near its cost of capital for prolonged period of time. Unless being a market leader, the first mover advantage shouldn’t exist as customer base lacks loyalty and faces low transition costs; service fees must be the prime determinant of their choice. Therefore, companies able to utilize several products on a single infrastructure and/or one reached a critical scale should have a district advantage. Moreover, brute force will also be a factor. The higher the absolute budget, the better. The more money one has, the easier to attract talent and customers.It should be clear by now the future belongs to Amazon and Microsoft rather than Carbonite and Cloudera. A logical question would be, how the latter still exist (and even enjoying valuation metrics comparable to the first)? By focusing on areas the big boys don’t find attractive. Yes. In the newly established and fast growing market of cloud computing, the blue chips are prioritizing the low hanging fruits. Gaining Bank of America as a client in opposite to the accounting firm down the road is most likely preferable. Microsoft will be trying to expand and defend its market share in key segments rather than cover every inch the industry touches. In such dynamics, companies like Carbonite will thrive in their niche segments up until Microsoft’s growth rate start losing steam. At this point, the smaller player should either have a really clever value proposition (and eventually be taken over by the blue chips) or be able to compete on pricing. Otherwise, they better make tones of money now.What is the essence of company’s offering? In my opinion, the best way to get a grip with such software is to watch a demo, similar to the one that made Dropbox what currently is. While Carbonite’s YouTube channel is full of hour-long technical presentations, up-to-date service description is absent. The closest one can get is a year-old third party material, giving a sense of the user interface and product’s capabilities.In short, Carbonite’s service takes your files and clone them on a presumably safer location, so when the villains come and seize your system, you can easily restore them and get back to business. Sounds awesome! Are there other alternatives? First, you have this bad boy:It is a one-time payment; faster to transfer data and accessible offline. On top, most manufacturers offer cloud and recovery services themselves as a compliment to their devices. Most of you would argue the external hard drivers are less secure and unable to simultaneously handle the needs of several users or an enterprise. It is not a 21st century solution.Right, are there identical substitutions? Quite a lot, actually. Starting with OneDrive, Google Drive and Dropbox to move to more customized and closer comparables including Box, Backblaze, CrashPlan, SOS, Acronis, Barracuda, Datto, Mozy (Dell's subsidiary)… The list goes on. There is a nice comparison page on Wikipedia covering over 50 online backup services. While some hardly substitute to what Carbonite offers, the list is by no means complete.A quick comparison between prices and features across the board lead us to conclude Carbonite is neither the cheapest nor most capable option on the market (direct comparison is impossible due to various twists different services have; yet, Carbonite is among the most expensive, lightest on resources and lacking any distinctive moat). Opposing the industry standards, Carbonite does not have a free version, does not run on Linux and is reportedly not having a continuous customer support as advertised. Lately, the default storage of all packages has been cut down to 250-500GB from unlimited cloud space, making the offering even less attractive when compared to alternatives. On the flip side, Carbonite is called intuitive and easy to use. It is meant to be a set-and-forget solution for less demanding users. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter how sophisticated a software is as long as customers love it. Simplicity is beautiful! Think of Google.I have spent quite some time reading Carbonite’s reviews, and frankly, there wasn’t a single elaborated comment why their product is superior to competitors or a happy customer expressing satisfaction with their choice (except a comment on Facebook, asking to participate in a referral program). I understand people are more willing to comment when upset with the service and that online backup is a sensitive matter, but the number and variety of complaints about Carbonite are alarming. Issues range from slow speed (suggesting out-of-date infrastructure/code, empirically backed) to technical glitches and lack of functionality to complete failure of the service paid for.All odds seem stacked against Carbonite. You must be wondering how the business has been performing recently. Exceptionally well, according to management and (surprisingly) the capital markets. Revenues are growing double-digit year-over-year; share price has tripled since 2016 lows. Earnings are negative, but it is Amazon’s playground at the end of the day. The management is doing a fantastic job, particularly in presenting Carbonite’s financial results.The reality is slightly different, though. Carbonite’s organic growth is non-existent; loss of lucrative business is presented as a strategic shift towards better customer mix. Deluded by ever increasing accounting figures and broad industry euphoria, the market is caught off guard.Over the past several years, Carbonite engaged in a number of vertical acquisitions. As a prime reason, management gives additional product functionality (plus cross selling opportunities) and improved positions in targeted segments (small and medium-size business clients). Fair enough. What I find interesting, though, is company’s reluctance to provide a breakdown of its organic and acquired results:Source: Carbonite’s 2016 10-kInterpolating the revenues for the 4th quarter and the 2016 growth suddenly drops from the breath-taking 66% to bare 5.6%. Company’s behaviour repeats with Double-Take. This time absolutely no disclosure is made: Source: Carbonite’s 2017 Q2 10-qUsing the previous computation and guidance as of the deal’s announcement, we can argue Carbonite’s organic growth has just turned negative. If these facts are still not convincing enough, you can get the same message straight from the horse's mouth. Browsing through Carbonite’s Glassdoor reviews, two recurring themes are resonating: remuneration packages are quite generous and there is no such thing as organic growth over there.Another recent disclosure-related development is company’s decision to merge the reporting of individual and small- and medium-size business clients into a single account. Following a year of negative growth and pessimistic outlook in the individual clients’ business, Carbonite decided to back up in favour of the SMBs. Shareholders are told it is the more profitable segment. The reality, once again, is slightly different. First, Carbonite is not voluntarily leaving the battleground, but violently pushed away from industry’s rising stars. The SMBs is most likely the segment with highest customer acquisition cost as a percent of revenues generated. Hence, SMBs are flying under big players’ radar as there are plenty of better opportunities to seize. Once these markets get absorbed, however, SMBs time will come.A fact worth mentioning is the company's heavy reliance on radio and printed advertisement. A good portion of the clients on the Internet say they have come across Carbonite after hearing about the product on the radio. It is not stupid if it works, but picking up my cloud services from the local newspaper sounds a little bit extravagant to me. In traditional metrics terms, Google Trends is dead flat; the same is reaffirmed from the corporate website’s traffic figures.By now, it should be clear the risk/return is skewed towards the bearish case. Is the timing good? According to the top executives, it is just right:While there isn’t anything extraordinary (insider selling is routine for Carbonite), the latest round of corporate selling is at higher volume and absolute price. It is not necessarily a tell, but nor is contradicting the thesis.Aside from the banal potential for being taken over or successful integration of the newly acquired businesses, I am struggling to find any particular company-specific catalysts that could turn the thesis around. Hence, all risks are industry-wide and could be hedged if the market neutral strategy is implemented. Here are a few suggestions:If you are a bull and I am missing something, I urge you to share your thoughts in the comment section below.The company’s accounting looks really messy. Research and development costs include hosting fees, consulting fees, rent, and depreciation; 15-20% of the general and administrative costs are executives’ remuneration packages. The point made is, it is challenging to model the income statement. Despite this, I give it my best try:In my base-case scenario, I assume the company will actually benefit from economies of scale (gross margin up, G&A/R&D down). As the space becomes more and more saturated, customer acquisition will get even more expensive, justifying high S&M costs.A good indicator of an assumptions reasonability is the operating margin. As I said, industry’s profitability is bounded from above, so 9% long-term EBIT margin is actually optimistic.Plugging the figures into a standard DCF model and we get more than 44% upside potential:Putting in a little bit more aggressive assumptions and the fair value could easily dive below $10. As usual, the full model will be available to Seeking Alpha’s Pro subscribers."

Higher margin SMBs are 30% of total bookings and 50% of new bookings—and expected to grow 30%+.Received a large and growing activist investment from Discovery Group, one of the most effective activist investors that has helped push over 50% of its 53 targets toward an acquisition.Valuable brand (tested by my own survey) will enable Carbonite to continue to gain share in a crowded SMB market that is ripe for consolidation.Attractive financial profile, with solid revenue growth, a clean balance sheet and both EBITDA and FCF positive—all achieved while transitioning the business, which is largely complete.Carbonite has all the characteristics of a prime acquisition candidate and with a discounted valuation relative to comparables and highly relevant precedent transactions; valuation upside of 40-50% is projected.","History LessonCarbonite (NASDAQ:CARB) was founded in 2005 to provide cloud backup solutions with anytime, anywhere access to files stored on its servers. The Company cut its teeth in the consumer market, and with its low-cost solution quickly attracting subscribers, Carbonite's revenue exploded, growing at a CAGR of 253% from 2006 to its IPO in 2011(1). Carbonite IPO'd at $10.00/share and since the first week of trading, investors have never seen a price higher than $16.50/share and shares have been as low as $5.75(2). When the price dipped in the summer of 2012, j2 Global (NASDAQ:JCOM) came in with an acquisition offer at $10.50/share (filing), which at the time represented a 38% premium to the day prior closing price. Carbonite subsequently turned down the offer, citing that it significantly undervalued the prospects of the business. Nonetheless, j2 Global still owns 9.5% of the Company as of this writing(3).Perhaps Carbonite went public too early. Though it had strong revenue momentum, the Company really only had one product and the consumer market was quickly commoditized by the competition. Nowadays companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) essentially give away consumer backup solutions for free. Growth rates slowed and margins were squeezed. A relatively ""slower growing"" company believed to be in a crumbling industry can be a real drag on a stock price, SaaS company or not.VCs and Founders did not sell any shares in the IPO and still owned more than 50% of the Company after the offering. The main VCs (CrossLink Capital and Menlo Ventures) further increased their positions after the IPO, buying a combined $20M+ through private and open market transactions. Without the desired surge in share price that would have led to a follow-on offering (allowing the larger shareholders to monetize their respective holdings), this group has been forced to sell massive stakes on the open market-which has hurt long-term share price performance. CrossLink Capital, Menlo Ventures and the Founders still own ~30% of the Company(3). As 9 years have passed since Carbonite was founded and 7 years since it received its first major venture round, large and influential shareholders are likely beyond eager to finally get liquidity and return their fund or move on to their next endeavor.In fact, Co-Founder Jeff Flowers left Carbonite in 2012 to launch a startup and the other Co-Founder David Friend announced in Feb. 2014 that he will be stepping down as President & CEO once his successor is hired.Business Model Transition: From Consumers to SMBsCarbonite has a very strong brand, though investors and individuals associate that brand with the commoditized consumer storage backup market. However, most investors aren't aware that when you dig a little deeper, Carbonite has pivoted from its consumer roots and is now solely focused on backup/recovery storage solutions for SMBs. Through years of R&D and a shrewd acquisition of Zmanda, Carbonite's solutions have expanded to include server backup for files, databases and live applications and a hybrid appliance that offers both local and cloud storage.A couple years ago, Carbonite learned a lot of its customers were actually small businesses and that all the metrics in the SMB space crushed consumer metrics. Low margins and a ""double your advertising spend, double your revenue"" model has made the consumer business too costly to chase. Carbonite also had an underutilized channel and was dependent on direct sales. In an effort to better scale the SMB business, direct sales will be shut down within the year and 100% of Carbonite's products will be sold through the rapidly expanding channel.Carbonite has bulked up its management team and Board with channel experts and introduced a new channel-centric partnership program in July 2014. The Company continues to build on its current network of ~5,000 resellers (e.g., CDW, Synnex, D&H Distributing) and its hybrid appliance solution was just released as the first channel-exclusive product.Carbonite is already seeing impressive results as SMB bookings grew 70% on an annual basis in 2013 and 40% YoY in Q2'14 and now make up 30% of total bookings and 50% of new bookings(1,4). The Company will still support the consumer business, but will not be investing in its growth. The advertising budget previously dedicated to growing the consumer side has been reallocated to R&D and marketing for SMB products. Also, with the significant geographic reach afforded by the channel, Carbonite has a massive opportunity to expand its international sales, which made up only 6% of revenue in 2013(1).The typical trajectory for fast-growing software companies is a period of massive growth followed by a period of more moderate growth while figuring out how to actually turn a profit. As Carbonite's initial target market became too costly to chase, growth decelerated and the Company was still unable to turn a profit. The business model transition further slowed overall growth and pushed out the profitability timeline-and impatient investors put their money elsewhere.Most business model transitions are best to be left out of the public eye, but Carbonite has managed to successfully pivot and has even turned EBITDA and free-cash-flow positive while doing so - and its lowest YoY quarterly growth rate has been 15%(1). Given the SMB momentum and the impressive financial profile, it's clear Carbonite has so far admirably endured the transition.If Carbonite is acquired, the buyer would integrate a business that has already done the heavy transition lifting. Also, the buyer would likely have significantly more scale and resources, such as a larger channel to pump Carbonite products through its network, and could better seize the market opportunity than the small-cap company could as a standalone business. Given that Carbonite currently trades higher than the j2 Global offer and that any acquirer would have to pay a healthy control premium, this had to be what management had in mind when it cited the bright prospects of the business.SMB Market Dynamics: Overcrowded Market in the Early Innings of ConsolidationAs Carbonite further penetrates the SMB space, it is bumping up against some new competitors and seeing familiar foes making the same transition. Through speaking with market experts and company insiders, I believe I have mapped out the most relevant names in the table below. As you can see, Carbonite faces significant competition in a crowded market of at least 20 formidable names. The SMB market is estimated to grow at a 20%+ CAGR to ~$650M in 2016, which is not a huge pie that can be cut this many ways, and I expect inevitable consolidation as all these players jockey for market share.There is no major technological differentiation amongst the companies and most offer similar solutions and features at similar prices. The solutions offered by Carbonite are certainly not unique, and compared to other market entrants, it is a little late to the SMB party. However, the one major differentiator in this market is brand equity, where Carbonite shines, and it helps make its late entrance irrelevant. Carbonite's strong brand should drive market share gains and help it stand out amongst the crowd.Thus far, the acquisitions appear to be on the smaller side or occurred years ago, but given the current dynamics, I expect many more in the coming years. The potential acquirers are not limited to the players with scale on this list. A perfect example is j2 Global's clear interest in Carbonite, further legitimized by j2's acquisition of cloud storage provider Livedrive in Feb. 2014 for an undisclosed amount.As is often the case with niche technology markets, the elephant in the room is the threat of a much larger player (GOOG, FB, AMZN, MSFT, etc.) entering the space and flexing their ability to withstand a race to the bottom. The most obvious candidate to potentially enter the market is storage powerhouse Amazon. Jeff Bezos is famous for saying ""your margin is my opportunity."" Most all of the players listed above run their own cloud, but Amazon is the expert and more could shift to S3 as the price of storage continues to drop. Amazon does not currently participate in this market but could easily offer a competitive solution (proprietary or through a third-party) and the fear of what Amazon could do may ultimately drive M&A.Is the Carbonite Brand Really that Strong?Without taking everyone's word for it, I created a survey to test Carbonite's brand and the viability of its products vs. its competitors. I hit the streets, hassling people at coffee shops and bars and also utilized SurveyMonkey to compile hundreds of results. Aside from running into a few Star Wars nerds asking if they could freeze me in carbonite, it was an insightful experience.To test the brand equity of the nine primary SMB competitors (including Carbonite), I had random individuals rank their familiarity from 1 (never heard of) to 7 (extremely familiar). Carbonite finished head and shoulders above the competition, grading out with a 3.1. Barracuda Networks was second place with a 1.5 and Mozy was a close third with 1.4. Other than EVault, no respondent had ever heard of the remaining competitors (Code 42, Axcient, Unitrends, Datto and Acronis). Bear in mind, I never expected any of these names to grade out at the higher end of the scale - Carbonite is a small-cap company with limited resources and most of these companies are private or embedded in a much larger organization.More than 60% of respondents found brand name moderately to extremely important when making their decision on which provider to select. And once the respondents selected their provider, 99% retain that same provider. Most respondents use Dropbox or Google Drive for their personal backup/recovery solutions, with a few using Carbonite - and very few actually paying for a solution. Note that no other SMB competitors were used by any of the respondents. Interestingly, out of all the individuals that knew Carbonite, exactly one was aware of the business model transition and selected SMBs as Carbonite's target market, as most all selected consumers as the target.I understand the survey I conducted is in no way perfect, but the small sample size does demonstrate that Carbonite has built a strong brand that it can leverage as it further penetrates the SMB space through its channel. The survey confirms Carbonite's decision to move away from the consumer space, as free solutions have overtaken the market, and also provides strong evidence of a sticky customer base once a provider is selected - good news for Carbonite as over 1.5 million customers still subscribe to the consumer backup/recovery solution and subscription proceeds will now serve as a cash cow for SMB business investment.Activist Investor AttentionDiscovery Group filed a 13D on 02/07/14 and has continued to purchase more Carbonite shares, which led to an amended filing on 02/28/14 and a further increase seen in its latest 13F filing as of 06/30/14. Discovery Group currently owns 8.1% of Carbonite's outstanding shares(3) and its $21.6M+ investment has a cost basis of $11.11(5) (above CARB's price per share of $10.83 as of 09/19/14).While you can debate the effectiveness of some activists, Discovery Group has an excellent and exhaustive record. Since 2005, Discovery Group has filed 13Ds for investments in 53 companies. Further, Discovery has a knack for finding companies that are soon to be acquired and has never shied away from publicly expressing that a target should pursue a sale, leading to acquisitions in over 50% of its targeted companies.When tracking the market valuation performance of targeted companies from the date of the first 13D filing to either the announcement of being acquired or to present day value, Discovery Group's performance dominates the S&P 500 over the same respective timeframe.To expand the performance analysis, I utilized my proprietary activist investor database, which measures activist performance and the financial profiles of over 1,000 targeted companies, to screen for companies with financial profiles similar to Carbonite. The screen returned 90 activist-targeted companies that on a whole have also smashed the S&P 500 over the same respective timeframe. And 53% of these 90 companies have been acquired, compared to 27% of all targets in the database.While there is no indication of a proxy battle or a clear plan of action yet, you can be certain Discovery has Carbonite's ear, as it is currently their third largest position (out of 21 total holdings) and 8.2% of their portfolio(6). Interestingly, Carbonite announced the pending retirement of Co-Founder David Friend 3 days after the first 13D filing and Friend was later quoted saying he wanted to ""spend less time comforting investors"" - perhaps indicating that Discovery has indeed been busy behind the scenes.Attractive ValuationI put slower growing in quotes above because even though Carbonite has grown its LTM revenue at 21% YoY(1), it is a SaaS company in a peer group full of impressive growers - and for SaaS, growth drives valuation. The peer group is defined in Carbonite's annual proxy as ""high-growth, small business/consumer facing companies with a focus on SaaS businesses that are U.S. based"" and all 17 of the identified companies are below. Research analysts have estimated 11% NTM revenue growth for CARB, putting it near the bottom of the peer group, and as a result, CARB has been rewarded with a lower revenue multiple. The expected dip in revenue is reasonable as Carbonite's business shifts to SMBs and deemphasizes consumers, the Company will no longer dedicate massive S&M spend to feed the consumer business growth - and analysts believe this will offset growth in the SMB business. Carbonite is now willing to allow the consumer business to flat line while the SMB business continues to take hold, which is causing a dislocation in current valuation vs. the upside potential. Carbonite offers both annual and multi-year subscriptions and has quarterly retention rates of ~96-97%(4). The Company has a clean balance sheet, with $72.4M in cash and no debt and is EBITDA and free-cash-flow positive(1). Strong retention rates coupled with its financial profile provide ample ability to withstand any short-term slowdown in expected growth.Pushing the comps aside, the precedent transactions command a much closer look. Using all the Carbonite proxies available, I pulled the companies from the peer group that have since been acquired. The precedents look a lot like Carbonite prior to their acquisitions with: 1) similar revenue scale and size, with deal values all less than $500M; 2) slower revenue growth relative to peers (except Market Leader); and 3) comparable margin and profitability profiles, with net cash positions and clean balance sheets. And to keep the valuation fair, I excluded the other acquired companies named in the proxies (OpenTable and Responsys) as both were much larger deals, with buyout multiples Carbonite would never see.Want to know what all the slower growers have in common (i.e., all but Market Leader)? That's right, an activist investor. And Convio and Keynote Systems were both activist investments for Discovery Group!Applying the valuation multiples to Carbonite's LTM and NTM metrics, I derived a price per share valuation that arrives at a range of 11-51% upside at CARB's price per share of $10.83 as of 09/19/14. The premiums paid analysis also shows a healthy range of returns from 33-58% over the price per share at the respective time period prior to acquisition. And since Carbonite actually has better growth than all the precedents (except Market Leader) with a comparable margin profile, it is reasonable to assume an even higher valuation.Note: If Market Leader is excluded from the precedents, the upside range is still 11-38%.Quickly looking at the comparable companies below, note that Carbonite outperforms the mean and median for all LTM metrics, but as research analysts estimate a slowdown in growth, Carbonite's valuation has been dinged, as its EV/Rev multiple is well below the mean and median. When applying the median revenue multiples to Carbonite's LTM and NTM metrics, I arrive at 44-45% upside. Carbonite's EBITDA multiples suggest it is relatively fairly valued on a median basis, however, some of the comps either have a very small EBITDA base or are not profitable, and these multiples have been excluded, labeled as ""NM,"" making the revenue multiples more appropriate for valuation.Conclusion: Significant Upside, Acquisition or NotAs an investor and avid follower of tech companies, I had always known Carbonite and just figured it toiled in small-cap purgatory after hundreds of millions of others like me had ignored or even ditched its backup/recovery solution for alternate solutions offered by Dropbox, Google and others. I was unaware of the Carbonite transition story, and after spending a significant amount of time digging into the opportunity, I am happy to find it undervalued. I strongly believe Carbonite is primed for an acquisition and below (in no particular order) I have recapped my top reasons why:Even if Carbonite is not acquired, the standalone prospects of the business still present significant upside. With the business model transition behind it, Carbonite will continue to leverage its brand to gain market share, which should drive growth in its SMB bookings. The Company can leverage its strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation to drive further growth through investments, share buybacks or tuck-in acquisitions like Zmanda. Once investors take notice of the SMB/channel story vs. the consumer-focused company they once knew, I would expect a reversion to the mean and Carbonite to trade more in line with its comparable companies.Footnotes:"
2006641,41741,2014-02-10T18:51:07-05:00,,"Despite posting a record quarter in 4Q 2013, Carbonite Management (NASDAQ:CARB) is now trading near 52-week lows. Carbonite managed to generate record levels of revenues and free cash flow during 4Q, marking the company's second straight quarter of profitability and sixth straight quarter of positive free cash flow.Even still, investors are a bit spooked by the company's pending transition from a consumer-focused company to a small- and medium business one. This is causing shares to be mispriced and creating a great opportunity for investors.Digging into 4Q a bit more, total bookings were actually up 15% Y/Y, with consumer growing a modest 5%, and the SMB growing 40%. On an annual basis, for 2013, total bookings were up 18%, consumer up 5% and SMB up 70%.Carbonite's chicken or the egg problemInvestors scurried out of Carbonite's stock earlier this year as the company's consumer segment growth rate came in well below last year's levels and analysts' expectations. However, what Mr. Market and its minions are likely missing is that the slow growth is a side effect of Carbonite's new strategy.In reality, it wasn't a decline in the market that drove bookings lower, rather it was Carbonite's change in strategy. And while the recent quarter wasn't what analysts or investors had hoped, the long-term growth story is still intact.A dollar being deployed in the SMB market is already yielding higher returns on investment than in the consumer business. The SMB services command a higher selling price and higher renewal rates, ultimately leading to higher margins.We believe that Carbonite is getting ahead of the curve when it comes to industry trends. The international market is ripe for increased IT spending, as emerging markets begin to urbanize. However, on the consumer side, there is a level of declining backup sales as the level of PC sales decline, and as the level or free online backups rise.Again, it seems as though Mr. Market appears to be missing the fact that Carbonite is already having marked success in the small- to medium-business market. Its total revenue base is just over $100 million, but its SMB business has already grown to $32 million. The company's growth is happening across the board, from average order value to higher margins.SMBs lead the way for future growthSMB bookings accounted for nearly 50% of all new bookings during 4Q. During 2013, Carbonite was only selling traditional endpoint backups, which is generally considered a ""secondary"" concern. Servers are the number one concern. In January, Carbonite launched a new standalone server backup service, coinciding with its new website launch.The other real beauty is that the steep growth in SMB during 4Q was mostly driven by sales of Carbonite's endpoint backup service. Meaning, Carbonite is already seeing marked SMB growth even without its server backup. Carbonite is also having success in its endpoint backup service. This service was only an add on offering through 2013, and is now a standalone service.Transition from consumer to SMBs; interim pressures but a long-term positiveAs Carbonite makes the move from a consumer-focused to an SMB-focused company, there will be some growing pains; however, the positives outweigh the negatives. The SMB market is much larger, with a much larger budget for IT. Carbonite's hybrid backup services have proven very popular, combining the convenience/speed of a local backup with the safety/accessibility of a cloud backup.Namely, as the company gears up for more SMB customers, we'd look for the company to start investing more in infrastructure, which includes upgrading its data centers. This might limit free cash flow over the interim, but we believe it's a necessary evil.The new marketing and sales strategy includes moving from a direct marketer to a channel driven marketer. This involves leaning on managed service providers and value added resellers. This move is a big positive, where resellers tend to have a greater influence over SMB purchasing decisions. Resellers can generally have a greater influence on purchasers, not to mention the fact that they can reach a much greater audience than Carbonite alone. With over six million SMBs as potential clients, the market opportunity is quite large.As part of its new marketing focus, Carbonite boosted its reseller network by 65% during 2013. We believe this will not only boost its ability to tap the SMB market, but also gear the company up for international expansion. Internationally, Carbonite is already looking toward Europe and Asia as its initial markets to tackle. The plan is to have the international side of the business up and running in 2014.A shift in marketing will further driver growthPreviously, Carbonite has been able to rely on radio and TV ads to drive consumer sales. However, with its new focus on SMBs, a new advertising strategy will be necessary. Carbonite has been right sizing its marketing spend, having reduced SG&A as a percent of revenues from 73% in 2011 to 58% over the trailing twelve months. 4Q marked a big pullback on media spending.As the shift to SMBs becomes real, Carbonite will move from a direct sales method to a reseller one. The conventional ads on TV and newspaper were enough to drive customers to the site and get a conversion for a sub $250 subscription, but as Carbonite looks sell services that are north of $1,000 to SMBs, it'll require a more direct connection with potential customers.The top-line growth is coupled with margin expansionCarbonite's backup business is a high margin business, yielding gross margins of 66% plus, and can ultimately be a high cash flow generative business. Current free cash flow margins of 5% should prove to be sustainable as Carbonite gets a handle on media spending, coupled with the fact that Carbonite's historical customer retention rate is a high 97%.While margins might bounce around a bit for the next year or so, we expect them to be meaningfully higher once the dust settles. Operating margins will likely take an interim hit as Carbonite beefs up spending on marketing as it realigns its go to market strategy for SMBs. Based on the margins that the SMB segment is able to generate, gross margins could be as high as 75% to 80% by the end of 2015.For 4Q, gross margin was up to 70.5%, an impressive 370 basis point jump from 4Q 2012. 2014 free cash flow margins could be as high as 11%, with the company churning out close to $14 million.Bottom lineUsing a long-term free cash flow growth rate of 7.5%, and a 10% discount rate, suggests that Carbonite should be trading closer to $12. An industry average enterprise value-to-sales multiple of 2 times on 2015 sales estimates of $142 million yields a $15 price target. Both suggest there's still plenty of upside to Carbonite.We look for Carbonite to continue funneling money into its channel strategy and gaining an international presence. The company has the balance sheet to help drive its international expansion, with no debt and over a quarter of its market cap covered by cash.Carbonite's transition to an SMB-focused company has already begun, and many investors might be missing the fact that despite the near-term setbacks with respect to consumer backup growth and increased marketing spend, Carbonite has the potential to beat expectations in the long-term as it tackles the higher-growth, higher-margin, SMB market.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Carbonite provides secure online backup solutions, with anytime, anywhere access to customer data, and has 1.5 million subscribers, along with considerable brand awareness in the cloud backup market. Pricing for Carbonite's personal services ranges from $60-150 per year, and pricing on the business/server products ranges from $270-1,000 per year.Carbonite represents the fourth collaboration between CEO David Friend and Jeff Flowers, Boston-based entrepreneurs. Prior to Carbonite, they founded FaxNet Corporation, Pilot Software and Sonexis Incorporated, all of which were ultimately sold to larger companies. Carbonite is also backed by venture capital firms Menlo Ventures and Crosslink Capital (who were pre-IPO investors and bought additional shares in the IPO), along with Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), who bought pre-IPO shares in January 2011 (at $12.00 per share). In August 2011, Carbonite was one of only a handful of companies to go public (amidst the U.S. ratings downgrade turmoil), with its IPO pricing at $10.00 per share. As of May 2014, shares traded at $11.13 (~$300 million equity market capitalization).Strategically, Carbonite has been shifting its focus from the consumer market to the small business market. Given this evolution, the company has not been aggressively marketing to consumers, and although the company is still growing at double-digit rates, sequential growth has been slowing and profitability has been improving. Considering the likely waning interest from growth-oriented public market investors, we believe it is a logical time for Carbonite to consider a potential sale. Carbonite's customer base and prospective cash flow should be attractive to potential acquirers, and this is evidenced by the fact that one potential buyer has already come forward.Willing Buyer (NASDAQ:JCOM)In November 2012, J2 Global filed a 13D noting 9.9% ownership of CARB's shares, along with a copy of an offer letter to acquire all of CARB's outstanding shares for $10.50 in cash (the offer was made on August 31, 2012, representing a 38% premium to the closing price of $7.56 on that date). This offer came following a stock decline precipitated, in part, by the impact of the termination of CARB's advertising relationship with Rush Limbaugh in March 2012. CARB rejected JCOM's offer without a counter-proposal.JCOM has been gradually diversifying its business from the legacy efax/jfax business to include cloud-based storage (including online backup) and digital media. JCOM has recently acquired a European online backup business and has publicly conveyed its interest in growing via acquisition, particularly in cloud storage, with CARB being not only an obvious candidate, but one it has already identified and tried to acquire in the past. Additionally, JCOM recently raised $300 million through a convertible notes offering for acquisitions and general corporate purposes.Willing Sellers (Rational, Financially Motivated Ownership Base)In February 2014, David Friend (age 66) announced his intention to step down as CEO, effective when a successor is found. To-date, no successor has been named. We expect that ten key shareholders (which collectively control 68% of the company) would be willing to consider a strategic deal at this time, in particular given the company's relatively small scale as a public company.ValuationWe believe it makes little sense for Carbonite to remain a standalone public company over the long term. The company has recently been emphasizing cash flow over top line growth (FCF yield is projected at ~4-5% next year), and given this evolution from growth to value, a handful of equity analysts have recently dropped coverage on the name. We have developed two key scenarios which underpin our valuation framework.1) Acquisition Scenario. Given the potential synergies, a strategic acquirer (such as JCOM) could pay a considerable premium and still realize double-digit cash flow yields by reducing overheads, marketing and R&D. In the context of a sale, assuming a targeted pro forma FCF yield for the buyer of 8-10%, Carbonite would be worth $18-22 per share (~60-100% premium to current market price).2) Sensitivity Scenario. We have developed a standalone ""run-off"" analysis, incorporating revenues from existing customers and reduced selling and research and development expenses. This scenario suggests that a standalone Carbonite in a prudently managed wind-down would be worth $10-11 per share.We are encouraged by the fact that the company is controlled by a relatively concentrated group of financially-motivated decision makers. Although there are no guarantees the company will optimize its potential value in the near term, we believe these decision makers will behave rationally when the time is right. Fundamentally, the biggest downside risk (other than a catastrophic loss of customer data) is that the company attempts to drive revenue growth in an unprofitable manner to appease growth-oriented public market investors. Fortunately, we take comfort in the fact that the company's recent actions suggest that it is not likely to chase unprofitable growth or expand into new business lines at this stage.DisclaimerThe author of this report currently has an outstanding long position in CARB's equity securities and may add to or reduce this position depending on market price movements.

The company noted that its sales were strong in its Carbonite Server Backup product and newly released Carbonite HT10 appliance. These products are resonating nicely with small businesses.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1534682,24802,2013-07-04T10:07:05-04:00,,"Carbonite (NASDAQ:CARB), one of the leading data backup companies, is set for a banner 2013, with record sales forecast for the year, as well as a continuation of narrowing losses. As Carbonite moves further into the burgeoning small business cloud computing market, we believe that the company will be able to further increase its customer and revenue base, thereby leading to. Backed by a strong balance sheet, Carbonite is well positioned to maintain its investments in new products and customer initiatives, and we believe the confluence of these factors will lead to profits for Carbonite's investors. With shares down almost 5% from their 52-week high, we believe that investors should take advantage of this (and any further pullbacks) to add to or initiate positions in Carbonite. Unless otherwise noted, financial statistics and management commentary will be sourced from the following: Carbonite's Q1 2013 earnings release, its latest 10-Q, or its Q1 2013 earnings call.Q1 2013: Pivoting Towards Small BusinessThe first quarter of 2013 highlights Carbonite's continued pivot towards small business cloud computing and data backup. Although the company is by no means ""abandoning"" the consumer market, and CEO David Friend reiterated Carbonite's commitment to the consumer market, the company is placing a clear emphasis on targeting the burgeoning small business data backup market. This pivot helped fuel Carbonite's growth in Q1, with total revenues rising 32.14% to $24.508 million (beating consensus estimates by $0.07 million), and pro forma losses coming in at 18 cents per share (matching consensus estimates), versus a loss of 27 cents in Q1 2012. Importantly, Carbonite's margin structure is improving. Pro forma gross margins expanded to 65% in Q1 2013 versus 64.2% in Q1 2012. Although Carbonite's gross margins fell sequentially from 66.8% in Q4 2012, CFO Anthony Folger noted that in Q1, there were several one-time impacts to gross margin, namely the impact from new product offerings and the fact that some run on third-party platforms, as well as incremental benefit costs related to expanded customer support operations. However, CFO Folger stated that the company expects gross margins to climb through the remainder of 2013, albeit at a slower rate than in 2012 (more on this later). Carbonite is also showing meaningful improvements further down its margin structure, especially in terms of sales leverage. In Q1 2012, sales and marketing expenses totaled 66.84% of revenue, a figure that fell to 50.12% in Q1 2013. Carbonite's total operating loss fell to $4.749 million, or 19.38% of revenue, versus 36.86% in Q1 2012.Carbonite ended Q1 2013 with 1.471 million total customers (including 50,000 small business customers), up from 1.279 million a year ago. This equates to growth of 15.01%, and both retention and renewal rates either increasing or holding steady; the company's retention rose by 400 basis points to 85% year-over-year, and its renewal rate held steady at 82%. Importantly, bookings (defined as total recognized revenue and net changes in deferred revenue) rose by 19.73%, Highlighting the company's pivot towards the small business market is the fact that small business customers comprised 24% of total bookings in Q1 2013, up from 14% in Q1 2012. Although small business customers still account for a small portion of Carbonite's overall business, the segment is continuing to become a more meaningful part of the company's overall revenue base, and as CFO Anthony Folger noted, ARPU for the company's small business customers is meaningfully higher than that of retail customers. Small business growth is being helped by the October 2012 acquisition of Zmanda for $13.4 million. Zmanda is a leading provider of open source and database backup systems; Carbonite has noted that database backup will be a key focus for the company going forward. CEO David Friend provided several updates on Carbonite's effort to integrate Zmanda on the company's earnings call. Zmanda's offerings have now been rebranded as Carbonite Database Backup, and the company's resellers are now offering it as part of Carbonite's overall suite of backup offerings. And Carbonite is now in the process of further integrating Zmanda's offerings into its direct and online sales channels, as well as integrating Zmanda's technology and that of Carbonite's own offerings. Zmanda's existing customer base includes many Fortune 500 companies, including Sprint (NYSE:S), Raytheon (RTN), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and we believe that with Carbonite's balance sheet, the company will be able to further expand its customer base as investments in new products and commercial efforts can be expanded. Carbonite has recently released updates to many of Zmanda's core product offerings, including Zmanda Enterprise, as well as introduced new products such as Zmanda ZRM, which is designed to back up MySQL databases. With Zmanda, Carbonite is well positioned to further penetrate the growing small business market. However, Zmanda is not Carbonite's only avenue for growth. In the coming quarters, we believe that other initiatives will begin to play a more meaningful role as well.The Road Ahead: Expanding the Addressable MarketIn late February, Carbonite inked a partnership with Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) to become a partner of Comcast's Upware for Business program, designed to offer small businesses an integrated suite of cloud computing services, including Carbonite's data backup services. CFO Anthony Folger notes that although there will be incremental ""price degradation"" related to the deal, the company's total addressable market will meaningfully expand via its distribution deal with Comcast, which will complement Carbonite's existing reseller base, which has continued to grow alongside the company's revenue. Over the past 10 months, Carbonite's reseller base has expanded by 56% to 3,400, which allows Carbonite's growth to come from initiatives other than direct marketing (as we noted above, the company's sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue have declined meaningfully on a year-over-year basis). Carbonite's use of resellers allows the company to meaningfully expand its addressable market without a meaningful increase in sales costs, for its reseller partners almost always have more insights into the small business customers in question than Carbonite. The small business market also features dynamics that favor Carbonite's efforts to drive incremental revenue growth. While the company's consumer backup offerings feature unlimited data, its small business offerings do not. The company offers two storage tiers for its small business customers, 250 GB and 500 GB, with additional storage available for purchase. As businesses continue to generate data, data that they will need to protect and backup, Carbonite will be able to offer them the appropriate amount of storage that suits their business needs; additional storage is priced at $55.99 for 50 GB, and $99.99 for 100 GB. However, even as Carbonite is making inroads into the small business market, the company is continuing to innovate on the consumer side of its business as well. Through its Carbonite Labs division, the company is currently in the process of developing Currents, a file syncing and sharing system designed to streamline the process of syncing and sharing files across all of a customer's device platforms, be they desktop or mobile. CEO David Friend noted on the company's Q1 earnings call that Currents has received positive feedback from beta testers, with users noting its ease of use as a key feature. Carbonite did not cite a specific release date for Currents, but did note that it is continuing to refine and update it, and we expect a firmer timeline to be provided on the company's Q2 2013 earnings call.Carbonite's forecasts for Q2 2013 and 2013 as a whole imply continued growth as well as a further narrowing of losses, as the company continues to generate operating leverage. For the second quarter, Carbonite is forecasting revenues of $25.8 million at the midpoint of guidance ($25.7-$25.9 million), and a pro forma loss of 11 cents per share at the midpoint of guidance (a loss of 10-12 cents per share). Carbonite's guidance for the second quarter implies revenue growth of 27.43%, and for pro forma losses to remain at Q2 2012 levels. Although the company's losses for the second quarter are not projected to improve on a year-over-year basis, this is not the case for 2013. Full-year guidance calls for a pro forma loss of 42 cents per share at the midpoint of guidance (a loss of 40-44 cents per share), versus a loss of 46 cents per share for 2012. Revenues are set to reach $105 million at the midpoint of guidance ($104-$106 million), implying year-over-year growth of 24.94%. Although this is a deceleration from the company's 38.89% revenue growth rate in 2012, Carbonite is projected to, at a minimum, see break-even free cash flow for the remainder of 2013 (the company generated $654,000 of free cash flow in Q1 2013, versus free cash flow burn of $4.624 million in Q1 2012). Carbonite's financial position is stronger than its pro forma losses suggest, something that can be confirmed by the company's solid balance sheet.Financial & 2014 ForecastsWhen it comes to investments in small capitalization companies, we believe in identifying companies that not only have solid growth prospects in the future, but also have strong financials today. Given the heightened risks of investing in this subset of the market, a strong balance sheet can provide protection against unforeseen business developments, as well as the capital necessary for continued growth, research and development, and commercial expansion. Carbonite, like most of the small-capitalization companies that we cover, has just such a financial position.Carbonite ended Q1 2013 with $56.5 million in cash & investments on its balance sheet, and no debt (Carbonite has access to a $25 million revolving credit facility, and to date has not drawn upon it). Based on its 25,969,781 outstanding shares, Carbonite holds $2.17 of net cash and investments per share, equivalent to 16.95% of its current market capitalization (based on the company's $12.80 closing price on July 3). Carbonite's free cash flow guidance for 2013 implies that this balance is unlikely to decrease meaningfully, thereby leaving room for Carbonite to invest further into research and development or potential acquisitions to further strengthen its competitive position in the small business market. Furthermore, consensus forecasts for 2014 imply that Carbonite's financial position will only improve. Carbonite is expected to generate $129.64 million in revenues in 2014, implying year-over-year revenue growth of 23.47%. While it is true that this means Carbonite's year-over-year revenue growth will once again decelerate (by 146 basis points), the company's pro forma losses are set to narrow to 16 cents per share, versus a projected 42 cent loss for 2013. The driver of Carbonite's narrowed losses will likely once again be favorable operating leverage, as the company expands its customer base (and average revenue per subscriber as more small business customers utilize the company's offerings), all while maintaining tight cost controls.ConclusionsWith a solid balance sheet and a clear strategic pathway, Carbonite has the tools it needs to continuing its pivot to the growing small business data backup market, all while maintaining and growing its retail customer base. Although revenue growth is set to decelerate in the years to come, Carbonite's losses will continue to narrow, and we believe that if the company is able to maintain its current trajectory, profitability is achievable in 2015. Carbonite is experiencing meaningful operating leverage, and in our view, its share price is likely to rise if the company continues to execute on its current strategy as it did in its most recent quarter. Carbonite's market opportunity continues to expand, and we believe that investors who add to or initiate positions in Carbonite will profit in the months and years to come as more investors become aware of Carbonite's full potential.Disclosure: I am long CARB, CMCSA, AMZN, RTN, S, CSCO.

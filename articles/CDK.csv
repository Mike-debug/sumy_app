4068394,76785,2017-05-03T09:42:52-04:00,"CDK Global management has done a stunning job on executing post spin-off.Patient shareholders have been rewarded, but new shareholders are forced to buy at 20x trailing EBITDA.If management hits its targets, the valuation makes sense, particularly given the protected revenue base.The company isn't a strong buy, but it certainly isn't a bad one. Market-beating returns seem likely.","CDK Global (NASDAQ:CDK) equity has had a heck of a run after its spin-off from Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) late in 2014. In hindsight, the company ended up being a picture-perfect spin-off investment opportunity: an underfollowed and mismanaged business that had significant opportunity for process improvement, all while offering a compelling product. While the market initially took the ""show me"" approach, valuations have since appreciated meaningfully, making CDK Global appear expensive on a trailing basis, but there is more here than meets the eye. Further likely margin expansion, a healthy protected recurring revenue base, and an asset-light business mark CDK Global as a company likely to be a steady compounder over the next several years, even from current levels.Business OverviewSo, what is the business model here? CDK Global is an essential technology provider for automotive retailers, providing the technology for accounting, parts inventory, services, etc. This is all about automation and streamlining operations, integrating all critical workflow processes into one product suite for dealers to manage every aspect of their franchise. Like many firms in the software technology space, the company has shifted towards contract subscription revenue, with most CDK Global customers signing mid-length terms (four to five years), with only some variability to the cost structure. Since very little revenue is based on sales transaction volume (registration and credit checks as exceptions), actual sales at the dealer level do not matter much for the company's bottom line. So, while new car sales are a great barometer of health when it comes to CDK Global customers, even large fluctuations in car sales do not matter. Management frequently cites back to the 2008/2009 period where US new auto sales were almost cut in half from 17M to 10M units; CDK Global revenue fell only 3% year/year. That shows the strong structure of this business and just how integral the technology is for dealers to continue to operate. The necessity of the technology translates over to switching costs as well, as most customers are extremely reticent to switch, given the initial fees and labor training costs to bring staff up to speed on entirely new systems. As a result, CDK Global retention rates are in the 95-99% range.It took some time for CDK Global to earn this position. While the company has only been public for two years, its history at prior parent Automatic Data Processing stretches back nearly half a century. CDK Global is essentially in a duopoly in this space, holding 40% market share of the North American market, a market-leading position it has held for decades. Together with Reynolds and Reynolds, more than two-thirds of the market is controlled by just these two companies and an even larger market share among larger dealers.Given its once relatively small size when CDK Global was consolidated within Automatic Data Processing, it seems that the business was neglected. Six months after the spin-off in June of 2015, management announced a three-year plan that targeted improving the financials from 22% adjusted EBITDA margins to 35%, with the end of fiscal 2018 as the targeted completion date. To get there, CDK Global has been working to migrate customers to the latest software, streamline the number of tools to cut down on programming costs and training time, enhance customer service, and putting a lot of time into reducing a somewhat bloated corporate cost structure. Thus far, the targets and timeline appear manageable. Fiscal 2016 (reported in August of last year) showed 370bps of EBITDA margin expansion while still maintaining 5% revenue growth. Healthy results in the beginning of fiscal 2017 have led management to update that EBITDA target to 36-38%, with the potential for 40% by the end of fiscal 2019.My figures above exclude restructuring costs but do not exclude stock-based compensation as CDK Global does in its adjusted EBITDA numbers. Including stock-based compensation in EBITDA figures is about a 2.5% margin headwind versus its figures. Today, CDK Global trades at 19x EV/EBITDA on a trailing basis. That is expensive by any stretch of the imagination. However, assuming 5% annual revenue growth through the end of fiscal 2018, along with management executing on the mid-point of its updated current EBITDA margin guidance (37%), the company could generate adjusted EBITDA of $862M. Basically, 12x next year's adjusted EBITDA may seem expensive, but the quality of earnings here is extremely pure. Capital expenditure needs are relatively light ($70M annual), putting next year's free cash flow yield at approximately 5%; not cheap but in line with companies of similar quality that have such a strong protection around the revenue base.Fiscal 2017 is off to a solid start. Based on strong Q3 2017 results (reported May 2nd), management increased earnings guidance to $2.40-2.44/share ($714M in adjusted EBITDA), up from the original $2.28-2.35/share guidance given last August. This guidance bump is solely due to margin expansion that has come in well ahead of schedule (Q3 posted 32.5% EBITDA margins, or up 690bps y/y).Shareholder Returns, TakeawayCDK Global intends to push 70-80% of free cash flow to shareholders, or several hundred million annually. Given the dividend is currently quite small (1% yield, $40M in annual obligation), the vast majority of this cash flow will be directed towards share repurchases, enough to retire around 2% of the float annually after the impact of stock dilution. The shareholder program here is not massive due to the stock valuation, but it is a solid start that will only improve with time.Is CDK Global dirt cheap? No. Is it an impeccably run company with a clear runway to strong earnings growth? Most definitely. I don't think it is a compelling enough company to make a buy today, but that is a tough hurdle to earn a spot in my portfolio. Overall, I think there are much worse places to park your money, and I certainly think the company has an excellent opportunity to be a consistent outperformer of mid-cap benchmarks.For deep-dive research on asymmetric risk/reward plays in the Industrial and Basic Materials sectors (particularly small and mid-caps), consider investing alongside me and other subscribers within Industrial Insights.

The automotive industry is undergoing technological changes, so the company is well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities by bringing on board Intel’s ex-CEO Brian Krzanich. CDK Global has a leadership in the highly competitive automotive market and is constantly innovating to obtain competitive advantages. Therefore, it invests a lot on developing new products like the Fortellis platform and integrating new automotive software capabilities so customers can adventure elevated automotive experience. The recent ELAD1ONE and Progressus acquisitions show management incentives to improve a slightly weaker CRM business that has significant growth opportunities. I am confident that company management can achieve top line objectives of business transformation plan set in 2016 and further drive shareholder value creation with increased revenue growth, margin expansion and share buybacks over the next 3-5 years.CDK Global was formed in October 2014 as a spin-off from ADP Dealer Services. For more than 40 years, the company has provided integrated technology solutions to over 28,000 automotive dealerships and adjacent industries worldwide. Its main mission is to provide technology to dealerships for a complete automotive consumer experience throughout the whole process - from researching to buying, and maintaining to upgrading the car. The industry is highly competitive and fragmented, however, no competitor provides the same combination of international reach and breadth of solutions. CDK leads the Dealer Management System (“DMS”) software solutions market with over 40% market in share in North America. Other key competitors are Reynolds and Reynolds, Cox Automotive and Autosoft, along with various local providers. DMS is sold on a subscription basis, and contracts are usually long-term with average client tenure of 20 years.(Source: Company website)It enables dealers to capture transaction, track inventory and account for every dollar and helps them to monitor the financial and operational performance of their business in real-time. It is also a management tool, as they can quickly share information with employees and customers on timely reporting. By making data available to everyone, both employees and customers gain a better value proposition. DMS also identifies profit leaks, like adding a disposal fee for a battery a customer previously declined, and identifies opportunities, like suggesting an after-sales service a customer previously declined. Data also spots escalating problems so dealers can act on time to solve the issues.Autoline Drive help improve customer experience in two key areas: help monitor customers calls accurately so they can answer most of the calls under 10 seconds with very low abandon rates. The sales process can be effectively micromanaged through digital sales, as 100% of leads are recorded on a database, and customers in showrooms are led by a complete digital experience from start to finish. CRM solution is very effective for personalized communication with existing or prospective customers, as they can be contacted through a number of channels like emails, voice, SMS, social media sites etc. It drives further long-term sales growth and also lowers the Sales & Marketing expense of dealerships.Key benefits of using after-sales DMS is a significant increase in retail hours per job, as it helps to monitor KPIs from initial quality checks to the upsell and conversion rate. For instance, if the dealer finds out a missed opportunity in brakes sales, it can come up with a better marketing and pricing strategy and increase sales over the next few months. Another key benefit is to monitor every minute of technicians' working time, so dealers can easily identify areas where time is wasted, which can lead to significant productivity improvement. A third important benefit is a key improvement in vehicle throughput rate, as live dashboard reports status of every car on site and the analysis tool helps to identify where there was a delay in the process.Fortellis Automotive Commerce Exchange is a technology platform that enables connections and greatest collaboration among automotive software developers, OEMs, and dealers. Automotive retail technology developers can easily sell their integrated product or services in a secure e-commerce environment, and the dealers can find new solutions and collaborate with others to develop unique experiences. CDK Global is leveraging Fortellis' capabilities to make applications better integrated with other software providers and more flexible for the end consumer. The company doesn’t expect any significant revenue in the near term, but it is a key tool for developing an outstanding long-term technology platform strategy that will lead to better customer experiences.(Source: Earnings Release, Q1 FY19)CDK Global reported total revenues under ASC 605 of $565.9 million in Q1 FY19, compared to $565.7 million in Q1 FY18, slightly higher of analysts' estimates of $561.16 million. Q1 FY19 GAAP earnings before income taxes and adjusted earnings before income taxes increased 11% y/y to $174.0 million and 12% y/y to $179.4 million, respectively. Both margins increased ~350bps to ~42%, and margin expansion was driven by operating leverage on subscription revenue growth and operating efficiencies essential to the business transformation plan set in 2016. Cost of revenues and operating expenses were both favorably impacted by lower labor-related costs. The company reported a net profit of $90.3 million and basic EPS of 0.70, in line with consensus EPS estimate. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $312.8 million in Q1 FY19 as compared to $805.4 million in Q4 FY18, and long-term debt increased to $2,673 million in Q1 FY19 as compared to $2,575 million in Q4 FY18. The company returned to $133 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends this quarter and almost $482 million calendar year to date. It has also announced a goal of returning $750 million to $1 billion in calendar years 2018 and 2019.New auto site sales continue to grow, but the key concern remains customer retention rate, therefore this quarter, the number of auto sites declined from 8,933 to 8,920 auto sites q/q. The company works on improving the entire customer experience by introducing new channels of customer support and extensive use of data analytics. While revenues per site continue to grow driven by strong commercialization and demand for layered applications and document cloud, there is a huge weakness in sales of inventory and CRM. The company has also offered a better commercial offering, by making changes in pricing and packaging and a new rewards program, so they have better conditions to cooperate with CDK.It has also initiated M&A deals, and a few months ago acquired CRM software provider ELAD1ONE, which develops automotive retail front applications and an integrated customer service platform. Its well-regarded customer service capabilities include daily sales planning, Internet lead management, lead tracking, etc. The acquisition is a big step towards a better CDK customer experience and the strategic objective to invest in products that help dealers to increase sales. Nevertheless, ELEAD1ONE is a lower-profit business, and cost of interest together with other associated costs will be mildly dilutive for CDK’s FY 2019 earnings.In April 2018, the company also purchased Progressus Media, a provider of mobile advertising solutions for dealerships and other automotive companies. That way CDK Global can accelerate growth in social media channels, as it is a perfect addition to the CDK advertising platform. This month, the company has also announced a new CEO, Brian Krzanich, who previously served as Intel’s CEO from 2013 to 2018. Krzanich has an exceptional track record of creating shareholder value, combined with strong technology and strategic expertise. I strongly believe he is the right person to lead the company and achieve superb future growth combined with shareholder value creation in a highly dynamic and rapidly changing automotive industry.The company also provided its fiscal 2019 ASC 605 revenue and EPS guidance of $2.35-2.38 million and $2.90-3.00, respectively. Analyst consensus estimate for FY 19 is for revenue and GAAP EPS of $2.33 million and $3.73, respectively. If we use FY 19 revenue of $2.38 million and EPS of $3.00 at the top-point guidance, then shares currently trade at a forward P/E and EV/REV FY19 multiple of ~16.5 and 3.74x, respectively. For instance, computed forward P/E FY 19 is in line with the current S&P 500 market average forward P/E multiple of ~16.7, which makes the stock reasonably priced currently. Nevertheless, the stock is a potential turnaround play, as the company is taking strong initiatives to return shareholder capital by continuous share buybacks and dividends, consequently lifting EPS in the near future.On the other hand, given the current overall bearish market sentiment on Wall Street, combined with increased stock market volatility, there might be a continuation of the Nasdaq and S&P 500 market downturn. The CKD stock price decline of 15% after reporting Q1 FY 19 earnings results provides a good entry point. In the case of downtrend continuation, I would “buy the dip” and slowly build the position at a higher margin of safety.I think CDK Global is an interesting long-term buy, even though the stock has underperformed both the S&P 500 and MSCI USA IT index over the last year. I expect that any positive bullish catalysts in the near future might be a trigger for a significant increase in the stock price. The key bullish catalysts are the company’s leadership position and its strong competitive advantage in integrated automotive solutions. Other important bullish catalysts are a potentially successful transformation plan set in 2016 along with improved operating efficiency and returning capital to shareholders, together with bringing Intel’s CEO Brian Krzanich to run the company. Key risks to my thesis are intensified competition combined with rapid technological changes in the automotive software solutions market or failed execution of business transformation plan set in 2016."
4042370,102551,2017-02-03T04:19:04-05:00,"CDK’s stock price has doubled to almost $64 since it was spun-off from ADP in 2014.
        CDK’s sub 1% dividend yield will not appeal to investors seeking income from their investments.
        CDK is expensive and I am of the opinion a $17 drop in price to approximately $46 - $47 is required before I purchase more shares.","IntroductionIn today's post I am going to review CDK Global Inc. (NASDAQ: CDK) and its recently released Q2 FY 2017 results.CDK is quite possibly a company that has never come across your radar screen for the following reasons:CDK was officially spun off from Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADP) on September 30, 2014 and began trading as a member of the S&P MidCap 400 Index on October 1, 2014. As ADP shareholders, my wife and I received one share of CDK stock for every three shares of ADP stock we held in ADP on September 24, 2014.We have never sold our CDK stock and if you want to know whether we have been pleased with CDK's performance, I enclose the graph below so you can see how well CDK has performed. You can also read my Do Low or No Dividend Yield Companies Belong in Your Portfolio? post in which I used CDK as one of my examples.Industry OverviewCDK operates in a competitive industry. In North America, there are 3 major players: CDK, Reynolds & Reynolds and the Cox Automotive Group.The Reynolds and Reynolds Company is a private corporation. Its primary business is providing business forms, management software and professional services to car dealerships. Its software is used to manage sales logistics at dealerships. It also produces forms used in medicine and insurance.Cox Automotive is a member of Cox Enterprises, Inc., which is a privately held American conglomerate with revenues of $18B and approximately 60,000 employees and is based in Atlanta, Georgia. Cox is a leading communications and automotive services company and its brands include Autotrader®, Dealer.com®, Dealertrack®, Kelley Blue Book®, Manheim®, NextGear Capital®, vAuto®, Xtime® and a host of other brands.Smaller competitors include Auto/Mate and Autosoft.There is a variety of other providers at varying ends of the spectrum in terms of sophistication and in terms of product offering that CDK bumps up against.In NASDAQ's 35th Investor Program and Citi's 2016 Global Technology Conference, CDK's CFO indicated that consolidation is occurring within the auto dealership industry. The number of dealership rooftops, while relatively flat at roughly 17,600 rooftops in the US, is consolidating in that the large companies are tending to buy other players. This benefits CDK because its sweet spot is the medium to high end of the market.Business OverviewCDK is a leading global provider of integrated information technology and digital marketing solutions to the automotive retail and adjacent industries. Its solutions automate and integrate all parts of the dealership and buying process from targeted digital advertising and marketing campaigns to the sale, financing, insuring, parts supply, repair and maintenance of vehicles.CDK provides solutions to dealers in more than 100 countries, serving more than 27,000 retail locations, and most automotive manufacturers.Effective July 1, 2016, CDK restructured its operations with a reduction from 3 to 2 main operating groups: CDK North America (consisting of CDK North America: Retail Solutions North America and CDK North America: Advertising North America) and CDK International (fka Automotive Retail International (NYSE:ARI)).This change included combining the Digital Marketing and the Automotive Retail North America (NASDAQ:ARNA) operations into a single organization thus creating a single North America Sales organization, and forming a single global R&D organization.CDK estimates it has a ~43% market share in North America. Of its total annual revenue, ~60% - 65% is of a recurring nature through multiyear subscription-based contracts. The remainder of its business is ~10% transaction-related and ~20% - 25% is tied to many of the subscription-based contracts but is more of a one-time nature.CDK is currently in its first year of a 3 year transformation plan aimed at significantly improving its profitability and improving the customer experience. The goal of the transformation plan from a profitability perspective is to expand EBITDA margins from ~22% to ~35% at the end of fiscal 2018 (end of June 2018).Q2 2017 Financial ResultsFull details can be found in CDK's February 2, 2017 Earnings release. Highlights are provided below.FCF for the 6 months ending December 31, 2016 amounted to $0.1337B vs. $0.0056B for the same period in 2015. For comparison purposes, FCF for FY2015 and FY2016 amounted to $0.204B and $0.256B, respectively.CDK announced an increase in its adjusted EBITDA margin to 32.8%, a 550 bps increase over Q2 2016 which keeps it on track to meet the 35% target margin for FY2018.In mid-January 2017 CDK returned $1B of capital to its shareholders in the 2016 calendar year. In Q2, CDK returned a total of $0.37B to shareholders through $0.02B in dividend payments, $0.02B of open market share repurchases, and $0.33B in accelerated share repurchases (""ASR""). The ASR is currently in-market and is expected to be completed in Q4 2017.The intent is to return $0.75B - $1B of capital per calendar year through 2019 using a combination of dividends and share repurchases. These returns will be funded by FCF and incremental borrowings intended to bring leverage, measured as financial debt, net of cash, divided by adjusted EBITDA, to a range of 2.5x to 3.0x over the period.Outlook for Remainder of Fiscal 2017CDK reported 5% revenue growth in FY2016 relative to FY2015 with 370 bps of margin expansion to 26.6%.When it reported its FY2016 results, CDK provided FY2017 guidance showing revenue growing 4% - 5%, and EBITDA margin expanding 500 - 550 bps (31.6% increasing to 32.1%). It also projected EBITDA margin expansion of 36% - 38% for FY 2018 and 40%+ for FY 2019.These projections have subsequently been amended wherein 4% - 5% revenue growth is projected for FY2017 and EBITDA margin will be in the 550 - 575 bps range.A recent addition to the FY2017 forecast is $0.095B - $0.105B of incremental adjusted EBITDA attributable to the execution of CDK's business transformation plan. It anticipates a YoY impact to earnings and margins for the remainder of fiscal 2017 due to incremental interest expense related to additional borrowings executed in the Q2 2017 and incremental incentive compensation expense in the Q4 2017, on the basis that it executes its business transformation plan.ValuationMr. Market must have liked what it saw in CDK's results as the stock has popped roughly $1.5 to just over $63.50 (a ~2.4% increase from the February 1, 2017 close) as I compose this.Let's see if CDK is priced to my liking.I enclose earnings estimates which I generated from TD WebBroker and from the most recent ValuEngine report. The mean FY2017 non-GAAP estimated EPS from 6 analysts reflects a figure of $2.36.The ValuEngine report reflects a mean FY2017 non-GAAP estimate of $2.34 from 5 analysts.Source: TD Bank WebBrokerSource: ValuEngineNow let's look at CDK from a dividend yield perspective. Even though the dividend has been increased to $0.14/quarter or $0.56/year, the dividend yield is still sub 1%. Clearly, the dividend yield on CDK will not be the primary metric that will sway my decision to acquire more shares. The high growth nature of the business and the potential for capital gains would be the reason why I would purchase additional CDK shares.I don't like to pay more than 20 times projected EPS so if I use a mid-point of $2.35 for FY2017, I get a price of $47 which is $17 lower than the current market price.If you need the dividend income, even a drop in price to $47 would probably not be enough to sway you to buy CDK. A $0.56 annual dividend and a $47 stock price would only give you a dividend yield slightly over 1.1%.Final ThoughtsCDK has certainly increased dramatically since we acquired shares as a result of this entity having been spun-off from ADP. While we have benefited nicely from this run-up and I like the company, I am of the opinion it is currently much too expensive at this stage to acquire more shares.CDK is on my radar screen and you may wish to put it on your radar screen unless your investment profile is such that you require dividend income.Please click the + icon next to my user name and follow me at, Financial Freedom is a Journey, as I work to keep you informed on further developments in the world of dividend stocks."

All figures are current as of the entry's submission - the contest deadline was April 22, 2016). Elevator PitchCDK (NASDAQ:CDK) is the largest supplier of end-to-end DMS software to automotive dealerships. It displays classic spin characteristics - under-followed, unknown, and under-managed. CDK has a remarkably durable (yet unknown) capital - light franchise (~27% ROIC, ~ 31% ROTA) with recurring, growing revenues that are relatively immune to recessions or volatile car sales. High software switching costs support high customer retention rates and high barriers to entry. Pre-spin CDK was under-managed as a small segment in a large corporation. Post-spin CDK has the potential to adopt a significantly leaner cost structure by reducing over-staffed ranks. Operating at industry standards would double EBITDA and FCF. Low capex, stable business dynamics (~5-7% industry revenue growth), strong free cash flows (~$1B total over 3y when EV is $8B), and an under-levered balance sheet makes CDK ripe for a LBO. Activist investors such as Sachem Head (a Pershing Square spin-off), Fir Tree and Elliott collectively own 16.8% of CDK. CDK trades at ~14.5x 2018E FCF, which is very cheap relative to the 25-30x acquisition multiples of its smaller peers that have less than a tenth of CDK's market share.

CDK displays classic spin-off characteristics. lt is under-followed, unknown, and even under-managed.2. The market is not properly discounting CDK's durable franchise and potential post-spinoff. Key competitive advantages include recurring revenue streams, high barriers to entry created by high switching costs, and business resilience in recessions. CDK has the potential for a significant re-rate after cost-reductions show results. Stable free cash flows and an under-levered balance sheet have also attracted activist investors (Sachem, Elliott, Fir Tree), who already amassed large stakes in CDK, for a potential LBO.ValuationCDK trades at ~14.5x 2018E FCF. This is very cheap on the basis of its capital-light, durable, market-leading franchise and acquisition multiples of its smaller peers. Dealertrack Technologies and Solera Holdings were acquired at 30x and 25x respectively as recently as 2H15, but have less than a tenth of CDK's market share. Accounting for repurchases, CDK should generate FCF $3.80/sh.

4358099,75025,2020-07-13T08:54:09-04:00,"The company appeared on the Magic Formula screen of July because of its high return on capital and high earnings yield.
        The company primarily provides software to auto dealers.
        CDK has a very solid record of growth over time, that goes for both sales and profitability.
        There are obvious industry headwinds in the pandemic, but these should moderate as people prefer personal transport over public transport.
        The stock is undervalued and has an upside of 45% on its way to a 5.5% FCF yield.","Earlier this year, I resumed coverage of the Magic Formula. CDK Global (CDK) appeared in last screen of July. The stock has lagged the market and its IT peers over the past year or so. Because of its very strong position in its core market I think that this is a quality business that trades at a reasonable price.The chart below shows the tickers of the 30 Magic Formula stocks that I identified earlier this month including sectors and industries. For more information about the Magic Formula, you can take a look at my last article about it. Source: compiled by author, magicformulainvesting.com was used to get the tickers, the sectors and industry classifications follow the GICS methodology.CDK is a rather underfollowed stock on Seeking Alpha, with the last analysis on Seeking Alpha stemming from 2018, despite it being a solid mid cap company in an interesting business niche. The stock already intrigued me when writing the Magic Formula article. It seems like it is a reasonably good buy for this market, despite obvious near-term challenges. Perhaps the challenges are so obvious that this is what makes the stock attractively valued.The Magic Formula bases its ranking on earnings yield and return on capital. The earnings yield is calculated as EBIT/EV and the return on capital as EBIT/(net working capital + net fixed assets).CDK’s earnings yield is 8% (604m/7,480m) based on data sourced from Seeking Alpha. However, the company’s operating earnings in its financial statements add up to $487m but approach $600m when excluding a one-off litigation expense of $90m.The aforementioned 8% is pretty high, but nothing extreme. The NWC is $42m when including the working capital for sale. Net fixed assets are $513m and I included ‘other assets’ as that includes contracts that do seem to be material to its operations and are definitely recurring. The return on capital is then 109% (604m/555m), which is very high. Compared to Acuity Brands (AYI), another ‘Magic’ stock that I analyzed recently, the return on capital is higher, but the earnings yield lower. That is fine but it shows that CDK needs more revenue growth than AYI does to justify its valuation.CDK is a software provider for automotive retailers. It provides solution for acquisition, sales, parts inventory, car financing, maintenance, accounting etc. The company spun-off from ADP (ADP) in 2014 and the stock did well initially until it reached a peak in January 2018. At the time, the company was reported to be in talks with private equity firms to be sold for a rumored $10bn. This obviously didn’t materialize and the company’s market cap is less than $5bn today.An advantage of CDK’s software is that everything is streamlined in one system. This opens up the possibility to optimize the system to maximize operational efficiency for dealers and also increases switching costs. The average client has a 20 year tenure with CDK. The company is geared towards the large dealer franchises and can count 7 out of the 10 largest US dealers among its clients. Based on a total US dealership figure of ~18,000, the market share of CDK should be close to 50% if we ignore Canada and independent used car retailers.The company operates its core Dealership Management System, or DMS unit, split into CDK North America and CDK International. The company also has a Digital Marketing Business, which is put into discontinued operations as the company is selling it. The figure below shows how the company presents itself nowadays.Source: CDK September 2019 presentation.The company publishes the number of sites that its software package is used at, as well as the average revenue per site in its two geographic segments. A table with that data starting in calendar Q1 of 2017 is shown below.Source: company data compiled by author. Table uses calendar quarters, shading indicates company fiscal years. Adjacencies represent adjacent industries such as heavy truck, agriculture and construction equipment. It looks that though the company is large outside the US and must have a sizeable market share in other developed markets based on its customer sites, it doesn’t generate a lot of revenue per site in those markets. This looks to be an opportunity as some growth in revenue per site greatly adds to the total for CDK International.Another thing that stands out is that the number of automotive sites in North America has declined in 2017 and stabilized over 2018 and 2019. That pattern is not worrisome as the number of light vehicle dealerships in the US has also stagnated over that time period.I aggregated the North American customer sites and revenue and found that the average revenue per site has gone up while the number of sites remained the same. Note that revenue per site is not a pure proxy for ‘price’ as the number and breadth of solutions offered differs per customer.Includes Automotive and adjacencies. Source: author’s own calculations. The last datapoint is (calendar) Q1 2020.Ideally we would also like to see an increase in dealerships/users/sites using CDK’s software. The company aims to grow revenue by mid single digits over the long-term. This doesn’t sound overly optimistic as it achieved a YoY revenue growth so far in the current fiscal year of 5.9% while it did 6.5% in FY19 and 3.9% in FY18. In my estimate, the organic growth was closer to 3% in FY19. For further context, the company reported 4% organic growth in Q2 (calendar Q4 of 2019). The components of the growth target are shown below.Source: September 2019 company presentation.A material opportunity is to grow its market share among independent used car retailers, which is now at less than 1%. The company has expanded its offering about one year ago with a ‘Flex’ offering for small dealers.One still undiscussed item is the competition. In my search, I have come across two main competitors: one is Dealertrack, the other Reynolds & Reynolds. From the several message boards that I have frequented to try to understand this industry, I got that R&R is most expensive, CDK is also perceived as expensive but seen as the benchmark, and Dealertrack is cheaper than CDK. Though opinions vary wildly, I observed a correlation between perceived quality (of product and service) and perceived price points.Frequent complaints about CDK’s software that I came across are that it is ‘glitchy’ and that one has to go through many screens to log a sale. In a recent earnings call, the CEO addressed the last complaint:I always find it a positive when companies recognize issues their products have and address them with actions. In this case, the company also created a COO role. Looking at the big picture, CDK has such a large market share and can afford to spend so much on development of its software, that the company should be hard to beat. Also, in this day and age, it may seem unappealing to software developers to invest in dealership applications. This has the potential to reduce competition over time.To me, it looks like CDK's DMS business is in a good place and the company has a plan going forward. One undiscussed line of business is digital marketing, a segment that the company put in discontinued operations.The digital marketing business has not been doing well lately. Its revenue plummeted and earnings were hit by a valuation allowance. This is only partly a result from the pandemic.Source: CDK 10-Q.The numbers may look awful, but perhaps the worst part is the timing of the sale after the segment has been on sale for almost a year. A final deal was struck with a private equity fund on April 21st, when it was agreed that CDK would get a $24m 10 year note receivable from a newly created entity that includes the acquired assets, plus a 15% interest in the business CDK just gave away for practically nothing. However, the market largely anticipated this and the response upon announcement of the sale was relatively modest.It is likely the industry outlook that explains much of the poor performance of the stock for this year. One important event in this context is the lowering of FY20 guidance. Though the company has a very stable subscription-based revenue model, it felt compelled to waive fees to clients for some time. There are obvious headwinds in the automotive industry, especially during the lockdowns. As data from the National Automotive Dealers Association shows, light vehicle sales are still down sharply both YTD and Year over Year.Source: NADA.The good news for CDK is that there is a difference between fleet sales and retail sales. In June, retail sales were down by just 6%, while fleet sales were down a whopping 73%. Of course, retail sales are dealership-intensive, so this is a positive for car dealers. But NADA also says that this was driven by generous manufacturer incentives. So we shouldn’t necessarily take this as a lasting V-shaped recovery.It is positive, as highlighted in a 2019 presentation, that the company is less cyclical than the end market for cars. During the global financial crisis, car sales dropped by 30%, while CDK revenues dropped only 10%. In that period the bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler also caused the close of 3,000 dealer sites.Nevertheless, the success of CDK ultimately depends on the long-term success of its customers. Good news is that the average new car dealership was still profitable for the year in May, according to data from NADA. That is despite a sharp 19% revenue decline, which was for a large part compensated for by cost cuts. Averages of relevant credit ratios have also changed relatively little since last year as shown in the same NADA report.What I find also an interesting data point is the sharp recovery in gasoline sales, despite the fact that many people work from home and are still advised to stay at home.Source: Daily Shot/Princeton Energy Advisors.I think that this is partially caused by people who shun public transport and air travel. It could well mean that car usage and sales get relative boost that lasts into next year.As in my analysis for Acuity Brands (AYI), I would like to zoom in on CDK’s cash flow generation and use. An important difference with Acuity Brands is that CDK has to top up its free cash flow with borrowings in order to cover its cash outlays. A large item for CDK has been dividends and share buybacks. Generally, it is positive that the growth strategy of the company is organic and it’s also good to see that shareholders are rewarded. On the other hand, this is a deliberate alteration of the capital structure and I believe that, though in theory it shouldn’t matter much, enterprise values are usually higher for companies with a lot of debt. In other words: this was nice for shareholders of the past, not necessarily so for shareholders of the future who must pay the full (perhaps inflated) price of the shares and bear the company’s debt.Source: author’s own calculations.However, it doesn’t seem like shareholders did very well over the past five years. CDK lost 24% while the Nasdaq US mid cap Software Index rose by a spectacular 160%. A small detractor would be the acquisition in FY19 of ELEAD1 that brought in a low amount of identifiable revenue but cost $500m, or 10% of the company’s current market cap.5-year stock chart of CDK and Nasdaq midcap Software index. Source: TradingView.For full context, starting in its FY 2015, the company spent over $2.8bn on buybacks and the market capitalization is less than $5bn today. Though the buybacks were very material, the stock suffered. It somehow reminds me of IBM (IBM), that also took on debt to give money to shareholders while its revenue stagnated. It’s perhaps a lesson that increasing leverage on the way down doesn’t work. This is also evidence that investors don’t blindly buy software, but differentiate.That said, the company doesn’t really seem to be on its way down. Its revenue, gross profit and operating income have increased every year with the exception of 2017 due to the reclassification of the marketing activities to discontinued operations. It is mostly the valuation of the stock that has been on its way down.CDK EV/EBITDA chart. Source: Seeking Alpha.A dropping EV valuation and rising debt are often a recipe for steep drops of the stock price. In this case it helped that the EBITDA of CDK has been rising.This still leaves us the question of what the company is worth. In 2018 and 2019, the company achieved a FCF of just below $400m. The current enterprise value is 7.5bn and this represents a cash flow yield of 5.3% to EV and 8% to market cap.A cash flow yield on market cap of 8% is high and given that the company has grown steadily over the years, I think that the stock is relatively cheap. I think it would be reasonable to factor in 3.5% organic revenue growth for the foreseeable future under its current cash flow profile. For a business with this stability and leverage, a 'no growth' earnings yield should be 9% in my opinion. This would be consistent with an earnings yield on EV of 6%. Subtracting 3.5% for FCF growth (note that I assume that FCF will grow as slow as revenue) would mean an FCF yield of 5.5% and would suggest a share price of $58, or 45% upside.Looking at it another way, the (retracted) guidance issued in February mentioned a midpoint EPS of $3.40, which, if we take that as a run-rate, would be a P/E of 12. Of course, we are not in that place anymore and 2020 will see a hit. However, I think that the pandemic is become beneficial to car sales over the next twelve months and this can offset the effects that are expected from a higher level of unemployment.In this market, there are very few stocks that are really cheap (barring those with existential risks), but CDK offers quality and steady growth at a very reasonable price.It looks like CDK is in an attractive software niche where it has an very strong competitive position. This is evidenced by its attractive return on capital, high and stable market share and its ability to increase revenue, gross profit and operating profit every year whereby the last metric shows the strongest growth over a 10-year period.The stock seems reasonably valued and it looks like the company, as well as its customers, will weather the epidemic quite well. This is a typical Magic Formula stock in so far we have a strong but reasonably cheaply valued company that has recently suffered a setback in its growth outlook. This is certainly an interesting stock for many quality and value oriented investors."

The firm provides software for car dealerships and has a market cap of $7bn.Since the spin-off, its share price has performed well, rising 55% to a peak in June 2015. Since then, shares have given back 20%. Despite the decline, valuations still appears stretched, trading at a trailing P/E of 32x and 17x EV/EBITA.CDK Total Return Price data by YChartsWho Is Involved?Despite the high valuations, activist hedge funds appear to like CDK and have piled into the name.Three activist hedge funds collectively own 20% of CDK as at September 30, 2015, which is by no means a small amount. The ownership split was 8% (Sachem Head Capital), 7% (Fir Tree Inc.) and 5% (Elliott). The trio have held the shares for some time.Both Sachem Head and Fir Tree were early investors in CDK since 2014. According to our estimates, they have established their positions in the low $30s, which implies a ~20% annualized return on this investment to date. On the other hand, Elliott joined the party late, having averaged into the stock at much higher prices of ~$48, which is higher than last Friday's close.All of this point to something interesting. Despite having achieved nice IRRs for their investment, Sachem Head and Fir Tree are still firmly parked in CDK with no signs of major stake disposals. This point to the possibility of more returns to come, such as through operational improvements or a sale. The late arrival of Elliott also point to possible further upside, as the manager has probably not made money on this investment. The manager is well known to take on software companies, as highlighted in our previous article.What Do We Know So Far?September last year marked the first anniversary of the spin-off, which means tax implications for a sale would have eased. Indeed, this seemed to have coincided with news surfacing in August 2015 of a possible sale:Shares spiked initially in August and September 2015, but have since then declined with the broader market despite plans of capital return.CDK data by YChartsNews flow since December have been limited. CDK reported its earnings last week on Feb 3, and there were no update on the sale process on the earnings call.Summary ThoughtsIs No News Good News? We may soon find out. It has been 266 days since Elliott Management first filed its 13-D, a time frame that is nearing the end of typical Elliott activist campaigns. Additionally, recent share price declines may have just made the company slightly easier to absorb, although still by no means easy to finance.That said, 13-Fs filings are due next week and should provide investors an update on the hedge funds' ownership. No change in stakes should be reassuring, although any material stake disposal by any manager would be a bad sign."

ADP shareholders received 1 share of CDK Global for every three shares of ADP they owned. As part of the spin-off, ADP does not retain any ownership of CDK Global.CDK Global provides information technology and digital marketing support to the retail automotive industry. CDK Global generates revenues through sales of software applications and software licenses to auto dealerships, used car dealers, heavy equipment dealers, auto repair shops, and vehicle manufacturers. The company has over 27,000 clients in more than 100 countries.CDK Global's applications are either installed on-site at the client's location or available via a CDK-managed cloud based service. The applications are designed to assist clients with their standard accounting procedures and marketing processes, but are tailored to the retail automobile market. This means that the company's applications help track service orders, the ordering of OEM and aftermarket auto parts, vehicle inventory, and auto lot management. CDK Global also owns the Cobalt brand of digital marketing and advertising solutions, which helps maintain client websites, and build e-mail and social media marketing programs. In addition to being sold directly to dealerships, Cobalt products are marketed to dealers through arrangements with 10 leading auto manufacturers.According to CDK Global's website, the company had fiscal year 2014 (ended June 30, 2014) revenues of $1.97 billion, up 7.3% from FY 2013. Nearly two-thirds of CDK's revenue was from the North American retail automobile market, with 17% of total revenue coming from the overseas retail automobile market. The remaining 19% of revenue came from digital marketing sales and services.2014 operating income increased 9.5% to $343.4 million and earnings per share was up 14.5% to $1.42. With an annualized payout of 48 cents, the company's dividend payout is 34%. The increase in revenues and income was due to both increased sales from within CDK Global's client base, along with an improving vehicle market.Going forward, CDK Global expects to deliver annual revenue growth of between 4%-5% and to allocate between 70%-80% of its free cash flow to dividends and share repurchases. Given the inherited dividend history, the projected increase in revenues and the intent to allocate free cash flow to dividends, I expect CDK to increase dividends at least annually.The company is a member of the S&P Mid Cap 400 index and S&P's High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index, and trades under the ticker symbol CDK.CDK Global's Dividend and Stock Split HistoryCDK Global has been in operation as a separate company for less than a year and, as such, has not established a dividend growth record on its own. The company has paid three quarters of dividends, each of which have been 12 cents per share.By Standard & Poor's methodology, companies that are spun off from Dividend Aristocrats and High Yield Dividend Aristocrats retain the dividend growth characteristics of their parent company. As long as CDK begins and continues to increase dividends annually, it will remain part of the High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index.CDK Global has not split its stock since the spin-off from ADP (NASDAQ:ADP).Investors received 1 share of CDK for every three shares of ADP owned in late September 2014. From December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2014, their investment in ADP grew at an average annual rate of 24.34%, assuming that the CDK shares were not sold.CDK Global's Direct Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment PlansLike ADP, CDK Global does not have a direct purchase or a dividend reinvestment plan. In order to invest in CDK Global stock, you'll need to purchase it through a broker. Most brokers will allow you to reinvest dividends without any fee.

3212836,68315,2015-05-26T19:13:21-04:00,"CDK has delivered huge returns since the company was spun off by ADP.CDK has good fundamentals and grows at a double-digit pace.CDK's valuation is stretched - it doesn't seem opportune to enter a position in CDK at today's price.Despite its recent IPO, CDK has already started to pay a dividend.","CDK Global (NASDAQ:CDK) is an automotive (dealership) software producer which was spun off by Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) last fall. CDK has a market capitalization of $8.7 billion and employs 9,000 people.CDK's offerings include software for retail automotive dealerships (CDK's main source of revenues) and (what the company calls) digital marketing solutions for car dealerships (e.g. web development and hosting, ad placement).CDK Total Return Price data by YChartsInvestors who held CDK's shares from the company's IPO have seen total returns of 76% over the last seven months, an impressive performance for sure.CDK's fundamentals look good and demand a premium valuation:The company's revenues in the last 12 months was $2.1 billion, and net earnings over the same time were $190 million. CDK's GAAP EPS for the last 12 months were $1.17.In the first (calendar) quarter of 2015 CDK saw revenues climb five percent to $526 million, and adjusted net income climbed 16% to $57 million. CDK's adjusted net earnings per share came in at $0.35 in the most recent quarter.CDK reports high margins on its sales, and the company has a gross margin of 39 percent and an operating margin of 18 percent. CDK's returns on capital look good as well: The company's return on assets is nine percent, return on equity was 23 percent in the last 12 months. This bodes well for CDK's future since high ROE businesses (such as CDK) tend to perform better than the broad market.CDK's balance sheet reveals some leverage: The company has a debt/equity ratio of 1.32, but with ample liquidity (current ratio of 1.90) this is nothing investors should worry about.Despite the fact that CDK is very young, the company has already started to return cash to shareholders in two ways:CDK started paying a dividend in November, the quarterly dividend of $0.12 equals a dividend yield of 0.9% at today's price. This alone is nothing to get too excited about, but the quick pickup of dividend payments after the separation of ADP shows that CDK's management is keen on letting shareholders participate. Since CDK's former parent company has a long history of regular dividend increases, it seems likely that CDK will take the same route and start increasing its dividend continuously over the years (think Philip Morris' dividend history after its separation from Altria).CDK also buys back its own common stock in the last quarter the company repurchased 690,000 shares. When we extrapolate this for the full year, we get an annualized repurchase rate of two percent of the company's outstanding shares.CDK's growth outlook is good. The company reported revenue and earnings growth in all segments in the last quarter: Automotive retail revenues in North America grew 8%, pretax earnings grew 12%.International automotive retail revenues grew three percent and pretax earnings grew four percent. International growth would have been higher when adjusting for the strong dollar, which negatively affected CDK's international results.Digital marketing revenues grew eleven percent in the last quarter, pretax earnings almost doubled over the same time.As CDK was able to grow revenues in all segments, and raise margins in each segment as well (which was based on operational improvements), it looks as if the growth story is not over for CDK, despite the negative effect the strong dollar had on the company's results.FY 2015 results (which include the last three quarters and the current April-June quarter) are forecasted to bring in revenues of $2.08 billion (+5 percent), adjusted net income of $227 (+ 15 percent) million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.40 (+15 percent).CDK is valued at 46 times trailing earnings right now, a rather lofty valuation in comparison to the broad market's 20.8 times earnings multiple. A company which grows earnings at a double-digit pace deserves a premium valuation (at least that's what I think), but more than twice the market average seems to be too much.When we look at the company's forward earnings multiple, we see that CDK is valued at 35 times 2016 (expected) earnings per share of $1.56. Although this number is a lot smaller than CDK's trailing PE ratio, this still represents a huge premium to the broad market's valuation at today's share price.I thus would not enter a position in CDK right now, as it seems rather risky and there's a huge chance investors could see a lower entry point in the future. Anyone still willing to enter CDK despite its immense run in the last months should have a long-term horizon since the stock could head lower in the near future. In the long term I'm bullish on CDK as the company has good fundamentals and keeps growing. The shareholder-friendly management is a plus as well."
2945406,74955,2015-02-24T14:22:58-05:00,"CDK Global (CDK) is a gem of a business that operates in a niche of the software industry known as Dealership Management System (DMS) software.CDK’s business benefits from durable competitive advantages that include recurring revenue stream with long term contracts, resiliency to recession, high switching costs, slow industry life cycles and high operating leverage.Key risks to the business include historical auto industry cyclicality, relatively low margins of the Digital Marketing Solutions segment, fragmentation of DMS providers and recent consolidation of franchised dealership groups.Recent purchase activity by funds Sachem Head Capital Management and Fir Tree Partners has driven up CDK’s stock price significantly and it no longer trades at a discount.Based on a DCF that assumes margin improvement, I value the company at ~$42/share versus a current share price of ~$46/share. I would wait for a more attractive entry point.","BackgroundIn an earlier post a few months ago (this post is way overdue) on Scuttlebutt Investor, I talked about digging deeper into a spin-off opportunity. From a field of several recent spin-off announcements, I decided that CDK Global (NASDAQ:CDK) was the most compelling opportunity.CDK creates software for the automotive dealership industry and was spun off from ADP (which focuses primarily on HR outsourcing and staffing) on October 1st. Well, a lot can happen in a few months and it has - two large hedge funds have taken sizable positions in the company since I first discussed CDK back in October. Sachem Head Capital Management (known to have an activist bent) now owns ~9.8% of the company and Fir Tree Partners (a value investing focused shop) now owns ~8.7% of the company for a combined ownership stake of ~18.5% between the two funds. The buying activity of these funds has driven the price of the stock up significantly over the last few months, but that shouldn't stop us from analyzing this opportunity in the traditional Scuttlebutt Way.Business OverviewCDK plays in a space that is relatively unknown (usually great hunting grounds for underpriced investments). It operates in a niche of the enterprise software industry that I like very much as a risk averse value investor. At its core, CDK provides operating software to retail automotive dealerships (think your local Smith Toyota dealership). The software often referred to as Dealer Management System (NYSE:DMS) software can be likened to the central nervous system of an automotive dealership. CDK's software automates and integrates all the critical workflow processes that happen at an auto dealership including advertising, sales, financing, insurance, parts and repair and maintenance of vehicles. The business is organized into three segments but I analyze the business primarily as two segments because two of the segments provide nearly the same solution but to different geographic markets.CDK generates revenue from two key businesses: 1) Selling the aforementioned DMS software to dealerships in North America and International markets; 2) Selling marketing solutions (web development, hosting and ad placement) to dealerships. For reporting purposes, CDK reports the North America DMS and International DMS businesses separately but I will discuss them together here.Source: Data from CDK Amended Form 10 (Filed 9/18/14)Automotive Retail Solutions ($1.6bn or ~80% of revenue) - North America and InternationalAutomotive Retail Solutions focuses primarily on mission-critical Dealer Management System (DMS) software that helps franchised automotive dealerships manage every component of their businesses from sales and inventory to maintenance and parts. CDK's primary DMS platforms for dealerships are called CDK Dash and CDK Drive and are sold both in North America and in International markets. While both North America and International markets offer similar DMS solutions, they are organized as two separate reportable segments due to geographical focus. CDK provides solutions to approximately 26,000 retail locations and most Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs or car manufacturers like Toyota, Ford, etc.) worldwide. In North America specifically, CDK serves about 8,400 auto retail locations, which equates to about 40% market share. Furthermore, in the US, CDK's clients include 7 of the top 10 largest automotive retailer groups.More specifically, the automotive retail software solutions that are provided by CDK include: Dealer Management System (DMS): In many cases, the DMS encompasses many standalone features such as Customer Relationship Management, Financial Management, Vehicle Sales Management, Fixed Operations Management, Document Management, Network Management, Data Management and Business IntelligenceDigital Marketing Solutions ($370mm or ~20% of revenue)The Digital Marketing Solutions segment is largely built on top of the acquisition of Cobalt in 2010. The segment provides solutions to drive and manage demand. More specifically, it helps automotive dealers manage their advertising spend and their websites. In this part of the business, endorsements from the OEMs are critical and CDK has endorsements from 10 of the major car brands. While digital marketing solution software is not as mission-critical to the operations of a dealership as dealership management software, it does play an important purpose if you understand the modern car buyers' path to purchase. Approximately 94% of car buyers research online before they buy a car. Thus, it is essential that automotive dealerships advertise on online platforms where prospective car buyers are doing their research.A little more than half of the Digital Marketing revenue is generated helping OEMs and dealerships to manage their digital ad spend with the remaining coming from website management.Think of the advertising side of the business as a large media buying agency that buys and places digital ads for dealerships. CDK has a proprietary advertising technology platform that dynamically adjusts content and spend across multiple digital marketing channels. CDK is one of the largest purchasers of automotive retail advertising inventory. That scale enables them to leverage strong relationships with the likes of Amazon, Edmunds, Google and Yahoo.The website business provides solutions and helps manage approximately 7,800 websites for retail dealerships. From an OEM perspective, it is important that all dealerships use similar layout and thematic for their websites because they want to convey brand consistency to the end consumer whether they are browsing at Fremont Chevrolet or Berkeley Chevrolet. Thus, in many cases, the OEM exerts control over or ""gently"" recommends the software that dealerships need to use to manage their websites.Source: CDK Roadshow PresentationIndustry LandscapeCompetitionSource: CDK Roadshow PresentationFor an industry that seems to fly under the radar, CDK surprisingly has many competitors. So many competitors that the industry seems fragmented and ripe for consolidation. More on that later. In the meantime, let's delve a bit deeper into the competitive landscape. There are competitors in every aspect of the retail automotive industry that focus on specific workflows such as inventory management or parts and service but there are also comprehensive solution providers that provide an end to end to Dealer Management System similar to CDK. For our purposes, we'll focus primarily on the latter. The chart above from the CDK Roadshow Presentation provides the primary competitors in the DMS space.Reynolds and Reynolds (R&R) is one of the largest competitors to CDK. In fact, R&R and CDK were for the longest time seen as a duopoly in the domestic DMS provider market. While they both have dominant market share in the US, a duopoly isn't necessarily the case anymore, especially given the growth in International markets. R&R's primary offering is its Dealer Management System called Retail Management System that, similar to CDK, is a complete dealer management system. R&R also has a secondary forms business that provides printed forms used in every day dealers operations.R&R is a private company run and primarily owned by Bob Brockman who started Universal Computer Systems and subsequently acquired Reynolds & Reynolds in 2006. Vista Equity Partners and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners were equity investors in this deal but Vista has since exited this investment as of December 2014. R&R is privately owned and public information is difficult to come by but there are some rating agency reports that discuss the business. The information that is available is a good case study as to how much margin improvement can be driven through a DMS business given that PE companies are known to wring out every cost efficiency possible when they acquire a business. In the case of R&R, the business generates operating margins in the low to mid 40% area. This compares to ~28% for CDK's North America Auto Retail Solutions business, which indicates that CDK may have some room for improvement when it comes to expense management and driving efficiencies in the business. That doesn't mean that CDK can get to a ~40% operating margin but they may be able to get part of the way there and thereby drive a tremendous amount of incremental value.DealerTrack Technologies (NASDAQ:TRAK) is the only publicly traded competitor. TRAK offers a similar breadth of solutions to CDK including a Dealer Management Software Suite and also a dealer marketing solutions platform through Dealer.com (acquired Dec 2013). The Company has experienced strong revenue growth through both organic growth as well as a multitude of acquisitions. TRAK provides services to ~20,700 dealer customers, but the install base of DMS customers (which is what I primarily care about) is unclear from public filings. From a revenue perspective, TRAK is about a fourth the size of CDK. However, TRAK's revenue mix differs significantly from CDK in that TRAK generates a large portion of its revenue from its transaction fee based services such as lending and registration/titling. Approximately 58% of TRAK's revenue is derived from per transaction-based services and only about 38% of revenue is derived from subscription-based software. Thus the business model is not as preferable as CDK, given that transaction based revenue is far more susceptible to cyclical swings in consumer car purchases while subscription revenue is typically contracted over several years. We will discuss the revenue model at more length in the Revenue Model section.Autosoft is a smaller player (which I believe is family owned) that has gained some share from the bigger players by being very competitive on price. Flex DMS is the company's DMS offering that is used by approximately 2,000 dealerships in North America. This equates to approximately a 10% share. Similar to R&R, the company also has a forms business that provides printed forms that dealers use everyday.Auto/Mate is also a smaller player that provides a DMS solution to approximately 1,150 dealerships in the US. Similar to Autosoft, Auto/Mate also competes aggressively on price. More recently the company's software has been fully configured to communicate seamlessly with Nissan. I wouldn't be surprised to see other OEMs allowing integration with Auto/Mate's DMS as it provides a less expensive alternative to their franchised dealers versus CDK or R&R. Auto/Mate is owned by a private investor.Incadea is a company based in Germany that competes primarily in international markets. The company was once owned by R&R but was spun off into an independent company in 2007. Incadea has experienced strong revenue growth over the last several years driven partly by acquisitions and partly by strong organic revenue growth in emerging markets. Incadea provides software and services to ~2,400 dealerships worldwide, but it does not compete in the US market. In January 2015, DealerTrack acquired Incadea. The news is so recent that I am still discussing Incadea separately here.Major Industry TrendsHistorically, OEMs only allowed communication and integration with a select few larger DMS systems (typically the industry heavyweights- R&R and CDK), but more recently, some large OEMs have broadened the number of DMS solutions that their franchised dealerships can integrate and interoperate with. In other words, the OEMs have allowed the DMS of other smaller players (e.g. Autosoft) to ""talk"" to their corporate headquarters and factories to ensure that things like parts, sales and accounting data can be exchanged in real time. The additional options are expected to create more competition among DMS providers and drive down pricing for dealers.In direct contradiction to the trend noted above, some OEMs (e.g. BMW) are doing exactly the opposite of broadening the DMS' that they integrate with - they are implementing global initiatives to standardize their DMS systems (which are currently fragmented on a worldwide basis- meaning that dealerships around the world are all using different DMS providers). In the case of BMW, they are standardizing to two systems - incadea (now DealerTrack) and CDK.Both of the aforementioned trends seem contradictory and the reality is that different OEMs are approaching their DMS strategies differently. However, as the undisputed largest player in the industry, both of these trends could actually benefit CDK. In the case of standardization, CDK (as the largest player) will continue to be one of the approved DMS systems and in the case of newer players entering the approved systems lists, CDK will continue to play a major role given the high switching costs inherent with changing to a different DMS provider.The great recession and resulting OEM bankruptcies have resulted in significant dealership consolidation and closures in the US. US franchised dealerships have declined from about 21,000 in 2008 to about 17,600 in 2013. The industry consolidation has presented both an opportunity and a risk. Dealerships that have a common owner have a desire to run all of their locations on a common platform and have shifted their business to a single DMS solution.The great recession also had some unintended positive effects on the industry. While it resulted in significant dealership closures, it also helped improve industry pricing and profitability by reducing dealership competition.Auto dealerships are one of the largest print (e.g. newspapers) advertisers. The continuing shift from print to digital advertising will benefit players that have a digital marketing business like CDK and DealerTrack.Revenue ModelLet's think about the revenue model as it relates to the different business segmentsSource: CDK Roadshow PresentationThe 'Automotive Retail North America' and 'Automotive Retail International' segments comprise approximately 80% of total company revenue and are very similar in terms of revenue composition. Both segments make money by selling (licensing) DMS software to dealerships. CDK receives monthly subscription fees from customers for software licenses, ongoing software support and maintenance of Dealership Management Systems. Revenue generated by the Automotive Retail segments is highly attractive as it demonstrates the characteristics that any prospective investor loves to see in a business: revenue is reliable (contractual), recurring (subscription based) and visible (can be forecasted in the future with predictability). These are revenue characteristics that are present in many software businesses and partly why this investor loves software businesses (I have said that I don't like businesses that are on the cutting edge of technology here, but CDK is anything but cutting edge. CDK is boring technology and that is a wonderful thing. We will discuss why shortly). Retail dealership clients typically sign long term contracts of several years and pay monthly subscription fees to license the DMS software. Thus, the next month's revenue or next year's revenue is not dependent on making the next sale, but rather it is already contracted. This makes it much easier for the CFO to forecast revenue and thus plan for the business. It also provides tremendous comfort as a potential investor. Furthermore, CDK contends that it has a diverse client base with high client retention rates (they don't however provide the data behind the retention rates).Despite all the similarities, there are a few key differences in the revenue models of the International and North America segments:The North America Automotive Retail Segment also generates revenue from transaction fees for processing credit reports, vehicle registrations and internet leads for automotive retailers, primarily in the US. While public filings do not break out the transaction revenue from the subscription revenue, I am led to believe that the transaction-based revenue is much smaller component of the revenue. The International segment does not generate revenue from transaction-based sources. Side note: Transaction revenue is not as desirable as subscription revenue. Transaction revenue lacks all of the characteristics that we love about revenue - it is not recurring, not reliable and not visible. Furthermore, transaction revenue is much more susceptible to cyclicality inherent in the automotive industry. In other words, when consumers don't buy cars, you don't make money. This investor prefers to make money whether or not consumers buy cars.The tenor of DMS contracts in North America is typically longer than in International markets. The average contract length in North America is ~5 years versus shorter contract lengths of ~3 years in International markets. This may just be a result of competitive dynamics in international markets versus domestic markets. While 3 years isn't as good as 5 years, we will still take a revenue stream contracted for 3 years any day and twice on Sunday. The figure below highlights the typical contract terms for each segment.Pricing appears to be much lower in International markets. Average Monthly Revenue per Client ranges from ~1,000 to $15,000 in North America versus an average of ~$2,000 in International markets. This may also be a result of competitive dynamics in those markets. Thus, while some of the international markets are growing way faster than the US market, they are likely not as profitable as the US/North American market.'Digital Marketing' segment revenue consists of two component revenue streams.A little more than half of the revenue is generated by the digital advertising business. This segment has experienced strong revenue growth over the last several years as dealerships shift more of their advertising spend online. CDK receives revenue for placement of automotive retail advertising - likely a small percentage of the advertising dollars that are placed. This revenue stream, however, is not subscription based and is highly susceptible to economic cycles. Typically, during times of economic weakness, companies (especially dealerships) reduce or completely eliminate their advertising spending as consumers begin to curtail purchases (especially large purchases like automobiles).A little less than half of the Digital Marketing revenue is generated by website management for retail automotive dealerships. Dealerships sign contracts to outsource their website management, maintenance and hosting to CDK. In return, CDK receives monthly recurring fees. These revenues are typically contracted with contract lengths in the range of 1-3 years. While contracted, these revenues are not as highly prized as the DMS revenues, because they don't benefit from the high switching costs that the DMS revenues do. In other words, a dealership is much more willing to switch its website management provider versus switch the mission-critical software that runs its entire operation.Only 80% of the revenue stream (the DMS portion) is recurring/contracted and visible- not 100% a skeptic might say, but this is a good thing. A revenue stream that is 100% contracted would be able to provide very little upside in a stellar economy. The 20% or so of the revenue stream that is more cyclical can help drive upside during good economic times supported by the stability of the 80% of revenue stream that is contracted and recurring. I couldn't build a better revenue stream if I tried.Financial performanceSource: Data from CDK Amended Form 10 (Filed 9/18/14)CDK has demonstrated strong revenue growth over the last several years. From 2010 through 2014, revenue grew at a 12.4% CAGR. The composition of this growth is a combination of organic growth and acquisitions.For the year ending 6/30/14, CDK revenue was $1,974, 7.3% versus the year ending 6/30/13. The overall revenue growth was driven by 5% growth in the Auto Retail Solutions North America segment, 3% growth in the Auto Retail Solutions International segment and 20% growth in the Digital Marketing Solutions segment. Further analysis reveals that the key drivers of revenue growth for all the segments are generally healthy.Auto Retail Solutions North America segment growth of 5% was driven by both pricing and volume. DMS client sites grew 3% to 13,600 sites and Average Revenue Per DMS client (often referred to as ARPU in other industries) grew 5% driven by a combination of increased sales to existing customers, growth in transaction based revenue and higher pricing.Auto Retail Solutions International segment growth of 3% was driven primarily by increased sales or expanded solutions to existing customers (not new client sites). We will need to continue to evaluate this segment's ability to increase client sites among what may be a more competitive dynamic in international markets.Digital Marketing Solutions segment has experienced particularly strong growth over the last few years. The segment has benefited from the website revenue growth in addition to a secular shift of dealership advertising from offline mediums (i.e. newspapers) to the internet. Segment revenue growth of 20% for the year ending 6/30/14 was driven by an 18% in Average Monthly Revenue per Website and a 26% increase in OEM advertising.Total company operating margins have increased consistently from 14.4% in 2011 to nearly 18% in 2014 driven primarily by increased operational efficiency and operating scale - a dynamic I expect to continue as CDK grows the topline. It is worth pointing out, however, that segment margins differ dramatically from one another. For the year ending 6/30/14, Auto Retail North America operating margin = ~28%, Auto Retail International operating margin = ~14% and Digital Marketing Solutions operating margin = 7%. I believe that the competitive dynamics and geographic dynamic between the segments drive the variance in the segment margins. North America DMS is likely less price competitive than international markets. And Digital Marketing Solutions is a drastically different business where the value added is clearly not enough to justify the robust margins that the DMS business delivers.I believe that there is room for improvement in all the segments, especially DMS. CDK's primary competitor, Reynolds & Reynolds (R&R) generates operating margins in the neighborhood of 40%. While it is known that R&R makes trade offs in customer service and technology to generate margins this high, there is a realistic opportunity for CDK to meaningfully increase margins while maintaining high quality service levels, even if they can't get to R&R margin levels. The DCF which is discussed in the valuation section assumes continuous margin improvement driven by both operational efficiency and operating leverage over the long term (10 years).Investment Merits and RisksNow that we have covered the business model and the industry landscape, let's get to my favorite section. What I like about CDK's business (investment merits) and what concerns me (investment risks). A graphical interpretation will serve us well here.The small circles in the illustration below are the key facets of the moat that protects CDK's business and provide it with a competitive advantage. The arrows are the forces, risks and industry trends that are attempting to pierce that moat. We will walk through each circle and arrow in some more depth because they are the crux of the investment thesis in CDK.Source: Scuttlebutt Investor Research and AnalysisInvestment Merits (circles in chart above)Stable and highly recurring subscription revenueAs previously discussed, CDK's revenue stream is very attractive because the lionshare (80%) of the revenue stream (the Automotive Retail business) demonstrates the characteristics that any prospective investor loves to see in a business: revenue is reliable (contractual), recurring (subscription based) and visible (can be forecasted with predictability). Much of the revenue is governed by long-term contracts with defined pricing per month. The Roadshow presentation excerpt in the Revenue Model section above shows how contract terms differ between the three segments.Mission-critical softwareDMS software is mission-critical software that runs all the operations of an entire dealership so it can't just be turned off to save money during lean economic times when consumers are buying less cars. During the global economic downturn, CDK's North America revenue (excluding acquisitions) declined 4% between 2009 and 2010 even while US car sales volume declined 21% during the same period. DMS software is a cost of entry and a must have for every franchised automotive dealership. Thus, despite historical auto industry cyclicality, CDK has been very resilient.High switching costsThere are many DMS providers out there. What's to stop a CDK customer from switching to a competitor provider like R&R and DealerTrack? High switching costs provide natural barrier to switching. New DMS systems require upfront installation costs and implementation costs in addition to a time investment required to train all the departments within the organization to use new DMS software. Thus, once a dealership implements DMS software and trains their staff, they are not likely to change the software. The time and financial costs of switching are too high. Now this doesn't mean that dealerships never switch. They do sometimes switch, but it is less likely. CDK's high renewal rates (as cited by the company) over the last several years support this point.Scalable software businessSimilar to other software businesses, CDK's DMS business (which comprises the lion share of revenue) is highly scalable and benefits from high operating leverage. In other words, the expense and capital investment in creating and updating the software is largely fixed and can be leveraged across nearly all of CDK's customers. As CDK's customer base and in turn revenue grows, the expenses and capital expenditures do not grow at the same pace given that they are largely fixed. This leads to higher margins, as the company grows bigger. CDK has demonstrated this operating leverage and scalability as operating margins have increased from 15.5% in 2010 to nearly 18% in 2014.Major OEM integrationWhile the role that this phenomenon plays in the DMS software space seems to be diminishing, OEM approval still provides a competitive advantage to CDK worth discussing. As discussed previously, some OEM software systems only allow communication and integration with a select few larger DMS systems (typically the industry heavyweights- R&R and CDK). This dynamic may be evolving a bit but the entire industry has not changed over. Furthermore, some OEMs (e.g. BMW) are implementing global initiatives to standardize their DMS systems (which are currently fragmented on a worldwide basis- meaning that dealerships around the world are all using different DMS providers). In the case of a limited set of choices, CDK will almost always be one of the limited options that OEMs approve given that it is the leading DMS provider and an understandable reluctance to test, certify and frequently update several different DMS systems. From a dealership perspective, it benefits the dealership to choose a DMS provider that is certified or approved by the OEM so that the respective systems can communicate important information like vehicle inventory and sales data to each other.Slow pace of enterprise technologyIf you know me and have read some of my other articles, you know that I don't like technology companies. But let's get a bit more specific, because it's not technology stocks that I don't like. It is companies that are on the cutting edge of technology or making a bold bet on the adoption of new technology. It is too unpredictable. This is often the case with new consumer technologies. Let's leave that to the venture capitalists. Enterprise technology, however, is very different from consumer technology. At Scuttlebutt we love enterprise technology because it is boring and boy oh boy do we love boring. Enterprise technology companies make for good investments for a few key reasons:Unlike consumer technology, enterprise technology life cycles are long and slow. Enterprises aren't looking for the disruption caused by frequently changing out their software system. They also aren't necessarily looking for the hottest new technology. They just need good, reliable software to manage their businesses with the occasional updates. They want to keep their software for at least 5-7 years as long as the price is fair and reasonable. If you want evidence of this, take a look at Microsoft Windows XP. You still have businesses that use Windows XP more than 12 years after it launched in 2002 because it is simple, cheap and it works for their needs. It is only within the last year that Microsoft dropped support for Windows XP.Switching costs are often even more pronounced when it comes to enterprise technology. The costs to the enterprise of switching technology include upfront installation costs, costs to train employees on new software, losses in productivity as a result of unfamiliarity with the new software, potential loss of historical data or customer records and general friction inherent with any change.Dominant market share of existing players in a niche industryWhile the addressable market across the entire value chain is about $40bn, the retail auto dealership software space is relatively niche versus other larger verticals in the software industry like databases (think Oracle, Salesforce.com) for example. Niche implies that the software is highly customized for a specific use case. And the existing players like CDK and R&R have already established strong market positions. While there are also several other smaller competitors in the space, we're not likely to see many new competitors enter the space. The niche nature of the retail auto dealership space combined with the dominant market positions of the existing players keeps potential competitors at bay and provides an enduring barrier to entry.Lower oil prices (not a circle in the graphic above)Lower oil prices are typically a boon for car sales and I don't see the recent decline in oil prices as any different. I do, however, view the decline as a more temporary performance driver and thus do not include it as one of the components of the moat above. Lower oil prices drive more car sales and thus benefit the dealerships. This is a positive for transaction-based revenue, but also DMS revenue. When dealers are doing well and flush with cash, they are more willing to pay for their DMS systems.Investment Risks and Considerations (arrows in chart)Auto industry sales have historically experienced tremendous cyclicality.The economy in general is very cyclical. Every 5 to 10 years or so there is a boom that is then followed by a bust. This is the nature of the beast and nothing can be done about it. During busts or downturns in the economy, larger discretionary purchases (think that new television or new computer) are the first to be curtailed as consumers skimp and save. Cars are a very big purchase and are no exception to this general reduction in spending. In fact, during the most recent economic recession, new vehicle sales declined by 18% in 2008 and a further 21% in 2009 and still have not recovered to pre-recession levels. See chart below. Remember ""Cash for Clunkers""? That was a program devised partly to help struggling auto companies and auto dealerships sell more cars in 2009.It's apparent that car purchases are very cyclical and thus would naturally follow that this would have a big impact on companies that provide software to automotive companies or dealerships. While you wouldn't be crazy to follow that logical path, you would be wrong. DMS software is mission-critical software that the dealership needs to run whether they sell a thousand cars or just a few cars. It's not software that can just be turned off to save money when times are tough. The numbers prove this out (I'll rehash a point I made earlier in the 'Investment Merits' section). During the economic downturn CDK's North American revenue declined by only 4% (2009 to 2010 excluding acquisitions) while US car sales volume declined by 21% during the same period. The modest decline was likely driven by a decline in some of the transaction based revenue (transaction revenue comprises a small portion of overall CDK revenue) as well as some DMS contracts that renewed around that time with some likely price concessions granted by CDK to their struggling dealership customers.Source: Data from National Automobile Dealers Association data, NADA.orgLow Margins of Digital Marketing Solutions: The Digital Marketing Solutions division is high growth but low marginThe Digital Marketing Solutions division grew at a 19% CAGR from 2012 to 2014. The division is experiencing tremendous growth driven by two key phenomenon: 1) Dealership advertising levels have recovered tremendously since the depths of the recession and continue to grow in tandem with new car sales. Franchised car dealerships spent a total of $7.6bn in advertising in 2013, up 6.1% from $7.2bn in 2012. This compares to approximately $5.4bn in 2009 during the depth of the recession. Dealer ad dollars are expected to continue to grow for the next few years in lockstep with new car sales (although the ad spend per new unit sold may stay relatively flat). 2) Dealership customers are shifting a greater proportion of their advertising spend to online channels, which is where CDK operates. Internet advertising is taking share from other mediums like newspapers and radio. In 2006, Internet advertising represented 12% of total ad spend and newspapers represented 27% of total ad spend. Since then, the tables have completely turned. Internet is now the number one medium used by dealerships, comprising ~33% of total ad spend (even bigger than TV which is ~21% of total ad spend), while newspapers now represent 16%. See graphs below. In an economic downturn, it is very likely that levels of internet advertising could stay flat or even continue to increase as dealerships continue to shift spend from old media channels like newspapers and radio to the internet despite an overall decline in ad spend. Thus, I believe that growth won't be an issue for this segment.Source: Data from National Automobile Dealers Association data, NADA.orgSource: Data from National Automobile Dealers Association data, NADA.orgSource: Data from National Automobile Dealers Association data, NADA.orgThe lower margins of the Digital Marketing Solutions segment concern me somewhat. Digital Marketing Solutions EBIT margins were 7% in the latest period (FY 2014), which is down from 9% in 2013. Low margins frequently suggest that a segment is either highly competitive or low value add. Low margins also provide less cushion during economic downturns. The Digital Marketing Solutions segment is by its very nature, the segment that is most susceptible to industry and general economic cycles. According to the Form 10, the margin decline in 2014 was driven by both expenditures to support new contract rollout (admittedly I don't know what this means but I think it is related to website management) and higher advertising costs. High advertising costs is a bit surprising because I would have thought that there would be more scale in this business as revenue grew $63mm in the same period. The majority of the revenue increase was driven by an increase in website management revenue. In summary, I think there is more to learn about the economics of this segment. I know that it is cyclical but I do not quite understand what is driving margins and how scalable this portion of the business is. I am comforted somewhat by the fact this is a smaller part of the business (<20% of revenue) and that it accelerates financial performance during times of economic boom.The Auto dealership software industry is much more fragmented than one would thinkAs previously discussed, there are a few large players: CDK Global, Dealertrack and Reynolds & Reynolds are the 800-pound gorillas. But there are also a bunch of smaller players that include Auto/Soft, AutoMate, Incadea, Dominion Dealer Solutions and a few others. Incadea operates primarily in international markets and Dealertrack recently acquired Incadea, making DealerTrack an even larger competitor. Fragmentation represents both a risk and an opportunity.A fragmented competitive landscape is a risk because the persistence and entrance of smaller players drives down industry pricing. These smaller players usually gain market share by offering lower pricing than their larger rivals. For example, a DMS system from a provider like Auto/Mate can cost several thousand dollars less per month than a comparable system from CDK or R&R. While CDK and R&R still dominate, money talks and lower pricing from these rivals can impact their pricing and ultimately operating margins. However, fragmentation is an opportunity here as well. Fragmented industries are often ripe for consolidation. Increasing consolidation can help sustain or drive pricing as smaller competitors that hurt overall pricing are acquired by larger players. We're starting to see some evidence of this with the recent news regarding DealerTrack and Incadea. Additional consolidation is good for CDK, especially if they are one of the acquirers. Note however, that I don't expect CDK to be acquired or make a transformative acquisition in the next 2 years because this would likely trigger tax consequences that alter the tax- free spin from ADP.Increasing consolidation of franchised dealership groups drives DMS pricing downAs of early 2013, there were 17,600 franchised dealership groups and 37,000 used vehicle dealerships in the US. The downturn has driven consolidation of dealerships but there is still a tremendous amount of fragmentation. Over the last several years, we have begun to see ever larger dealership groups form and buy out smaller dealership groups. Some of these are Lithia Motors (NYSE:LAD), AutoNation (NYSE:AN) and Penske (NYSE:PAG)). Even Warren Buffett recently got into the game by buying the fifth largest dealership group in the country called Van Tuyl Group (privately owned). This increasing consolidation among dealership groups is likely to be a negative for CDK and other DMS providers. As dealership groups merge and grow larger, the pricing power shifts in their favor and they are likely to try to extract price concessions from their DMS providers. I haven't necessarily seen any evidence of price degradation but put it on the radar as a long-term risk if dealership consolidation continues.New model of direct to consumer sales may limit usage of DMS softwareI only need to mention one company here and that is Tesla. Tesla is taking a very different approach to auto sales than any of its automotive competitors. Tesla is eschewing the franchised dealership model in favor of direct to consumer sales. In this new model, Tesla likely does not need to license DMS software. They likely have proprietary software to manage their sales, financing, etc. While I believe that selling cars in this way is likely much more efficient and cost effective, I see it as highly unlikely that larger players like Toyota or GM decide to change their current dealership model in a meaningful way. And even if they do, they cannot eliminate any of their existing dealerships. State franchise laws are very strict and would prevent them from doing so. In summary, I see the risk from the transition to a new sales model in the near to intermediate term as very low, but I did think it was worth highlighting to acknowledge the breadth of risks that are out there.ManagementAt a high level, the management team (including the CEO) is a group of ADP veterans that has a wealth of industry experience and has made good capital allocation decisions.CEO Steve Anenen has been with ADP and CDK for 39 years. He has been at the helm of CDK since 2004 (10 years) and has managed exceptional growth of the base business while making sound acquisitions such as Cobalt, which is now CDK's Digital Marketing Solutions Business. Anenen has seen many parts of the business and I generally believe that this experience will be valuable to the newly public company.Many of the other management team members including the CFO and the division heads also have a wealth of experience with CDK and ADP. Chairman Leslie Brun has extensive financial, management and advisory experience that makes him particularly well suited to the role. From corporate governance perspective, CDK gets a gold star for keeping the CEO and Chairman roles separated.The important thing I like to look at with spinoffs is how much skin management has in the game (in other words, how much of CDK Global's equity will owned by management). A management team that is overpaid with equity that significantly dilutes the common shareholder's ownership is not a good thing, but a management that owns a substantial equity stake, has interests that are better aligned to shareholder interests. There is a fine balance between the two, but in summary, we do want management to be owners of the company in a fairly meaningful way.In the case of CDK, management owns very little of the new company on a pro forma basis. Even if we include additional shares that would be acquired upon the exercise of additional outstanding stock options, the management team would own close to a half million shares in aggregate. While this may sound like a lot, it is well less than 1% of the total outstanding shares. I believe that management's ownership of the company will grow over time but I wish it were somewhat higher at the get go to ensure that management interests and shareholder interests are well aligned.Having said that, there are a few things that I like about management compensation at first blush:Minimum stock ownership guidelines are a key aspect of CDK's compensation policy. The policy requires that the CEO hold minimum equity ownership in CDK of three times base salary (= ~$1.5mm for 2014) and executive officers hold at least one times base salary. This ensures that management has at least some skin in the game, but this amount of ownership is still relatively low. As of this writing, management satisfied these requirements.~50% of CEO compensation and ~37% of other executive compensation is comprised of long-term incentive comp like stock options and Stock Awards. I like compensation that is based on long-term objectives. It motivates management to make decisions that are good for the long term.Capital AllocationIn mid -November, management declared a dividend of 12 cents per share, which results in a dividend yield of ~1.0% (at current stock price = ~$46). I like the move by management to initiate a dividend. The declaration of a dividend represents a fixed quarterly expenditure ($77mm per year in aggregate in FY 2015) and demonstrates confidence in the business by the management team and a capital allocation policy that is shareholder friendly. I expect continued increases in the dividend as former parent ADP was well known for. Additionally, the Free Cash Flow payout ratio of ~33% represents an amount that is appropriate and provides sufficient cushion relative to annual FCF of approximately ~$230mm (excluding one time separation costs).Prudent acquisitions that add value are also a way that I qualitatively evaluate management's strategy. CDK has made 30 acquisitions since 2000 that have ranged from smaller tuck in to more transformative. Two key acquisitions have included: the acquisition of Kerridge Computer in 2005 which formed the foundation for CDK's International DMS platform and the acquisition of Cobalt which is the basis for CDK's digital marketing solutions business. Both of these acquisitions have proved to be integral to the current business and generally make logical sense for the company. I don't have specific information on purchase prices and other tuck in acquisitions, so it is difficult to say if management has been prudent with all acquisitions, but at a high level, I can say that acquisitions have been additive and logical.A key component of CDK's business strategy going forward is completing acquisitions that support or complement its existing technology. We will need to continue to evaluate the quality and prudence of acquisitions going forward.ValuationNow we come to the million-dollar question - what's it worth? Before we go there, let me recap. There are a lot of things that I like about CDK: an experienced management team that is working in the shareholder's interest, the recurring revenue stream of DMS software, the relative resistance to recession due to mission-critical nature of the software, high switching costs, slow pace of change in enterprise technology and high operating leverage. There are some risks/watch outs to be aware of: industry cyclicality could have some impact to the revenue stream, low margins and susceptibility to cyclicality of Digital Marketing Solutions, fragmentation of DMS providers and increasing consolidation of franchised dealership groups. In totality, I would say that the positives far outweigh the risks. And with the risks, there are fairly strong mitigants. So what's this all worth to us at Scuttlebutt?Based on a Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, we get to an intrinsic value of ~$42 per share. When the stock was trading around $25 to $27 per share post debut, it was a healthy discount to fair value. However, at a current share price of ~$46, the value proposition is difficult to justify.There is an important point that I need to make on the origin of the intrinsic value. The intrinsic value of ~$42 is predicated on a reasonable level of margin improvement driven by two key factors. First, I believe that the business is not productive as it can be today when you compare it to peers like R&R that generate operating margins of 42%-44%. However, I believe that R&R may generate those excess margins at the expense of its product and service levels. Thus, my model assumes that CDK can improve margins in its three key segments to competitive levels, but still well below R&R. Second, CDK should be benefit from operating leverage as it grows the top line, thus improving margins naturally.Sachem Head Capital Management and Fir Tree Partners, which now own ~18.5% of CDK between the two funds have driven the price of the stock up significantly since the debut. I should note that Vanguard and Blackrock, the mutual fund companies, also own large positions of ~6.1% and 6.9% respectively, but neither is known to be activist in any way.The question is whether or not these hedge funds will continue to buy and if this will continue to drive the price of the stock up. I would call these speculative drivers of price (not value) and could not recommend an investment on the basis of an increase in price due to these drivers. However, these funds may try to drive value- by recommending strategies and acquisitions to management that can drive margins, Free Cash Flow or strengthen competitive advantages. These are the drivers of value that we at Scuttlebutt can get behind. There is another school of thought that there may be a push for consolidation in the industry. I view large scale or transformative consolidation for CDK as unlikely in the near term given that there would be tax implications with doing so. I think that they will be more focused on tuck-in acquisitions in the near term. However, based on the universe of information out there, it is difficult to ascertain precisely what these funds are proposing to CDK management.My recommendation is to wait out until the stock trades at fair value or a discount to it. I believe that market volatility should provide more reasonable purchase price opportunities. I would be willing to pick up more shares at what I deem to be fair value because the business is a gem and can deliver decent returns (for what I view as relatively low risk) even at fair value, but I will wait until the shares trade at more reasonable levels. Patience is the name of the game. I think Charlie Munger, Buffett's right hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, called it ""sitting on your ass"" investing. In other words, sitting on your ass until the right investment or right price materializes.Disclosure: I am currently long CDK.

Now, the newly spun off company, CDK Global (NASDAQ:CDK), is one of the best plays on the software market for car dealerships. Basically, CDK provides software for advertising and optimizing car sales. As an interesting fact, its name is a compilation of various businesses,CDK is doing $2 billion a year in revenue with a 11.5% profit margin (although that will decline due to corporate overhead as a public company). CDK's solutions for auto dealers includes a variety of steps, such as automating marketing, insurance, repair, sales, financing, etc.About 80% of its business is in the auto retail business which is its core software market. The other 20% is in digital marketing solutions. A large part of the digital solutions business is to the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), with General Motors (NYSE:GM) being its largest customer in this segment.Car sales are amidst a nice rebound, with leading car companies to spend money on tech. And CDK has enjoyed a nice run, despite an initial selloff. Shares are up over 30% since spinning off from ADP. One of the activist investors in CDK, Fir Tree, has already seen a solid return on its investment, given its $30 a share cost basis.But the big news for CDK is that it has already attracted two activist investors. One activist is unusual for a newly spun off company, but two is unheard of.Who we're dealing with (activists): Sachem Head Management added 10mm shares to its stake in October and changed its status from ""passive"" to ""active."" Then Fir Tree bought 14mm shares in November and added 150k shares in December and changed its stake to ""active.""Collectively, Sachem Head and Fir Tree own over 16% of CDK. It's worth noting that CDK is a large position for Sachem Head (although about half of its 12.6 million share stake is held via options).Recall that Scott Ferguson (Sachem founder) was the first analyst that Bill Ackman hired in 2003 before launching Pershing Square. And Ferguson was a partner at Pershing Square before launching Sachem. Sachem and Pershing also do some deals together - note their partnership deal re: Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS).PRO FORMA SACHEM HEAD PORTFOLIO FOR 3Q'14source: stockpucker.comMeanwhile, Fir Tree's stake is all stock. Fir Tree's fund is about four times the size of Sachem Head. Jeffrey Tannenbaum founded Fir Tree in 1994 after working for KKR & Co. for six years.Fir Tree has noted that it has already had meetings with CDK management, where they discussed margins and capital allocation. Both hedge funds have said they think CDK is undervalued.Where we stand: With CDK trading at 30x forward earnings and 16x EV/EBITDA, I have valuation questions. I also don't see how the company can materially grow with its current reliance on the auto market.Auto sales have already started hitting a ceiling, with North American car sales returning to pre-recession levels last year (2014). The downturn in auto sales during the financial crisis already forced auto dealers to turn to optimizing their systems, and those that didn't, have been doing it over the last year.Although it's tough to bet against Sachem Head (and Fir Tree to some extent), a plateauing of new car sales is a net negative for CDK. I don't think a buyout is likely due to tax implication so soon after the spinoff, but the activists will likely push CDK to get started on buying back shares. However, we think there's other areas of the market providing greater return potential."
2569425,52382,2014-10-18T06:15:00-04:00,Fundamentals of the recent spin-off look weak when compared to peers in the industry.Relatively weak revenue growth and expected rise in expenses may put further pressure on the operating profitability.Stock may correct as more Street coverage on the new name highlight the lack of earnings power and comparatively expensive valuation.,"CDK Global Inc. (NASDAQ:CDK) is a recent spin-off from Automatic Data Processing Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) focused on providing auto dealer services. Although the stock has declined close to 25% along with the rest of the market, but short-term volatility notwithstanding, fundamentals suggest more downside from the current levels, especially as the name gets more Street coverage as an independent standing company.Dealer services sector in general is in a fundamentally decent position with dealers adopting technology at an increasing rate, since the auto dealers themselves are in a much better position after the consolidation of the last few years, which has led to increased sales and profitability per dealer. Indeed, I wrote a bullish piece on Dealertrack Technologies (NASDAQ:TRAK) and its improving fortunes after the Dealer.com acquisition, but improving dynamics in the sector may not directly boil down to the improved stock performance of CDK global.The stock, trading close to 12 times EV/ EBITDA, highlights the high investor expectations, partly due to the favorable industry dynamics, but a closer look at the fundamentals point towards poor competitive positioning. Well dressed for the spin-off, but analyzing the business going forward, concerns about low growth and margin pressure, due to the expected rise in interest and other costs, raises more doubts, besides the usual uncertainty with management's ability to manage a public company in current volatile equity market environment.A new entity, but an old businessEven though the independent company is new, the business, as part of ADP, is built up of more than 30 acquisitions completed over the last fifteen years. The current name, which is inspired from different acquisitions; C in the CDK is from Cobalt Digital Marketing, D from the original dealer services business and K from Kerridge Computer, highlights the acquisitive heritage.CDK Global provides IT and digital marketing solutions to the auto dealers and the business is made up of Auto Retail North America, Auto Retail International and Digital Marketing, out of which Digital Marketing business that constitutes just 20% of the total business is clearly the growth leader and rest 80% of the business carry much better margins but considerably poor growth rates. The company has close to 40% market penetration in the North American market.Unlike other major competitors that focus mainly on the auto dealers, CDK has also served other markets like trucking, agriculture, marine and recreational vehicle markets, even though these markets constitute only a small portion of the total business.As a spin-off, each ADP shareholder has received one share for every three shares of ADP held. So there are close to 160 million of shares outstanding giving it a market cap of $4.1 billion and, since the company is expected to carry a debt of approximately $700-800 million, an enterprise value of approximately $4.9 billion at the current stock price.The Long thesisThe name is barely followed, since the company has been spun off just a few weeks ago, but the Long argument mainly rests uponIt's easy to make a case favoring the auto dealer services in general. Over the last few years, especially since the recession, the highly fragmented auto retail industry has consolidated significantly, leading to improved sales and profitability for the average auto dealer. According to independent research, average sale for franchised retailers increased from 564 vehicles in 2009 to 877 in 2012 and average net profit went up from 12% in 2008 to 28% in 2012. With improved profitability and sales, the dealer is spending more on technology, including analytics and digital advertising.Another opportunity for the company is the operational improvement possible after the spin-off. As an independent company, CDK would have the freedom to pursue acquisitions, R&D projects and market penetration opportunities much more aggressively.Size not leading to better relative competitive positioningFor service providers, the fundamentals look favorable, especially after the consolidation of the last few years, with multi-year contracts, good margins and decent organic growth rates, but better industry dynamics may not necessarily mean great stock.Source: CDK Global Roadshow PresentationBoth CDK Global and Dealertrack have lead the consolidation trend and now both along with Reynolds & Reynolds and Cox Automotive constitute much of the auto dealer service provider space. As the chart above shows, both companies compete on most service offerings, even though Dealertrack is close to half the size of CDK, but the growth for CDK seems much weaker on a relative basis, even excluding the acquisitions.Looking at the profitability, the picture does not get any prettier, which as the sheet below shows, CDK margins get virtually no advantage from the scale.But looking at the relative valuation below, concerns are barely baked into the expectations.Risks that may challenge the Long thesisEven ignoring the fundamental challenges to the independent CDK, there is significant downside risk to the stock. Considering the low single digit organic growth rate and rising expense structure, a back of an envelope calculation leads to $16-17 stock price based on 7-8 times enterprise value/ EBITDA with $750-800 million of debt and 160 million shares outstanding, which is almost 30% down from the current levels. Besides high expectations and low delivery, some of the fundamental challenges that may bear negatively on the stock, especially as the stock draw more coverage, areEven though the company is growing close to the average market growth rate, with competitors like Dealertrack growing much faster organically and aggressively making acquisitions like Dealer.com, there is a real risk to the company's dominant market share.As the worksheet above shows, CDK draws much larger average revenue per dealer in network compared to competitor, but there seems limited opportunity to ""upsell"" into existing customer base, especially as competitors get aggressive. Case in point is Dealertrack, which grew its potential revenue per dealer from $6,000 per month, two years ago, to the current level of $13,000 per month via acquisitions and launching new products.As per CDK's own estimates, digital media spend by the U.S. auto industry is expected to grow at an average rate of 15% and somewhat stronger growth rate is visible at competitors' digital marketing revenue trend, but CDK's DMS business has grown at 14-20% over the last two years.Even a back of an envelope calculation should highlight the lack of potential earnings growth, going forward, as the expense level of the company increases due to interest expense and increase in other usual operating expenses associated with being a public company. In the above calculation, estimates of 10-15% increase in SGA (Selling, General & Administration), tax rate of approximately 33% and annual interest expense of $15-20 are baked in, which may be proven conservative, but highly encourage readers to do their own analysis. Important to note that, as per SEC filings, maximum bonus payments for some of the executives become eligible at revenue growth of 11% and operating income growth of 12%.ConclusionEven though the dynamics for the broader space looks good, better to wait on the sidelines as the challenges get fully discounted in the stock and fundamentals catch up to excitement and promise offered by the new spin-off. Technology stocks usually suffer from a discount, as they age, due to concerns about lack of innovation. This ""Lack of Innovation"" discount has to be bigger in the case of CDK, which barely grows even after aggressively acquiring over the last many years. Going forward, it seems evident that the company would have to invest more on R&D, besides the usual spending increases associated with a public company. Target of $16-17 is based on 7-8 times enterprise value/ current year EBITDA, considering the low organic growth rate and expected increase in the cost structure of the new company. Relatively, I prefer TRAK after the integration of the Dealer.com acquisition."
2559355,53162,2014-10-15T07:00:00-04:00,"CDK Global, a spin-off from Automatic Data Processing, has strong growth and stock upside potential.CDK Global offers high free cash flow and this would mean high dividend, share repurchase and acquisition driven value creation.CDK Global provides end-to-end IT and digital marketing services to the automotive industry and this gives the company an edge over peers.","Initiation of the Spin-OffAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) that provides technology-based outsourcing solutions to employers worldwide completed the spin-off of its dealer-services business that is now called CDK Global (NASDAQ:CDK). The spun-off entity, CDK Global, is now trading as an independent company as a member of the S&P MidCap 400 Index.I am initiating CDK Global as a ""Strong Buy"" as the company has the potential to create shareholder value through multiple avenues. This initiation on CDK Global discusses the key growth triggers for the company and the potential return prospects for shareholders.With CDK Global having traded just for few days on the exchanges as a separate entity, the stock still needs to gain visibility and I believe that this is the right time to consider buying CDK Global.Business OverviewCDK Global is the largest global provider of integrated information technology and digital marketing solutions to the automotive retail industry.The company's operations are organized into two main businesses - Automotive Retail Solutions and Digital Marketing Solutions.Through its Automotive Retail business, CDK Global provides technology solutions that help automotive retailers, OEMs and other industry participants manage the sale, financing, insurance, parts supply, repair and maintenance of vehicles.The company provides these solutions in the United States and in over 100 additional countries. In the United States, the company's clients include 7 of the top 10 largest and 57 of the top 100 largest automotive retailer groups by total new vehicle sales units. CDK Global is therefore the largest player in North America.Through its Digital Marketing business, CDK Global provides integrated digital marketing solutions for OEMs and automotive retailers, including websites and management of their digital advertising spend. The company's solutions are currently provided in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand.As of June 30, 2014 (company's year-end), the Automotive Retail Solutions segment generated $1,592 million in revenue, representing approximately 80% of the company's revenue and the Digital Marketing business generated $373 million in revenue, representing the remaining 20% of the company's total revenue.North America Business - Steady Growth and Cash CowIt is clear that CDK Global's business is largely dependent on the health of the automotive industry in the United States and globally. I will first focus on North America as CDK Global has a leading market share in the region and is best positioned to benefit from any strong growth in the automotive industry.According to IHS forecast, US automotive sale is expected to reach 16.4 million in 2014 and is expected to expand to 17.4 million by 2017. The sales forecast of 16.4 million is the highest since 2006 and is an indication of the strong recovery in the US automotive market.Further, according to another report by IHS, the new light vehicle production in 2014 is on track to reach 17 million units in North America and will increase to 18.5 million by 2021. It is clear that automotive manufacturers are expecting the current strong trend to continue.CDK Global, which is the top automotive retail solutions provider in North America, is best positioned to benefit from this steady growth in the industry.A very critical point to mention here is the brand loyalty trend in North America. According to another IHS analysis, new vehicle owners that returned to market during the first half of 2014 purchased a new vehicle of the same make nearly 51% of the time.In an intensively competitive market, brand loyalty can help automotive manufactures and automotive retailers sustain their growth and market share. I am discussing brand loyalty as automotive retail solutions enhance sales and after sales experience for customers as it include components such as managing the sale, financing, insurance, parts supply, repair and maintenance of vehicles.In other words, CDK Global's software solutions are critical to automotive manufacturers and retailers would not hesitate in investing in advanced solutions that not only enhance customer experience, but also drive profitability through efficiency. CDK Global's business is therefore integral to OEM's and retailer's needs. This ensures a steady flow of cash through the subscription based model.Emerging Markets - High Growth and Stock Upside CatalystCDK Global's automotive sale in North America for the year ended June 2014 was $1,268 million and the company's sales in international markets was $325 million.Emerging market penetration has just commenced for CDK Global and it is a part of the company's strategy to focus on emerging markets to drive growth. According to analyst estimates, China's car and light van production will increase by 10.2 million vehicles to 30 million vehicles by 2021. India and countries in Southeast Asia will produce another 5 million vehicles a year by 2021.Overall, global production is expected to increase from 87.7 million units in 2014 to 106.3 million units by 2021 with growth in emerging markets expected to be relatively robust.To put things into perspective, the company estimates (according to their road show presentation) that the global market opportunity is in the tune of $40 billion. CDK Global's current revenue stands at $2 billion and the market potential gives an idea of the imminent revenue upside that is likely to come from emerging markets.While CDK Global offers service to 7 out of 10 largest automotive retailer groups in the US, it also offers services to 20 of the top 30 dealer groups in the UK. The point I am trying to make is that CDK Global has been successful in penetrating deep into markets it has explored. Over the next few years, the company's penetration in China, India and other emerging markets can be a major growth catalyst.Digital Marketing - The Game Changing OpportunityThe digital marketing solutions segment can be a potential game changer for CDK Global. In the last two years, the segment revenue has grown at a CAGR of 19% from $263 million in 2012 to $373 million in 2014. I believe that this growth is likely to sustain and this section discusses the rationale for this opinion.As is the general trend with overall advertising, automotive advertising is increasingly focused on digital media. According to a December 2013 study by Google, 95% of U.S. vehicle buyers now use the internet before purchasing a vehicle. This underscores the importance of digital marketing solutions.Further, according to a detailed research by IHS -Both these research points lead to the conclusion that digital marketing is of paramount importance and with this data in hand; OEM's or retailers would not mind spending on their digital marketing initiatives. It is therefore not surprising to see CDK Global's digital solutions business growing at a robust pace.Over the next few years, digital marketing spend is likely to increase at a CAGR of 14%-15% and this means that the company's digital marketing solutions segment will continue to grow at a CAGR of at least 15% (if not more).With CDK Global providing data-driven digital marketing and advertising insights for OEM's and retailers to enhance their online presence, the service offering is in sync with the trend.Low Capital Requirements - High Shareholder ReturnsCDK Global's capital expenditure has been historically around 2%-3% of the revenue. Low capital requirements make the stock attractive from a shareholder return perspective.Further, if the last few years trend for free cash flow is observed, the business has been consistently generating free cash flow as a percentage of revenue in the range of 10%-12%. In FY14, the FCF was $194 million and considering the fact that the number of shares outstanding is 160.1 million, the company's free cash flow per share comes to $1.2.The important point here is that CDK Global intends to use the free cash flow in three ways - payment of dividends, share repurchase and opportunistic acquisitions.While the company is yet to provide any indications on the possible dividend payout, even if 50% of the FCF is used for paying dividends, CDK Global will be offering a dividend yield of 2.2% considering the current stock price of $27.8.Further, share repurchase will also be a boost to the EPS and I believe that CDK Global will pursue buybacks relatively soon as the company has mentioned in its road show presentation that it intends to buy back shares to offset dilution.I also believe that CDK Global will be looking for acquisitions in emerging markets, where it intends to expand its presence.Coming back to the point on value creation, besides the potential stock price appreciation that is likely to come from strong growth, CDK Global will offer investors a good dividend payout and EPS boost through buybacks.Another important point related to the company's business model is that CDK Global has long-term contracts with OEMs and retailers. In automotive retail North America, CDK Global has an average contract length of 5 years and in automotive retail international, the company has an average contract length of 3 years. Further, the contract length varies from 1 to 3 years for digital marketing contracts. The revenue and cash flow trend is therefore steady and I believe that this is a low risk business model.In the last 3-4 years, the company's revenue has been steadily growing at 7%-8% and I believe that this steady growth trend will continue. The growth trend can certainly accelerate as digital marketing segment grows further and as the company's presence in emerging markets is more significant. Investors can therefore expect steady revenue, cash flow and dividends growth other than potential value creation coming from acquisitions.Talking about the financials, I must also mention that CDK Global has a debt of $1 billion and a net debt of $750 million as of June 2014. The leverage is, however, well under control with a debt to LTM EBITDA of 2.4 and a net debt to LTM EBITDA of 1.8.Valuation PerspectiveFor the year ended June 30, 2014, CDK Global reported an EBITDA of $413 million. Further, the company had a net debt of $750 million for the year ended June 2014 and the company commands a current market capitalization of $4.2 billion. This translates into an EV of $4,950 million and CDK Global is therefore trading at an EV/EBITDA of 12.0.From a PE perspective, CDK Global is trading at a PE of 18.5 times FY14 earnings. With the valuations in the IT sector, a PE of 18.5 is not stretched. Automatic Data Processing is itself trading at a PE of 22.9 and SAP SE (NYSE:SAP), which provides dealer management systems, is trading at a PE of 20.3. Further, CDK Global has a healthy free cash flow per share of $1.21 and this translates into a free cash flow yield of 4.6%, which is attractive.In terms of peer valuation, CDK Global has no direct competitor as the spin-off has created a pure play provider of integrated IT and digital solutions to the global automotive industry. Further, there are no players in the market that provide end-to-end solutions for the automotive industry from an IT and marketing perspective. This is clear from the chart below that provides insight in to the company's service offerings as compared to peers.This makes CDK Global a unique investment opportunity and gives the company an edge over peers through a comprehensive suite of solutions.Concluding AnalysisOne of the risk factors for CDK Global would be another downturn in the global economy that can negatively impact the automotive industry. I, however, believe that the global economy might stabilize at lower GDP growth levels than going into another downturn.Another important point is that CDK Global's services will be of equal importance during a downturn as intense competition will require continued strong customer service. The digital market segment is also likely to be minimally impacted by slowdown as digital marketing is a relatively cheaper source of advertisement and it would make sense to have more digital marketing as a percentage of total marketing in times of slowdown.A good example of the point I am trying to make comes from the company's growth trend during the slowdown coming from the financial crisis. The company's North America revenue (excluding acquisitions) declined by 4% between fiscal year 2009 and fiscal year 2010, while US car sales volumes declined 21% from calendar year 2008 to 2009.CDK Global is therefore an interesting investment option that promises rewards for shareholders in the form of dividends, buyback and through capital appreciation.Considering all the growth factors discussed, I rate CDK Global as a ""Strong Buy"" and I believe that the stock has the potential to significantly outperform market returns."

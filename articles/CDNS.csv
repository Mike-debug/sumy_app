While everyone is familiar with the big names in tech, I’m focused on a company that has also performed well this year but is not a household name. Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) has seen its share price rise by 60% on a YTD basis. While no one likes to overpay for an investment, I also don’t find it useful to dwell too much on missed opportunities in the past. The stock market is forward-looking, and in this article, I explore whether the stock makes for an attractive investment at today’s prices. So, let’s get started!Cadence Design Systems is a leading electronics design company with more than 30 years of expertise in computational software. Its customer base is comprised of semiconductor and systems companies. Cadence’s solutions enable these customers to deliver chips, circuit boards, and systems for a broad range of applications, including consumer, hyperscale computing, 5G communications, automotive, aerospace, industrial, and healthcare. It currently has over 8,000 employees, and in 2019, generated over $2.3 billion in revenues.One of the risks to investing in Cadence is its exposure to China, which represents a strong growth area for the company. For reference, the company generated ~12.5% of its total revenues from China in the first half of this year, compared to just 10% total last year. With the U.S. government cutting China off from the supply of semiconductors, Cadence’s business of serving the industry could be at risk. This was addressed by the CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, during the Q&A session of the latest conference call (emphasis added by author):Based on the CEO’s comments, it appears that management is closely monitoring this dynamic situation. Outside of this risk, it appears that China and greater Asia would continue to be strong growth drivers for the company. This risk is also mitigated by the fact that China still represents a relatively small segment for the company at just ~12.5% of revenues.What I like about Cadence is that it essentially sits at the cusp of a technological revolution in 5G, IoT, AI, and data-centric systems, which is seeing accelerating semiconductor demand and design activity. As a leading electronics design solutions provider to many semiconductor companies around the world, I see Cadence as being in a prime position to benefit from this takeoff. This is supported by the following analysis conducted by Iot-Analytics, which shows that the number of device connections is expected to grow at a 17% CAGR between 2020 and 2025.(Source: IoT Analytics)The revenue picture for Cadence continues to be bright, with growing recurring revenues from a stable customer base. The IP royalties and Systems Innovations segments continue to be strong growth drivers. As seen below, revenues are growing at a solid clip, with a 4-year CAGR of 9.4%. What’s even better is that operating margins (calculated as operating income divided by revenue) have also grown, from 15.8% in 2016 to 21.5% at present. This has resulted in a much faster growth in operating income, at an 18% CAGR over the same period.(Source: Created by author based on company financials)Meanwhile, I’m encouraged by the key partnerships with leading companies that Cadence is driving to increase cloud adoption, as noted by management on the last conference call:Turning to analyst estimates, it appears that the current share price is sitting at about the same as the average estimate, implying a Hold rating.(Source: YCharts)Cadence Design Systems is a leading electronics design company that serves well-known semiconductor and systems companies around the world, with end markets in a wide range of categories. It stands to benefit from continued strong growth in the areas of 5G, IoT, AI, and data-centric systems. Management also continues to execute well operationally, as demonstrated by the continued revenue growth from a stable customer base, and operating margin expansion.Going forward, one of the risks worth paying attention to is its exposure to China, which may see a decline in demand due to trade disputes around the semiconductor industry. Based on management’s guidance for $2.53 in non-GAAP EPS for full-year 2020, I calculate a forward P/E ratio of 43.8, based on today’s share price of $110.91. While I’m bullish on the company’s growth prospects, I believe the shares are fairly valued at the moment, and therefore, have a Hold rating on the shares at this time."
4348549,105400,2020-05-18T15:42:55-04:00,Cadence Design has experienced steady growth in recent years with improving margins.The company has been producing strong free cash flows to support growth and operations.Cadence Design's valuation appears fair due to its strong operating fundamentals.,"Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) has greatly outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 10 years, returning 1108% compared to the S&P's 152%. This is attributed to its history of strong product innovation, which has driven steady sales growth, high operating margins, and high return on capital. Despite improving pricing power and gross margins, revenues could come under threat from a slowdown in the electronics industry or industry consolidation. The company has a strong balance sheet with enough cash to continue innovating. Cadence's stock also appears to be decently priced due to its strong fundamentals.(Source: Seeking Alpha Data)Cadence Design's value proposition is optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, shortening the time to bring their customers' products to market and reducing their design, development and manufacturing costs. For some companies designing electronic products, this might be a more cost-effective method compared to building the software themselves.Revenue from $936M in 2014 to $2.3B in 2019, compounding at 12% year on year. This has been driven by a culture of innovation, with 20 significant new products over the past 3 years. The company has a recurring revenue business model, which leads to steadier cash flows. Cadence's revenue is also diversified across product segments and region - no product segment contributes more than 30% of revenues. This reduces the concentration risk for the company at the top line.(Source: Investor Presentation)Cadence Design also estimates its total addressable market to be $30B in the next five years. With sales of $2.3B, this puts Cadence Design's market penetration at roughly 7.6%. This gives Cadence Design a decent runway for growth to capture market share, which is also accelerated by growing digital transformation. Cadence Design has options to take market share such as new customer acquisitions, expanding its existing user base, and international expansion.The company's gross margins have expanded from 83% in 2011 to 88% in 2019, reflecting that growth of price has been increasing at a higher rate than cost of service. This suggests some degree of pricing power for Cadence and the value proposition that the company provides.Cadence Design has third party integrations that contribute to industry standards. The closer their products are to industry standards, the stronger the switching costs for customers:(Source: Latest 10K)The company has also been focusing on profitable growth and disciplined capital allocation. Operating margins have increased from -0.32% to 21.6% over the past 10 years. Return on capital has also been trending upwards. At roughly 13.6%, Cadence's return on capital shows it is generating value with growth since it is much higher than its cost of capital of 7.11%.(Source: Seeking Alpha Data)Looking at its latest balance sheet, Cadence Design has $705M of cash and $346M of long-term debt. At a positive free cash flow of roughly $600M, this puts Cadence Design in a great cash position to fund future growth and handle any operating difficulties. It is unlikely that Cadence Design would have to raise funds to meet its operational needs. This high cash flow generation ability comes from the high deferred revenue of $355M for Cadence, which allows the company to collect cash upfront before services are delivered. (Source: Latest 10k)Any potential downturn in the semiconductor and electronics industries may negatively impact Cadence's business and reduce the company's bookings levels and revenue. Companies might reduce spending on technology if they deem that Cadence is not mission-critical to their operations or current projects. Hence, it is dependent on the usage level from Cadence's customers.Another worrying trend is the consolidation in the semiconductor industry. If the trend continues, it might reduce the pricing power of Cadence design due to the stronger bargaining power of customers. This consolidation could also decide to streamline operations to cut costs, which could reduce the demand for Cadence's products and services.Depending on which multiple you look at, Cadence could be expensive or cheap relative to its peers. Based on its consensus EV/revenue of 8.9x, it is much higher than the median of 5.2x. Its consensus EV/EBITDA multiple of 25.2x is also higher than the median of 23.4x. However, its P/E ratio of 33.4x is lower than the median of 37.9x. Despite being more expensive than its peers in some cases, Cadence Design has better operating fundamentals. Its consensus EBITDA margin of 35.1% is higher than the median of 31%. Its estimated revenue growth next year of 9.5% is also higher than the median of 8.1%. Hence it appears that Cadence's overvaluation on some multiples appears justified.(Source: Atom Finance)Whether Cadence Design can continue to outperform the S&P 500 depends on whether the company can continue to do what it has been doing well. Product innovations and improving customer proposition should lead to a stronger top and bottom line. This should drive steady value creation as returns on capital exceeds the cost of capital. Some external risks that are dependent on economic performance and industry actions are uncontrollable by the company. Strong management execution is required to ensure that Cadence Design remains relevant in the face of these risks."
4337666,25120,2020-04-15T07:33:37-04:00,"Cadence remains a steady play in the wider semiconductor space given its excellent fundamentals.At a time when peers have seen some struggles, the company reports resilient growth.The predictability of these earnings is what has attracted many investors, yet with shares trading at nearly 40 times earnings.As the current Corona crisis is creating bargains in many areas, I am not compelled to Cadence here.","I have last looked at Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) late 2019, as I will provide a brief update on the potential and impact of the current woes on the company, the shares, and thus the investment thesis.Last December, I concluded that there are great prospects for Cadence, yet mostly for the operations instead of the shares. In December, I concluded that Cadence is an undercovered beneficiary of the semiconductor boom. I like the positioning and track record, yet valuations had gotten a bit out of hand last year, as I no longer saw a compelling risk-reward.Cadence is a leader of system design enablement solutions, as this includes software, hardware and intellectual property. The company claims that this is mission-critical technology for electronic customers which together with a subscription based business model, makes for high renewal rates and a great portion of recurring revenues.The basic idea, or premise is that Cadence is catering just a small segment of the semiconductor marker, yet a very critical one for its customers. With mega trends such as mobile, automotive, machine learning and data centers increasing demand, the promise for suppliers such as Cadence looks good.Shares fell from levels in their twenties to $2 during the 2008 economic recession, after which a multi-year boom pushed shares up to a high of $80 in February 2020. Shares fell to levels in the mid-fifties in March, yet have rebounded to $71 at the moment, with shares actually trading about 10% higher compared to early December when I last looked at the prospects for the shares, marking continued great outperformance of the stock vs. the rest of the market.When I looked at Cadence in December the company had recently reported the results for the first nine months of the year, with sales up 10% to $1.7 billion in the first nine months of the year. The company reported GAAP operating profits of $383 million, for steep margins of 22% despite having spent over $700 million on R&D already in the first three quarters of the year.With GAAP earnings totaling $1.17 per share in the first nine months of the year, I noted that realistic earnings would come in around $1.50 per share, resulting in a sky-high valuation multiple at $67. Even after adjusting for amortization expenses which are included in the GAAP numbers, I concluded that expectations were very high at around 40 times earnings as the business operates with a net cash position of around a dollar.While the valuations were too expensive to consider shares potentially compelling, there was a silver lining as well. Sales were up double digit percentages so far in 2019, while the rest of the sector was facing some struggles. Furthermore, the company is spending massive amounts on R&D as leverage on this front could provide a boom to margins and thus earnings.In February of this year, Cadence reported its fourth quarter results which at a first glance did not look so compelling. Sales rose just over 5% year-over-year. The company reported a very steep profit on the back of half a billion tax benefit, with quarterly non-GAAP earnings only totaling $0.54 per share, although that number excludes $0.17 per share in share-based compensation expense, making that realistic earnings came in at $0.37 per share, or $1.50 per share per annum, as the numbers and pro-forma balance sheet were pretty much in line with my expectations early December.Of interest is the 2020 guidance. The company saw 2020 sales increase to a midpoint of $2.565 billion, which if attained suggests that sales will be up another 10% year-over-year. The company guided for adjusted earnings of $2.40-$2.50 per share and GAAP earnings at a midpoint of $1.51 per share. With adjusted earnings totaling $2.20 per share in 2019, earnings per share growth is seen at 9-14% this year. If I kindly only adjust for stock-based compensation expenses, which ran at $0.65 per share in 2019, realistic earnings probably come in around $1.80 per share at best in 2020, that is of course before factoring in the impact of the Coronavirus.Trading at $71 per share today, and including a net cash position of around a dollar, valuations remains very steep in my book, at 39 times realistic earnings seen this year, which seems like a steep multiple given the state of the market and the fact that the outlook might of course see significant risks to the downside, although the mega trends remain intact.Hence, this probably works out to be great long term play, talking (multi)-decade here, yet given the elevated risks and near term uncertainty in the economy, significant valuation compression could easily take place. Hence, I do not necessarily see a compelling-risk reward for investors with a shorter term horizon."
4340100,105306,2020-04-27T00:45:30-04:00,"Cadence surpassed Q1 2020 estimations and reaffirmed its 10% revenue growth guidance for FY 2020.The management team has pointed to a strong design activity and has not seen a slowdown in activity, despite the current lockdown.While Cadence's valuation is not cheap, I believe it is worth owning its shares in both short- and long-term time frames.","Unlike many companies that have lowered the guidance for 2020, Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) has reaffirmed its 10% revenue growth guidance for FY 2020 at the time of its quarterly earnings release. During such uncertain times, Cadence’s predominant recurring revenue model is expected to provide what many other companies may not - a relatively stable business that should weather this economic downturn without an abrupt decline in demand. Unsurprisingly, shares of Cadence have fared better than the broader market throughout this tough environment after the outbreak of the ongoing pandemic.Total revenue was $618 million in the quarter, 0.8% above estimations and up 7% over a year ago, with business volume well-distributed across its core categories: Digital IC Design and Signoff (29%), Custom IC Design and Simulation (25%), Functional Verification (23%), IP (14%) and System Interconnect and Analysis (9%).The company has seen increased adoption of its new Cadence digital full flow by several leading customers, as this solution is able to further optimize power, performance and area. Meanwhile, its verification suite got several project wins across different segments like cloud/data center, automotive and networking, with the verification hardware family breaking through several new customers and showing strength at hyperscale systems and semiconductor companies. Furthermore, its IP segment also had a remarkable quarter with double-digit growth, taking advantage of the current outsourcing trend in this area.Overall, the management team has pointed to a strong design activity, driven by demands coming from 5G, artificial intelligence, hyperscale computing and industrial IoT.Shifting to the bottom line figures, GAAP operating margin came in at 22.6%, up 30 bps over a year ago, while Non-GAAP operation margin was 32.2%, down 10 bps, and Non-GAAP EPS was $0.60, 11% above estimations and also up 11% over a year ago.As we can see on the chart below, Cadence has been able to successfully increase gross profit margin over the last years, while keeping SG&A and R&D expenses relative to revenue under control. As a result, operating margin has stabilized at the high end of the 5-year range.Source: YChartsDespite the current lockdown still in course in many regions, the management team has not seen a slowdown in activity, as R&D and sales teams continue to work with a high level of productivity and R&D innovation projects and customer deliverables are tracking well. On top of that, Cadence's business is largely tied with semiconductor R&D budgets, which should cushion the company at this moment.Taking it into consideration and assuming the company has a backlog of nearly $3.7 billion, the management team has reaffirmed its FY 2020 guidance. Hence, the revenue is expected to grow 9-11% in 2020, Non-GAAP operation margin should remain in the range of 32-33% and Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow 9-14%.I am going to compare Cadence's financial and valuation metrics with companies in the technology sector, using as reference the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK), as well as the software segment of the same ETF, containing 14 companies, including two system design enablement peers (Synopsys (SNPS) and Ansys (ANSS)) and other tech names such as Adobe (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT).Firstly, looking at the profitability, Cadence's gross profit margin is among the top 3 companies in the software group, only behind Autodesk (ADSK) and its peer Synopsys. In addition, its operating margin is in the middle of both peers, while its growth rate over the past 5 years is in the 2nd quintile.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorOn the other hand, Cadence's free cash flow yield is below the average of both peer groups. It is worth mentioning that Cadence is in the middle of Ansys (2.0%) and Synopsys (3.2%). It is also interesting to remark that Cadence’s free cash flow yield growth rate has been significantly higher compared to these 2 companies, specially taking into consideration that its revenue growth rate has lagged these 2 peers.Source: YChartsShifting to the financial health, Cadence's debt profile scores in the first or second quintile in both groups, as the company has managed to reduce its debt-to-EBTIDA ratio below the 0.7 mark over the past 2 yearsSource: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorSource: YChartsMoving to the valuation analysis, Cadence is trading at higher P/E, EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA multiples compared to XLK peers. The same is happening with Ansys and Synopsys, meaning that all these three system design enablement companies are trading at a premium. On the other hand, Cadence shows lower long-term earnings and revenue forecast than peers, what suggests that the market is actually paying a premium for Cadence’s revenue and earnings predictability rather than future growth. A second obvious data that also supports Cadence's higher valuation is its superior historical EPS growth rate compared to direct peers and the technology sector average.By contrast, Cadence trades at lower multiples compared to the software group. While it could indicate an undervaluation, we must remember that these software companies exhibit much higher growth forecasts and that many of them also have a predominant recurring revenue profile.On balance, Cadence's current valuation probably makes sense in this environment. However, once a potential recovery become clearer in the software industry, I think Cadence is unlikely to outperform this group. Nonetheless, I foresee that Cadence can perform very well compared to the broader technology sector once current premium valuation is probably sustainable going forward, given the stability of the company's businessSource: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorShifting to the price momentum analysis, shares of Cadence have generally outperformed the broader technology sector and, to a lesser extent, the software industry in the past year, as displayed on the table below. In addition, current prices of Cadence, Ansys, Synopsys and the related benchmarks are trading above 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages, confirming a more neutral-to-bullish price momentum for the time being, despite the high level of anxiety in the overall market.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorThe resilience of Cadence's business underscores the recent outperformance of its shares amid the ongoing pandemic. Even assuming that Cadence's valuation is not particularly cheap, I believe it is worth owning its shares. Cadence can continue to beat the broader market in the short term, while still performing well in the long run, as the company should benefit from new demand from 5G, artificial intelligence and other technologies."
4337278,104888,2020-04-13T11:59:21-04:00,"Strong 4Q19 results paint a solid picture pre-pandemic.
        Upbeat industry outlook with new demand drivers.
        Entry into systems analysis and solvers are bearing fruit.
        Virus concerns are still present but Cadence boasts strong recurring revenue.","Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) has been a high flying company in simulation systems, delivering beats in the past few quarters. In 4Q19, Cadence reported revenue of $599.56M and non-GAAP EPS of $0.54, both of which were ahead of market estimates.Initially in February, markets believed the virus could be contained in China which was likely why we saw the U.S. broad market indexes reaching all time highs. That situation quickly turned when infections spread all across the globe. Many quality names were indiscriminately sold off, with many registering declines of more than 30% in just a month's time. Now that the dust is beginning to settle, I think it is a good time to revisit Cadence.4Q19 total revenue of ~$600M was up 5.2%, of which product revenue contributed to $565M, increasing 5.7% yoy.Functional verification (hardware) accounted to 24% of total revenue in 4Q19, up from 20% in 3Q19. Hardware segment had a record year, owing to major expansion at multiple customers, leading to the addition of 19 new Z1 and 11 new X1 customers, over the 2019. This includes a global marquee semi customer who has placed one of the largest hardware orders ever for Cadence. Digital IC Design and Signoff revenue grew ~9% yoy in 4Q19 while it grew in the low teens in FY19 due to persistent and strong adoption by customers demanding for solutions offering best-in-class, performance, power, area, and time to market capabilities.Design IP was also a highlight, growing 16% yoy, primarily due to strong showing of Tensilica and other products in audio, imaging and computer vision. Cadence has a strong presence in audios like earbuds and smart speakers.Improvement in gross margin by 1.1% in 4Q19 and 60bps for FY19 was helped by its entry into systems solver space which carry a profitability profile similar to its core EDA tools.According to the upbeat earnings call for 4Q19, the management is very optimistic regarding the future potential, highlighting the 5 major waves that will drive demand. They are AI/Machine learning, 5G, hyperscaling, autonomous driving, and digital transformation on an industry level. They have mentioned that their biggest customer has been quietly building up silicon capabilities and are moving into systems analysis which will be an important driver in the future for Cadence.Their self-developed system solvers, including Clarity 3D Solver, Celsius Thermal, an EM fuel solver simulator and an electro-thermal co-simulation software, have been highly successful over the past year. The two solvers, Clarity 3D solver and Celsius Thermal is currently addressing ~$700M TAM and the company hopes to grow the TAM to beyond $5B. They have 20 customers onboard and over 90 under evaluation.1Q20 operating margin is guided to be about 30% which is slightly lower than the 31% in 4Q19 and 32% in FY19. This mainly to do with the increased headcount as they are chasing customers and TAM.FY20 operating margin is guided to be 32%-33% which is likely to express an improvement in the back half of 2020. I believe the upside will likely be driven by its expanding solvers which carry a good profitability profile.While company guidance was given in mid February ahead of the market decline and the pandemic, I believe that they can still achieve their targets as the majority of their revenue is recurring, I see impact to cash flow as minimal, and as long as it is a temporary shock, deals will probably return to normal and we should have a smooth recovery.That said, in FY19, 44% of revenue came from Americas, while 10% and 20% came from China and other Asia respectively. EMEA was 18% and Japan accounted for 8% of revenue. From this perspective, I would say more than half of the revenue is at stake because Americas and EMEA should be the last few regions to recover from the pandemic versus the earlier scenario where we thought China/Asia were to be the drag. This was probably why the stock was hit quite hard in this sell-off.Also, Cadence is more exposed to larger enterprises which is a favorable factor as exposure to SMB would mean that they would be more adversely affected during this pandemic.My view is that there will be temporary adverse impacts from travel bans even domestically in the U.S. This will affect deal-making in the short-term but this is something which will eventually recover.Given the strong rebound of late, the market has caught onto the pluses of owning Cadence - solid, recurring revenue. However, the stock is still relatively cheaper than most of the past year and fundamentals are still very solid.Track the daily increase for flattening of the curveAt this juncture, there is nothing more important than the recovery from the virus. The log chart below is starting to show some early signs of a plateau.Source: John Hopkins UniversityGlobal coordinated stimulus to further provide backstopCentral banks and governments across the world have been stepping on stimulus packages which range from providing markets with ample liquidity to outright wage pledges and flight ticket purchases. Overall, these measures will greatly improve the economic situation once pent-up demand occurs."
4310154,104888,2019-12-02T16:50:52-05:00,Strong 3Q results with beats on the top and bottom line.Breakthrough deal in IP with a marquee US semiconductor company.Further wins in hardware orders.3D EM solver gaining traction with customers already.Upside still present with positive optionality if trade uncertainty resolves.,"Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) reported strong 3Q results all round with an IP win with a marquee US semiconductor company. The company reported 3Q19 revenue of $580m, roughly 1% higher than Street and non-GAAP EPS of $0.54 which was about 6% better than Street. The stock is roughly down 10% from its recent highs, and I believe it is an attractive buy given its strong fundamental momentum.Data by YChartsThe marquee semiconductor company which the management has boasted earlier this year has started to pay dividends. On the call, it was mentioned that the customer made a large IP order in 3Q, pushing IP segment revenue to a record high of $86.9mn.Year-over-year revenue growth rates have slowed slightly in the past few quarters due to tough comparisons for its hardware segment. Still, huge IP deals helped offset the softer hardware segment. Further, the management is optimistic on the pipeline of hardware deals as inventories rise heading into the final quarter and the company still expects to see 0-5% YoY growth in its functional verification segment, implying 25%+ qoq growth in the segment.We see the Street penciling in stronger next few quarters as shown in the chart below. This would put both the YoY and 2-year revenue growth rate back in acceleration mode.Source: BloombergGross margins up slightly to about 90%3Q19 gross margin was stronger than expected at 91.6% due to hardware contribution from hardware emulation and Protium X1 FPGA-based prototyping which I believe carry higher margins than functional verification that slowed due to tough comparisons.As mentioned before, the marquee U.S. semiconductor company placed its largest IP order with the company due to its strong ongoing partnership, and the deal included its Tensilica processor family and design IP portfolio, and ultra-high-speed SerDes. Benefiting from the continuing IP outsourcing trend, Cadence had additional wins in audio, imaging, computer vision, and machine learning in its Tensilica products.A different global marquee customer purchased one of the largest hardware orders for Cadence in order for the customer to expand additional Palladium Z1 and Protium X1 capacity. In Q3, the Z1 product added eight new customers and had eight key expansions. Management believes the Protium X1 is a great complement to its Z1 and is upbeat about the robust customer interest in X1.Full verification suite wins in Q3 included a major customer in Asia and an automotive semiconductor company in EMEA.For security, its 3D EM Solver gained 4 competitive wins and more than 30 active customer engagements going forward. The product was launched in spring earlier this year and has gained traction.The company provided an updated guidance for Q4 which they expect revenue of $590-$600m, non-GAAP operating margin of about 30%, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.52-0.54. Further buyback of $75 million shares is planned.I believe the outlook is still quite solid but export controls from the United States Department of Commerce on the customers on the entity list would continue to be a headwind. Now, it's hard to speculate what might actually happen next year, and as a point of reference, in 3Q, 10% of revenue came from China compared to 12% in 2Q and 10% in 1Q.Cadence shares have begun to trade back above its 2-year historical mean if we look at the forward P/E ratio. I expect revenue growth of about 7% in FY20E, which is conservative given the relatively low volatility of Cadence's top-line compared with semiconductors, and net margin to expand slightly. This puts expected EPS in FY20E to be about $2.4 and assuming ~31x PE, we arrive at $74.4, implying upside from current levels.I believe Cadence's products are addressing fast-growing challenges that its customers face in simulation and testing which is driven strongly by growth in AI, 5G, Cloud, and IoT.There is uncertainty regarding export controls to customers in China on the entity list, but I believe the company's guidance has already factored that in, at least for the time being. I don't believe sales to China will go to zero abruptly (currently ~10% of revenue), but there is a risk. However, on the flip side, should it get resolved, there is positive optionality which I think is not embedded in the stock price.Source: Bloomberg"
4311400,25120,2019-12-09T10:35:03-05:00,"Cadence Design Systems is an undercovered beneficiary of the continued semiconductor boom.The company is well positioned and has a good track record, yet valuations have gotten a bit out of hand.I like the long-term positioning yet the valuation argument does not create a compelling risk-reward here.","Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) is a name with quite a good track record. It's a shame that I have not been covering this name before, although I briefly looked at the prospects for the firm in 2013 when it announced an interesting move at the time. The largest part of the strong share price advancement ever since has originated from higher valuation multiples, although accompanied by decent growth of the operations as well, yet the risk-reward does not look compelling here.Cadence claims to be a leader of system design enablement solutions, including hardware, software and IP. This is so-called mission-critical technology for electronic systems. Its subscription software model results in high customer renewal rates, great loyalty and thus recurring revenues.The addressable market of Cadence is just a fraction of the semiconductor sector, yet it is critical to these customers. Increasing demand for data, relating to for instance mobile, edge computing, machine learning, automotive and data centers, among others, makes this a real growth market. The company is truly a global business with great diversification between end markets. The great positioning to these growth, yet profitable segments means that Cadence has delivered on steady and impressive growth, combined with compelling margins.This positioning and execution has paid off great for long-term investors, although the definition of the ''long-term'' section matters a lot in this respect. Shares traded between $10 and $40 between the dotcom bubble and 2008, only to collapse to $2 and change during the crisis. Ever since, shares have steadily risen to $40 by the end of last year, before returning more than 50% in 2019 to a current level of $67.In October, Cadence reported results for the first nine months of the year with revenues up roughly 10% to little over $1.7 billion, making that sales will top $2.3 billion for the year. The company is immensely profitable as it reported GAAP operating earnings of $383 million for the first nine months of the year, for margins equal to 22%. Note that this is even the case as the company invested $700 million in R&D in the first nine months alone of this year already!Aided by a low double-digit tax rate, the company reported net earnings of $1.17 per share so far this year, making a number of $1.50 per share for the year very realistic. Even at $67, multiples are very high at 44 times GAAP earnings at current levels, largely driven by the huge returns seen in 2019 already. While the company reported much higher adjusted earnings, that is largely the result of stock-based compensation. Pre-tax amortisation charges run at roughly twenty cents and might be adjusted for. Even if I do that, I still end up with earnings multiples around 40 times!While the company operates with a net cash position of about a dollar, it is quite obvious that the valuation attached to the business is very large. After all, after backing out net cash, operating assets are still valued north of $18 billion, or nearly 8 times sales! While that is certainly a high multiple, it is noteworthy that sales are growing at double-digit rates at a time when the wider semi market is still seeing some struggles.The direct reason why I looked at Cadence was that of the $160 million acquisition of AWR Corp., a subsidiary of National Instruments Corp. (NATI). This software is used by microwave and RF engineers to design wireless and complex RF applications, used among others in the communication, aerospace, defense, semiconductor and related industries.No revenue contribution was announced, yet with a deal tag just below 1% of the current market capitalisation of Cadence, this looks immaterial, although it is interesting to see deal-making by the firm.When I told you at the start of this article that I wished that I would stumble upon this interesting business earlier, that statement is not really correct. In fact, I briefly checked out on the prospects for the firm in spring of 2013 when the company acquired Tensilica in a $380 million deal. In fact, shares traded at just $13 at the time, only to increase by a factor of 5 times in just about 6 years.Valued at merely $4 billion at the time, Cadence was valued at 20 times earnings and 2.6 times sales. As such it seem very evident that most of the returns seen, with shares up a factor of 5 times in just six years, comes from higher multiples rather than actual sales and earnings growth.Note that even as 2013 does not sound that long ago, typically valuations were less demanding than they are currently as mega trends from which Cadence is benefiting still were largely emerging at the time. While my neutral stance seems to have been too conservative at the time, I am much more confident in having a neutral to cautious stance at this point in time despite the current growth and rosy prospects, as valuations have risen too much to create a balanced risk-reward here."
4285091,21798,2019-08-13T09:21:12-04:00,"Cadence Design Systems has a great track record of growing revenue and earnings at an above average pace.This can continue as the EDA market is projected to grow at a strong pace over the next 7 years.However, the stock is pulling back from an overvalued and overbought valuation level.","Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) has been growing revenue and earnings at an above average pace for multiple years. I began coverage of the company back in 2013 and the stock significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (SPY) since then. The long-term future for the company looks positive as Cadence enables customers to design electronic products. There are many positive catalysts for electronic product development over multiple years.While the long-term looks positive for Cadence, there could be some short-term headwinds for the stock as a result of lower expectations for earnings growth in 2020 and a high valuation.Cadence's future business is poised to be driven by a handful of new growth technologies - 5G, AI, AR/VR, machine learning, advanced vehicles, cloud infrastructure, the internet of things (IoT), and aerospace/defense. The electronic design automation (EDA) industry in which Cadence operates is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% through 2027, according to researchandmarkets.com. That double-digit annual growth rate has the potential to help drive strong growth for Cadence over the next 7 years.Cadence makes their money by licensing their software and intellectual property, from selling or leasing their emulation and prototyping hardware technology, and from providing engineering and maintenance services for their products. The company helps customers' end products by optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, lessening the amount of time to get products to the market, and by reducing costs.The company has a great track record of exceeding their revenue and earnings estimates. The recent Q2 2019 results marked the 6th quarter in a row of exceeding earnings estimates and the 11th consecutive quarter of exceeding their revenue estimates. If you look at the earnings history at this link, you'll see that missing estimates is a rare occurrence for Cadence.There were only 2 revenue misses in the past 4.5 years. During that same time, there were no earnings misses, just one quarter where Cadence met expectations, but did not exceed estimates. Cadence's subscription-based business model provides the company with a steady stream of revenue with a high degree of predictability. So, there aren't many unpleasant surprises.Semiconductor-related companies have to constantly innovate to provide the market with what it is demanding. This is a result of Moore's Law, which states that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit double about every two years. Cadence has a strong engineering team that keeps up with this fast pace of innovation. Cadence produced 20 significant new products in the past three years.Cadence's products help their customers produce integrated circuits for end products that are constantly being updated with more advanced features. The company's high customer retention rate demonstrates their ability to maintain cutting edge design products that enables customers to produce more complex products over time.Cadence's strategy is known as system design enablement [SDE]. SDE drives the company's growth in the EDA and IP business. The strategy does this by striving to give customers increasing value while growing Cadence's market share. This is achieved through design excellence, system innovation, and by applying AI and algorithmic knowledge to the business.Cadence is likely to perform well over the long-term with all of the individual tech growth areas expected to boom in the foreseeable future. This is likely to create growing demand for Cadence's products. However, a high valuation has been reached and the technicals indicate that the stock might pull back before moving higher.This was the how the weekly stock chart looked when I first released this article to Margin of Safety Investing (MoSI) subscribers.You can see from the weekly chart that the stock was overbought according to the RSI level which exceeded 70. The MACD reached a high point and could be ready to turn lower. The biggest indicator is the decline in money flow (CMF) since May. The stock price increased since then. Therefore, if money is coming out of the stock, it hasn't been reflected yet in the price. So, a pullback looks likely according to these indicators.Look at what happened to the stock the last time money flow declined in early 2018. The stock declined about 20%.The stock did pullback about 8% since the article was first released. However, there could be more room to the downside since the stock is losing strength and did not yet reach an oversold level according to the RSI indicator. Here's the recent chart:The green MACD line is indicating a change in trend as it passed below the red signal line. Money flow has been in a declining trend since May. Previous pullbacks drove the stock below the 50-day moving average. I don't know if that will happen this time, but it is possible. If the stock drops below the $62-$63 level it could continue to drop towards the 50-day moving average.The valuation has reached lofty levels according to most metrics.source: Thomson Reuters, Capital IQ, us.spdrs.comAll of these metrics are significantly much higher than the valuation of the S&P 500. Granted, Cadence should be trading with a higher than average valuation because of their above average growth rate. However, Cadence's valuation metrics are much higher than average and at levels that might not be sustainable.Cadence is also overvalued as compared to their main competitor, Synopsys (SNPS) on 4 out of 6 valuation metrics. Both companies have much higher than average valuations.The growth stocks that I cover typically trade with PE ratios that are slightly above average. The PEG ratios which reflect the company's growth rate typically trade between 1 and 2 for the well-performing growth stocks that I've studied. These stocks tend to increase approximately in-line with earnings growth over time. Their above average growth tends to drive stock outperformance.Cadence is getting way past reasonable valuation levels with their PEG ratio almost hitting 3. Therefore, the stock performance may take a breather at these levels.Cadence has strong expected revenue growth of nearly 8% for 2019 and 7% for 2020. However, Cadence's valuation looks more like a company with much higher double-digit revenue growth. Earnings growth is expected to be 15% for 2019, but only 7% for 2020. So, it is only a matter of time before investors see the disparity between the stock's valuation and the earnings growth rate slowing to the single-digits next year.The slower growth rate might only be temporary. Of course, things could change in Cadence's strategy or in the industry which could boost the earnings growth for 2020 over the current expectations.The long-term outlook for Cadence Design Systems is positive. There are multiple growing technologies that are likely to drive demand for the company's EDA products. Cadence has a great track record for innovating and providing customers with the products that they need. That has been reflected in Cadence's above average revenue and earnings growth rates.The growing technologies (5G, AI, AR/VR, machine learning, IoT, cloud, etc.) have the potential to provide Cadence with multiple years of strong, above-average growth. This growth could last over the next decade according to industry projections.The big caveat is that Cadence's stock is beginning to drop from overbought and overvalued levels. Adding to this is the expectation of the earnings growth rate going from double-digits to the single digits in 2020. The earnings growth rate will probably get back to double-digit growth beyond 2020 as the new technologies advance and create more demand for Cadence's products.In the meantime, the technical indicators are pointing to a possible larger pullback in the stock. Large investors could be taking profits off the table after the recent run up in price. So, I don't see the stock as a buy right now. If the stock pulls back 10% to 20%, it could be a more attractive buying opportunity for a long-term position."

4279553,104720,2019-07-31T12:18:59-04:00,"Over the past ten years, revenue of Cadence has been increasing at a CAGR of 9% and EBITDA has been increasing at a CAGR of 22%.
        In the second quarter of 2019, Cadence delivered 12% YoY revenue growth, and 33.6% non-GAAP operating margin.
        As the company’s SDE strategy remains successful, it announced the next phase of the strategy, called Intelligent System Design.","Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) is a technology provider that offers its software, hardware, services and reusable IC design blocks to its customers. The company mainly has two types of customers, viz., electronic systems customers and semiconductor customers. Its electronic systems customers use its technology to develop ICs (integrated circuits) and PCBs (printed circuit boards). They also develop fully functional electronic products, such as smartphones, laptops, servers, automobiles, artificial intelligence systems, networking products and medical equipment. The ICs and PCBs are used inside the electronic products. The semiconductor customers of the company develop ICs, including memory chips, systems-on-chips (SoCs) and analog chips.The company’s core businesses are EDA (electronic design automation) and IP (intellectual property) businesses. The company's EDA offerings allow engineers to build different types of ICs. In its IP business, customers license its IP for developing their fully functional products using ICs and PCBs.Over the past ten years, the revenue of CDNS has been increasing at a CAGR of 9% and EBITDA has been increasing at a CAGR of 22%. In the second quarter of 2019, CDNS delivered 12% YoY revenue growth, better than its long-term trend. It also delivered 33.6% non-GAAP operating margin, which is encouraging.In the next three to five years, its strong design activity will be supported by multiple new technology trends, such as AI (artificial intelligence), 5G, augmented reality, virtual reality and internet of things. CDNS’ competitive advantage lies in its strength surrounding its EDA and IP businesses, where workload specific computing is driving design activity. Electronic systems companies are building custom chips for their end products instead of depending upon commodity chips.The company’s strategy, known as SDE (system design enablement), is to help its electronic systems customers develop complete and fully functional electronic products by leveraging its silicon designing capacity. The capacity is well-tested in the past. Given that CDNS remained highly successful in fueling its revenue growth at a CAGR of 9%, as mentioned above, it’s easy to understand the company has a long-term and wide moat around its silicon design capacity.The EDA tools market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.1% in the next five years. According to a report:CDNS’s growth drivers (in the form of new chip design) depend on its customers' investments in new products and new designs of existing products. Both require new chip design by CDNS. There are new and existing opportunities for its customers. New opportunities for which new chip design is required by CDNS exist in the spaces like hyperscale datacenter infrastructure, machine learning, edge computing and 5G networks when customers initiate developing new products. Existing opportunities for new chip design are available in spaces, such as datacenter servers, smartphones and networking equipment when customers begin new design projects.Rapidly improving IC manufacturing technology in general is required for every tech-supported industry, such as IT, aerospace, defense, healthcare and automobile, to name a few. The customers of CDNS can take advantage of such improvement if the company develops new products. In order to keep pace with improving IC manufacturing technology, CDNS invests in product research and development. With the advent of new technology, the demand for CDNS’ new products rises. This is a continuous process which remains active for a long time frame.CDNS is a strongly innovative company, and it continues to innovate. It has developed more than 20 significant new products in the last three years. As its SDE strategy remains successful, CDNS announced the next phase of the strategy, called Intelligent System Design. This new phase will continue to drive growth via its core EDA and IP businesses. In addition, CDNS will use its computational software expertise to expand into two new areas, (NYSE:A) system innovation, where the company will expand into new system domains, and (NYSE:B) pervasive intelligence, where it will apply AI and its algorithmic knowledge to its core businesses.Intelligent System Design strategy will expand the company’s TAM (total addressable market) from $10 billion to $30 billion in the course of the next five years. In Q1 2019 CDNS announced a strategic partnership with Green Hills Software. This partnership opened up new opportunities worth $3 billion. In April the company entered the system analysis market with an estimated $4.5 billion TAM opportunity.CDNS has a very aggressive and prudent management team in terms of product development. CDNS’ peer group includes Synopsys (SNPS), Keysight Technologies (KEYS) and Analog Devices (ADI). CDNS’ ROE and ROA are 31.37% and 11.21% respectively, compared to Synopsys’ 16.88% and 4.43%, Keysight’s 10.30% and 6.28%, and Analog’s 13.66% and 5.57% respectively. CDNS’ ROIC is 15.25%, compared to Synopsys’ 6.59%, Keysight’s 8.55%, and Analog’s 6.70%. CDNS is using its capital more prudently compared to its peers.During Q1, CDNS repurchased $81 million of its shares and during Q2 it bought back $75 million of its shares. The company is moderately shareholder friendly since it repurchases shares but doesn’t pay dividend.CDNS’s non-GAAP forward PE ratio and trailing 12-month P/CF ratio is 35.28x and 31.62x respectively, compared to Synopsys’ 31.64x and 32.78x, Keysight’s 21.47x and 23.27x, and Analog’s 23.37x and 19.00x respectively. CDNS’s trailing 12-month price to sales ratio is 9.20x, compared to Synopsys’ 6.35x, Keysight’s 4.10x, and Analog’s 7.37x (at the time of writing). Clearly, CDNS is richly valued in the near-term.Investors should remember that CDNS is a long-term (three to five years) growth story, and therefore relative valuation isn’t very important. Instead, profitability ratios are more important (as mentioned above). In terms of the profitability ratios, CDNS is very attractive. Is the stock a buy for long-term shareholders at the current price? In my opinion, no. I believe they should wait for a pullback. The company announced positive news during Q1 earnings, and that is acting as strong catalyst for the stock’s upward movement. The news was that, (A) CDNS entered the system analysis market with an estimated $4.5 billion TAM opportunity, and it introduced its first product for this market, known as Clarity3D Solver, which is an advanced solution for electromagnetic field simulation. Clarity3D Solver delivers up to 10x faster simulation performance compared to rival products without compromising accuracy. (B) The company announced the next phase of its SDE strategy, as mentioned above, called Intelligent System Design. However, I believe the catalyst will gradually weaken, and a better entry point to buy the stock will be available.Furthermore, CDNS belongs to a cyclical industry (semiconductor industry), which has historically experienced cyclical revenue and we maybe nearing the top of a cycle. This will offer long-term investors ample time to buy the CDNS stock. The good news is that although the semiconductor industry is cyclical, CDNS is not. In the past ten years CDNS has grown its revenue secularly at a CAGR of 9%. Now let’s derive the stocks long-term (five year) valuation. CDNS’s 2019 mid-year revenue is $2259.5 million. The company has grown at a CAGR of 9% over the last 10 years, as stated above. At 9% CAGR the company’s 2024 mid-year revenue will be $3500 million or $12.49 per share. At 9x price to sales ratio (today's price to sales ratio), the stock’s 2024 price will be $112.41.The next phase of CDNS’ SDE strategy, which is known as Intelligent System Design, is its new growth engine. It will expand the company’s TAM from $10 billion to $30 billion in the next five years. CDNS is a highly innovative company with a prudently aggressive management team. I would recommend long-term investors to buy the stock on dips."
4273533,104888,2019-07-05T08:12:39-04:00,"Revenue guidance raised on new product successes.New intelligent system design strategy opens up $10-30bn TAM.Emulation hardware and design IP were strong segments.Gross margins are a bit weak, but opex is well controlled to offset.Further share buyback will provide support as a buy.","Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) has been performing spectacularly despite uncertainty involving global trade disruption and high valuations. In the last year, it outperformed the broad semiconductor ETF by about 60%! But, as I've written in my past article, Cadence has been posting strong beats, driven strongly by new products, which opens up larger addressable markets and good cost control.Data by YChartsCadence reported 1Q19 revenue of $576.7M vs. Street's expectations of $569.3M while non-GAAP EPS of $0.54 was ahead of Street's $0.49.Product & maintenance grew 13.1% yoy to $544M while services slowed -9.5% to $33M.Adjusted gross margin is about ~88%, which is weaker than the 90% previously guided to due to higher contribution from hardware sales which typically carry lower margins.On the earnings call, management highlights that its digital and sign-off business grew 12% yoy in revenue, helped by new customer wins, and proliferation by existing customers at advanced nodes. Its IP business also showed similar double-digit growth rates as Tensilica added eight new customers during the quarter and continued to win sockets for machine learning, vision and audio applications in the automotive, consumer and surveillance segments.In light of new customer wins and repeated orders, the company raised full-year guidance by about $30M to $2.305 billion to $2.335 billion, which is about 9% growth yoy. It expects non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.04 to $2.12, which at the midpoint implies ~60% yoy growth.The growth rate in revenue slowed slightly in 1Q compared with 4Q, which was mainly due to lumped up hardware sales which were very strong in 4Q. This has been expected as I wrote before in my last article.Source: Bloomberg1Q adjusted EBIT margin hit 32%, which shows good cost control. Admin, R&D and marketing expenses have been trending lower as a percentage of revenue. Cadence is well on track to deliver FY19E EBIT margin guidance of 30-31%.Cadence has been actively exploring new growth areas in the system innovation space. This is evidenced by its strategic partnership with Green Hills Software, which brings an estimated $3bn of new opportunities in the embedded system, safety and security space. Similarly, Cadence entered into the predicted ~$4.5bn system analysis market with its new Clarity 3D Solver product that may disrupt existing electromagnetic simulation solutions with flexible delivery such as the cloud. However, this also opens up new competition with incumbents like Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS).Cadence is currently trading about 34x forward earnings, which puts it at record highs. It has generally negated much of the weakness that Huawei ban and uncertain global trade brought upon semiconductor companies as recent as May. Downstream customers are forced to continue to innovate, design, and test new products, which provides a long-lasting stream of demand for Cadence's product suites.The company expects to repurchase $75M per quarter for the remainder of 2019 which should provide a strong support for its shares.I think Cadence's growth profile is very robust as evidenced by its stable revenue growth and increasing operating leverage through cost improvements. New growth areas help boost the top line further. Therefore, I still think the company's shares are worth holding.Source: Bloomberg"
3896106,21798,2016-02-15T10:45:05-05:00,Cadence is poised to perform well over the long term.The stock trades below its intrinsic value and below peers on an EV/FCF basis.I expect the stock to outperform the S&P 500 due to the company's above average growth.,"Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) is a key player in the tech world. The company makes electronic design software that is used in the semiconductor and electronics industries. Cadence also produces prototyping and emulation hardware, verification intellectual property and design intellectual property. The company's software allows customers to design whole electronics systems and complex integrated circuits (ICs). The value in Cadence's products is that it allows customers to reduce the time that it takes to bring electronic systems to market and reduces design, development and manufacturing costs.Cadence has attractive fundamentals that are likely to drive the stock higher and outperform the averages for at least the next two years. Revenue is expected to grow 7% in 2016 and 6% in 2017 according to consensus. Earnings are expected to grow at about 11% annually for both years. The S&P 500 is only expected to grow earnings at about 5% or 6% annually over the same period.The company's strong ROE of 18.6% will help drive Cadence's above average earnings growth. Cadence consistently produces strong free cash flow which is used for share repurchases. The stock buybacks boost EPS and make shares more valuable for shareholders. There is $960 million remaining on the current share repurchase plan, which will probably be used within about a year. That is equal to about 16% of the current market cap of $5.95 billion. Therefore, the buyback is likely to help boost the stock.Cadence just beat estimates for its top and bottom lines for Q4. The company is performing well even in a challenging environment. Cadence expects to continue its strong performance through effective execution. That will provide customers with solutions that will ultimately save them money, but also allow them to produce quality products.Over 90% of the company's revenue is recurring (based on 2015 sales) as the company stated in the Q4 conference call. This is a primary reason that Cadence has consistently grown operating and free cash flow. The growth in free cash flow will be positive for shareholders since it is used for share repurchases. The share repurchases will reduce share dilution, thus putting upward pressure on the stock price.Internet of Things Trend as CatalystCadence is positioned to benefit from the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is the connection of various devices to the internet. More products are being connected to the internet so that users have more intelligent control over certain things. For example, the Nest brand thermostats, security cameras and smoke alarms can be connected to the internet so that activity can be monitored remotely on smartphones. Another example is systems for vehicles such as dash autopiloting. IoT is increasingly being implemented in numerous industries for a variety of applications. The technology for IoT involves complex circuits and Cadence provides the software that allows its customers to design and produce them.Cadence has a variety of solutions to capitalize on IoT including: mixed signal, low power, advanced node, automotive, 3D-IC, system to silicon verification, full flow digital and photonics. The company also offers various design and support services so that customers get the full guidance that they need.The trend toward more IoT applications will last for many years. One relatively recent company announcement explained that Cadence is developing a reference system with ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) that targets IoT systems. This reference system includes frequently used functions required in an IoT platform that hosts sensors, actuators and wireless connectivity. The combination of Cadence and ARM working together will make it faster for customers to bring IoT products to market with less risk.There are many applications for IoT in various industries that will likely create growing business opportunities for Cadence for many years. This is why I think that the company and the stock will benefit for multiple years over the long term.Attractive ValuationCadence stands out in its industry with an attractive valuation and the highest growth among its closest competitors. Here's how Cadence compares to its peers:Data: Seeking Alpha, Yahoo FinanceAlthough Mentor Graphics has an attractive valuation, Cadence's higher expected growth is likely to drive the stock to outperform its competitors. One key metric to point out is that Cadence has the lowest EV/FCF due to the company's strong free cash flow. Cadence's FCF is what the company uses for its buybacks. The buybacks help boost EPS, which has helped Cadence to meet/beat its earnings expectations and it should help the company to do so in the future. That is likely to give the stock continued positive momentum.Since Cadence has strong FCF growth, I performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the stock's intrinsic value. I used 10% as the discount rate, since that is the market's long-term annual return that we aim to beat. I projected that Cadence would grow FCF at an average of 11% annually for the next five years, which is in-line with expected earnings growth. I then projected annual FCF growth of 5% for years 6-10, and 3% annual growth thereafter. The calculation produced an intrinsic value of $24. This is 18% higher than the current price of $20.28. This reinforces the stock's attractive valuation.The RisksThe industry is competitive, so investors need to be aware that if competitors offer discounts on their software/IP, then Cadence will be under pressure to lower prices. That would lower the amount of Cadence's total revenue.Since about 55% of the company's revenue is derived from outside the United States, Cadence faces currency headwinds. If the value of the dollar rises against foreign currencies where Cadence operates, it could have a negative effect on operating results.ConclusionGiven Cadence's strong likelihood to remain a go-to company for the IoT, I think that the company will continue to grow revenue and earnings for multiple years. The attractive valuation and strong, steady above average earnings growth will drive the stock to outperform the S&P 500 going forward. I think a reasonable one-year price target for the stock is $24, which is an 18% gain from the current price. The growth in the stock price is based on earnings growth plus a boost from buybacks and some multiple expansions. Overall, Cadence should be a multi-year investment that is likely to outperform the broader market.If you like my analysis, click on FOLLOW at the top of the article near my name.

4161801,76425,2018-04-09T09:56:28-04:00,"CDNS is dominant in digital design IP and has grown market share in other areas.Demand for new innovations and products in IoT, A.I., cloud, security, and mobile devices is fueling the semiconductor industry boom.CDNS has outstanding free cash flow generation, making it an attractive acquisition target.","Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) provides integrated system and electronic device solutions primarily to the semiconductor industry. The stock price has steeply declined from its highs. I believe that the reason for the selloff was fear that earnings growth has slowed.My investment thesis is:Major competition in the EDA industry comes from Synopsys (SNPS) and Mentor Graphics (NASDAQ:MENT) which was acquired by Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) last year. Other competitors include small EDA companies, companies with EDA capability such as Ansys (ANSS), and electronic design, consulting and IP firms.What makes CDNS unique is its philosophy to provide its customers with solutions ranging from the smallest element to complete systems. It has swallowed up a ton of smaller companies and continually increases its R&D expenditure in the absence of acquisitions in order to maintain this ability.The company has a dominating market leadership position of 80% in IC custom design, is also the leader with over 70% market share of the emulation market and maintains a strong presence in digital IC design/signoff, system interconnect, and IP.Demand for CDNS products is being fueled by the demand for new innovations and products in IoT, A.I., cloud, security, and mobile devices. In the words of CEO Lip-Bu Tan, ""The Data Driven Economy is emerging as the new paradigm and has key underlying technology waves including mobile, cloud/data center, edge computing and automotive.""The 2017 10-K reported growth in all market segments except one. The company experienced a slow start in the fiscal year for its emulation hardware products. CDNS business model is built on recurring revenue and ratable sales. This model allows for reliable and accurate earnings forecasts. CDNS reported that sales in emulation hardware picked up in subsequent quarters resulting in a healthy backlog. In previous years, backlogs have resulted in 70% of revenues for subsequent reporting periods. Management guidance for fiscal 2018 is $1.62 to $1.72 per share. Applying a PE of 30 results in a stock price in the 50s, 30% higher than the current price.CDNS has partnership relationships with companies that it also competes with. I believe that one of these companies is a likely acquirer as the transaction would result in being accretive to earnings through cost reduction and end a bipolar relationship.CDNS is one of only two major remaining players in the EDA arena and commands a higher multiple than Mentor Graphics which was acquired at a 21% premium to its market price. Mentor's products are considered lower quality than Cadence's, and Mentor Graphics did not dominate any market sector as does CDNS.What makes CDNS an attractive acquisition is not only its market presence but also its strong cash flow generation. CDNS reported $693 million in cash and investments as of the end of the calendar year with free cash flow of $471 million for the fiscal year. The chart below illustrates the extended free cash flow rise.80% of the cash is overseas. The new tax laws make for a compelling case that the funds may be used in the U.S. as almost half of the semiconductor companies surveyed by KMPG responded that they are most optimistic about business in the U.S.CDNS Free Cash Flow Per Share (TTM) data by YChartsThe boost in free cash flow is being supported by an active shareholder friendly share buyback program whereby the company has been buying back $50 million per quarter.The stock price is about 25% off its high and below the 200-day moving average.CDNS data by YChartsBut the stock has had a nice 5-year run.CDNS data by YChartsThe selloff is based on fears of a slowdown in growth that appear to be overblown. The strong free cash flow growth coupled with the strong market position in a growth industry provide sound arguments for investment. I do not recommend buying stocks that are declining in price. There is no telling where the bottom will be. The technical picture will provide a clear buying signal. Look for a spike in trading volume on a lower trading day or for the stock price to climb above the 200-day moving average. The fundamental picture suggests a stock price 30% higher.Downside risk is in the uncertainties of the overall market and is always present for high tech companies competing in a quickly changing arena. The company is dependent on maintaining an edge on new product introduction and development, and there is no guarantee that it will succeed in this endeavor."
4065908,21798,2017-04-27T01:57:07-04:00,"Cadence’s positive momentum can continue due to a broad range of applications for their products.
        Cadence has a specific multi-point strategy to drive growth.
        Cadence is valued fairly in the industry, which will allow the stock to grow as earnings increase.","Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) is a company that I’ve been covering that has performed well. I expect the stock to continue to outperform as a result of the bright outlook for the company’s products. There are a wide variety of applications for Cadence’s products. Cadence’s strategy will help drive growth for these various applications. Cadence just reported a 6.5% increase in revenue to $477 million and a 47% increase in GAAP net income per share to $0.25 for Q1 2017. Although these are great results, the company’s guidance for Q2 triggered a sell-off after hours on Monday April 24, 2017. The stock declined 4.6%. I see this as an over-reaction and a buying opportunity. The after-hours sell-off was caused by the company guiding lower than consensus for Q2. Cadence’s revenue guidance was $470 million to $480 million, which is below consensus estimates of $480.6 million. The guidance for non-GAAP EPS was $0.31 to $0.33, which is below consensus of $0.34. Image source: memedad.comThe reason why I think the sell-off is a buying opportunity on this news is because the company’s outlook looks bright for the long-term. Another reason is because Cadence is reaffirming guidance for the full year that is consistent with consensus estimates. Cadence expects full year revenue to be $1.9 billion to $1.95 billion, with consensus at $1.93 billion. The company’s range for full year non-GAAP EPS is $1.34 - $1.42, with consensus at $1.38. So, while the company may experience a quarter with results below consensus, Cadence is likely to perform well for the longer-term. High Growth OpportunitiesThere are numerous high-growth areas that Cadence is poised to benefit from: automotive, virtual/augmented reality, cloud infrastructure, the Internet of Things [IoT], machine learning, aerospace, and defense. Cadence is focusing its strategy to benefit from these high-growth areas.Vehicles are becoming more advanced with a significant amount of electronics. Virtual/augmented reality is forecast to grow to $120 billion by 2020 from levels below $20 billion in 2017. Worldwide spending for cloud services is expected to grow at a 19.4% CAGR through 2019. IoT is expected to grow at an impressive CAGR of 32.6% by 2020. The U.S. spends about $600 billion on defense efforts. So, Cadence is likely to benefit by focusing on these growth areas. Cadence enables customers to design electronic products. The company’s main strategy is known as System Design Enablement [SDE]. Through SDE, Cadence focuses on providing its offerings to growing industries. This includes licensing its software & intellectual property [IP] and selling/leasing its emulation & prototyping hardware to electronic systems and semiconductor companies. Since technology changes rapidly, Cadence’s products are likely to see continued strong demand. As part of its strategy, Cadence is leveraging its IP for scalable growth. The company is expecting 10% growth for IP in 2017. Electronics companies are constantly innovating their products. Cadence makes the process easier through its offerings. Valuation Cadence is trading about 21X expected EPS of $1.50 for 2018 (consensus). The valuation improved after the 4.6% sell-off after the earnings report. This was an over-reaction in my opinion. The sell-off was triggered by Cadence guiding lower than consensus for Q2 revenue and EPS. However, the company didn’t change its full-year outlook, which is positive for the company and the stock for the long term. Cadence is now trading about 10% below the Application Software industry’s average forward PE of 23.4. Here’s how Cadence compares to its peers in the industry with similar market caps: Data Source: Finviz.comCadence is trading below most of its industry peers with the exception of OpenText. This shows that Cadence is reasonably valued at the current price. The recent pullback in the stock is likely to be a good buying opportunity for the long-term (one or more years). OpenText also looks like a viable investment. OpenText is expected to grow earnings annually at double-digit rates for this year and next year. OpenText is a key software provider for cloud computing that is obtaining a lot of its growth through acquisitions. With the stock attractively undervalued in the industry, Open Text’s acquisitions are not fully priced in. ConclusionCadence’s focus on high growth industries is likely to lead to steady top line and bottom line growth for at least this year and next year. Although the company faces a competitive environment, Cadence can get its piece of the pie through its SDE strategy, focusing on high growth industries.The recent pullback has the stock valued reasonably, creating an attractive entry point. With a fair valuation and double-digit expected earnings growth for 2017 and 2018, I expect the stock to achieve double-digit annual growth over the next two years."

(NASDAQ:CDNS) are up over 25% from their opening price of $20.00 on the first trading day of 2016. Prices reached their 52-week highs of 26.45 on Monday after the stock was upgraded to a buy status from its previous neutral status by DA Davidson. The news comes as new analysis of electronic design automation (EDA) industry fundamentals and leaner operating models are causing renewed optimism in the long-term potential of EDA stocks and a new belief in the appropriateness of using a higher multiple to value premium semiconductor-related stocks such as CDNS.A Highly Profitable Industry With Little CompetitionCadence produces software and design tools used heavily by semiconductor companies. Their revenue sources are largely based on software subscription fees making revenue predictions relatively predictable. Another benefit of Cadence's business is relatively stable demand in growth of semiconductor design and production. The number of electronic devices owned by consumers has continued to rise over the last few years and Cadence has benefited from it. Behind the design and testing of those semiconductors is typically once of three companies: Cadence, Synopsys (SNPS), or Mentor Graphics (MENT). With only three major players, the market is undersaturated in a business where demand is relatively quantifiable. One of the risks Cadence faces is a loss of new users to new market entries. The industry is one with high barriers to entry that requires engineers to hold lots of specialized knowledge and experience mitigating those risks or, at least, making new competitors visible early on in the process of entering the space.400G, USB Type-C and DSC Protocol Support.On Monday, the company further announced a new set of software features aimed at allowing engineers to more quickly verify that designs produced in Cadence's design software meet the specifications for the latest standard protocols. The new features allow for the facilitation of growth in bandwidth-intensive products such as streaming video and cloud computing in consumer products such as cars and trucks, mobile phones and tablets, business and consumer products and more. The company's reach spans just about every electronic device related consumer industry. They are very much a seller of shovels in a gold rush.By adding updated standards, Cadene allows for expanded production of in-demand consumer protocols such as 400G Ethernet, USB Type-C, and Display Stream Compression (DSC), a technology which compresses images and videos making file sizes smaller in turn reducing data costs and increasing accessibility for mobile users.Cadence Is In A Strong Financial Position In A Growth Industry.Among the reasoning behind the decision to upgrade the stock's ratings comes from newly found appreciation for the relative stability and improved cash flow metrics of the market as well as the shrugging of the perceived volatility of the industry. Cadence's strengths lay in balance sheet fundamentals such as reasonable debt levels, revenue growth, return on equity (21.48%) and stock price performance. The firm's 50-day moving average is $25.20 with the 200-day moving average hovering at about $24.45. It is important to note, however, the stock's 52-week low is $18.32 compared to its 52-week high of 26.44, which was set this morning.Despite the new sentiment, however, EDA stocks are still trading significantly lower relative to engineering software giants Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) and Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS), which places Cadence's stock in a unique position due to EDA software's critical role in semiconductor chip design in a market that's likely to see growth with the increasing automation of cars and the growth of IoT products. The company has had below industry growth in net income (14.52% net margin) which has been holding the stock price back creating the opportunity for the recent rally.The Bottom LineIn the last quarter, RBC Capital Markets and Bank of America have restarted an ""outperform"" rating with targets of $29 and $30, respectively, while hedge funds such as Invicrus RG, Daiwa Securities Group, Strs Ohio and Penserra Capital Management have increased their positions in the stock. Cadence offers strong business fundamentals, positive cash flow, and the luxury of being at the center a growth industry. CDNS is a buy opportunity for investors interested in a stock that reflects the growth of consumer electronic devices."
4002863,102162,2016-08-30T15:41:58-04:00,EDA industry is an oligopoly with strong pricing strength.New product cycles in Digital IC and Emulation to drive strong YoY growth.M&A-driven R&D headwinds overblown; 40% revs from system companies; growth to re-accelerate.IP Licensing business a hidden asset; grew >40% 5-year CAGR to $200M in FY15.$720M buyback to shrink share count by >10% vs. >5% dilution in 2014/2015.,"Description: Cadence (NASDAQ:CDNS) provides software and hardware design tools, intellectual property, and verification services to semiconductor firms (60% revenues) and system companies (40% revenues).Investment Thesis: Cadence is a high-margin (89% Gross Margins) ""subscription software"" company with strong revenue predictability and a long-term ratable business model, currently trading at low hardware-like multiples. The Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry has consolidated into an oligopoly with three main players, outperforming the semiconductor sector over the past decade. The business is characterized by high margins, strong free cash flow, high barriers to entry, and low capital intensity levels. CDNS is a 20% FCF margin business, with Net Income to FCF conversion > 100%. It grew FCF 20% in 2015, and has guided to 20% growth (conservative) again this year. Stock is trading at 4.8% TTM FCF yield, growing to 6.8% yield for FY17. Cadence's licensing business is a hidden asset, having grown at a >40% CAGR from $50M to >$200M in revenues last 5 years. Our work suggests M&A-driven R&D headwind concerns are overblown. Indeed, 40-50% revenues are from system companies (e.g Alphabet, Apple, etc.); 7-8% revenues/bookings growth in 2015 against a backdrop of negative industry growth rates proves the resiliency in business model.Catalysts: Immediate catalysts include strong growth in Digital IC (up 17% YoY FY16 Q1) and Functional Verification (emulation) (up 23% YoY FY16 Q1) categories driven by new product cycles, cyclical re-acceleration in semiconductor growth, and a $720M buyback shrinking share count by 10.5% YoY (vs. 4% and 2% dilution in 2014 and 2015). This compares favorably to 2014 and 2015, when share count went up 5.4% (despite $430M share buyback) due to equity dilution to warrant and convertible note holders (notes expired in 2015).EDA SectorThe EDA sector has poor sell-side analyst coverage and general investor apathy due to the high technical complexity of the industry involved. This is a high quality collection of software businesses with high market share and high switching costs. The sticky user base is due to productivity losses incurred in learning new tools. (If a start-up introduced a new Excel competitor but you couldn't use your macros or keyboard shortcuts, and with possible compatibility issues with older files, would you switch to save costs?)Given current valuation, stock is pricing in modest growth with M&A headwinds, but not the optionality of strong appreciation should cyclical industry growth resume. Given the high FCF and stable business attributes, the business is also a great candidate for M&A or PE takeover.Company DescriptionCadence provides hardware and software design tools and verification services as well as intellectual property (IP) blocks to semiconductor firms. Some of Cadence's products are the solutions of choice for their end markets: Virtuoso for analog, Jasper for formal (equivalence) verification, and Palladium for emulation. Other names include Innovus, Encounter, Tensilica, Voltus, Allegro, etc.Figure 1: Cadence Geographic and Revenue mix (2015 Revenues)The revenue and geographic mix for Cadence is given above. Cadence's core strength has been Custom IC Design (up 74% 2011-2015) and Interconnect (up 78% 2011-2015). Japan revenues were down 21% from 2011-2015 due to FX and cyclical headwinds, but have started growing again recently.Investment Thesis1. The EDA Industry is an Oligopoly with strong pricing strength: The Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry has consolidated through M&A into three main players (Synopsis, Cadence, Mentor Graphics), resulting in pricing power and has outperformed the semiconductor industry over the last decade. In fact, Mentor is a much smaller player and uncompetitive in several sectors. Moreover, within EDA sub-verticals, each company has a dominant market share. This slide from 2011 shows that the #1 supplier in each EDA product segment averages 66% market share. The industry has further consolidated since that time.Figure 2: EDA sub-segments and market share (Source: Mentor Graphics)We expect EDA's share of semiconductor revenues to continue to rise, after declining for almost a decade. The industry thus faces a favorable pricing environment. We have heard some contract renewals being negotiated at 25% higher price; industry clearly believes there's value to be captured.2. Growth should reaccelerate: Optically, Cadence's revenue growth has been deaccelerating due to end-markets and product cycle related headwinds. We believe growth will accelerate from here. Our rough math (assuming 40% incremental operating income) suggests every 100 bps uptick in organic growth to be worth $0.03 in incremental EPS.In a backdrop of a semiconductor industry with negative growth in 2015, Cadence grew revenues 7.7% and bookings 7%. As we get a cyclical upturn in various end-markets, Cadence could easily hit mid-teens revenue growth (average from 2012-2014), especially when we consider share gains in emulation and digital IC design tools.Figure 3: Cadence Bookings and RevenuesWhile the 2015 industry unit-growth of 10% was similar to 2014, the revenue growth was masked by FX headwinds. With automotive content growth, replacement demand in mobile and PCs, consumer growth in emerging markets, we believe semiconductors should deliver 3-4% revenue growth over the next 3-5 years. This is not factoring in any growth in EDA spend from the rising demand from Chinese semiconductor firms.3. R&D M&A headwind concerns overdone: Over the years, there have been a number of secular concerns that have turned out untrue for the overall growth of the EDA industry. First, there was the concern of ""secular trend"" towards the usage of ""programmable chips"" (i.e. FPGAs) vs. ASICs. The second concern was R&D spend shifting towards Asia with patchy record of intellectual property enforcement. Moreover, there was concern about round-the-clock R&D effort reducing the number of licenses needed for simultaneous users.The latest concern is US semiconductor M&A impacting R&D spending which hurts EDA spend. If you look at the big M&A announced last year, the estimated impact of R&D cuts would be <2% of total R&D. Further, 40% of Cadence revenues are from non-semiconductor system companies. Thus, the actual headwind for CDNS should be roughly 1% from M&A.To better understand the unit economics behind R&D, we believe it is imperative to understand two main drivers behind R&D spend. First is the per-seat R&D spend to enable productive engineering resources. Second is the aggregate R&D spend driven by new chip-design activities on tools, masks, computing resources, etc. (So if on aggregate a new chip costs $20M in R&D, it is largely this expense we are talking about.) Given our view that engineers will largely remain in demand and employed, the first should remain sticky, while the second will face headwinds. Cadence, largely due to its strength in analog, is more levered to the first trend, and Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) to the second. We like this cyclical resiliency.Rising complexity has driven higher spend, largely on masks, tools and services.Figure 4: Design costs rising rapidly (Source: IHS)4. Functional Verification (Emulation) and Digital IC Segment (55% Revs) growth rates accelerating:Figure 5: Functional Verification and Digital IC Design Segments (55% Revs) Growth YoY%Functional verification segment includes design and verification building blocks which Cadence provides and are used to accelerate design cycles. It also includes Palladium, Cadence's hardware-based verification solution (emulation). Emulation is a technology used by chip companies to verify that their chips work in the context of the system and software that they would be designed into. Cadence is an emulation leader and its emulation solution (Palladium) is a jewel in its product suite. It has a new product, Palladium 2, whose refresh should drive a product cycle in this category.While street is fixated on M&A curtailing R&D spend, we believe emulation spend would be driven by growth vectors like virtual reality, gaming, GPUs, computer vision and ADAS; all computationally intensive end-markets where emulation has historically proven its time-to-market advantages. A random search for emulation job listings in the Bay Area shows companies like Apple, Intel, Xilinx and Broadcom investing heavily in their respective emulation efforts.Digital IC Design: We believe that Cadence is gaining share in digital (currently a Synopsys stronghold) due to new products and management. The new SVP, Anirudh Devgan, is a known industry veteran, and has helped CDNS launch new products (Tempus, Voltus, Quantus, Innovus) to explicitly target and grow market-share in this category, as can be seen from recent growth rates.5. Intellectual Property segment is a hidden asset: Cadence is the fourth largest Intellectual Property provider after ARM (ARM), Imagination (OTCPK:IGNMF) and Synopsys. It has made strategic acquisitions like Denali and Tensilica and is currently the dominant provider of several important IP blocks used in a system-on-chip. Licensing and royalty businesses are pure-profit businesses and are valued at very high multiples in the market. Licensing business has grown from $50M run-rate to a >$200M annual revenue business.Both Synopsys and Cadence have targeted low double-digit growth for this segment (though last couple of quarters have been slow for Cadence).Figure 6: Gartner IP Growth forecast; CDNS IP Revenues6. Dominant position in Custom IC Design (analog): The Custom Design tool segment consists of analog tools and the company's platform (Virtuoso) is the dominant industry standard in this segment. Cadence has been an industry leader in providing analog design tools. It has a large captive analog engineering design community who has learned design using Cadence tools. There is an enormous switching cost involved for companies and employees, and Cadence tools thus tend to be very sticky. Cadence has been using its analog strength to cross sell other products as well (through an ""integrated flow"" and other such bundled features).7. Share count dilution headwinds due to dilutive convertible notes are past: Cadence issued convertible notes due in 2013 ($144M) and 2015 ($350M). It also entered into a separate warrant transaction (2015 Warrants) for purchase of 46.8M shares at $10.78 per share. Due to these warrants, Cadence issued 23.1M shares of common stock to the 2015 Warrant counter parties. These were highly dilutive to share count; despite buying back $430M worth of stock in FY2014 and FY2015, share count went up by 5.4% over the period. They were thus a terrible drain on cash flow with no real return to shareholders. Going forward, we don't see any further dilution except the stock-based compensation dilution of ~1.5%/year. Cadence has $720M in share buybacks remaining; current share-count guide for FY16 implies a 10.5% YoY reduction in float.8. Turnaround story with expanding margins: Lip Bu Tan, the Cadence CEO, has been a venture capitalist for almost 30 years. Appointed in 2010, the new management moved Cadence to a long-term ratable business model with strong predictability and pricing discipline in their revenue streams. With 3-4% semiconductor industry growth rates, 2%/year EDA share gain and a 1-1.5% Cadence turnaround growth rate, Cadence should grow revenues by at least 7-8%.9. Comparative analysis between Cadence, Synopsys and Mentor Graphics Favors CadenceMentor: We believe Mentor (NASDAQ:MENT) is a sub-scale competitor to both Cadence and Synopsys; primarily a monopoly on the digital implementation tool Caliber. There might be a take-out value to Mentor (i.e. Icahn), but we believe that is fairly well known. Mentor screens cheap on valuation metrics, but it's a lower quality name.Synopsys: Synopsys is a worthy competitor to Cadence, with potentially higher share of high-margin, low capital intensity businesses like IP licensing. We find Cadence's analog products to be stickier based on strong product preferences. Secondly, any R&D headwind should first manifest itself in fewer new design activities and fewer tape-outs. Synopsys, through products like Design Compiler and Prime-Time, is more levered to chip tape-out activities and should thus face stronger headwinds should M&A lower new chip design activity. We also believe Cadence is a more catalyst-rich name at these levels for reasons mentioned elsewhere. Finally, with 60% revenues from Digital IC Design ($1.35B), Synopsys has a lot more to lose in terms of market share loss.Interestingly, Synopsys and ARM are the two biggest vendors in intellectual property and compete aggressively against each other. This naturally results in closer partnerships between ARM and Cadence, and a desire on the part of ARM to help Cadence succeed.Cadence is slightly more expensive to Synopsys:But, it has had better margins, better growth rates and, importantly, higher incremental margins as well.Figure 7: CDNS, MENT SNPS Margins, Valuations, Growth RatesWe only need to look at the gross and operating margin improvements to see that Cadence has been the biggest beneficiary of the industry consolidation and technology trends discussed here. CDNS has gone from below average gross and operating margins to leading margins in a span of 5-7 years.Steady EBIT margin expansion over the last 5 years as business model shows operating leverage:Figure 8: CDNS EBIT Margins and YoY Change (2012-2016)Valuation and stock driversCadence screens cheap on FCF yield basis vs. historical range. Management guide for Operating Cash Flow implies 20% FCF growth in 2016; we believe they will easily exceed that number.Figure 13: CDNS FCF and CFO (2011-2016)We feel the stock is worth $29, or 17x FY17 EPS of $1.60 plus cash.Misc. FactorsThe rise of vertically integrated silicon providers and IP reuse: Technology companies like Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Oracle are vertically integrating and increasingly designing their own chips as a product differentiation strategy. This represents a new and growing source of revenues for Cadence.Expansion into adjacent markets: A number of these tools are ""checklist"" tools that qualify code, product or designs towards certain quality levels early in the design process. Leveraging common R&D and sales channel resources, these can potentially be used in adjacent markets. Indeed, Synopsys has expanded into security software, Mentor Graphics into transportation and automotive, and Cadence into Aerospace designs.Moore-stress could lower R&D intensity levels: Cadence has grown R&D expenses by 50% last 3 years and R&D intensity levels to 38% of revenues. Any reduction in R&D intensity levels due to Moore stress and slower technology node transitions will drive margin expansion and higher profitability.Investment risks"

Total sales have reached all-time highs on the back of demand drive by favorable technology trends,CEO Lip-Bu Tan, February 27th 2019 Earnings Conference CallThere's potential for further earnings growth as back in 2012 the company reported even greater net income on $500M fewer sales. However I maintain a conservative outlook on the business as the price of 8 times sales is no discounted asking price. My view: As the price the company is trading at reflects a substantial premium to their fair value, according to my numbers.While there's substantial tangible book value here at $400M, with $533M of net worth in cash and equivalents, today's ask for the business is way high at a $16.41B market capitalization. The business collected less than $2 per share in free cash flow during the last year's time and we're seeing the best performance this company has ever put out.Trading at over $58 per share, the market is pricing the business at 24 times the cash flows of the company's best year on record. At an earnings multiple of 24, exceeding the S&P 500's average P/E of 21, any slowdown in earnings, whether through competition, market saturation, or economic slowdown, will put a lot of pressure on the price of this business from these all-time highs.My pricing model puts the fair value of the business at $29.08. The primary factor is the estimation this business will generate $540M free cash flow or more every year over the next 20 years. Also indicated is the maximum estimated market value of $54.89, which when exceeded, indicates the stock's rally is potentially overextended state. In summary, everything will have to turn up roses for the market to continue trading this stock at such a high earnings multiple.Keep in mind, they generated $540M of free cash flow during this record-breaking year and are trading at $16.41B - priced at 32 years of free cash flow.Contrary to my expectations, earnings growth may continue unabated as the company is directly engaged with markets widely forecast to continue growing.The narrative is straightforward: Cadence designs components for devices expected to sell well in the Internet of things, AI, 5G, and data center niches.However we see all the time how just because a macro trend is favorable - let's choose data center growth - doesn't mean the business we're talking about is going to incrementally grow earnings going forward.Foremost among these busted narrative examples I present Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) which soared throughout 2017 because of a storyline that boiled down to ""they sell networking cords and the data center needs networking cords."" The stock's rollercoaster from $10 per share to $97 sees the stock trading for $15 per share today.Overall, I anticipate the stock is going to have a hard time maintaining its momentum. The maximum dividend rate management and the board may dare to distribute is 3.3%, and that, again, is based the total sustainability of these record high earnings.The firm may continue to grow, or it may not. Either way I'd prefer to get into the stock while the market is sour on the company, not elated about recent results and future prospects."
4249463,104888,2019-03-18T11:13:27-04:00,4Q revenue of $570M beat by 3.6%.4Q non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 beat street's $0.47.Big wins in Aerospace/Defense.Operating margins were strong and are expected to sustain 2019.,"Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) reported 4Q results and FY19 outlook which provided hefty upside. Revenue growth for FY18 accelerated to 10% over 2017's 7%. Guidance is 7% yoy for 2019E mostly due to the timing of hardware sales, some of which were booked in the fourth quarter of 2018. Despite higher mix of hardware which typically carries a lower margin, overall EBIT margins were 31.6% in 4Q18, +60bps higher than consensus, as operating expenses were lower than expected.In aerospace and defense, Cadence won business deals with GE Aviation (NYSE:GE) and BAE Systems (OTCPK:BAESF). While its Functional Verification suite gained 22 new customers, which drove ~$143m in revenue, there was also a breakthrough, wide-ranging semiconductor win. In 4Q, Cadence and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) expanded their relationship to include more of its digital, custom, and verification products.Source: CompanyEBIT margins providing operating leverageGiven that the top-line growth is in the high single digits, operating efficiency is very important in driving EPS growth. FY19 EBIT margin guidance of 30-31% further substantiates this. The company is displaying good operating expense management as we see sales & marketing and R&D expenses going down as a % of revenue.While Cadence's business is more stable compared with semiconductors and aviation industry, it is still affected by the R&D cycle of its customers. The reason why Cadence is trading at these high levels has quite a lot to do with how robust its revenue growth and earnings are. To highlight, despite the revenue yoy figure declining to 7% in FY2019E, the two-year growth rate is 17.7%, which is the same as FY2018. Its downstream clients are subject to more cyclicality, but they are under pressure to continue to innovate, design, and test new products, which provides a long-lasting stream of demand for Cadence's product suites. Competition is healthy as market share are divided among two other major peers, Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY).Given consensus estimate of $2.01 in FY2019E and applying a 30x P/E, we reach a PT of $60, which is where Cadence is already trading at. This is a solid name to keep on the watchlist, but we remain neutral for now.For further upside, we will need to see more contract wins and broader semiconductor strength.Source: Company"

The company along with competitors Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) and Mentor Graphics (NASDAQ:MENT) comprise the only major players in the Electronic Design Automation industry. Swallowing up the smaller companies has been key to survival of the Big 3 as the EDA industry is subject to change as quickly as technological advances are made. CDNS has made over 50 acquisitions in about 20 years and is the second largest of the Big 3.The EDA industry is dependent on new design demands for their revenue. According to CDNS CEO Tan, the market opportunities exist for his company and the EDA industry in the cloud, the Internet of Things, communications, computers and the automotive sector.A report by Yole Development pegs the market size of the Internet of Things in the $70 billion range by 2018 and over $400 billion by 2024. The global cloud computing market is expected to reach $270 billion BY 2020,Cost saving and the increased usage of mobile devices are driving new product creation and business opportunity for CDNS. The Internet of Things is about making dumb objects smart and interconnected. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last month, some of the products on display included connected coffee pots,GPS-enabled pet trackers, connected workout clothing and plant containers that automatically water the plants. Cloud computing needs solutions for mobile communications issues.CDNS' strategy has been to extend beyond offering just semiconductor solutions but to provide complete end products, as they demonstrated at CES 2015.Another key element in CDNS's strategy has been its collaboration with ARM to develop products jointly and sometimes even including a third party such as the project with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) to develop wearable devices.About 90% of CDNS's revenue is recurring, making it relatively predictable. Their Q4 earnings report this week came in line with estimates on revenue and EPS as is typical for the company.CDNS is projected to grow at over a 20% growth rate over the next year. The company does not project out beyond one year It trades at a modest forward PE of just 13.Institutional interest in CDNS if fully subscribed at over 100% and there are several noteworthy names, but one in particular stands out according to Insider Monkey who points out Glenview Capital's stake and the recent successful plays that the fund has enjoyed.There are several analysts covering CDNS and likely that new reports will be coming out shortly. Northland Capital has been very bullish on the stock maintaining an Outperform rating and a price target of $23, citing its ""strong market share momentum."" .RBC Capital and DA Davidson have a ""buy"" rating and a $20.00 price target on the stock.CDNS is a play on riding the wave of The Internet of Things and growth of Cloud Computing. With these two themes in play, there is likely to be a continuation of growth above 20% with enough opportunity to satisfy each of the Big Three in the EDA industry. If either of these themes fail to play out, CDNS will not succeed."
136049,20187,2009-05-07T06:53:43-04:00,,"Stocks discussed on the in-depth session of Jim Cramer's Mad Money TV Program, Wednesday May 6.Cadence Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS)The list of what went wrong last year with Cadence Systems reads like horror story; this supplier of materials for chips saw its stock price tumble from $17 to $3, and its operating margins fall from 30% to -3%. The company dismissed its management, faced a threat of delisting by the Nasdaq and was overwhelmed by accounting problems that got Cadence in trouble with the SEC.Why would anyone in their right mind buy this stock? Basically, things can't get much worse fand there is reason to believe that the future might actually look bright for Cadence. With demand raging for more efficient chips, the whole sector is en fuego. The company beat estimates when it reported on April 29, and there is reason to believe operating margins will be up. Cost cutting measures, including 12% employee cutbacks are helping the company balance its budget. It has fixed the accounting problem and expects $150 million in operating expense benefits. Cadence also has $2.20 in cash per share, and will be protected against an extreme drop in its share price.CEO Interview: Airgas (ARG) Peter McCauslandCramer admitted he made a mistake telling investors to sell Airgas last October; the company reported a better-than-expected quarter and may well beat again. Even though earnings were down, Airgas saw a record year thanks to cost-cutting measures. Cramer has been concerned about Airgas' past acquisitions, and McCausland replied the company sizes up potential purchases very carefully. However, manufacturing has been hit hard and the CEO admitted he has not seen an upsurge in manufacturing activity yet and has adjusted guidance. Cramer says he is sticking with Airgas this time around.JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), American Express (NYSE:AXP), Metlife (NYSE:MET), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Cramer says the Bank Stress Test results provide another reason to believe the worst is over; JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo passed with flying colors while only Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo need more cash. Even the banks who didn't pass can find solutions easily: BAC can sell assets and transfer TARP money into common stock while Warren Buffet is giving Wells Fargo a hand. Geithner also said Metlife and Morgan Stanley were in the clear.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Get Cramer's Picks by email-- it's free and takes only a few seconds to sign up.Seeking Alpha is not affiliated with Jim Cramer, CNBC or TheStreet.com"
1781712,21798,2013-10-29T10:26:17-04:00,,"Small-Cap technology solutions provider, Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS), recently experienced an approximate 12% dip in price as a result of a $0.43 million miss in third quarter revenue. The dip in stock price was also attributed to the company's revenue outlook for Q4 of $370 million to $380 million, which was disappointingly lower than the average consensus of $379 million. Despite the revenue expectations miss, earnings came in right on target at $0.21 per share with revenue up 8% year-over-year. Cadence does experience sharp movements in its stock price, so I think that the recent dip presents a good buying opportunity for the short term and long term. The stock tends to recover just as quickly as it drops. The long-term outlook should be positive for the stock due to the above average earnings expectations for the company.Cadence develops solutions that allow customers to design complex integrated circuits (ICS) and electronic devices. The company helps its customers reduce design and development costs, while simultaneously reducing the time to bring ICs and electronic devices to market. Cadence provides maintenance for its product offerings and engineering services for design solutions. The majority of the company's business is generated from semiconductor and electronics systems manufacturers & designers.The following products should help the company in its growth efforts:Cadence has developed these new products for significant performance and productivity improvements over computing solutions. The company continues to integrate its IP acquisitions and is gaining new business among its customers. These products should experience solid revenue gains as customers look to benefit from the performance and productivity improvements.Valued Lower than CompetitorsCadence looks attractive as compared to its competitors. Not only does Cadence have a lower valuation than Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) and Mentor Graphics (NASDAQ:MENT), but the company is also expected to grow earnings at a much higher rate. Here's a valuation comparison on these three companies:One of the key valuation metrics with regard to these companies is the PEG ratio. With Cadence's PEG near one, the company is priced more attractively for its future earnings growth than Synopsys and Mentor Graphics. If Cadence can achieve its earnings growth over time, the stock has the likely potential to outperform its competitors and the overall market.Cadence's valuation became attractively lower when the stock dipped as a result of the Q3 revenue miss and due to management's cautious outlook for the business. I think that the management team is being conservative in its outlook. Cadence does have 70% of the top semiconductor companies using Palladium and 40% of revenues are derived from the system companies. Therefore, Cadence is positioned well in the industry. The established relationships that it has are likely to continue as Cadence improves its current offerings. Its customers are likely to upgrade to newer products if the cost/benefit makes sense. With performance and productivity improvements built into the new products, customers are likely to upgrade.The RisksThe current business environment is challenging which is why management has issued caution for its Q4 outlook. Although some customers are doing well, others are experiencing softer demand. If enough customers reduce spending, Cadence could take another hit on its Q4 earnings.Cadence must also keep pace with the rapid changes in technology. The company must remain on the cutting edge to maintain and grow its market share over its competitors.ConclusionCadence has good long-term growth prospects despite any short-term disappointments. Despite the uncertainties in the industry, the company has significant market share, which speaks to Cadence's respected reputation in the industry. The current valuation makes for an attractive long-term investment. I like the company's five-year expected annual earnings growth rate of 15%, which has the potential to allow the stock to outperform the market.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1918111,47021,2013-12-28T09:30:00-05:00,,"Today is an age of unparalleled advances in technology. Driven by a revolution in semiconductor chip design and manufacturing capabilities, electronics today are integrated into everything from your car to your home and offer incredible computing power coupled with the ability to be connected anywhere. The design of these chips and systems is only possible through advanced electronic design automation (""EDA"") tools that enable everything from design of individual transistors to the development and testing of critical software before the actual hardware is built.Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) (""Cadence"" or ""the Company"") is one of the largest providers of electronic design automation tools and systems, with roughly 18% share of the $5 billion EDA market. This small cap industry leader operates a high-margin, asset-light business which benefits from an attractive recurring revenue model. However, misunderstood short-term headwinds this year have sparked a sell-off in shares, which are now trading at multi-year lows in valuation.In my opinion, shares of CDNS are undervalued relative to the broader industry and do not properly reflect the company's leadership position in an essential niche market. Trading at a big discount to historic earnings multiples, the market seems to be mispricing the company's steady and predictable cash flows. A conservative five-year DCF analysis, confirmed by relative EBITDA multiples, implies shares are undervalued by 25-30%.Company OverviewCadence, founded in 1988, is the world's second largest provider of electronic design automation software. Headquartered in San Jose, California, the Company offers software, hardware IP and expertise that its customers use to design and verify today's mobile, cloud, and connectivity applications. Each new electronics device today is a unique combination of silicon, SoC (System on Chip), software and system technology - all of which drives demand for Cadence design tools and intellectual property. The Company combines its products and technologies into categories related to major design activities:Custom IC Design, Digital IC DesignIntegrated chip design and verification offerings are used by customers to create schematic and physical representations of circuits down to the transistor level. Cadence offers leading solutions for mixed-signal and low-power integrated chip design that serve high growth markets such as mobile, consumer, and network devices. Its major design platforms are Virtuoso custom IC design, Encounter digital IC design and Allegro system interconnect design. The Company's Virtuoso platform is an industry leader in analog design, and the Encounter and Incisive platforms are also gaining traction in digital design and verification, respectively.Functional Verification, Hardware and IPFunctional Verification products are used by customers to efficiently and effectively verify that the circuitry they have designed will perform as intended. Verification takes place before implementing or manufacturing circuitry, reducing the risk of discovering an error in the completed product. SoC Realization, which includes design and verification IP, is a high-growth business for Cadence - revenue for these products increased 30% in 2012. The Company offers differentiated, high-performance IP to the mobile, video and network markets.System Interconnect DesignSystem Interconnect Design offerings are used to develop printed circuit board and integrated chip packages. In 2012, the Company acquired Sigrity, greatly increasing its capabilities in this area through integration of Sigrity analysis tools with the company's existing Allegro platform. System design tools enable customers to design highly complex and functional electronics while reducing cost and time-to-market.Design for ManufacturingOne of the challenges that semiconductor companies face is ensuring that the integrity of the chips they design can be maintained while manufacturing in massive volumes. Cadence's DFM capabilities help customers address manufacturing effects as early in the development process as possible.Recent Financial PerformanceIn its most recent earnings release, Cadence offered current year guidance of $1.45 to $1.46 billion in revenues, with EPS of $0.85 to $0.86 per share. The Company is on track to generate between $430-$440 million in EBITDA. The Company currently has a backlog of $1.7 billion in revenues; the new Palladium offering seems to be well received, and bookings are solid across the core product line.Strong Recurring Revenue Business ModelOne very attractive aspect of Cadence's business is that it employs a recurring revenue model, which allows for a highly visible and predictable revenue stream. According to company filings, the firm generates roughly 90% of projected quarterly earnings from its backlog, which stood at $1.7 billion as of December 2012. Its average contract term is slightly under 3 years. Cadence has consistently generated operating margins and return on equity in the mid-to-high 20% range with strong free cash flow yield (currently around 6%).Earnings OutlookAfter several years of double-digit revenue growth, Cadence still seems poised to grow revenues in the mid single digits in absence of further accretive acquisitions. The semiconductor industry has gone through an extended period of weakness in conjunction with slumping PC sales; should the industry experience a rebound or enter a meaningful cyclical recovery it would be possible to see sustainable revenue growth of 10% or greater over the coming yearsEven assuming a modest slowing in sales momentum from 10% to ~7% year over year, revenues should top $1.5 billion in 2014 with EBITDA in the area of $500 million. Bloomberg consensus is for EPS of $0.97 per share in 2014.Recent Deal Renegotiations Were An Exception, Not The RuleOn its October earnings call, Cadence disclosed that several customers had negotiated their existing licensing agreements, resulting in fewer licenses per contract. This resulted in a sharp sell-off in shares, as investors worried that these renegotiations were either a sign of weakness in the overall EDA market or in the Cadence offering suite specifically.Commenting on the renegotiations, Chief Financial Officer Geoffrey Ribar stated, ""There's a small number of customers doing that... I don't want to overstate it. We don't believe it's a long-term trend."" Management went on to describe that many of its customers are going through restructurings, citing Japan specifically. While this presents a short-term headwind, leadership is encouraged that these few customers are refocusing their efforts on the consumer and making intelligent business decisions for long-term viability and success.CEO Lip-Bu Tan Accumulates SharesIn October, following the earnings miss and subsequent sell-off, the Company's CEO purchased 20,000 shares of CDNS at an average cost of $12.82 per share, investing $256,500 of his personal savings in the Company. This brings Mr. Tan's total direct ownership to 190,831 shares (worth ~$2.6 million) and, along with his indirect holdings through options and incentive compensation, his total holdings to over 790,000 shares (worth over $13.5 million). While I'm not going to comment on Mr. Tan's investing expertise, it's quite a vote of confidence from senior management to make an open market purchase of this size considering his holdings are already substantial.A Note on Convertible BondsIt is also important to mention that Cadence has two convertible bond issuances outstanding. The first one will mature this month, while the second comes due in 2015. The covenants in these bonds have prevented CDNS from paying dividends or engaging in a share repurchase; however, as these obligations are met, the company may begin to return cash to shareholders in the coming years.ValuationPrior to the 2008 financial crisis, Cadence traded with a trailing 12-month P/E ratio in the mid 20's. As earnings have normalized following the recession, EPS has almost quadrupled from $0.20 in 2010 to the $0.86 expected in 2013. Surprisingly, Cadence has seen its multiple contract from the high 20's to 16 times current year earnings today, a two-year valuation low despite strong earnings growth.Today's share price implies a valuation of 8.5X EV/EBITDA, compared to the broader software industry, which trades between 12-13X EV/EBITDA. The publicly traded EDA firms, which include Cadence, Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) and Mentor Graphics (NASDAQ:MENT) have historically traded around 10-11X EV/EBITDA. I view the main reasons behind today's discount to be the customer contract renegotiations previously discussed, as well as the high level of spending by Cadence on acquiring IP this year. However, I feel that the renegotiations are customer-specific ""one offs"" and the IP purchases this year should be accretive to EPS in 2014 (they were mildly dilutive this year).When looking at fair value for CDNS shares, I used both an EV/EBITDA approach as well as a five-year DCF analysis, giving equal weighting to each.Applying a 10.5X EV/EBITDA multiple to $500 million in 2014 EBITDA yields a per-share value of $17.22, a 25% premium to today's price. This assumes no debt prepayment, and no reduction or issuance in outstanding shares.For the five year DCF analysis, I modeled EBITDA increasing to $500 million in 2014 and $560 million in 2015, with growth slowing to 6% by 2017 where EBITDA reaches $635 million. Assuming an 11% weighted average cost of capital and a 2% terminal growth rate, my PV calculation for Cadence is $5.4 billion or $17.79 per share - a 30% premium to today's closing price. This implies a terminal EBITDA multiple of 10.4X which is roughly in line with where the sector has traded historically.Source: Company financials, author estimatesBlending the results of both analysis yields my intrinsic value estimate of $17.50 per share. At today's closing price of $13.77, this represents 27% upside over the next 12-18 months.The Bottom LineWhile EDA may not be a ""sexy"" business, it is an attractive niche market that serves an essential role in the design of today's electronics. Cadence is a major player with 18% market share, and enjoys a cash generative, high-margin recurring revenue model that has proven resilient over time. Short-term concerns around spending and customer contracts have left shares at a two-year low in valuation, which I believe mis-prices the company's earnings potential over the coming years. I view shares as oversold today, and should the stock trade back to levels consistent with historic norms, upside should be 25-30% over the coming year.Safe investing...Disclosure: I am long CDNS.

1268171,22829,2013-03-12T17:32:43-04:00,,"By Tejas VenkateshCadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) on Monday bought configurable silicon  intellectual property vendor Tensilica for $380 million in cash. Not only is  this Cadence's biggest acquisition, it is also paying the highest  valuation in its M&A history. Tensilica generated $44 million in sales in  2012, valuing the company at 8x trailing sales. The purchase bulks up  Cadence's IP business, pushing it over the $100 million mark. Previous IP  acquisitions include Denali Software in May 2010 (for verification IP)  and Cosmic Circuits just last month (for silicon IP).Its exit did not come easy for Tensilica. The IP core vendor raised  roughly $100 million in six funding rounds in its 16-year history. Investors  include Foundation Capital, Altera, and Cisco, among others. Tensilica  makes money through license fees for its IP and also via royalties on  unit volumes its customers sell. The company's client list includes  marquee tech names such as Intel, Broadcom, Cisco, and Samsung. Qatalyst  Partners advised Tensilica on the transaction.Tensilica's data-plane-processing units are programmable and allow  customers to develop customized system on a chips (SoCs) and  differentiate themselves in the mobile and wireless network  infrastructure markets. These IP cores are complementary to standard  processor architectures from companies like ARM Ltd., a fact highlighted  by a quote in the PR from the microprocessor provider itself. Potential  overlap between ARM and the EDA giants as they move further into the  silicon IP and SoC business is a sensitive point.The deal comes just four months after rival MIPS Technologies sold  itself to Imagination Technologies and Allied Security Trust for a  combined $450 million. CEVA, which unsuccessfully bid for that business against  Imagination, is now the last remaining stand-alone company. Its revenue  for 2012 dipped to $54 million, down 11% compared with $60 million in 2011. Cadence's  larger competitor Synopsys has been buying into silicon IP steadily  since the acquisition of Virage Logic for $315 million in June 2010. Virage had  previously acquired ARC International for its configurable IP, a more  direct rival to ARM. Both Cadence and Synopsys are looking to take  advantage of faster growth rates beyond their mature EDA tools  businesses."

And as the company enters the EDA business in Asian-Pacific as well as pushes for system design automation, we are excited by the opportunity here to catch up to the rest of the application software industry.Business Overview:Cadence Design Systems is one of the largest providers of electronic design automation (EDA); they are developing, selling or leasing electronic design and verification intellectual property (VIP and design IP). Specifically, Cadence products help to reduce the time of production and control the cost of its counterpart in designing and manufacturing.CDNS makes its name on two main product categories: Functional Verification and Design. In Functional Verification, Cadence's products are used to verify logical presentation of an IC design to see whether it is functionally correct. Meanwhile the custom design, digital IC decide and sign off, and system interconnect design are all used in stimulating the operation of certain design, verifying blueprint and ultimately identifying problems before manufacturing.Here is a breakdown of revenue for CDNS products in the last three years, as stated in the latest Cadence's earnings report:Industry TrendsIn 2013, total EDA revenue grew by 6% in the third quarter to $1.1 billion. The main driver of the industry is the computer-aided engineering market, which had the highest growth of 12% to $632.5 million. While the IC design and verification revenue grew in a moderate level of 3%. The industry is moving towards system designs from traditional EDA, and CDNS is moving with the industry.In system, companies will not only supply customers with IP and software content but also help to design with end products such as design integration, analysis, and verification in the system level. As the company mentioned, the market of system design enablement is around $2.6 trillion.However, challenges still exist. There are several challenges in the company's industry. Firstly, the design and manufacturing of IC is changing, which includes introduction of three dimensional transistors and the migration to advanced process nodes. The change will require companies to adapt to more complex physics and manufacturing challenges.The second challenge is from the advanced node design, which require customers to work with a new manufacturing process. The new process will reduce customers' need to upgrade and enhance EDA products and design services. Last but not least, the endless gate capacity will create more room for design reuse, which might also put some challenges for companies in the EDA business.Main CatalystAs we can see above, system design is a small part of the business, but as we can tell from the industry, it is the future and it's a place of growth. System design enablement business was defined by Cadence's CEO as going beyond traditional EDA, a method to improve the production of electronic devices, by taking a system view. Cadence's management envisions that their future business will include design integration, analysis and verification of system level components in all products that they offer.According to Cadence VP of Corporate Marketing, Craig Cochran:Enablement goes beyond automation. Enablement includes Cadence's content contribution to our customer's design in the form of licensable IP and software…(leading) to the enablement of the full system including hardware, software and IP to interconnections and verification of the complete system.As we know, CDNS's core business is its traditional EDA business. Traditional EDA is focused on chip design automation, while the system design will put the whole EDA design process into a system view. The system design not only provides customers with tools, IP, and software content, it helps design end products by combining design integration, analysis, verification of system level components into a single process.So the question is what opportunity is there for Cadence in this industry?First, we need to look at the opportunities that CDNS will have on its system design enablement business. According to the latest 10-K, ""Cadence's customers are sensitive to products prices and the time to deliver products to market."" As a result, the market demands higher functionality and smaller devices from semiconductor and electronic system companies. In order to meet the demand trend, more and more system companies have to combine its subsystems, for example, radio frequency, signal processing and so on into a single silicon. The positive is that CDNS has always been a cheaper provider.In terms of market size, the company estimated that the whole system area is around $2.6 trillion. The system area not only includes semiconductor and electronic system companies, but also include computer hardware and software companies and lots more. What's more, those new type of system companies are expanding rapidly, and their requirements on EDA design has been going beyond the silicon and SoC. They need partners such as CDNS who can help them to design the entire system in a top down approach.Even though the market potential of system design is huge, the question is whether CDNS will gain enough competitive advantage to gain market share and be successful here? In order to successfully tackle the system design market, CDNS is initiating several plans in recent years. The acquisition of Tensilica Inc. is one of the steps the company has taken. During fiscal year of 2013, they acquired ""Tensilica, a privately held provider of configurable dataplane processing units and Cosmic Circuit, a privately provider of IP used in system on chip design."" The acquisitions enhance their portfolio of design and verification IP and create diversification in their products and services offering.As President and CEO Lip-Bu Tan mentions:With Tensilica, we will be able to provide designers with a more complete SoC solution that will speed the development of innovative and differentiated products, while reducing time to market. We look forward to working with Tensilica's dedicated employees as one team to bring even more value to our customers.Furthermore, the company expects to heavily invest in Research and Development for fiscal year of 2014 to develop their high level synthesis tools that will be integrated into computer chips to help reduce human error and subsequent debug and verification activities. Those R&D plans will help the company to improve its design enablement for cheaper and more efficient systems, which would allow its customers to meet their market trend. All of these plans are considered by Cadence's management as the stepping stone for them to head into the system design business.But the next question is whether CDNS is able to compete against its competitors in the marketplace? In the EDA market, CDNS's major competitors are Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS), Mentor Graphics (NASDAQ:MENT) and Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS). Among them, SNPS is the market leader with TTM revenue of $1.97 billion. CDNS ranked in the 2nd place with the TTM revenue of $1.46 billion. The chart bellows show the major market players' relative position in the marketplace by TTM revenue:Customers can use SNPS's products to develop integrated circuits (NYSE:ICS) as well as simulate and test the ICs before and after the production. SNPS has a variety of customers, but most of them are in electronic and semiconductor manufacturing business. In the fiscal 2012, SNPS acquired Magma Design Automation, Inc., EVE SA and Springsoft Inc. The acquisition enhanced SNPS's competitive position in the marketplace and placed more competitive pressure for CDNS.Compared to SNPS, CDNS's competitive advantage is its relatively lower cost of operations. The company recently initiated several restructuring plans to reduce its cost by reducing workforce and consolidating facilities. Even though those cost reduction activities didn't achieve the company's expectation so far, it did reduce its cost of business in a certain level.With the company horizontally integrating as well as developing organically, we believe that the company can gain a stronger foothold in the EDA tools industry. In our model, we used a 200 basis point accretion to 20% market share. As we know, the whole system design area market potential is $2.6 trillion. In terms of the revenue projection, the global EDA tools market in 2013 is about $8.2 billion, and Cadence currently has around 18% market share. According to the research conducted by Electronics.ca Research Network, the global EDA tools market is likely to reach $9.85 billion by 2015, a CAGR rate of 9.6%. We expect that CDNS's market share will be 19% in 2014, and 20% in 2015, and keep stable after it. As a result, we come up with the projected table below (millions):On the margin side, due to the increasing level of demand and expectation from the newly rising system companies to the design companies for production, CDNS expects to keep heavily investing in R&D in the next year for its transition to a system design enablement company, so we believe that operating margins will be held in check for at least the next 24 months.In terms of the specific number, we would project that its SG&A expense will be stable around 34% of the total revenue, while its R&D will grow to around 14% in 2014, and after that achieve a growth rate between 6% to 7% year-over-year. Below is the projected SG&A, R&D and operating margin (millions):Thus, we see our model as fairly conservative for margins. 2014 would be 350 basis point reduction and no get back to current levels until 2016. Even with these levels, our pricing model shows that there is upside in shares.Secondary CatalystThe company's secondary catalyst is its EDA business in Asian Pacific market. In 2013, the EDA business in Asia Pacific market is expected to achieve a growth rate of 22% to $392.8 million. One of the drivers of the high growth in Asia Pacific market is mobile devices.From 2011 to 2012, the company's Asian-Pacific segment revenue grew by 30%, and from 2012 to 2013, the segment's revenue grew by 14%. As the company noted, ""Asia Pacific is an emerging growth area. We are very excited and we are well positioned as you know in that market.""According to the recent Q4 report, CDNS's Asia segment made up 19% of total revenue.As for the future revenue potential of the Asian Pacific market, the company commented about their current business partners:And clearly you see a bunch of company coming up from Spectrum, RDA, High Silicon, the Galaxy products IPO in Hong Kong and a suite of company coming up and we are so well positioned engaging with them providing the tool and also increasing the IP blocks and we have a very broad portfolio able to provide them a very good silicon proven IP so that enable them to fast to market. And clearly we also see a tremendous growth on the Palladium hardware emulation because it is a must have when they have a complex chip design especially in the advance node.By looking at the global EDA market in 2013, American market is only growing at 1%, followed by EMEA market of 4% and Japanese market of 5%. While the Asian Pacific market is growing at 22%. In terms of the company's Asia Pacific segment growth, we would project that the company will see at least 15% of growth year-over-year. As a result, we come up with this projected table below (millions):So the question is how will this high growth from the Asian Pacific market impact its overall business? Let's assume that in fiscal year 2014, CDNS's Asian Pacific segment will still have 19% portion. If the Asian Pacific segment grows 15% in 2014, the segment will contribute at least 2.85% of the company's overall growth. Yet, we know that this segment will continue to grow as a piece of the overall pie, and we believe growth in system design as well as Asia-Pacific makes CDNS an exciting name to watch.ValuationRevenueIn our valuation model, we used three scenarios of a worst, mid, and best-case scenario at 5%, 7%, and 13% growth per year, respectively. We believe that in the best-case scenario, the company is going to experience a higher growing period of time due to the new system design enablement and the successful vertical integration. In the middle case scenario, we think 7% growth is a reasonable number, which is in line with historical levels. In the worst case scenario, we believe that the company will still grow at around 5%. This level would represent a slowdown in Asia-Pacific beyond the 15% level as well as a less successful integration process.Best-case scenario:Middle-case scenario:Worst-case scenario:MarginThe company expected its gross margin to decline in the next several year. CDNS's gross margin in 2013 was 86.4%. By looking at its historical average over past 5 years, its gross margin is around 83.68%. Gross margin will likely decline due to product cycles that should see a decline, so a move back to the historical averages seems likely. In terms of operating margin, we would expect that its operating margin would stay low and then start to bounce after 2015 as we noted earlier.Operating margins:TaxAs the Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President said during the earnings call:So when we guide the 26% non-GAAP tax rate that is kind of the long-term rate that we expect over time. Our cash tax rate had traditionally tended to be lower as we have tax attributes and NOLs to help offset some of that.Thus, we think using 26% effective tax rate is very reasonable.CapexThe company has seen capital expenditures as roughly 3-4% of revenue over the past several years with some pops due to acquisitions. The company should continue around the 3% mark with a slowdown in spend in 2014 as the company has noted in their last earnings call.CapEx and % of revenue:Shares OutstandingThe company expects to repurchase $50 million worth of stocks in each 2014 and 2015. Currently, CDNS has around 289 million shares, so we expect share count to reduce to 286 million, which we used in our model.Target priceBased on the information above, we come up with three price targets below:Risk VarianceOne risk that CDNS has is its dependence on sole suppliers for certain hardware components, making its vulnerable to supply disruption and price fluctuation. Additionally, the company has tough competition with a crowded environment that will fight for market share. Additionally, we base a lot of the success on their ability to see strong growth in Asia-Pacific. If those levels drop off more than we expect, it does push risk into our model.ConclusionIn conclusion, CDNS's three cases scenarios are all very positive. With a system design enablement successful integration along with the company's international expansion, there is a lot to like here. In the worst case, the stock is still undervalued in our cash flow model, and we believe that the market is really undervaluing this name as can be seen by the 14.6 future P/E in a strong growth market as well as the 0.8 PEG ratio.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

433681,23407,2012-03-14T11:34:09-04:00,,"Soon, blog teardown reports will show which suppliers won coveted slots in the new Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad. As I've written previously, two winners may be Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which likely won the LTE baseband business, and Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN), which likely powers iPad's Siri-Lite.However, as much as I like those two stocks, neither is an under the radar pick. Most investors already know who supplies Apple with its various components, such as Broadcom (BRCM), who supplies Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, and Qualcomm, who supplies baseband chips. Those selling to these and other suppliers, however, are less known.In this camp are Electronic Design Automation (""EDA"") stocks, such as Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS). These stocks make their money by selling software tools used by engineers to design chips for consumer devices, such as iPhones and iPads.Smart phone and tablet manufacturers, including Apple, are demanding chips do more while using less energy and taking up less space. These feature rich silicon solutions are increasingly challenging to design and test. Yet, the pressure has never been higher to speed new products to market. As a result, chipmakers are investing heavily in software to design, test and troubleshoot manufacturing hiccups prior to mass production.This demand drove Cadence's sales up 23% in 2011 to $1.15 billion. At the same time, Cadence's non-GAAP operating margins doubled to 18%. The strength is expected to continue this year too. Cadence is guiding 8-11% sales growth in 2012 as chipmakers, such as Apple's A5 and A5x chip supplier Samsung, focus on next generation 20 nanometer designs.· Last summer, Samsung used Cadence to design a 20 nm ARM Cortex-M0 microprocessor featured chip· Last fall, Samsung, which controls ~41% of the DRAM market, announced a $10.2 billion program to produce 20 nm memory.· In October, ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) and Cadence taped out a 20nm ARM Cortex A15 for TSMC 20 nm process.The street seems to be gaining confidence too. Over the past sixty days, analysts have ratcheted their earnings expectations for 2013 up to $0.86 from $0.74, a 16% lift. The company has beaten those analyst's estimates in each of the past four quarters, suggesting the street is playing catch-up. Despite the increasing enthusiasm, bears haven't covered positions... yet. As of the last short report, they were still sitting on nearly 7 days of average volume short.Supplying software to the biggest chipmakers helps insulate Cadence from risks tied to OEM's switching suppliers. Last summer, rumors suggested Apple was looking at Taiwan Semi's (NYSE:TSM) to supplement or replace Samsung. Given TSMC was announcing a deeper collaboration with Cadence at the same time, Cadence's risk from Apple changing horses appears minor.Importantly, Cadence exited 2011 with a book-to-bill ratio above 1 and a $1.7 billion backlog. Of the company's $308 million in Q4 sales, products accounted for $177 million and maintenance and services generated $101 and $30 million each, respectively. The sharp rise in revenue boosted operating cash flow to $240 million for the year, up from $199 million in 2010. This pushed Cadence's cash and equivalents up $44 million to $602 million.Given the chip industry is improving in line with seasonal trends, capital spending at foundries is likely to support Cadence seat growth this year. In January, the SEMI book-to-bill clocked in at 0.95; up from a dismal 0.71 in September and above the 0.85 in January. Consumer's ongoing appetite for faster, more unified consumer devices isn't waning, suggesting Cadence shareholder's will benefit as Apple and competitors release new products.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in CDNS over the next 72 hours."
1269801,25120,2013-03-13T11:03:04-04:00,,"Shares of Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) traded with losses of around 4% halfway through Tuesday's trading session. The leader in global electronic design innovation and silicon intellectual property announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tensilica.The DealCadence Design Systems announced that it has agreed to acquire Tensilica, a leader in dataplane processing IP, for a total consideration of $380 million in cash. Combined, the firms will deliver more optimized IP solutions for mobile wireless, network infrastructure, auto infotainment, and home applications. Tensilica employs some 200 workers who serve more than 200 licensees, including seven of the top 10 semiconductor companies. Since its inception, the company has shipped over 2 billion IP cores. CEO Lip-Bu Tan commented on the deal:The company anticipates to finance the deal with cash at hand and an existing credit facility. The purchase price includes a net cash position of $30 million, held by Tensilica, putting the effective price tag down to $350 million.Tensilica reported full-year revenues of $44 million for the year ended December 2012. As such, the deal values the company at roughly 8.0 times annual revenues. Cadence did point out that revenue growth averaged some 35% over the past two years, and that the company was profitable for the year. As a result, the deal will be slightly dilutive to non-GAAP earnings for fiscal year 2013 due to merger-related costs. The deal is expected to be accretive to full-year 2014 earnings.Cadence expects to close the deal in the second quarter of its fiscal 2013. The deal is furthermore subject to normal closing conditions, including regulatory approval.ValuationCadence ended its fiscal year of 2012 with $827.0 million in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments. The company operates with $447.0 million in convertible notes outstanding, for a net cash position of $380 million. Cadence reported full-year revenues of $1.33 billion for 2012, on which the company net earned $439.9 million, or $1.57 per diluted share. Earnings were severely inflated as a result of a negative income tax provision of $251.7 million. Excluding this and other one-time charges, net income came in at $216.7 million.The market currently values Cadence around $3.9 billion after Tuesday's declines. This values operating assets around $3.5 billion, which values the firm's operating assets around 2.6 times annual revenues and 16-17 times 2012's non-GAAP earnings.Cadence Design Systems does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveShares of the company have been suffering for a long time, with the exception of the last years. Shares peaked around all time highs of $37 back in 1998, and have traded in a wide trading range between $10 and $30 for the next decade. Shares hit lows of $3 during the 2008-09 recession, but have gradually made up some of its lost ground, currently exchanging hands around $14 per share.Between 2009 and 2012, the company has aggressively grown its revenues again, as 2009's performance was severely impacted by the recession. Revenues grew a cumulative 55% over those years to $1.33 billion, while the company returned to profitability in the last three years. At the same time, convertible offerings resulted in a 10% dilution of the shareholder base over the period.Investment ThesisCadence stresses that the deal with Tensilica is one of a strategic nature. The purchase price, at 8.0 times annual revenues, represents a massive premium compared to Cadence's own valuation at roughly 2.6 times annual revenues. Given that Cadence is willing to spend up to 10% of its market capitalization, it is understandable that investors of Cadence are cautious. A 5% decline in the share price suggests investors think the company is overpaying for Tensilica.Yet CEO Tan stresses that the combination will accelerate IP development and integration, while providing more extensive support network covering IP and tools. The deal would also lead to shorter time-to-market lead times and an optimized power performance. As a result of the deal, the full-year revenue guidance of $1.405-$1.445 billion for 2013 will translate into a guidance of roughly $1.45-$1.50 billion. The guidance for GAAP earnings between $0.58-$0.68 per share and non-GAAP earnings between $0.82 and $0.92 per share for 2013 will become a little too optimistic.Overall, shareholders have their concerns, but have already disapproved the deal by sending shares lower on Tuesday. The deal will most likely have long-term benefits. However, at the current valuation of 2.4 times 2013's full-year revenues and roughly 20 times annual earnings, there are few reasons to pick up shares with a convincing argument.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

While the company confirmed its previous Q3 guidance, the Street has obviously lost all faith in Cadence, and the stock has cratered.Citigroup’s Terence Whalen today cut his rating on the stock to Hold from Buy, lowering his price target on the shares to $5.50 from $11.50. He says that the accounting freeze stops the company from buying back stock and “casts doubt” on results and the guidance. And he says the management exodus “was deeper and potentially more disruptive than we expected.” He cut his 2008 EPS estimate to break even from a profit of 3 cents; for ‘09 he now sees a loss of 9 cents, down from break even.Mahesh Sanganeria, of RBC Capital, now gets a chance to gloat: he already had an Underperform rating and $3 target on the stock. “We could be looking at a slippery slope” it the review extends beyond the issues with Q1 revenues that were disclosed yesterday. “A review covering periods involving changes to revenue recognition models could open a can of worms,” he writes. “A prolonged review resulting in non-filing of financials would have serious consequences.” Sanganeria also warns that “a massive head count reduction remains in the offing.”Raj Seth, of Cowen, remains Neutral on the stock, and says that “despite a very, very depressed-looking valuation, we see no need to step up till the dust clears.”Deutsche Bank’s Tim Fox repeated his Hold rating today, and cut his target to $5 from $13. “Cadence faces an uphill battle as it attempts to right-size the company without damaging its core franchise long term,” he writes. “With semiconductor end-markets softening, an impending restructuring to manage through and replacement of senior management to tackle, we are cautious on the timing of a turnaround.”CDNS today dropped $1.10, or 25.46%, to $3.22."

Combined, the EDA software company reduced revenue for the first six months of the year by $37.9 million.For the December quarter, Cadence now sees revenue of $215 million to $225 million, below the Street consensus of $247.4 million. The company expects a non-GAAP loss for the quarter of 4-6 cents a share; the Street had been expecting a loss of 7 cents.Analysts point out that Cadence also projected bookings for 2009 of $800 million to $900 million, which Deutsche Bank’s Tim Fox notes is about 20% below what the Street had expected; in response, analysts dramatically reduced their revenue expectations for 2009 from around $1 billion to about $800 million.In a research note, Fox repeated his Hold rating on the stock, cutting his target to $4, from $5.Other analyst made similar moves: Merrill Lynch’s Jay Vleeschouwer, for instance, repeated his Underperform rating, and cut his target to $4.50, from $5.50, noting that the company indicated it would have “virtually no operating cash flow next year” versus a prior forecast of $250 million.  Standard & Poor’s analyst Jim Yin cut his rating on the stock to Sell from Hold, reducing his price target to $3.50, from $4. While the accounting issues have been solved, he notes that the company still has no CEO, and that it faces “a difficult transition amid an economic recession.” He widens his ‘08 loss estimate to 93 cents from 37 cents; for ‘09, he now sees a loss of 45 cents a share, versus a profit of a penny a share previously.CDNS Thursday closed down 22.6%."

The company, which makes computer chip design software, has spoken with KKR and Blackstone, they said, but warned a deal may not be imminent due to private equity's reluctance to enter the arena of complex tech companies who require vast R&D spending, and because its relatively high $6.4 billion market cap makes it a rich risk. Cadence is regarded as one of the most innovative and aggressive companies in its field. Since 2004, it has acquired four companies, invested heavily in other Silicon Valley firms, and repurchased $1 billion of its shares. Cadence says it will introduce a new approach to chip design this year that lays wires diagonally, horizontally and vertically, making chips faster and more efficient. But Intel recently pulled support from Cadence in favor of Magma Design, which Intel says has a time-to-market advantage. Despite underwhelming revenue growth ($1.329 billion in 2005 vs. $1.484 billion in 2006), Cadence shares are up almost 100% YTD to $23, giving it a 4.1 sales multiple; competitor Synopsis trades for 3.3x, while Magma Design trades for 3.1x.

For the 2008 fiscal year, Cadence projected revenue at $1.49 billion to $1.54 billion with an EPS of $1.11 to $1.19, lower than analyst expectations of $1.74 billion and an EPS of $1.53.   The company’s CFO, Bill Porter cited “Aggressive pricing environment” as a reason for the conservative estimates. To understand the competitive environment that Cadence is playing in, and the resultant “deal practices,” please read my prior EDA series: “Cadence: Buyout Rumors Persist,” “Synopsys Looks Healthy, But,” “Mentor Graphics: LBO Recommended,” and “Will Magma Die in the Vine?” While the price competition is an industry-wide issue, the EDA Card “all-you-can-eat” strategy that Cadence is following puts it at a competitive advantage versus smaller rivals Mentor Graphics (NASDAQ:MENT) and Magma (NASDAQ:LAVA). Only Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) can meaningfully compete with that strategy. So, my gut says that the competitive environment should favor Cadence, not hinder. I am not sure I understand what Bill is saying here. Analysts are also concerned that revenues from “turns” (revenue on license renewals is recognized upfront), which make up 40% of the company’s revenues, will become harder to come by in case of a weak economy and a soft semiconductor market. This is a real concern. The share volumes traded showed a substantial increase from 5.8 million shares on January 30 to 53.5 million on January 31. In the five trading sessions following the announcement of the results, 114.5 million shares have been traded compared to the 22.4 million shares traded in the five trading sessions prior to the announcement. Cadence is not used to such activity levels in its stock, and perhaps, is burdened by the attention. If you are an investor, what should you be doing? Well, first, let’s finish taking a look at the numbers, and understanding more of the dynamics of the industry. The $28 million settlement with the Internal Revenue Service relating to tax years 1997-1999 helped Cadence increase its net income to $119.5 million (26% of revenue) from the previous year’s $48.4 million (11% of revenue) reporting a 147% increase. Diluted EPS on a non-GAAP basis stood at $0.46 compared to $0.38 for the year before (a 21% increase over the year), and $0.33 for Q3 (a 39% increase over the quarter). Revenue for the year grew by 9% over $1.48 billion in fiscal 2006 to $1.62 billion in fiscal 2007. The net income for the fiscal year 2007 was $296 million compared to $143 million in the year 2006. Diluted EPS on a non-GAAP basis stood at $1.35 per share for the year 2007, compared to $1.08 per share in the year 2006. This is the most profitable Cadence has been in a long time. The question, however, remains: at what cost? EDA is notoriously R&D heavy. Cutting R&D usually is tantamount to either cutting off future revenue, or betting on expensive acquisitions. The bigger issue is also that startup activity in EDA has gone down significantly, and venture capital has all but dried up. There may not be much to acquire when the need arises. This is a deeply concerning phenomenon, since the entire semiconductor industry is dependent on EDA to be able to achieve its innovation objectives, even though it doesn’t allow EDA to get enough value for its contribution, something Mike Fister, CEO of Cadence, has been trying to address, albeit not very successfully. The truth is, innovation in chips has to continue. The chip industry and the EDA industry have to come to terms with each other, and find a sustainable balance. Unfortunately, Wall Street, the master of short-term focus, does not care about these sustainability issues. EDA CEOs also have no choice but to sing and dance to Wall Street’s tune, or their own personal compensations get be jeopardized. As a result, Ray Bingham and Mike Fister, Cadence’s past and current CEOs have had little choice but to “follow the money.” In the past, chips went to smaller nodes every couple of years, driving in a new version of EDA tools into custom shops. Not anymore. Things have become far too expensive, causing design starts to fall. The move to 65nm and 45nm has been much slower than those to 120nm and 90nm. EDA, meanwhile, has not delivered any breakthrough innovation that can actually “check” the cost of chip design in the lower node sizes via automation. The growing area is early verification, and Cadence’s Verisity acquisition has helped the company build up its verification business further. In terms of Q4 numbers, revenues from Functional Verification increased sequentially from 20% to 26%, Systems Interconnect from 7% to 9% while Custom IC Design fell from 32% to 25%. Both Digital IC Design and Design for Manufacturing revenue shares remained stable at 27% and 6%, respectively. Revenue from Services and other sources saw a minor dip from 8% to 7%. For the fiscal year 2007, Digital IC Design revenue share increased from the previous year’s 24% to 27%, while both Functional Verification and Custom IC Design revenues continued to contribute 24% and 27%, respectively, for both the years. Revenues from Design for Manufacturing, reduced from 7% to 6% while both revenue from Systems Interconnect and Services, and other sources fell from 9% to 8% each. Region-wise, North America’s contribution to revenue increased sequentially from 41% to 50%, and Europe’s share reduced from 25% to 17%. Japan maintained its share at 22% while the rest of Asia’s contribution reduced marginally from 12% to 11%. For the year, America’s share reduced from 54% to 49%, Europe from 19% to 18%, while Japan grew from 17% to 21%, and Asia from 10% to 12%. The only surprise in here is that North America is growing, and not Asia. Back to the big picture, nothing so remarkable is happening in EDA that can unlock a large number of design starts by making “experimentation” and perhaps “protoyping” affordable, at the same time accurate. [For more color on this topic, you can read “RTL Hand-off & Predictive Prototyping.”] Manufacturability and Yield are also huge issues for semiconductor companies today. Tools that enable Design for Manufacturability (DFM) are considered a big growth opportunity, which caused Cadence to buy Clear Shape. [Read “DFM Vision” to get more color on the opportunity.] There is a small public company called PDF Solutions (NASDAQ:PDFS) that Cadence has looked at buying from time to time, that does great work in Yield Optimization. One of these days, these acquisition thoughts could actually materialize. Meanwhile, the actual DFM R&D needs to continue happening inside Cadence. So, the EDA industry, overall, is not a healthy industry. [Read “Future of EDA,” and “Future of EDA: Addendum” for more big picture thoughts.] However, it is a “must-have” industry, if semiconductors have to be built. Thus, within this “must-have” industry, Cadence and Synopsys are the two best-positioned companies. In the short/medium term, the growth in Cadence’s business is likely to come from using its EDA Card strategy against Mentor Graphics and Magma in order to take away market share. The EDA Card strategy is a powerful one against competitors with less comprehensive portfolios for the design flow. For the moment, if you are an investor or fund manager considering buying Cadence’s stock, your best bet is “Market Share” based on “EDA Cards,"" and not on innovation, or acquisition. The bottom line is cold, hard sales."
58375,20521,2008-02-12T05:07:45-05:00,,"I have regularly commented on the EDA industry and discussed specific companies in the past, including Cadence (NASDAQ:CDNS), Mentor Graphics, Magma (NASDAQ:LAVA), and Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS). Today I would like to take another look at Cadence, and examine what has changed since I last wrote about the company.
During the summer Cadence was rumored to be in buyout discussions with Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and KKR (KFN), which I said were preposterous. The only company in the EDA industry that warrants a buyout is Mentor Graphics (NASDAQ:MENT). Nonetheless, rumors seem to be persisting in the industry, telling of how clueless people are about how buyouts work, and what investors’ motivations are in such deals.
Cadence announced Q3 earnings on October 24, 2007 and the results posted were better than analysts had expected. Cadence Q3 revenue totaled $401 million with net income resulting in $97.4 million, versus $81.4 million YoY for the same quarter.
For guidance, Cadence predicted it would meet analysts’ expectations in Q4, and revenue would be in the range of $465 million to $475 million.
Regardless of beating analyst expectations, the market has not been kind to the stock. With a market cap of $4.9 billion and 268.8 million shares outstanding, CDNS closed at $21.69/share prior to announcing earnings on October 24, 2007. The following day the stock was downgraded, and closed at $19.32/share. The downgrading was due to a lack of faith in a new licensing model that will affect Cadence’s pipeline. In earnings discussions the company made a commitment to keep focused efforts on making sure that it would have strong technology offerings, and to keeping a management eye on the product pipeline, which in turn would keep the company successful. Analysts seem to (rightly) disagree with that conclusion.
Two acquisitions have provided Cadence with key ammunition in growth segments of the EDA business. Clear Shape and Invarium, both in the DFM segment, bring technologies that would have been difficult to develop internally. I am glad to see the infamous Mike Fister NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome, a direct import from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), has not hindered Cadence in DFM, as it would have been absolutely fatal. [You can read more about DFM here.]
Cadence’s direction is to envelope the client and cover as many areas as possible under umbrella all-you-can-eat contracts. The company is placing a lot of bets on the introduction of a draw-down license, or EDA Card, in which Cadence found its customers buying more software through an umbrella license than through traditional product-specific ordering. This approach, which was started two years ago, has continued to grow revenues significantly, they claim.
The hope is to capitalize on what Cadence dubs “spontaneous demand,” and have the flexibility to meet the variety of needs at the moment they occur, and Cadence believes the company can generate more sales as a result.
The fallacy in the argument is that Cadence continues to sell its future short. These multi-year all-you-can-eat contracts, while introducing predictability into revenue streams, also take the punch out of technology breakthroughs, disruptive innovations, and associated upsides. The sales force, now incentivized with a commission structure to sell more of the very large all-you-can-eat deals, no longer pays any attention to point products. Yet, the irony of EDA is that any disruption, should it happen, would happen in the point products.
It is not an easy equation to balance - between umbrella deals and point products - since each have their pluses. However, the industry, as a whole, is still spinning in place, and nothing important has happened since I first wrote my article, ""Future of EDA,"" which pointed out the dysfunctions.
Meanwhile, the rumor of a buyout is back, with a share price considerably cheaper at $17/share than the $23/share price of the summer. I still maintain, there is no upside in Cadence for a Private Equity firm, and not much for any investor, unless Cadence makes some very drastic steps to re-engineer the industry. That would mean mergers like ArvinMeritor Inc. (ARM) or KLA Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC), which would consolidate adjacencies of a significantly different scale. Should such deals be in the realm of possibilities, then a private equity buy-out may be a very interesting proposition."
38604,20069,2007-06-18T05:49:20-04:00,,"The New York Times reports people close to the buyout negotiations between Cadence Design Systems and two private equity firms (the Blackstone Group and KKR) say the talks have stalled over price. Although the talks may resume, they are reportedly suspended for now.  The Times notes private equity has historically shunned the tech sector due to its volatility and R&D requirements. The recent run-up in Cadence's shares (following a Times report of talks with Blackstone and KKR) may also pose a problem for return on investment, in addition to the rising interest rates of late, which makes it more difficult to finance a deal. Cadence had a market capitalization of $6.49 billion based on its Friday close of $23.30. Its shares have lost 4% after gaining 6% to $24.22 ($24.90 intra-day) reaching a 52-week high on June 4th, when the Times reported of talks with the private equity groups.

86993,20491,2008-07-25T04:46:00-04:00,,"Cadence announced rather unimpressive Q2 results on Wednesday. Revenues of $329 million were higher than the market’s expectations and grew 15% sequentially but recorded a 16% year-on-year decrease. Product revenue was $195 million, maintenance revenue $100 million, and services the balance of $34 million.In the quarter, 49% of revenues came from the Americas, compared with 40% the previous quarter. Asia followed with a 30% contribution; Japan brought in 18% of overall revenue. Europe’s share was 21% of overall revenue.For Q3, Cadence projected revenues of $235-$245 million with a non-GAAP loss of $0.09-$0.11 per share. Revenue projections for the year are $1.12-$1.14 billion, compared with the company’s earlier guidance of $1.6 billion. Projected EPS for the year is $0.01-$0.05, while the market was looking for EPS of $1.16.I have often  talked about consolidation within the EDA industry as the first step to improving its future and the possible buy-out of Mentor Graphics. With the recent announcement of Cadence’s hostile takeover bid for Mentor Graphics (NASDAQ:MENT), the dice are finally rolling.Cadence has already purchased 4.3 million shares of Mentor amounting to 4.7% of Mentor’s common stock through open market transactions. I said that this takeover bid of $1.6 billion, or $16 per share, might be slightly high, but the deal would be worth the money if Cadence is able to leverage the alliance to compete with Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) and get the industry out of the current price wars.The deal means Cadence would have additional debt of $1.1 billion on aggressive credit terms. Given the market conditions, it might be a difficult debt to repay, but management seemed confident of the company’s ability to pay it back in four years – with or without synergies from Mentor.Management, however, is worried about the current market conditions. With the sales cycle lengthening and budgets tightening, customers are willing to stay at older nodes. Customers across the globe are willing to take risks in delivery or efficiency instead of investing in superior technology.On pricing, Cadence is going back to a 90% ratable license mix, which will enable them to keep the value of their technology. This is a step back from the 50% ratable/50% upfront model that they had earlier migrated to. It is unclear what impact this change would have on the company’s financials.The company’s shares slipped in after-hours trading before recovering marginally to $10.27. However, on Thursday morning, the shares tumbled down to a new 52-week low of $6.9. That puts its market cap at $1.7 billion, compared to Mentor’s $1.2 billion. It will be interesting to see what Mentor’s earnings look like.So far, Mentor is not talking to Cadence. The company has hired bankers (Goldman and Merrill) to “fend-off” Cadence’s acquisition bid, which, with the current share price situation, may have to go away anyway. If Mentor’s stock also drops dramatically, then paying $16/share may not be a great idea. On the other hand, if Mentor holds up, this puts Cadence in an awkward position. Mentor will point to the Cadence stock and ask shareholders, “You want us to merge with THEM?”Disclosure: None"
38055,20521,2007-06-12T05:00:49-04:00,,"Does naivete rule when investors send Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) shares up to a 52-week high on the rumors of a buy-out? The truth is, a Private Equity player buying Cadence doesn’t make a hell of a lot of sense, since the company has a very slow growth rate due to the industry’s normal behavior patterns. It has been reasonably well-managed within its constraints, and cannot be split up due to the integrated nature of its design platform. I have said this before, but will say it again: the buy-out target in EDA is Mentor Graphics (NASDAQ:MENT), not Cadence. It can be split up. In fact, it should be chopped up and sold in parts. They have a great DFM piece that both Cadence and Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) would pay a premium to get their hands on. Synopsys would also buy their PCB business (Cadence already has one of these; especially with increasing emphasis in chip consumption by the Automotive industry, Mentor’s PCB business is a very good asset. On the other hand, Mentor’s IC Design tools lag behind the rest and are nothing to write home about. In terms of the destiny of Cadence, it ties intricately with the Future of EDA question. DFM is one of their identified growth areas. Here, they might consider a merger with TSMC. As it becomes increasingly complex to design manufacturable chips that are miniaturized to the limits, tighter integration with foundries are becoming critical. I don’t see how a buy-out might help here, unless KKR is thinking about rolling up Cadence, TSMC, ARM (ARMHY) and KLA Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC) into a significantly larger semiconductor industry infrastructure play, which I think would inject some serious excitement into a stalling and vastly uninspiring industry, in terms of wealth creation. In would also create efficiencies that are truly valuable to the customers. The semiconductor industry today is at about $280 billion. It will go to a trillion by 2020. Everything from cars to medical devices have numerous chips in them. However, for EDA, this doesn’t translate into an automatic growth curve. EDA depends on unique design starts, not chip volume. Design starts are dropping, even as chip volume ramps up exponentially. In the future, smaller number of highly complex chips will likely drive the industry, shrinking the room for EDA’s growth. Vertical integration may be a very good solution, and if KKR has enough vision to pull this off, then more power to them!"
19355,20171,2006-10-26T19:28:16-04:00,,"Frequently, it is said that those who made the most money during the San Francisco gold rush (the 1849 one, not the Internet boom) were those who sold the shovels. A similar analogy for the semiconductor industry would point to the equipment makers. However, as we have noted often, eventually the miners won’t need any more shovels either. That’s why Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) points to a better business model still. According to Reuters.com: So, they are confirming what we’ve been saying but claim they are immune to it. Their 9% growth year/year is far lower than the semi equipment makers’ recent 70% gains, but is likely far steadier. We’ll call them the map makers. Helping the miners find their way to riches, or at least pointing out the best places to dig. And of course, R&D creates a mixed bag for the semiconductor makers themselves. A hot new product could fill up some of the excess capacity, but could also make the existing inventory piles obsolete. But still, better at least not to be piling it higher. CDNS 1-yr chart:"
74880,20521,2008-04-30T08:46:38-04:00,,"Cadence, (Nasdaq: CDNS) continued to be bothered by the woes of the EDA industry. Q1 results that were reported last week saw the quarter’s revenue drop by 21% annually, and 37% sequentially to $287 million. However, the revenue still beat market expectations of $285 million. EPS for Q1 met analyst expectation of $0.04, recording a fall of 85% from $0.26 in Q1 of 2007. Segment-wise, Product revenue contributed $156 million, maintenance revenue contributed $99 million and services revenue brought in $32 million in the quarter. The troubled economic conditions affecting the Americas became evident with America revenues falling to only 40% of overall revenue. European and Japanese contributions increased to 22% and 26% respectively while the rest of Asia contribution remained at 12%. During the quarter, it repurchased 19.8 million shares of stock at a total cost of $216 million. Going forward, Q2 revenue is expected to be in the range of $310 - $320 million, and EPS in the range of $0.13 to $0.15. For the year, 2008 revenue is projected to be $1.49 - $1.54 billion with EPS of $1.14 - $1.22. I have written earlier about the need to provide a seamless “Chip Infrastructure Portfolio.” One such small step taken by Cadence in this direction was its acquisition of Chip Estimate Corporation. Chip Estimate Corporation is a leader in IC planning. With its acquisition, Cadence hopes to improve its customers’ productivity as it would now be able to gauge key factors like product cost, power dissipation and performance at the outset of the development project. A small step in the direction of Virtual Prototyping discussed earlier, but still far, far from the promised land. However, much to my dismay, the company continued to place bets on longer duration “all-you-can-eat contracts.” Its average contract duration was marginally higher to three or four years as it revels in the belief that in present economic conditions, customers prefer to use the same technology for longer. Even though, it has its revenue stream more predictable, it does take the punch out of technology breakthroughs, disruptive innovations, and associated upsides. And the practice has basically sent the rest of the EDA industry, especially smaller players, reeling. Cadence still isn’t taking any bold step in fighting out the EDA worries. One company that it should take a very close look at is BlazeDFM. It is a company that is making a direct impact on yield, and has partnered with TSMC to actually participate in customers’ gains. The stock is also not doing too much, with the price only falling only marginally by $0.10 to $11.34."

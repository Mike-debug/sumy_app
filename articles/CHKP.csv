4385764,102101,2020-11-06T08:55:20-05:00,"Management needs to provide more color to raise the market's conviction in Check Point's growth story.Check Point has acquired most of the capabilities it needs to edge out competitors.Check Point has also improved its sales strategy.By guiding the street on the strength of its new bets in cloud and next-generation security, the market will value Check Point like other growth peers.I see the weak growth factor as the major roadblock impacting multiples expansion. The ball remains in Check Point's court to update this narrative.","Source: AiThorityCheck Point Software (CHKP) reported impressive results during the last earnings. It continues to add strong capabilities to drive its growth factor. Combining its solid cash flows and the strong growth from its cloud offering will drive valuation multiples. This onus rests on management to drive the market's conviction. A generous multiple on the fast-growing cloud security segment, a moderate multiple on the rest of the business, in addition to its cash position at $4b, show the strong potential for multiple expansion. This article highlights the hidden opportunity.Check Point's Q3'20 results were impressive against a backdrop of weak expectations due to its unpromising top-line prints in recent quarters. Revenue beat by $4.5m, at $509m (+3.7%). GAAP EPS beat by $0.07, at $1.42. Internally, strong performance from its subscription segment, which includes the solutions under its Infinity architecture, drove the growth outperformance. This was assisted by the network security gateways, which drove a rare 10% growth. The network security business has been flattish in recent quarters.Management reiterated the strong retention and renewal rate of its offerings. Going forward, management is guiding for revenue of $525m - $575m (2.2% growth at the midpoint) in Q4 and non-GAAP EPS of $2- $2.18 in Q4. The guidance is expected to be impacted by a quarterly refresh in the December period. After the earnings report, Goldman Sachs raised guidance from Sell to Neutral:In addition to the bullish observation from Goldman Sachs, I believe Check Point has strong technical offerings to drive growth. The headwinds from the upgrade to a new management console have declined. A second COVID-19 wave remains a headwind to growth. This will be slightly offset by Check Point's improved remote working solutions, which we will explore in the business section. The market continues to expect weak single-digit growth as cloud subscription growth outpaces on-prem licenses.Source: Seeking AlphaI believe the short-term growth estimates are conservative (3% growth in 2021 decelerating to 2.5% in 2022) because Check Point has significantly improved its offerings. Check Point's cloud offerings are recording high double-digit growth. It also has the resources to scale efficiently, going by its historical OpEx management.Check Point's future product strategy revolves around its ability to sell its network security offerings and other products under the Infinity architecture umbrella. The network security business gains from demand in the Telco industry, data centers, and large enterprises with strong security demands. Infinity houses offerings from endpoint, cloud, data, mobile, threat management, and other bets. The sales and product positioning of Infinity might explain why Check Point isn't breaking out sales by product category (cloud, endpoint, network).Source: GartnerRecently, Check Point added capabilities in security operations via the launch of Infinity SOCs. This complements its security operations strategy to help security analysts effectively investigate cyber-attacks and threats.Check Point also acquired a remote access security company called Odo security. Odo improves Check Point's Zero Trust capabilities. Odo also serves as a good VPN replacement.Check Point also announced an IoT Protect solution for IoT devices. The IoT security market is one of the fastest-growing segments of the cybersecurity space.The moves in IoT, SecOps, and Zero Trust correlate with the concentration of new moves in the cybersecurity space. The growth of cloud endpoints means more data for security teams to handle. This requires the development of modern security analytics tools and teams. Also, the proliferation of IoT devices has created new opportunities in the cybersecurity space.The shorter upfront recognition of its subscription business is expected to mask growth in the near term. Check Point didn't break out cloud revenue growth, but it pegged cloud revenue % of overall business at 10%. It also reiterated the double-digit growth of cloud offerings. The investments in cloud and other next-generation security bets have led to some margin sacrifice in recent quarters. Going forward, I expect more margins volatility.Check Point has evolved its capabilities to provide a robust suite of security offerings for enterprises of all sizes. It continues to boost its cloud security and security automation capabilities to play into the current wave of workloads moving to the cloud.To differentiate itself from competitors, Check Point has leveraged its deep expertise in providing highly efficient appliances.It also has strong security teams and analysts that uncover the latest security exploits. Last quarter, Check Point highlighted the top campaigns tracked and stopped by its security team.Source: Check PointCheck Point also has a lean operating model that drives industry-leading margins and cash flows. These attractive metrics have driven strong liquidity and operating cash flows in recent quarters.Source: Seeking AlphaCheck Point's strongest factor grade is profitability. Value has been average because the market is catching up to its attractive financials, including an income margin of 42%, an operating cash flow margin of 49%, a cash position of approx $4b, and zero debt. These attractive numbers are expected to weaken in the short term due to competitive pressure forcing the company to reinvest to scale its next-generation bets.Check Point's growth factor is weak because enterprises are now buying more subscriptions and cloud offerings. These offerings are still a small portion of Check Point's overall revenue. While Check Point has acquired most of the needed capabilities to stay competitive, it will take a few more quarters for these capabilities to reflect in the top line.Profitability is the strongest factor grade for Check Point. I expect this grade to weaken in the coming quarters. Firstly, new acquisitions drive expenses that impact the income statement. Also, Check Point has raised operating expenses in recent quarters to fight for market share in the cloud space. I expect this trend to continue.Momentum benefited from the demand for remote working solutions in Q2 and Q3. The effect of this trend is waning. Cloud migration and cloud security offerings are expected to drive momentum in the coming quarters. In cloud security, Check Point has all the capabilities to cross-sell its offerings, and I expect it to benefit from this trend.Lastly, Check Point's EPS revision factor has been impacted by weak growth and reduced interest income. Though it beat EPS guidance in the last quarter, I don't expect significant EPS growth in the coming quarters.I see Check Point getting picked up by three categories of investors: firstly, long-term growth players who are seeking growth at a reasonable price. Check Point's subscription business contains a lot of solutions that are in demand by modern enterprises. Secondly, I see value investors acquiring some shares due to its attractive cash flows and share repurchase program. Thirdly, I see momentum investors buying into the remote working trend. A second COVID-19 wave in Europe can drive a spike in demand for solutions for cloud migration and remote working.For my valuation, I expect cloud revenue growth to drive subscription revenue. This will result in a 5% revenue growth due to the flattish license and maintenance segments in the coming year. Since subscription revenue leads to shorter payment terms, I expect the flexible duration options to impact billings growth and deferred revenue.In addition to reduced earnings margins due to opex ramp and declining interest income, operating cash flow margin will drive a steady FCF margin decline in the coming years.Check Point is debt-free. This means its cost of equity drives its cost of capital. I will be using a modest WACC of 8% as the hurdle rate. This cost of capital considers the low interest rate environment, Check Point's historical low beta, a modest risk premium, and the huge reinvestment to scale its cloud offerings.Comps/MispricingSource: AuthorThe table above compares Check Point's financials to its competitors. The major competitors are Fortinet (FTNT) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). FireEye's combination of cloud and network security offerings also makes it a good peer. NortonLifeLock (NLOK) provides a good peer comparison as both companies are in similar stages of their business lifecycle. It also helps to understand how non-network security companies are valued.I excluded CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Zscaler (ZS) because they are both in the growth and investment phase of their business lifecycle. As such, they have more expensive sales multiples. Though, they can also help calibrate the valuation of cloud security bets.From the chart table above, we can see Check Point is somewhat undervalued. The undervaluation argument lies in its attractive margins. Compared to competitors, Check Point's gross margin and EBITDA margin are outstanding. Despite these attractive metrics, Check Point is still valued in line with its peers. Having followed Check Point since the cloud security wave picked up, I believe Check Point hasn't done enough to explain the potential of its cloud security business. This has forced the market to estimate the strength of its cloud security offerings from its subscription segment. The subscription segment grew at 10% during the last earnings. Marc Pentacoff of Seeking Alpha analyzed the market during the peak of the coronavirus wave to show the correlation between valuation multiples and forward growth estimates in a bear market. From the analysis, stocks expected to compound revenue between 10% -20% traded at a valuation multiples range of 4x - 7x. If we assume the subscription business currently drives 30% of overall revenue. Using a multiple of 6x on the subscription ( 6 x $600m = $3600m) portion and a generous 4x ( 4 x $1400m = $5600m) on the rest of the business growing in the low single-digit gives a valuation of $13.2b after adding cash of $4b. This shows Check Point is fairly valued. However, if we break out the cloud potential, which is growing to half of the subscription business, and apply a more generous multiple of 10x -15x, it is easy to make a case for multiples expansion.In terms of demand-related risks, I'm mostly worried about Check Point's win rate in the cloud security space. On the product side, I am not worried about execution risk; however, I remain wary of Check Point's sales motion. Recently, Check Point has improved its sales motion via the launch of a distribution marketplace to help resellers reach new customers as it grows its cloud security solutions. This is promising as it fights for market share.I expect EPS growth to continue to be impacted by the declining interest revenue. This might force Check Point to ramp its share repurchase program.I am worried about competitors. The cloud security space has a lot of strong players.A second COVID-19 wave remains a serious threat to normal business activities. This might impact Check Point's offline engagements.In terms of valuation, Check Point's endearing feature is its strong value factor. Value has underperformed in recent quarters. If this trend continues, Check Point might continue to trade sideways.Check Point's growth options are attractive and improving. Its financials remain solid. Management needs to shed more light on the cloud security opportunity. The macro-environment remains volatile due to a second COVID-19 wave rocking Europe. This isn't good for momentum heading into the attractive fourth quarter. Valuation continues to underprice the attractive margins and cash flow factors. Check Point remains a strong cash flow generator providing some safety for investors with a value tilt. Growth investors will have to wait for more color on its cloud security and next-generation security bets. I believe Check Point can be worth a lot more given its solid operating efficiency and cheap cost of capital (solid balance sheet, no debt).If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4370715,24361,2020-08-25T15:51:45-04:00,"This should be a rare opportunity for Check Point, as security remains a priority for enterprise budgets and enterprises are adding capacity to accommodate increased work-from-home demand.
        The new Quantum portfolio has driven the first product growth in almost three years and a new product designed to secure industrial networks is worth watching.
        The familiar concerns for Check Point - the company's ability to generate attractive growth and maintain margins - remain in place, as the company seems under-leveraged to higher-value growth opportunities.
        Check Point's prospective return is still in the high single-digits, which isn't bad given the predictability of the business, but high-margin/low-growth software names can be frustrating.","I had mixed feelings on Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) a year ago, as I thought the shares were priced for some decent returns, but also didn’t see much going on with the business that would break it out of its prolonged doldrums where growth was concerned. Since then, the shares have basically kept pace with the S&P 500 and Palo Alto (PANW), but have been left behind by smaller players like Fortinet (FTNT), Sailpoint (SAIL) and Zscaler (ZS).This current environment may be about as good as it can get for Check Point, with security spending holding up as an essential area where enterprises won’t look to cut costs, work-from-home driving some incremental sales opportunities, and Check Point’s large recurring revenue base providing some security at a time when there are still a lot of modeling uncertainties. I’m still worried about Check Point’s relatively modest leverage to cloud security, though, and what that could mean for margins five or 10 years down the road. The valuation isn’t bad here, but I believe near-term outperformance would be more likely driven by another wave of pessimism/fear hitting the markets.Check Point had a good second quarter, as those aforementioned positive drivers all chipped in to help. Revenue beat expectations by 4%, with a nearly 14% beat on the product line and a small 2% beat at the subscriptions line. Gross margin was slightly better than expected, while reduced operating expenses helped drive a 10% operating income beat and a nearly three-point operating margin beat.Revenue rose 3.6% this quarter, almost exactly in line with the quarterly average over the past three years. Product revenue rose 1%, the first growth in almost three years, helped by increased demand for physical firewall appliances in general and good initial acceptance of the new Quantum line (introduced in April). Subscription revenue rose 10%, while maintenance revenue rose 1%.Gross margin was stable with both the year-ago and quarter-ago periods, while operating income improved 5% and operating margin improved 60bp from the year-ago period. Operating income also rose about 5% sequentially, with margin up about 260bp.Deferred revenue rose 4% yoy and fell 4% qoq, with short-term deferred revenue up 5% yoy and down 3% qoq. Billings were strong, up 7% yoy and 10% qoq, beating expectations by 11%, and I believe there was actual growth in product billings, something that I don’t believe has happened since the second quarter of 2017.Enterprises are not going to look at their IT security budgets as a rich source of cost-cutting opportunities, and in fact many CIOs have reported that attacks have increased – I’d guess that would-be attackers would assume that companies are distracted given the challenges and chaos created by COVID-19. What’s more, in order to support increased work-from-home loads, many customers are reported adding more firewall appliances to data centers.That’s all good for Check Point, and I believe the company is also getting a boost from its new Quantum appliances. These new products include higher-value subscriptions (like Sandblast) and they’re a better suite of products overall in terms of performance characteristics, but Check Point has priced them at prices similar to the older generation, leading to an attractive value proposition and strong initial interest. It’s also worth noting that Quantum appliances are integrated with Maestro – Check Point’s hyperscale security offering.Check Point also introduced the 1570R appliance – a security product for critical industrial functions like industrial control systems (or ICS) and SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition). Think about the havoc that someone could wreak by hacking into a refinery’s control systems and you can understand why this product gets my attention – particularly in the context of more companies adopting industrial IoT and remote maintenance/monitoring functions and creating some new system vulnerabilities/attack points.While this should be a relatively good time for Check Point, again I note that growth was simply in line with the average of the past few years, and I don’t see a meaningfully acceleration as particularly likely.A big part of the problem is that Check Point remains overweight to what I’d call more “legacy” applications (like physical firewall appliances), and the company hasn’t been as aggressive as peers like Palo Alto, CyberArk (CYBR), Okta (OKTA), Zscaler and others in building up its capabilities in areas like access management, secure remote access, and cloud security.Check Point did offer some rare detail about its cloud business, disclosing that it is about 10% of the overall business and growing at 70%, but I’m worried that this business can’t grow fast enough to offset pressures on the legacy operations. Yes, Check Point does have a strong recurring revenue base and a large base of installed customers that aren’t going to be ripping out their systems, but I worry about what the margins will look like in the coming years as these areas of security are seen as less “core” and competition shifts more toward price than feature sets.The fate of margins makes a big difference in a discounted cash flow model. Over the last decade, average adjusted trailing FCF margins have migrated from the high 50%’s to the low 50%’s. If Check Point’s adjusted FCF margins decline from a recent multiyear average of around 51% to 47% (over the next decade), fair value is in the mid-$120’s. If Check Point can somehow maintain a steady level of FCF generation (51% adjusted FCF margins), the fair value jumps into the low $130’s. Revenue growth also certainly plays a role here; my base-case estimates drive a long-term revenue growth rate of around 3.5%, and my growth expectations are a little higher than the Street’s.A blended growth and margin model is a little more generous to Check Point, supporting a forward revenue multiple of around 7x and a fair value in the high $120’s.I don’t dislike Check Point. Appreciate it for what it is, and it is a pretty impressive company. I do think, though, that the company has under-invested in new growth opportunities, and I worry that Check Point’s historical “fast follower” strategy is going to lead to the company getting left behind, leaving growth stuck in the low-to-mid single-digits. High-margin/low-growth software names can work, but they can also be frustrating names to hold, and while Check Point’s valuation can still support a high single-digit annualized return from here, it’s not my preferred idea."
4360916,102101,2020-07-27T04:00:32-04:00,"Check Point's subscription business is worth watching.New bets in IoT, cloud security, and SecOps will boost the company's growth factor.Reduced operating expenses, share buyback, and more cross-sell into its installed base will drive EPS growth.The company's attractive value factor will continue to provide support until the subscription segment gains full momentum.","Source: FreepikCheck Point Software (CHKP) is making promising bets to drive growth. Its new IoT and SecOps offerings will help its subscription segment to reaccelerate growth. Reduced operating expenses and its share buyback program will also be accretive to EPS. This will help its value factor provide the needed support for its growth factor as the subscription business becomes a more significant portion of revenue. As a result, the risk/reward dynamic remains favorable due to the company's improving competitive positioning and solid financials.Key Drivers: TCO-Subscription-Threat Prevention-SecOps-Cloud-IoTCheck Point exceeded expectations last quarter. The highlight was the security subscription segment growth of approx. 10% (y/y). This assisted products and licenses, and maintenance revenue, which were flattish. The shift of greenfield deals and some refresh towards security subscription engagements continues to mask top line growth metrics. External growth drivers remain favorable. Check Point saw reasonable demand for its work-from-home solutions. Customers also migrated to its Quantum Security Gateways. These appliances provide better performance and are, thus, highly cost-effective. Check Point has been able to offer more value to its customers via its regular product updates. While the company hesitated to give forward guidance, the long-term outlook remains promising. Key Drivers: Platform-Land & Expand-Margins-FCF-LiquidityCheck Point is releasing new products to beef up its capabilities in security operations (Infinity SOC), cloud security (CloudGuard), and IoT security (IoT Protect). In cloud security, its solutions cover cloud security posture management, serverless security, cloud workload protection, and cloud access protection. Check Point strategically differentiates itself via the block rate of its offerings. Its APT solutions are highly effective, and the company can easily infuse these capabilities into new products to boost the value of its offerings. In the near term, Check Point observed large and existing customers keeping their private data center security posture. This observation shifts the demand for cloud security solutions towards new customers born into a cloud environment. The company estimated cloud security subscription to be 10% of revenue. This is growing at approx. 70% y/y. This means cloud products were an insignificant portion of revenue in recent quarters. Going forward, the rapid growth of its cloud offerings will neutralize the downside effect of its revenue recognition mix shift to more subscription engagements.Check Point's IoT offerings build on top of the speed and block rate of its solutions. It is geared towards the management of IoT devices by providing visibility and classification. This capability is enabled through integrations with top discovery engines. It includes the unique value proposition (what Check Point does best) of preventing cyber threats. It also features zero-trust network segmentation. This is a promising revenue driver for the company.Infinity SOC unifies threat prevention, detection, remediation, and investigation. Infinity SOC leverages Threat Cloud for threat intelligence alongside Check Point's cyber research analysts. Infinity SOC will drive business efficiency by reducing the cost of managing security solutions and attending to threat alerts. This update will support Check Point's endpoint security solutions.The company's gross margin was flat y/y. Operating margin benefited from lower operating expenses due to shelter-in-place orders. Check Point is still hiring, which means it is confident about gaining market share. It observed solid results from key verticals like finance, health care, government, and technology. The tax rate remained at approx. 17%, while interest income reduced. Interest income is expected to decline due to the low-interest rate environment. Since Check Point has acquired most of its capabilities, its attractive valuation compared to its competitors continues to drive the rationale to maintain its share buyback program. This is good for short-term investors as Check Point grows the efficiency of its sales team. The company has the flexibility to stomach extended payment options from customers impacted by COVID-19. Its cash position is attractive, and minor bumps in accounts receivable shouldn't be a major concern. Key Drivers: Integrations-Acquisitions-Partnerships-International ExpansionCheck Point has improved its competitive positioning. Its new security gateways offer faster, cost-effective, and durable deployment options for customers. Its added capabilities in IoT, cloud, and security operations will also grow the breadth of its security platform. Its regular security research activities have uncovered a growth in cyber-attacks targeted at mobile devices and cloud platforms. This research will serve as a launchpad for the company to grow revenue from its endpoint security and SecOps offerings. Check Point appears hesitant to provide more color on the depth of its SD-WAN offering. Its partnership strategy in the SD-WAN space appears sufficient to acquire the needed capabilities in the short term. Fortinet recently acquired a cloud security solution in its pursuit to be the first security platform with a complete SASE (secure access service edge) capability. This position will be highly coveted as enterprises demand more consolidation of security services, as it reinforces FTNT's idea that networking and security will continue to converge.On the macro front, EMEA outperformed, while the US fared as expected. Check Point maintained its cautious outlook about the macro environment due to the uncertainty about shelter-in-place orders in Europe and America. This drove the company's lack of guidance for the next quarter and the full year. Key Drivers: BuyBack-Economies Of Scale-Switching Cost-Momentum-AnalystsSource: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Check Point will have to rely on its EPS and cash flow factors to buffer its growth factor. This will favor short-term investors. Its valuation will be a function of EPS growth. EPS will be supported by the double-digit growth rate of its subscription segment, which will benefit from favorable macro trends. This will also be supported by reduced operating expenses offset by reduced interest income.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Long-term investors will rely on the optionality from its cloud and IoT bets. These optionalities are promising given Check Point's leadership in the cybersecurity space. Check Point is one of the top three pure-play cybersecurity companies building a fully integrated security platform. This capability will drive margins as it sells into its installed base.Source: AuthorCheck Point's demand-side risk factors will benefit from favorable macro trends. Work from home, digital transformation projects, cyber-attacks, and its high-margin business model will all drive predictable growth in the short term.A significant risk factor to its financials will stem from reduced interest income. If multiples compress due to a gloomy outlook for the global economy, the share buyback program might not be immediately accretive to valuation.Discounting by competition remains a major concern. Customers refreshing to low-ticket SaaS deployments might make smaller upfront cash commitments. This will impact licensing and maintenance revenue growth.Check Point's valuation risk factors will benefit from its share buyback program, which will be accretive to EPS if the macro environment remains accretive to valuation. The company's valuation will also benefit from its attractive cash position and operating cash flow margin.Check Point remains an attractive investment due to its well-rounded factor grades. While the company's low revenue growth doesn't help multiples expansion, its share buyback program and appealing EPS factor will deliver returns for short-term investors.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

Check Point has the option to accelerate its growth factor.Given its investments in cloud security, investors will enjoy attractive valuation factors across all fronts.","Source: Check PointCheck Point Software (CHKP) offers a balance of all the attractive valuation factors that investors enjoy. As it pays more attention to its marketing and sales tactics to accelerate its growth factor, investors will enjoy multiple expansion. Check Point plays in the cybersecurity market that is experiencing favorable tailwinds as more enterprises migrate their workload to the cloud. Check Point is also winning customers due to the high efficiency of its network security appliances and its investments in preventing the most sophisticated cybersecurity threats. While competitors threaten its ability to expand its market share, Check Point has the experience and financial stamina to manoeuver its way. Investors should stay long this attractive cyber play.Global Reach-Network-Security-CloudCheck Point is a network security player with a global reach. In addition to its network security solutions, it also offers cloud security solutions, endpoint security solutions, and security solutions for mobile and IoT devices.Check Point's revenue has been stuck in the mid to low single-digit range, firstly due to the law of large numbers. The cloud security market is recording strong growth. Customers are replacing their network security licenses with security subscriptions. Spreading out the multi-year billings from security appliances and maintenance into quarterly contract fulfilment explains part of the growth weakness. The other part of the growth weakness is a combination of competitive pressure, sales execution challenges, and slow market share uptake. The pace of innovation in cybersecurity is fast. As competitors update their platforms, Check Point risks losing out on the low hanging fruit.Check Point's capital allocation strategy is geared towards pacifying existing investors. Check Point has been buying back shares while investing the excess cash flow from operations into marketable securities. Investors interested in a cloud security stock generating solid cash flow with loads of growth options will find Check Point's valuation attractive. This is due to Check Point's growing confidence towards accelerating its growth factor.Hiring-Platform-Land & Expand-Margins-FCFCheck Point has most of the cybersecurity solutions that customers demand. It recently conducted a survey that produced a positive result about the efficiency of its remote work solutions. Though, the positive result can also be attributed to the low TCO (total cost of ownership) of its offerings. This is reassuring in a market where Zscaler (ZS) is replacing VPN solutions with its proxy technology.On the product front, Check Point is solving next-generation network security problems using a combination of cost optimization and efficiency. It recently released a gateway for industrial control systems and SCADA environments. This is an operational technology play that echoes moves by other players in the vulnerability assessment space. The gateway complements Check Point's full range of security gateways for all enterprises released earlier in the year. The gateway is bundled with Sandblast. Sandblast is Check Point's advanced threat protection platform, which has a 100% block score for zero-day threats. Zero-day threats are arguably the most sophisticated malware vector as they have no patch developed to mitigate their propagation. Highlighting Sandblast is important because it is one of Check Point's fastest-selling security subscriptions.Check Point's cloud security business now has over 3,000 customers. It supports major public cloud platforms. Its cloud security products have capabilities in cloud network security, cloud vulnerability assessment, cloud workload protection, and cloud threat hunting. These represent the bulk of the security solutions that enterprises need when adopting a cloud-centric network architecture.Check Point's capital allocation strategy has mostly been a split between growth and margin sustainability. Investing in new features keep existing customers. Check Point's ability to acquire the capabilities it needs while initiating new share buyback programs is compelling. Though, the evidence that sufficient capital is being allocated to improve its go-to-market playbook is sometimes lacking. In the past, Check Point has experienced sales execution issues. It has also experienced product-related challenges after it released a new management console. This created a challenge as most customers upgrading to new products were still on the old management console.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Getting ahead of these challenges will take more quarters. In the meantime, investors can enjoy the attractive EPS factor driven by Check Point's lean operating cost. The chart above highlights Check Point's attractive income and FCF margins. These are arguably the best in the cybersecurity space. These factors are complemented by Check Point's debt-free balance sheet, which includes a cash position of $1.7B.Branding-Refresh-Integrations-Partnerships-FXTop network security players are making the pivot to cloud security while automating security service delivery. Fortinet (FTNT) is the only network security player whose growth strategy is mostly about the speed and latency of its products. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is currently investing in the future of cybersecurity. Check Point's competitive edge include its cheap cost of capital and attractive financials. Going forward, Check Point has to double down on its brand positioning to improve the depth of its competitive edge. The recent partnership with Coursera is a good step in the right direction.Macro headwinds are minimal as Check Point sells mostly to large enterprises. Though, it might also experience the headwind from lower interest rates (drives lower interest income) and FX volatility from its ex-US business.FCF-Growth-Analysts-Market ShareSource: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha) peers include PANW, FTNT, NLOK, PFPT, and ZS)Check Point spots a combination of low forward growth forecast and relatively moderate to high valuation ratios compared to its peers. The table above highlights the drivers of a high valuation when a company is experiencing low growth. This is often a result of having healthy EPS and cash flow factors that are attractive to value hunters. To generate more value, players in this situation look to product updates, acquisitions, and branding. Check Point has done most of these. It only needs to sell its new offerings to its customer base efficiently. This will require the invention of a new go-to-market playbook that will take some time to master. Risk-averse investors should wait for Check Point's growth factor to improve before initiating a position.Source: AuthorCheck Point faces market saturation risk in segments like network and endpoint security. Execution risk will be less of a concern if it acquires more market share at a faster pace.Financial risk factors are limited though opex growth could impact EPS. Competitors might pose a significant risk due to bundling and discounting activities to gain market share. Macro weakness will be propagated by a weak Israeli shekel against the dollar. This will drive FX volatility. Innovation is also a concern as players like CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Zscaler continue to rethink cybersecurity methodologies.Check Point has the optionality to catalyze its growth factor, given the ample cash on its balance sheet. The cloud security space is up for grabs. As Check Point delays going all out, the cost of capital that will be expended towards gaining market share will grow, and the power of Check Point's optionality will be diluted. Regardless, investors will continue to enjoy its attractive margins in the short term.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

Successful crisis management investing means retail value investors protect their cash and savings by investing in stable, growing, essential industries thus minimizing risk.Threat prevention from harm and damage is the hallmark of Check Point solutions.It is the most common means of industrial espionage to steal proprietary information and disrupt competitors.

China zeroed in on targets in India before the fighting started last week and soldiers died. The banking system and ATMs are flooded by hacks. Iran allegedly tried to dislocate Israel's water system, so Israel supposedly retaliated two months ago with attacks on Iran's shipping ports. The Wall Street Journal reports ""a rise in cyberattacks on the health-care industry,"" including attempts to steal novel coronavirus vaccine formulations.The company is no longer is the 1993 start-up, glitzy, and glamorous center of attention it once was; one government agency now describes it as ""the granddaddy of cybersecurity."" Yet, CHKP is also Israel's largest tech firm selling to all Fortune and Global 100 companies. It sports a market cap of $15.66B. CHKP has offices in 38 countries. Approach CHKP in these times of crisis investing from the perspective of Philosopher of Technology Lewis Mumford who once said, ""Every generation revolts against its fathers and makes friends with its grandfathers.""The pandemic, according to the Check Point CEO, Gil Shwed, is moving the technology evolution forward by ten years. It is a primary focus of Check Point to secure the new tech. The demand going forward for the services of Check Point is virtually unchecked. Here is an example cited by Check Point that speaks to the enigmatic mirage of tech evolution that keeps Check Point focused and growing:According to Allied Market Research, cybersecurity was a $104B+ market in 2017. By 2025, it will touch $206B, ""growing at a CAGR of 11.9% from 2018 to 2025… Demand for cloud-based cybersecurity (where Check Point excels) solutions is also one of the major factors fueling the market growth.""Over the past five years, the share price of CHKP jumped nearly 29%. The current share price at ~$107 per share is flat for the past year. The price dipped briefly into the low $80s during the first quarter of the year when the markets tumbled. Its 52-week high topped $120 per share. This sign of stability is a good portent for retail investors worried about a coming melee in the markets, about further fallout from the pandemic, and arguments over hoarding cashing or investing in America. Briefly, Check Point reported on April 27th earnings of $1.42 per share for the quarter topped analysts' consensus estimates by $0.04. Revenue was $486.50 million for the quarter (+3.1% Q/Q) compared to the consensus estimate of $480.78 million. The net margin was 41.03% and the return on equity was 23.45%.Source: Yahoo FinanceCheck Point continues producing new tech solutions to the new challenges. The true value of Check Point lies in its continuing commitment to meet evolving cyberthreats. This year, its 1570R security gateway system went on sale to protect critical infrastructures in utilities, oil and gas, and manufacturing facilities. It addresses the threats to smart grids and smart cities, too. This month, CHKP announced the launch of a fully-automated cloud platform to address cloud-related challenges with a single solution.Source: Allied Market ResearchA word of caution is in order that the share price is currently on the high side of fair value but it is more than ten percent below its 52-week high. Some stocks are best valued for their potential. CHKP is such a stock. This mature and plodding company is forecast to have slow but steady revenue and earnings growth that will keep the share price stable and investments relatively safe. Stellar growth for Check Point is more likely to come from acquisitions than organically. But I remain confident in the company's future since insiders own more than 20% of the shares.Source: Simply Wall StreetThe industry is growing rapidly and Check Point is among the best of the best. The company will continue growing organically and with some zip in its step from R&D and more acquisitions of cybersecurity companies like those it made since October 2019. Ironically, Check Point's largest competitor and biggest critique charges Check Point is a slow-growth company ""putting too much emphasis on profit."" Now, there is a left-handed compliment.Shwed considers Check Point a personal lifetime project he founded and built as the CEO. Growth comes organically but he is unafraid to make acquisitions in the hot Israeli tech market. He claims to have no intention to sell Check Point but the decision may not be his alone. More than 70% of the shares are owned by institutions. Moreover, the momentum in the world of Israel tech is for exits, which jumped 72% to a record of $21.74B in 2019 following a ten-years tear of Israel tech M&As and IPOs. It is conceivable CHKP might be a takeover target in this era of big cybersecurity M&A momentum. Check Point is a mature company and its future growth is unlikely to be gleaming. But that's its value to retail value investors today when analysts and economists complain of lassitude and uncertainty in the markets."

Even during the uncertain economic environment, the company was able to post better than expected results, with revenue growth actually accelerating from last quarter.While management did not provide guidance on the earnings call, they did note that a majority of their revenue comes from annuity streams with most of that already included in Q3. This could mean that Q3 revenue might not be as volatile as some investors may have expected. The company also noted that travel expenses are expected to remain low, which could help margin expansion over the next few quarters.Data by YChartsEven though the stock has not moved too much since reporting earnings, the stock is currently trading near all-time highs. Since the global pandemic swept through the markets, investors realized that CHKP could be a beneficiary as enterprises invest more into their IT security with an increased amount of employees working from home. However, the stock has reached a valuation level where I think investors should start to take a second look.Based on forward revenue, CHKP is more expensive than all of their peer group except Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT). Typically, companies get a high forward revenue multiple if they have fast revenue growth, but with CHKP's revenue growth coming in at 4% during the quarter, I don't see much room for revenue accelerating.With the stock currently trading near all-time highs, it appears investors have already priced in a strong performance over the next few quarters. While I am a believer of the company's long-term operating success, I am a little more hesitant to put new money to work right now.CHKP is an IT security solutions provider focusing on areas such as network security, endpoint security, mobile security, data security, and security management. They are considered one of the legacy players in the security market and have faced intense competition over the past few years. While CHKP provides efficient and effective IT security tools, it should not be valued on a revenue multiple, and investors should focus more on its earnings multiple.The main areas CHKP competes in have seen increased competition from companies that solely focus on a specific area of IT security. Network security has become very saturated by four main players: Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Fortinet and CHKP. Competitors are growing at a much quicker rate, thus taking market share from the company. This area of the IT security market continues to grow mid-single digits each year and is one of CHKP's main focus areas.During Q2, revenue grew 4% to $506 million, which was well above expectations for only ~$488 million. Even though the economic environment was much more challenging during the second quarter, the company was actually able to accelerate their revenue growth from the 3% growth last quarter.The company specifically noted strength from their advanced technologies, such as cloud, ending, and high performance network security. This bodes well with the current work from home trend as enterprises needed to quickly invest in their IT security protocols before transitioning workloads at an at-home environment.Source: Company PresentationFor the first time in several quarters, Products and License revenue turned into a benefit to revenue growth during the quarter. While revenue growth remained minimal, the lack of revenue drag during Q2 helped revenue growth compared to previous quarters.It's no surprise the Security Subscriptions demonstrated strength during the quarter, growing an impressive 10% during the quarter and now representing nearly 33% of the company's overall revenues. As more enterprises push for a work from home environment throughout the remainder of 2020 and likely into 2021, Check Point could be a benefactor of increased security spend.In addition, the company reported strong deferred revenue growth of 4%, improving from the 3% growth last quarter. Deferred revenue reached $1.34 billion, which was pretty similar to last quarter's $1.35 billion. Deferred revenue is a great future indicator of revenue growth, and investors continue to focus on backlog as an underlying sign of company strength.Source: Company PresentationOperating margin during the quarter came in at an impressive 50.1%, which was better than the 49.5% margin seen in the year ago period. In addition, margins improved from 47.5% last quarter. Over time, as the company continues to invest in their security software products, this higher-margin growth will cause margins to expand. In the short term, margins may remain under a little bit of pressure, given increased expenses caused by the global pandemic. However, margins could see some expansion over the long term.EPS for the quarter came in at $1.58, which was well above expectations for only $1.43. The better than expected EPS was due to revenue beating expectations and margins coming in higher than expected.Similar to last quarter, management did not provide quarterly guidance, given the many uncertainties related to the global pandemic. However, management did talk briefly about some revenue and expense considerations (Source: Company Presentation):While it is reassuring to know a large part of their revenue is annuity based and most of that is already known for Q3, investors were likely looking for more guidance of revenue performance. In addition, with some expenses such as travel not expected to resume anytime soon, the company could achieve another quarter of operating margin expansion, which could drive a better than expected Q3 EPS.Since the company reported earnings a week ago, the stock has not moved around much. However, I don't think investors expected this quarter to result in a big stock move. The stock already trades near all-time highs, and investors would need to see a blow-out quarter in order for the stock to jump meaningfully higher.The company did see their revenue growth accelerate to 4% during the quarter. However, this remains well below the growth rate of peers such as PANW and FTNT.Data by YChartsData by YChartsThe global pandemic has made forecasting future quarters and years very difficult as companies have become more reluctant to provide any forward-looking guidance. However, CHKP is a benefactor of the pandemic as more companies look to increase their IT security spending as more employees continue to work from home. But with the stock trading near all-time highs, investors should become a little more cautious around valuation.CHKP currently trades at ~19x forward P/E and while this is well below PANW and FTNT, remains a few turns above CSCO. In my opinion, CSCO is a more diversified business and has historically grown revenue faster than CHKP. At current levels, it is difficult to imagine that CHKP's forward P/E multiple expands more than CSCO.When looking at valuation on a forward revenue basis, CHKP currently trades ~7.7x forward revenue, which puts them slightly below FTNT for the highest forward valuation among the group. Typically, investors will place a high forward revenue multiple on companies who have either a long history of fast growth or have a catalyst to propel revenue growth higher for several quarters. I don't see CHKP accelerating their revenue growth to 10%+ anytime soon, which makes me question the current valuation levels.While the fundamentals for CHKP have improved over the past few quarters, it seems that the stock is already pricing in this. The stock currently trades near all-time highs as investors currently have a lot of confidence in operations continuing to improve in the next few quarters. While I am a believer of the stock over the long term, I find it challenging to believe valuation will continue to expand at an already high level.The IT security and software landscape offers many opportunities for investors to gain exposure. Right now, I have become more willing to invest in other areas of this industry, given CHKP's current valuation and stock near all-time highs."
4335822,105409,2020-04-03T09:47:17-04:00,"Check Point is a well-known name in the security market. The company managed to increase its revenues and FCF by a CAGR of 8.6% and 9.7% over the past years.Check Point's stock price declined 27% from its recent highs as revenues growth slowed down and margins declined drastically. Analysts name competitive pressure and weak innovation as two causes.However, my research shows that these short term financial negatives are caused by growth investments and a change to the subscription model, which should be beneficial in the long term.Risk-averse investors should benefit from this market misunderstanding. Check Point is valued at an adjusted P/E of 10.4 and my DCF model sees 77% upside at this level.I believe the stock could get a re-rating when the newly introduced subscription products bear fruits in 2021. Moreover, the company is quite resilient against a recession.","Check Point Software (CHKP) is a world leader in security solutions, providing both software and hardware IT solutions for management. The company has a very strong brand name as its client base includes 90% of Fortune's 500 companies. Recently, the company has been focusing on ""fifth generation cyber security"", which are large-scale attacks on multiple computing platforms such as the cloud and mobile devices. The cyber security market is rapidly increasing as the number of global devices and complexity of threats are growing, which intensifies the need for security management. Recently, the stock declined by 27.5% from its yearly high (vs. -25% for the S&P 500) due to a top- and bottom line slowdown and the COVID-19 virus. According to analysts and many investors, Check Point is not an attractive stock as competition pressures margins and its market share is declining drastically. In contrast, I believe that this negativity creates a strong buying opportunity as margin deterioration is caused by investments in future growth and the revenue slowdown is caused by its transition to a subscription model with newly, best-in-class introduced products. Clearly, the market is misunderstanding this strategic change, which I will focus on in this article. Check Point is operating in a market that is expected to grow by double digits, while being valued at a cash-adjusted P/E of 10.46. Additionally, this sector is very resilient during a recession which Check Point has proven during the financial crisis. This low-risk company is a strong buy at these levels caused by market misunderstandings. My DCF model shows that there is 76.92% upside for investors buying the stock now.(Source: Tradingview)Check Point posted very consistent growth over the past years, contributed by achieving leadership in a rapidly growing market. CEO and co-founder Gil Schwed, who also owns 17.2% of the shares, managed the company extremely well as revenues almost tripled over the past 12 years, while operating margins expanded by 595 bps. Astonishingly, the company has an operating margin of 44.20% which is one of the highest margins of all publicly listed companies, outperforming competitors by miles. For example, competitors Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT) reported operating margins of -1% and 16% in their last quarters. As the market is heading for a recession in 2020 due to the coronavirus, I am increasingly looking for stocks that generate high, consistent cash flows to add to my portfolio as they will recover much quicker from a market downturn. Interestingly, Check Point managed to keep growing its free cash flow by 91% during the period 2007-2010, in contrast to many companies who made negative cash flows or even went bankrupt. These strong FCF margins are used by Check Point to perform many buybacks as they managed to reduce its share count by 25% over the past 10 years. In February, they announced the expansion of its ongoing repurchase program by an additional $2 bln, which is approximately 15% of its market capitalization. But there are also some negative points to mention. Revenue growth slowed down from double digit growth to low digit growth. Meanwhile, operating margins decreased drastically by more than 10% over the past 7 years. These negatives will be discussed in a later section.(Source: Robbe Delaet based on company data)The strong free cash flow generation during the financial crisis was also reflected in its share price. Check Point's maximum draw down was approximately 30% vs. almost 60% for the S&P 500. Moreover, the stock recovered from these losses in only one year. This out-performance could be repeated during the COVID-19 crisis as the stock is down only 17% YTD as I'm writing this article versus a 25% draw down for the market.Data by YChartsThe Cyber security market, as indicated in the graph below, is expected to grow by a CAGR of 11% until 2025, contributed by two factors: growth in the volume of attacks and growth in the complexity of attacks.(Source: Robbe Delaet based on Grand View Research; numbers in $bln)1) Increase in number of cyber attacksFirst, there is a strong increase in the number of cyber attacks. For example, the number of Internet of Things attacks tripled in the first half of 2019. This strong increase is caused by the increase in number of globally connected devices. This number increased by a factor of approximately 10 over the past 10 years and is expected to keep growing exponentially. The more devices that are used, the more chance a company has undergone a cyber attack.(Source: Helpnetsecurity.com)2) Increase in complexity of cyber attacksSecond, there is an increase in the complexity of cyber attacks. This is primarily contributed by the increase in usage of cloud products and the increase in the complexity of multinationals. Cloud products create many opportunities for businesses and also threats as it is a new way for cyber criminals to attack a company. Also, companies are using many more devices to increase operational efficiency. However, this could increase the number of threats as we are experiencing large increases in connections between these devices.While the market growth is looking to be very positive for Check Point, the company is experiencing a strong slowdown in both top and bottom line growth. Let's discuss this in the next section.Recently, there have been many negative (partially justified) headlines about Check Point's growth and competitive strength, dragging down the stock price. Recently, Goldman Sachs turned bearish:Also, First Analysis came in with a bearish note:At first sight when I analysed the company, I mentioned three bearish aspects. First, margins declined heavily by more than 10% over the past 7 years despite the strong market conditions. Some analysts pointed out that this could be due to higher competitive pressure. Second, revenue growth is slowing down drastically from more than 10% pre-2011 to only 4% last year. In contrast, the security market is still growing significantly, which could also indicate to higher competition and brings us to our last point: Check Point is losing market share. As shown in the graph below, market share has been steady for a long time but started to decrease in 2018. Competitors that focus more on innovation and SaaS, such as Palo Alto and Fortinet, saw a strong increase in market share.(Source: Statista)I know, these negative factors all sound very bearish at first. However, in this complex sector, it is important to dig a little deeper, which I will do in the next section.1)Revenue growth slowdownMany investors and analysts believe that the revenue growth slowdown is caused by competitive factors and poor innovation. In contrast, I believe that this is caused by a significant increase in new, innovative products that are based on a subscription model. Let me explain...It is widely known that the swap from a license model (one-time payment) to a subscription model (quarterly/annual payments) leads to short term top-line pressure as the sales are split between different years. Over the past years, Check Point has increased products and services which are focused on subscriptions, as this could lead to higher customer monetization. New innovative products, like Infinity and Cloudguard, are introduced in 2017. Consequently, subscription sales as a % of revenues increased from 19.5% to 30.5% over the past 5 years, as shown in the graph.(Source: Robbe Delaet based on company disclosures)The subscription growth is primarily contributed by strong growth in Cloudguard (cyber security for your Cloud) and Infinity (a new, innovative platform for all cyber security practices). During the last CC, management mentioned that these deals grew by double-digit and triple-digit revenue growth over the last quarter. Now, let me explain why this is negative for short term total revenues. Infinity, its strongest grower, is a total protection solution that includes software, hardware, services, and support.(Source: Check Point Software website)The one-time invoice from hardware and software sales in the past is now changed into a multi-year subscription agreement. The interesting part here is that by offering this all-inclusive model, Check Point also takes over some sales from competitors. The benefits are very well described in the last CC:Let's try to explain this with a hypothetical graph, as there are no real examples put available by Check Point. With the old license model, Check Point got most of its revenues up front by selling security hardware to the customer. This hardware needed to be renewed/improved after some years (here year 4) and meanwhile the company received a license/maintenance fee for providing software and service to the customer. This completely changed with the new model, which is based on an annual all-in-one subscription fee. Most of the time, this is introduced to the customer with a sharp introductory rebate, but the power of this model is that pricing can be increased sequentially. As a consequence of this transition, revenues get hurt in the short term (-87.5% in 1 year, -33% in 2 years) when customers do the change. Importantly, in the long term, this can lead to doubling the average annual spending from customers.(Source: Robbe Delaet)This transition totally changes the connotation of the slowdown in revenues. For example, well-known SaaS players like Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK) underwent the same transition, which was first not applauded by the market as it took 10-11 quarters before revenue started to grow after this change. However, in the long term it clearly paid off and the stocks gained significantly.(Source: Robbe Delaet)I want to end the revenue section by telling you what I believe is a more accurate metric to look at than just revenue growth. Many of these new subscription contracts are made for several years. However, only the income from this year is booked into revenues and the amount which accounts for the next years is booked in deferred revenues. Look at it like this: with the license model, hardware revenues were booked in one year, while it was used for four years. In contrast, with the subscription model, it is booked in all four years, which pressures revenues in the short term. Therefore, I believe it is more interesting to look at revenue growth + deferred revenue growth, which also shows us what we can expect from revenue growth in the coming years. When you apply this method, you can see that the real growth (green line) was much higher than the reported revenue growth (red line) as deferred revenue grew by double digit revenues pre-2019. In 2019, this growth was only 5%, but this was also well explained in the last CC:In other words: new subscription products like Cloudguard are booked in deferred revenues, but the real growth driver Infinity is annually invoiced. So the significant growth in new subscriptions is both not included in revenues and deferred revenues. We should be able to see the real impact in 1-2 years, when annual invoices grow after introductory rebates and when more customers start using it.(Source: Robbe Delaet)2) Margin pressureAccording to Mr. Market, margin pressure is caused by high competitive pressure and weak product innovation. My graph below shows that most of the margin decline is caused by R&D (+283 bps) and selling & marketing (+563 bps) expenses. I see the increase in R&D expenses as a long term value creator as it should lead to higher innovation and growth in the long term. In terms of selling & marketing expenses (which intensified in 2018), I believe that this is needed to introduce the new products and fully benefit from new innovation. Yes, it could be partially competition driven, but I believe that a big chunk of it is related to the increase in Infinity customers who need to be convinced to buy and keep the new subscription package. Note that selling & marketing costs as % of revenues are still much higher at Palo Alto (49%) and Fortinet (41.8%). In other words, Check Point its high-quality products sold itself during the last decades, but right now, the company needs to intensify marketing efforts to sell its new products to customers. Still, will be able to maintain much higher margins compared to competitors.(Source: Robbe Delaet based on company data)3) Competitive pressureYes, there is some competitive pressure from companies like Palo Alto and Fortinet. However, I believe the market share data is biased as this is based on revenues and as described above, Check Point is in the middle of a significant transition right now. Moreover, Check Point is a long term security leader and it would be really surprising if they wouldn't be able to maintain this leadership given the experience and amazing track record of CEO Schwed and the new products introduced.(Source: Gartner)I'm not a security specialist, however, on the Internet, I read many positive reviews about Check Point. For example, its security protection software which is also integrated into Infinity, Sandblast, is ranked as second best threat protection solution by itcentralstation.com. Overall, specialists say that there is not a clear winner between the four cyber security leaders as they are all good in a different way. However, Infinity (Next) looks to become a strong growth driver for Check Point. Infinity is the unified architecture that is introduced in 2017 and updated to Infinity Next in 2020. Infinity focuses on problems with scale which is increasingly relevant for this generation of companies. These days, companies need a very agile system that can be operational very quickly. The problem with point solutions (a different solution for each security problem) is that it doesn't impact the number of threats and that it loses its relevance quickly as IT systems change each day. Infinity is the best product for many companies as it includes every security solution at a low cost. According to CEO Schwed, it would require products from 19 security vendors at a cost of $5.9 mln to provide the same thing as Infinity, compared to a cost of less than $2.7 mln for products and service provided by Check Point. Consolidation of cyber security products is key, which is provided by Infinity Next.(Source: Check Point Software)Again, I want to emphasise the strong influence that this transition could have by quoting some more management statements during the last CC:Check Point valuation: strong opportunities and downside supportIn this section, I will try to estimate the fair value of Check Point by providing a discounted cash flow (""DCF"") analysis which I believe is the most relevant model for valuing this company. Also, I will include a sensitivity analysis which includes a worst-case scenario as investors always need to be aware of potential worse results than expected and its implications on the fair value. The DCF consists of calculating the WACC and estimating cash flows.Weighted average cost of capital (WACC)The WACC is the discount rate to discount the future cash flows to today and is essential in the DCF analysis. Normally, I calculate the WACC based on the beta as shown below. However, this gives a very low WACC of 6,09% which could be misleading. To be more conservative, I used a WACC of 7,50% in my model which is pretty high for a safe company like Check Point.(Source: Robbe Delaet)Free cash flow estimationsMy cash flow estimations include the assumptions displayed below. First, I expect revenues to slow down in 2020 and 2021 due to the subscription growth as mentioned previously. Moreover, I expect margins to keep declining. In the mid term, I expect revenue growth to accelerate again by 2% per year (1.09% to 3.09%, etc.) until 2024. After 2024, because of saturation in the market, I assume that revenue growth will slow down by 1% each year to 2.09% in 2029. Lastly, I used a perpetuity growth rate of 2% after 2029. I believe that these assumptions are very conservative as the market is expected to grow by 11% each year.(Source: Robbe Delaet estimations)Astonishingly, when we assume a mid-to-long term growth rate still under the industry growth and declining margins, my model shows that the stock is still undervalued by 76.92%! This is caused by its high FCF margins, high earnings predictability and high cash position (approx. 30% of market cap).Sensitivity analysisNow, what would be the fair value if the company won't be able to deliver as I expect? Let's check the bear and bull case. Interestingly, if I assume that the mid term revenue would keep slowing down by 1% each year (so from 1.09% growth in 2021 to -1.09% in 2022 to -2.09% in 2023 etc.) and if I would take a strongly negative long term growth rate, the stock would only have 3% downside risk!(Source: Robbe Delaet estimations)Moreover, I would like to quickly mention Check Point's valuation based on a P/E multiple. In 2019, the company had non-GAAP net income of $933mln, which implies a P/E of 14.6. However, if you adjust for its net cash of $3.9bln, the P/E would be 10.46 which is very low compared to the market average and particularly compared to competitors Palo Alto (negative earnings) and Fortinet (P/E of 57).At the current valuation, I believe there is very little risk when you look at a possible slowdown in growth as this is already baked into the stock price. The real risk, to me, would be that Check Point wouldn't be relevant to the industry anymore and would lose a significant part of its market share to competitors. However, given its recent investments in R&D, its new innovative product launches and a CEO with an insane amount of experience in the industry, I believe this is highly unlikely. In the faster growth markets such as cloud security and end-point security, smaller companies like Zscaler (ZS) and CrowdStrike (CRWD) are increasingly gain market share with their innovative solutions. Although Check Point is increasingly investing in these high growth markets, and for example launched products such as CloudGuard, it is possible that as a big company it will be harder for them to adapt quickly to new, innovative customer needs. For example, Zscaler believes that the 'older' security companies their cloud offers are very limited and that the cloud needs more 'specialty' security providers who solely focus on the cloud. Customers rotating to the more innovative, younger companies is definitely a risk to take into account.Second, a potential risk includes the intensifying of its margin decrease. Check Point's operating margin decreased from 55% to 44% over the last 6 years. If this continues to go down to let's say 30%, the stock price could get hurt even more. However, note that my model already includes a further slowdown to 37%.Overall, I believe it is important as (potential) shareholder to increasingly focus on Infinity and Cloudguard comments made by management during the conference call and how this influences earnings. If in 2021, the growth numbers can't be turned around by Check Point, I believe that there could be more tough times ahead.Due to recent negative growth numbers, it looks like the market is expecting a significant further deceleration in market share and margins for Check Point. In my opinion, the market is overlooking two important things. First, the revenue slowdown is caused by a drastic change to the subscription model with newly introduced, best-in-industry products, which puts short term pressure on revenues. Second, the margin pressure is primarily caused by investments for future revenue growth with newly introduced products rather than higher competitive pressure. At a cash-adjusted P/E of 10.46 Check Point is a strong buy, especially when you take into account that the cyber security industry is expected to keep growing by double digits over the next years. My DCF model confirms this undervaluation as it indicated that buying Check Point now could give investors 91% upside potential. Moreover, an experienced CEO as majority shareholder and aggressive share buybacks up to 20% of the market cap make this an even more interesting pick. Lastly, with its strong cash balance and resilience to a recession, Check Point is a very interesting, low-risk buy in the current market environment."

While the cybersecurity market is expanding, Check Point is gaining market share at the speed of sound while competitors like Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Proofpoint (PFPT), and Zscaler (ZS) are gaining market at the speed of light. Having studied the evolution of the cybersecurity space since 2016, Check Point appears to be ceding its leading position to competitors. While I've highlighted the competitive concerns in a previous thesis, Checkpoint's solid financials and buyback program have propelled the stock in recent quarters. However, with the recent print on the growing short interest, it will be interesting to analyze the validity of the short bets. From my experience, excluding the competitive pressure and low entry barrier in the cloud security niche, exploring the three points I listed earlier will help investors understand the strength of these bets.During the Q3'2019 conference call, analysts tried to extract some color on the declining sales trend in North America. Brent Thill of Jefferies inquired into the productivity trend and investment in North America, and the response was positive after management reiterated the appointment of Chris Scanlan to head the North American business. They also confirmed a continuous ramp in hiring and marketing activities.However, during the last conference call, management hinted at the continuous decline in product sales in North America.Overall, America is now at 44% of revenue, down from 49% in 2016. It will be interesting to watch how Check Point grows its cloud business in America, given the number of cloud security players in the region. At this point, it is safe to conclude that Check Point will have to sacrifice some margins to grow its business in North America, given the level of competition in the space. Also, given the shifting landscape towards cloud security solutions, it appears the playing field has been leveled for innovative incumbents to give existing players intense competition. This might further weaken its traction in North America. If the current trend continues, bears might be proven right.The color around cloud subscription uptake remains strong. Though cloud security remains a small portion of revenue. Regardless, it is reassuring to know that Check Point has made the right investments to play in the cloud security space. The acquisition of Forcenock and Dome9 has helped Check Point develop its capabilities in all forms of cloud deployment. Another attractive development is its new IoT security capabilities, which expands its total addressable market. Check Point has a strong install base to grow its cloud and IoT business. However, it is unclear if the strong expansion opportunity will offset the slowing licensing renewal of its appliance-based security business. My take is that Check Point still has a long runway of customers to cross-sell and grow its cloud business in the near term. However, I am not positive about greenfield deals due to the volume of competition in the cloud security space.Data by YChartsThis is a serious concern given that the decline in licensing revenue has a double impact on growth as it also affects support and maintenance revenue. While management was upbeat about the feedback from clients in SDWAN, and the IoT space, the biggest concern remains competitive pressure. There are more than enough network and cloud security players fighting for market share. The advantage for Check Point is that it has the talent to build strong security IPs, and it also has ample leeway to sacrifice margins for growth. However, its share buyback program suggests the near term capital allocation strategy assumes total shareholder return is best captured now. It's not clear how this will impact growth; however, given that Check Point has no liquidity or solvency concerns, the move will continue to drive positive price action in the near term. Also, I assume the confidence to make this move - when all competitors excluding NortonLifelock (NLOK) are sacrificing margins for growth while tapping the debt market to take on huge leverage to stay ahead - underlines the conviction Check Point has in its research team to develop cutting edge cybersecurity solutions at a comparatively cheaper cost of capital. Though, management's forward growth guidance of +3% in 2020 suggests otherwise.Data by YChartsCheck Point's valuation is in-line, and it remains untouchable due to its strong financials and huge install base, which can be used to cross-sell and up-sell its new IoT and cloud security products. Growing off the existing customer base isn't a concern as long as the renewal rate remains strong. The important metric to watch is the growth of new customers. The +3% forward growth guidance suggests Check Point is leaving money on the table given that Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is still guiding for double-digit growth after surpassing Check Point in annual revenue. The strong momentum of competitors might be the force driving the growing short interest. In the event of an earnings miss, these bets will be validated, and the narrative around the stock might be rewritten towards the lack of growth and possible weak renewals. In light of these, I will be maintaining a long-term bullish outlook with a near term neutral rating."
4324082,22246,2020-02-13T17:25:55-05:00,"Check Point Software is one of the most heavily shorted large-cap stocks, despite steady growth and an undemanding valuation.Check Point is the most profitable cybersecurity company in the world, and its growth is poised to continue.Check Point's low valuation, steady growth, and hefty share repurchases are likely to upset the shorts and make investors in the company money.","Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP) stands apart from other heavily shorted stocks in both its conservatism and its attractive valuation. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a good example of a typical heavily shorted stock. Whether you're a fan of Tesla or a hater, it isn't hard to understand why the stock has attracted so much short interest. While the company is an innovator in the automotive space, its CEO is a magnet for controversy and the company floated an ill-considered, ""funding secured"" buyout at ""$420"" a share. Additionally, Tesla trades at a sky-high multiple that requires a big leap of faith, so it is natural that there will be a lot of cynics.What's a mystery is why Check Point Software, a conservative cybersecurity company that has grown steadily for years, has a level of short interest that approaches that of Tesla:For the past 27 years, Check Point has been run by its founder and CEO, Gil Shwed, who is now the longest-tenured CEO on the Nasdaq, narrowly beating out Jeff Bezos. Shwed invented the internet firewall that forms the basis for today's cybersecurity industry. Under his leadership, Check Point has become a $17 billion company that is the most profitable cybersecurity company in the world. Shwed also continues to personally own 19.5% of Check Point's stock.So, why are the shorts after Check Point? Check Point has grown steadily for years, generating consistent cash flow, which it returns annually to stockholders through significant share buybacks. In 2017, 2018, and 2019, for example, Check Point completed share repurchases of $1 billion, $1.1 billion, and $1.28 billion respectively. In 2020, the company is expected to buy back $1.3 billion of its stock, representing roughly 10% of the public float at the current price. And more importantly, unlike other heavily shorted companies, Check Point's valuation is well below the market average - trading at just 12x free cash flow (net of cash). Through free cash flow generation and buybacks, Check Point will be at just 11 times free cash flow by year-end 2020 (if the stock price remains static).The bear case for the company is that it will continue to slowly cede market share to its competitors. But even under that bear(ish) scenario, the stock is simply way too cheap. Check Point has been growing steadily for years. And the company's slow-but-steady organic growth, combined with its massive stock buybacks, do not equate to a falling stock price. How low can the stock reasonably trade? Should the world's most profitable cybersecurity company trade at nine times multiple? Will that happen in the face of billion-dollar-plus buybacks?And, on the other side, there is a clear path for Check Point to transition to stronger growth in the next few years. Historically, Check Point has been more of a technology company than a sales organization. It had the best firewall on the market and its products largely sold themselves. While its competitors spent money on sales and marketing, Check Point elected to forego these expenses and keep its wide profit margins. But more recently, that has changed. Check Point has begun growing its sales force and spending more on marketing. The company continues to have a top-rated suite of products, which should position it well to retake share from its competitors.There have been two other changes to Check Point's business, which should benefit the stock long term. First, Check Point has begun to sell more products via subscription services as opposed to one-time sales. While that masks the company's growth rate in the short run because it recognizes less revenue upfront, in the longer term, subscriptions provide predictable and recurring revenue streams that boost the company's prospects.Second, Check Point has begun targeting a wider market by bundling its products into a suite that the company refers to as ""Infinity."" Under this program, instead of using multiple vendors for different products, customers can get all of their products from Check Point at a discount and control those products through a single dashboard. The net effect is that customers pay less and Check Point's share of their customers' spending increases. It also means that smaller companies, who previously couldn't afford Check Point's products, now can.In the face of these realities, I've struggled to understand why investors have continued to short Check Point's stock. The best explanation that I've heard is that many of the shorts really aren't betting against Check Point at all. Instead, long-short hedge funds, which are required to balance their long positions by shorting other stocks, are apparently using Check Point as a funding short so that they can be long other software companies. Their theory seems to be that since 25% of Check Point's market cap is in cash and it's relatively unlikely that Shwed will pursue a sale, they're unlikely to get burned by shorting the stock. In reality, Check Point, which is a low beta stock, is a terrible hedge against long positions in high flying software names. But analysts at long-short hedge funds need to balance their books.In my view, shorting Check Point is much riskier than the hedge funds may think. Short interest in the company is now approaching 20 days of trading volume. If these hedge funds all need to exit at the same time, the door will be narrow. And while a Tesla-like short squeeze is unlikely, I wouldn't be surprised to see something similar on a smaller scale. Regardless, in the fullness of time, Check Point's steady growth and hefty share repurchases mean that the company's stock should do well.Risks to the thesis include but are not limited to lower than expected cybersecurity spending. Larger than expected market share losses and/or large acquisitions that do not do enough to improve Check Point's market position."

With this kind of market turbulence, it is best to focus on companies with a solid balance sheet and strong free cash flow. Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP) is one such company.(Source: Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.)To tell you the truth, I wouldn't have paid much attention to Check Point in a previous lifetime. The company's annual revenue growth rate is an anemic 4%. But times have changed and high-growth is not the place to invest for the moment. Such stocks tend to get punished the most in a bear market, thanks to DCF valuation for which many analysts tend to employ. You see, according to DCF, valuation is determined by future cash flow which is driven by growth expectations. So when future growth expectations fall, so does the stock's current valuation.Check Point, with its relatively low annual revenue growth of 4%, has not been punished nearly as much as other cybersecurity stocks. It is down 23% over the past month. In comparison, the First Trust Nasdaq CEA Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR) is down 30%.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)What interests me most about Check Point is the best-in-class free cash flow margin which is a whopping 60%. The high free cash flow margin gives this company an easy pass on the Rule of 40. Check Point also has zero debt, making this a good investment opportunity for troubling times. For this reason, I am giving Check Point a bullish rating.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to one of my previous articles.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In Check Point's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 4% + 60% = 64%Check Point scores well above the 40% needed to fulfill the Rule of 40. Exceeding the Rule of 40 signifies that Check Point has a healthy balance between growth and profitability.The following scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth illustrates Check Point's stock valuation relative to the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red on the scatter plot and represents a typical valuation based on next year's sales growth. As can be seen from the scatter plot, Check Point is situated above the best-fit line, implying that the company is overvalued based on forward sales multiple.The Sales/EV multiple tells me that the stock is overvalued, but my value assessment changes when I substitute next year's earnings estimates for forward sales.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The results shown on this second scatter plot suggest that Check Point is undervalued based on next year's earnings estimates.According to the Check Point blog, the pandemic is an open season for cyber hackers.While the world appears to be coming to a stop, cybercrime isn't. Cybersecurity stocks have fared poorly so far this year, but I doubt spending on cybersecurity will fall. In fact, the rise in cybercrime due to the Covid-19 outbreak may actually benefit cybersecurity companies and could translate into higher stock prices longer term.Despite Check Point's low growth rate, the company's products have achieved the highest score for security effectiveness in the 2019 NSS Labs Breach Prevention Systems (BPS) group test.Some analysts believe that the cybersecurity market is overcrowded and many companies have been reducing forward guidance this year. This has dragged down the entire cybersecurity industry. There may be overcrowding and industry growth could be lower than investors anticipate. Lower growth obviously translates into lower stock prices.Check Point, with its low growth rate, has been slowly losing market share. This trend may continue into the future, especially if the company doesn't keep up with technological advancements.The bear market may persist for some time, years in fact. If the bearishness continues, Check Point's share price will drop.We are witnessing a ferocious bear market for which no one can predict the length or severity. In this type of market conditions, investors should only be looking at investing in companies with a strong balance sheet and strong free cash flow. Check Point has both. The company has zero debt and a best-in-class free cash flow margin. The company also has positive GAAP earnings, a rarity in the software industry. I consider Check Point to be undervalued based on its forward earnings multiple. For these reasons, I am giving Check Point a bullish rating."
4362119,35181,2020-07-29T23:52:33-04:00,"Check Point has zero debt and strong free cash flow margin. The company will most certainly come out of the pandemic and recession in excellent shape.Revenue growth has been anemic for several years due to legacy security products, but cloud-based services are strong.Check Point's stock price has broken out to a 52-week high. I believe that the stock is a smart investment for the current economic conditions.","Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP) is a legacy player in the cybersecurity industry with a broad set of offerings that include on-premise hardware, perpetual software licenses, endpoint management, zero trust, and cloud-based services. Growth investors beware, Check Point is not a barnburner when it comes to revenue growth, averaging approximately 6% annual growth over the last 5 years, and 4% recently.Despite the fairly anemic growth, I believe that this stock may be a smart investment for the current macroeconomic environment. The pandemic has not really impacted Check Point’s financials to date. And it has extraordinary free cash flow, zero debt, and a large amount of cash and cash equivalents. The company is actively introducing new cloud-based cybersecurity services that are growing by high double-digits annually, although still a small portion of the overall business at around 10%.Check Point easily fulfills the Rule of 40, an S/W metric that I find particularly useful in the current economic environment. The cybersecurity industry in general is benefiting from the pandemic and work-from-home (WFH) mandate. Therefore, I find Check Point to be an easy investment choice, not only for modest growth but also for stable profits. This company is buying back stock which will help boost the share price and also has a strong balance sheet. For these reasons, I am assigning a buy rating for Check Point.The stock price has broken out to a 52-week high and has managed to hold up despite some bearish market conditions in the latter part of July. Mr. Market is signaling that this is a stock to watch.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The rule provides a single metric for evaluating both high-growth companies that aren't profitable and mature companies that have lower growth but are profitable. Revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) must add up to at least 40% in order to fulfill the rule. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can tolerate some level of negative free cash flow. But if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth. This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so ones.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to a previous article I have written.The two factors required for calculating the Rule of 40 are revenue growth and free cash flow margin. Check Point's annual revenue growth for the last year was 4%, while its free cash flow margin was an impressive 54%. (Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)Therefore, the Rule of 40 calculation for Check Point is as follows:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 4% + 54% = 58%Check Point's score fulfills the Rule of 40, suggesting that Check Point has a healthy balance between growth and profitability.The plot below illustrates how Check Point stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward EV/Sales versus forward revenue growth. Note: please refer to a recent article for more information on the scatter plot relative valuation technique.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)According to the scatter plot, Check Point is somewhat overvalued on a relative basis relative to its peers. I would be careful with reading too much into this valuation analysis as Check Point is being judged as a growth stock, when in fact it is primarily a value play given its strong profitability. Its EV/forward sales multiple is comparable to other broad cybersecurity companies such as Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW), Fortinet, Inc. (FTNT), and Qualys, Inc. (QLYS).Of the four cybersecurity stocks listed above, Check Point has the lowest revenue growth but the highest free cash flow margin by far, giving it a high score on the Rule of 40.(Source: Portfolio123/Author)All four stocks are worthy of investment, but I really like Check Point’s high level of cash and cash equivalents plus its free cash flow margin. These two factors provide this company with a superior chance of surviving the pandemic and a potentially very long and deep recession.Of the four stocks, Fortinet and Qualys have thrived this year, while Check Point and Palo Alto Networks have lagged.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)I am pretty optimistic that with the recent 52-week high, it is now Check Point’s time to shine.While Check Point's business performance has not been significantly affected so far during the pandemic, the company management is cautious with regard to future guidance, indicating that the situation is very fragile.It seems unlikely that we will see a vaccine until at least the spring of 2021 and that depends on everything going well in phase-3 trials for vaccine candidates. Therefore, it will be at least a year (in my opinion) before we see a return to normalcy in general.While we wait, the government and the Federal Reserve are being generous with handouts and stimulus. But how long will this last? The handouts are a heavy burden for taxpayers and I can’t see this persisting for much longer, certainly not past the November election. When the handouts stop, I expect that the stock market may become very bearish.An additional factor that must be considered is the many specialty upstarts such as CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (OTC:CRWD) that are aiming to take market share away from Check Point. The cybersecurity industry is very fragmented, and it is difficult to predict how all of the various technologies will manage to compete in the market.Check Point has a broad-based cybersecurity product portfolio consisting of legacy hardware, software licensing, endpoint management, zero trust, and cloud-based services that have demonstrated consistent profitability for many years. While the company’s 4% annual revenue growth is modest, this company has other qualities that make it attractive as an investment in the current macroeconomic climate. Check Point has zero debt, $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and has exceptional profitability. The company scores an impressive 58% on the Rule of 40.We don’t know when the pandemic will be overcome, and we don’t know how the recession will play out, although it is very likely that it will be long and deep. Check Point’s strong balance sheet and recent financial performance make it an ideal investment in today’s market. And I expect that cybersecurity products, in general, will thrive particularly with the WFH strategy employed in many parts of the world. Therefore, I am giving Check Point a bullish rating."
4341541,104608,2020-04-30T12:25:13-04:00,"Check Point reported Q4 revenue and EPS that were slightly above expectations and near the midpoint of management’s previous guidance.2020 guidance was withheld given the uncertainties surrounding the global pandemic.Valuation appears somewhat attractive, but given the lack of clarity around demand over the next few quarters, investors could wait for a better entry point.","Check Point Software (CHKP) reported revenue and EPS that were slightly ahead of expectations, though the uncertainty regarding the global pandemic has caused the stock to have a muted reaction post-earnings. Management noted that ~75% of their revenue was recurring, which could mean their revenue may be somewhat more isolated from extreme downward movements.However, revenue growth remains somewhat minimal as CHKP has continued to lose market share from faster-growth competitors such as Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT), and Cisco (CSCO). With 2020 guidance now being withheld given the uncertainties, I believe investors may be better off remaining on the sidelines for now until CHKP has better clarity around their demand trends.Data by YChartsValuation continues to remain below their competitive peer group, which is one of the bullish arguments investors have regarding the name. However, when looking at their competitors, CHKP has consistently grown slower and is still stuck with legacy hardware revenue, which is weighing on both growth and margins.With the stock trading ~16x a bullish 2020 EPS, I am more inclined to invest in the faster-growth software security players which may see increased demand and retention during these challenging times. CHKP has done a good job diversifying away from their legacy hardware products and more into their software solutions, however, they still have a long run-way left and until growth trends change, I believe there are better investment options in the security landscape.CHKP is an IT security solutions provider focusing on areas such as network security, endpoint security, mobile security, data security, and security management. They are considered one of the legacy players in the security market and have faced intense competition over the past few years. While CHKP provides efficient and effective IT security tools, it should not be valued on a revenue multiple, and investors should focus more on its earnings multiple.The main areas CHKP competes in have seen increased competition from companies that solely focus on a specific area of IT security. Network security has become very saturated by four main players: Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, Fortinet and CHKP. Competitors are growing at a much quicker rate, thus taking market share from the company. This area of the IT security market continues to grow mid-single digits each year and is one of CHKP's main focus areas.Revenue during the quarter grew 3% to $486 million, was better than expectations for ~$481 million, though growth remained consistent with the 3% seen last quarter. Revenue was also near the midpoint of management's previous guidance range of $475-495 million. Given the consistently slower revenue growth, investors have become accustomed to this and expectations do not consist of beat and raise quarters.Source: Company PresentationProduct and License revenue continues to remain a revenue drag for the company, with this segment declining ~2% during the quarter to $110 million. However, as this revenue stream continues to decline, now representing ~23% of total revenue, the negative impact will become less profound over time. Security subscription continues to show signs of strength, growing 10% during the quarter and now represents ~33% of total company revenue. CHKP has been transitioning to more security subscriptions as opposed to products/license revenue, as the subscription-based revenue gives the company higher visibility and is typically stickier than hardware revenue.While the company reported slightly better than expected revenue, the company's deferred revenue, a good indicator of future revenue growth, came in at $1.35 billion, which represented only 3% growth. I believe the minimal growth in this category combined with no growth in billings during the quarter will likely result in continued minimal revenue growth.Source: Company PresentationOperating margin during the quarter was 47.5%, down from the 49.7% in the year ago period. Margins were also down from ~51.4% last quarter and the ~220bp contraction was steeper than the ~170bps contraction last quarter. I believe the company will continue to experience some operating margin expansion as they invest more into their security software products. Even though subscription-revenue typically comes with higher margins, CHKP needs to continue to heavily invest in this revenue stream in order to maintain strong growth in that product category.EPS for the quarter came in at $1.42, which was above expectations for $1.38. The better than expected EPS was largely due to revenue coming in better than expectations. Over time, margins have the potential to expand as the lower-margin hardware revenue continues to decline and represent less of the overall revenue.On the conference call, management did not provide guidance for Q2 or the remainder of 2020 given the headwinds related to the global pandemic. However, management did note that ~75% of their total revenue comes from annuity sales, meaning these should be somewhat protected against downside. On the earnings call, management noted:While I believe this helps prevent a drastic decline in the company's revenue stream, there still remains a big uncertainty around when the IT spending will pick back up, how much spend could be decreased over the next few quarters, and which competitors are ripe to take make share. There could be a ceiling on how much higher shares could trade until there becomes more clarity on future revenue demand streams.While the stock has seen limited movement since reporting earnings, I believe investors remain somewhat uncertain about where demand will fall in the coming quarters. Even several quarters ago, investors did not seem overly bullish around the name and appeared to be waiting for a demand or product catalyst to push the stock higher. Now we have increased headwinds and uncertainties given the global pandemic, which means investors may continue to remain on the sidelines for the time being.In addition, CHKP continues to lose market share from faster growth competitors such as PANW and FTNT, and even though the industry is growing nicely, there is room for improvement.Data by YChartsData by YChartsGiven the global headwinds almost every economy is experiencing due to the pandemic, valuation has become increasingly difficult. In addition, CHKP has lost market share to the faster-growth competitors like PANW and FTNT, however, CHKP continues to boast higher margins and better cash flows. Their faster-growth competitors also trade more off a forward revenue multiple whereas the legacy competitors in this space are more inclined to trade off earnings.With management no longer providing 2020 guidance, we can use three different assumptions to get to our valuation. 2019 EPS was $6.13 and initial guidance called for ~5% growth at the midpoint. For comparison sake, we can assume three scenarios in which 2020 EPS declines by 10%, has 0% growth, and grows by 10%. This would result in 2020 EPS estimates of ~$5.18, ~$6.13, and ~$6.74. Using the current price of ~$106, this results in a 2020 bear case valuation of 20.4x, neutral case of 17.3x, and a bull case valuation of 15.7x.This leaves us with quite a bit of variance between the cases and each investor is entitled to their own philosophy on CHKP's growth throughout the year. In my opinion, I believe we are more like to see one of the first two cases, that being the bear case and neutral case. Given CHKP's recent share losses to faster-growth companies and clients less likely to invest in more expensive hardware (compared to software), I believe CHKP could continue to face some pressure throughout 2020.Given the faster-growth options in the security/software landscape, I am more inclined to put my money to work in other names for the time being. The competitive landscape remains challenging and CHKP will need to demonstrate to investors they are capable of re-accelerating revenue growth in order to deserve a higher valuation multiple."

Besides having more diverse revenue streams, CSCO also grows revenue and EPS faster, thus, is more deserving of a higher multiple. Even if we were to see CHKP's multiple expand in the near-term, I find it challenging to see the stock go up more than 10% during the year.With other security competitors growing at faster rates, accelerating billings growth, and expanding margins, I believe there are other areas in this market to properly invest your money.CHKP is an IT security solutions provider focusing on areas such as network security, endpoint security, mobile security, data security, and security management.

The ~170bps margin contraction was better than the ~280bps margin contraction seen last quarter, though the continued pressure on margins may be becoming a greater impact on the stock, considering revenue growth has been in the lower single digits. Continued pressure on the margins will not only continue to pressure EPS, but will continue to pressure the stock.EPS for the quarter came in at $2.02, which was above expectations of $1.99. The $0.03 EPS beat was largely due to the company reporting higher than expected revenue and slightly better margins.On the conference call, management provided Q1 guidance which included revenue of $475-495 million, or ~3% growth at the midpoint. This was about in line with consensus estimates of ~$488 million. EPS for the quarter is expected to be $1.37-1.43, which came in below consensus estimates of $1.43 at the midpoint.For the full year, the company is expecting revenue of $2.0-2.1 billion, or 0-5% growth, and was near consensus estimates for ~$2.06 billion at the midpoint. In addition, EPS is expected to be $6.25-6.65, which is slightly below current estimates for ~$6.45 at the midpoint.One big positive point during this quarter was that the company repurchased $325 million worth of shares during Q4. In addition, they announced a $2 billion extension to their share repurchase authorization with the ability to repurchase up to $325 million each quarter. I believe the company will continue to repurchase the maximum amount of their shares in order to reduce the pressures of low revenue growth and margin challenges.Even though the stock was only down ~1% after reporting earnings, there were not enough positives during the quarter which will give investors the extra confidence to become more bullish around the name. With revenue growth expected to be ~3% during 2020 and EPS guidance a little below expectations, it seems like there needs to be a change in investors' long-term confidence in order to drive the stock higher.The company continues to lose market share from faster growth competitors such as PANW and FTNT, and even though the industry is growing nicely, there is room for improvement.Data by YChartsData by YChartsValuation has been a little challenging with this name because although they are likely losing market share to faster-growth competitors like PANW and FTNT, CHKP does have higher margins with better cash flows. Their faster-growth competitors also trade more off a forward revenue multiple whereas the legacy competitors in this space are more inclined to trade off earnings.With management guiding 2020 revenue growth of ~3% at the midpoint, it doesn't seem right for investors to view CHKP based off their forward revenue growth, or a revenue multiple. 2020 EPS guidance is $6.25-6.65, which came in slightly below expectations of $6.45 at the midpoint. Given the EPS growth expectations, I believe investors will continue to base valuation of P/E.2019 EPS was $6.13, which means management's guidance of $6.25-6.65 results in EPS growth of only ~5% at the midpoint. While I believe this growth target is possible, the company also has some added firepower with their recently announced $2 billion share repurchase plan, which could lower share count and increase EPS.With the stock currently trading at ~$114, this implies a 2020 P/E of 17.7x, when using the current consensus estimate of ~$6.45. While this forward multiple does not seem overly aggressive, I would use Cisco as a comparable and note that CSCO's revenue streams are more diverse and growing faster. Even if we were to assume CHKP's multiple trades closer to 19x forward P/E, this would only result in a stock price of ~$122.50, which would represent only ~8% upside to today's closing price.Given the faster-growth options in the security/software landscape, I am more inclined to put my money to work in other names for the time being. While the new $2 billion share repurchase provides an avenue for beat and raise quarters, I find it challenging to believe the company's P/E ratio will expand much higher than 18x.The competitive landscape remains challenging and CHKP will need to demonstrate to investors they are capable of re-accelerating revenue growth in order to deserve a higher valuation multiple."
4295496,102101,2019-10-07T17:20:00-04:00,"Check Point has some of the best margins in the cyber security space.It also has a strong balance sheet.Sadly, it has one of the slowest growth rates.Management has the power to re-accelerate the growth narrative, a move which will tilt risk-reward towards more upside.Check Point remains a BUY due to its solid intrinsic value.","Occasionally, I spot a good name that I believe has been passed on or has fallen by the wayside. At a gross margin of 89%, TTM FCF % of revenue of 56%, and EV/EBITDA of 16.7, the slumping growth narrative (FY'19 target of 4%) has kept investors on the sideline. However, given Check Point’s (CHKP) solid financials and management’s ability to generate strong return on investment capital, Check Point is a must add to your portfolio.The market today is after names that can deliver a FAAMG-like growth. I’m referring to the growth that the likes of Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have produced. These giants have raised the bar for the type of growth expected of tech companies.Therefore, when you see a name like Check Point struggling to deliver 5% y/y revenue growth, it’s easy to overlook every other good thing about the company. This is where the underpricing occurs as the lack of growth has led a lot of investors to ignore the inherent value and potential of this stock.Data by YChartsCheck Point is one of the healthiest names in the cybersecurity industry. Its gross margin, profit margin, and FCF margin dwarfs most of its competitors.Where the valuation decoupling is coming from is the shift to cloud security, the cybersecurity industry is witnessing. Check Point is primarily an appliance-based vendor. Though in recent years, it has made acquisitions to beef up its capabilities in cloud security and AI-driven solutions. Nevertheless, it has been unable to catch up with the momentum of high flyers like Fortinet (FTNT) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW).Management has longed favored the strategy of preserving margins; however, it looks like investors will rather sacrifice all that margin for growth. This makes logical sense, given that plays like Palo Alto continuously talk about their success replacing competitors like Check Point during RFPs and refresh cycles.Preserving customers is cheaper than winning them back from competitors. This is the best time to make the market share preservation sacrifice as the cost of acquiring new customers will continue to rise as the low hanging fruit gets picked.If the present is any indicator, we are yet to scratch the surface of what the cybersecurity market will sprout into. It's a market that will continue to thrive on the proliferation of internet-enabled devices, fast internet speed, and the declining cost of data. Therefore, the best operating strategy for Check Point is to sacrifice some of its profit margins for market share acquisition. If management continues to overlook growth in favor of margin preservation, Check Point will begin to trade on hopes for multiple expansion. This is dangerous, given that Palo Alto spent a decent part of its last earnings call marketing its next-generation of cybersecurity solutions and how it intends to displace weaker competitors.Check Point is releasing new products. However, management isn't as excited about them as much as competitors tout their offerings. This is not helping sentiments towards the stock with Bank of America analyst Tal Liani, downgrading the stock from Buy to Underperform while citing ""competitive pressure with CHKP consistently losing share over the last 4-5 years to firewall peers.""Source: FortinetRegardless, Check Point remains a leader in the network firewall space, though it is conceding its podium spot to the trio of Fortinet, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Palo Alto Networks.The revenue estimate for 2019 currently stands at $1.99 billion, second only to Palo Alto amongst pure-play network security vendors. Its 2020 growth estimate of 4% isn’t too encouraging. Though operating expense growth has now accelerated from 4.5% in 2017 to 14% TTM. The fact that revenue growth isn’t picking up as expected is a harbinger that the cost of capital required to pick the low hanging fruit is increasing. On a brighter note, interest and investment income have been growing in the mid-teens, though I’ll have preferred that the growth is from revenue. This has helped net income margin remain at 38%, a steep deceleration from the 45% peak in Q4’18. Though the company has instituted a share buyback program, it hasn’t been enough to cushion the effect of the operating expense growth, which led to the EPS fall of 3% last quarter.Check Point has a healthy balance sheet with cash and short-term investments of $1.6 billion (28% of assets), a slight decline from the all-time high due to its recent acquisitions. Accounts receivables have declined, which is a good sign. Long-term investments stand at 43% of assets. Lastly, the company has zero debt on its balance sheet.Check Point's earnings (71%) drive the bulk of its operating cash flow. Unlike most competitors, whose cash flow are driven by stock-based compensation; this is healthier. Check Point isn't aggressively spending on CAPEX, which means free cash flow can be moderately modeled to be inline or continue to grow in the coming quarters. FCF % of revenue currently stands at 56%, which is the best amongst its peers.The near-term worries are the sluggish product growth, which has been neutralized by strong subscription growth, and the flat billings growth, though deferred revenue grew at 11% in the most recent quarter.Overall, Check Point's financials are attractive. The main concern will be the declining revenue growth rate and the shrinking operating margin as management bumps up spend to re-accelerate growth.Check Point has a P/S of 8.7. This is within the valuation range of its high-growth counterparts. It trades at an EV/EBITDA of 16.7 and a market cap of $16.9 billion. Unlike its unprofitable peers, Check Point has a positive ROA (9.9%) and ROE (22%). The average analysts' price target is $121, which means the stock is currently trading at a discount to analysts' consensus.Though the company has suffered downgrades in the past few weeks, coupled with Palo Alto reporting its usual quarterly displacement of competitors, which, as expected, includes Check Point, Check Point remains a force to be reckoned with in the network and cloud security space. The company has introduced new cloud solutions strengthened by the acquisition of Dome9 and Forcenock, coupled with the recent release of some high-performance firewalls. There is strong demand for the SandBlast Zero-day threat prevention solution, and management is also recording growing demand for the Infinity platform. These offerings have the potential of driving revenue in the short term as Check Point's solutions are highly ranked according to third party testing sites.Check Point won't witness any margin expansion unless management communicates the desire to accelerate growth. Like a startup trying to raise funds, the narrative is back in the hands of management, and they have it in their power to decide if they will be willing to sacrifice more portion of the company's profit margin to seek growth. The near-term tailwinds from investments in cloud security is a good sign. For investors seeking a stock with solid intrinsic value with the optionality of the growth that most safe-haven assets don’t posses, this is the right stock for you. Downsides are capped due to its superior margins and healthy balance sheet, and the risk/reward is clearly tilted towards more upside in the long term.I will be reiterating a BUY rating with a PT of $134, which gives a market cap of $17.3 billion using shares outstanding of 160 million, driven by its superior FCF margin which stands at 56% of revenue."
4283142,104608,2019-08-08T09:16:55-04:00,"Billings growth continues to decelerate which continues to result in minimal revenue growth.Management reiterated their 2019 guidance, which now seems a little more challenging to beat.However, valuation remains on the lower-end of legacy software security providers.","Check Point Software (CHKP) reported a somewhat uninspiring, with almost all metrics in line with consensus expectations, though billings growth continues to decelerate. The stock remains in line with comparable valuations, though has lower growth rates, declining margins, and minimal upside to guidance. While the stock is only down ~5% since reporting earnings, the minimal billings growth combined with management reiterating guidance (which now seems somewhat difficult to surpass) should make investors somewhat cautious about owning the name.CHKP is one of the legacy IT security players still competing in the market and despite rebounding very strong from their December 2018 lows, which was up nearly 35% at one point, the stock has trended downwards and is ~15% from recent highs. With the company reporting another in line quarter with billings growth decelerating again, it is challenging to see this name have much upside from these levels.Data by YChartsValuation remains near the middle of their comp group and there could be some downside risk over the coming quarters. With revenue growth of 4% and billings growth of only 1%, it is challenging to believe the company will start to re-accelerate at a meaningful pace. Guidance for Q3 was pretty much what consensus expected and with full year guidance being reiterated, this implies growth accelerate to ~6% during the latter part of the year.While I still remain somewhat positive on this name over the longer term, the recent Q2 performance was not inspiring or created many catalysts for the stock to rip higher over the coming months. With other security competitors growing at faster rates, accelerating billings growth, and expanding margins, I believe there are other areas in this market to properly invest your money.CHKP is an IT security solutions provider focusing on areas such as network security, endpoint security, mobile security, data security, and security management. They are considered one of the legacy players in the security market and has faced intense competition over the past few years. While CHKP provides efficient and effective IT security tools, it should not be valued on a revenue multiple, and investors should focus more on its earnings multiple.The main areas CHKP competes in have seen increased competition from companies that solely focus on a specific area of IT security. Network security has become very saturated by four main players: Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Cisco (CSCO), Fortinet (FTNT) and CHKP. Competitors are growing at a much quicker rate, thus taking market share from the company. This area of the IT security market continues to grow mid-single digits each year and is one of CHKP's main focus areas.Data security will always remain a competitive industry. We keep seeing data breaches occur on what seems like a daily basis. Enterprises are becoming more protective about their data, and recent regulation in Europe, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), brings hefty fines for enterprises that are found in violation of user data protection.During the quarter, revenue grew 4% to $488 million and was in line with consensus expectations and similar to the growth seen in Q1. With revenue growth remaining this low for the past few quarters, it is very likely CHKP is losing share to some of their faster growing competitors. Product revenue decline ~3% during the quarter, marking the 8th consecutive quarter of decline. Management noted growth in the US showed healthy product growth, though this was likely offset by bigger declines in other geographies.Source: Company PresentationThe bright spot in the company's potential revenue growth story remains within the subscription revenue, which grew 13% during the quarter. Security subscriptions are a much more valuable revenue stream given the fact they are more recurring in nature and have higher visibility. While security subscription revenue represents ~55% of revenue during the quarter, the rather impressive growth over the next few quarters could help push overall revenue growth above 5%, which could improve sentiment around longer-term potential.Operating margin, while among the highest compared to competitors, contracted ~330bps compared to the year ago period. The 49.5% margin is strong, but with the company needing to reinvest more in S&M in order to improve their growth trajectory, we could continue to see pressure on the margin.Source: Company PresentationThe lower than expected margins combined with revenue that was in line with consensus expectations led to EPS of $1.38 for the quarter. While this was $0.01 better than consensus expectations, this was largely due to CTHS repurchasing 2.8 million shares for $325 million during the quarter. With the stock remaining under pressure, now would be a good time for the company to repurchase shares (assuming they are believes in their own long-term story). The lower share count will ultimately continue to help the company's EPS, despite margins remaining under pressure.During the conference call, management provided guidance to Q3 and reiterated their 2019 guidance. For Q3, management expects revenue of $480-500 million and EPS of $1.36-1.44. Despite the relatively wide range for EPS given the low earnings base, both of these guidance metrics were similar to what consensus was expecting.Management also reiterated their 2019 guidance which includes revenue of $1.94-2.04 billion and EPS of $5.85-6.25. With revenue during the first two quarters of ~$960 million and growing ~4%, this implies a rather steep acceleration during Q3/Q4 in order to achieve the full year guidance range. I believe management was confident in reiterating guidance because some of the steps they have taken to improve their sales force to accelerate revenue growth. However, considering the much faster growth rates at competitors, I believe we are more likely to see the company either miss their full year guidance or reduce next quarter, rather than coming in much above the midpoint.Even with the recent weakness in the stock, down ~15% from recent highs, I believe upside to the name is somewhat limited given the low revenue growth and contracting margins. As the company continues to lose market share to the faster growing competitors, it will become even more challenging to accelerate revenue growth. While the company has done a good job repurchasing shares to reduce share count (helping EPS), this is only a temporary fix to a longer-term problem.With revenue growth needing to accelerate during the second half of the year in order to come in ahead of the midpoint of 2019 guidance, we could see some increased pressure on the stock price throughout the quarter, especially right before Q3 earnings. Valuation remains a bit out of place, with P/E near the middle of the comp group despite CHKP having lower revenue and billings growth. I believe part of this is due to CHKP's leading operating margins, though these have been under pressure as of recently.Data by YChartsData by YChartsCHKP's P/E remains below the faster growth names of the group, such as PANW and FTNT, and rightfully so. Although CHKP's security subscription revenue grew 13% during Q2, it remains well below the 20%+ growth rates of PANW and FTNT. CHKP's valuation is similar to that of the other legacy players, such as CSCO and JNPR and this make sense. All three of these companies grow revenue below 10% and have experienced increased competition over the past few years.For now, I remain on the sidelines given the difficultly in presenting much upside to current guidance in addition to billings growth decelerating to only 1% during Q2. I think if CHKP reports a weak Q3, we could see the multiple contract below CSCO and JNPR which would put a lot of pressure on the stock. Over the long-term, I believe CHKP's security subscription revenue growth could remain healthy and is it continues to represent more of the overall revenue, we could see revenue growth accelerate over the years.Some risks to this thesis include CHKP's ability to maintain customers because of its legacy operations. Competition in the security market continues to increase, and the transition to cloud-based security subscriptions could prove to be challenging to CHKP's revenue growth."
4278022,24361,2019-07-26T09:47:55-04:00,"Revenue and margins were basically on target, but minimal billing growth is going to revive chatter about whether Check Point's revenue is going to decelerate further.
        A different billing approach for Infinity could explain the billing weakness, but I remain concerned that Check Point no longer has compelling offerings relative to its competitors.
        Valuation isn't demanding on a free cash flow basis, but it's hard to see what will break the company out of this muddle-through performance.","It is an oversimplification to say that software investors care only about growth, but growth is nevertheless a key driver of multiples. Check Point (CHKP) may be working hard behind the scenes, but the reality is that the company continues to lag rivals like Palo Alto (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT), and Cisco (CSCO) when it comes to revenue and billings, and it’s hard to see any meaningful reacceleration on the horizon.The good news, if you want to call it that, is that I don’t think there are many investors interested in Check Point who expect a lot of growth out of the company. If the different billing cycle for Infinity is in fact obscuring underlying growth and this security as a service platform can catch on with more larger clients, Check Point could outperform. I’m not sold on the strategy though, and I continue to believe that Check Point has been surpassed by some of its rivals. The prospective return is getting more interesting, but isn’t high enough to coax me to take the risk.Check Point’s revenue was very much in line with Wall Street expectations, with only very minor deviations at the three major lines (Products, Subscriptions, Maintenance). Gross margin and operating margin were almost spot-on as well, with gross margin 10bp better and operating margin 10bp light. The one divergence came at maybe the worst place it could for Check Point at this point – in the billings numbers. It’s debatable whether revenue growth or billings growth matter more in share price performance (analysts/investors say one thing, the numbers suggest a different thing), but Check Point once again missed at the billings line, coming in about 3% light with virtually no year-over-year growth.Revenue rose 4% as reported (both yoy and qoq), with Subscriptions up a little less than 13% and Maintenance up a little less than 4%. Product revenue was down 3%, the eighth straight negative yoy comp, but Check Point did at least see a return to growth in the U.S. business.Gross margin was effectively flat on an annual and sequential basis, though product margin continues to erode at a gradual pace. Operating income declined 2% (rising 3% qoq), with operating margin down 330bp yoy and down 30bp qoq. S&M (sales and marketing) spending continues to spank the company, with spending up 10% as part of the company’s stated intention to reinvest in sales and improve execution here.As mentioned above, billings were flat. Some of this could be due to the difference in how Infinity Total Protection is billed versus how Check Point has historically recognized billings (annual versus all upfront), but sequential growth was only 3%.This is the sixth straight quarter were Check Point grew S&M spending by double-digits and S&M spending has gone from 23.6% of revenue in second quarter of 2017 to 27% this quarter … and revenue has increased about $30 million over that time versus a greater than $23 million increase in S&M spending. It takes time to restructure a sales effort, nobody disputes that, but Cisco has been repositioning its security efforts over that same time, and while the comparisons are very much apples-to-oranges, Cisco seems to have more to show for it at this point.To be fair, Infinity Total Protection, ThreatCloud, Dome9 and other efforts are still very new. Infinity in particular addresses a real need in enterprise security, that of integrating an array of security tasks and reducing complexity for the customer/administrator. It’s also fair to note that a new partner policy that rewards customer activities beyond just revenue has only recently gone into effect, though I regard that more as a rearguard “protect what we have” move rather than a growth driver.My biggest concern about Check Point is basically that they’re an uninspiring me-too player that doesn’t really do anything particularly well anymore. The company continues to lose share in its traditional markets, and the market continues to move away from the hardware-oriented solutions that used to be such a big part of the business. Companies like CyberArk (CYBR), Forescout (FSCT), and Okta (OKTA) seem better-placed to benefit from an evolution toward a “zero trust” approach, and I think Cisco and Palo Alto are ahead of Check Point when it comes to analytics, orchestration, and automation, and I think Palo Alto’s acquisitions of Evident.io and Redlock will help it in the cloud.Check Point has long taken a “fast follower” approach, but my concern is that they’ve been surpassed in core capabilities that really count – like the aforementioned analytics, orchestration, and automation. It’s not that Check Point’s offerings are bad, but if you can’t bring something compelling to the table that stands out, what leverage do you have on pricing? Sure, firewall refreshes can still provide a little boost, but I’m concerned that Check Point has put itself into a fairly uninspiring corner.The second quarter results from Check Point don’t really drive any major changes to my model, but I am concerned about what weak billings may mean for future growth. Like I said, maybe this is just turbulence as the model adjusts to incorporate Infinity, but I don’t get a sense of any real momentum in this business. On a more positive note, the company continues to make money hand over fist, and Check Point continues to generate an amazing amount of cash flow relative to its revenue.Given Check Point’s weak revenue growth, discounted cash flow is actually the more bullish valuation metric for me. Check Point looks priced for high single-digit returns, and while that’s not bad, it’s not enough for me relative to the risk of going share erosion to rivals like Palo Alto that could ultimately drive a more substantial reduction to long-term growth expectations."
4255467,104608,2019-04-19T11:07:33-04:00,"Check Point reported Q1 earnings that were largely in line with consensus estimates, with revenue only growing 4%.Operating margins contracted compared to last year which led to only a $0.02 EPS improvement.Valuation took a hit post earnings as investors moved money out of the slower-growth name. However, it's tough to see valuation going too much lower.","Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP), one of the legacy IT security players still in the market, rebounded nicely since their December lows, receiving over 30% before hitting all-time highs. However, the company reported a relatively in-line quarter which sent the shares down an immediate 10% before recovering a bit throughout the day. Just as momentum was building up for the company, a softer-than-expected quarter took that away.Although I like the name over the longer term, the company continues to lose share to faster-growing firewall and cloud security players, with management committed to spending more on their sales force in order to capture more market share. In a world where security is moving away from on-premise operations, legacy players such as CHKP could be left behind. Though the company has remained competitive in today's market, it continues to lose share, as revenue increased 4% this past quarter. Shares continue to tread along, remaining near the high end of valuation ranges for comparable security players.Data by YChartsData by YChartsAlthough CHKP has been a solid performer over the past year, I believe valuation became a bit overheated prior to Q1 results, and the recent pullback was likely a bit overdue. Up until earnings, CHKP was one of the better performing security stocks in the market, and for a company growing revenue under 5%, it's challenging to see valuation expand much from here.CHKP is an IT security solutions provider focusing on areas such as network security, endpoint security, mobile security, data security, and security management. It's considered one of the legacy players in the security market and has faced intense competition over the past few years. While CHKP provides efficient and effective IT security tools, it should not be valued on a revenue multiple, and investors should focus more on its earnings multiple.The main areas CHKP competes in has seen a rise in new competition from companies that solely focus on a specific area of IT security. Network security has become very saturated by four main players: Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) and CHKP. Competitors are growing at a much quicker rate, thus taking market share from the company. This area of the IT security market continues to grow mid-single digits each year and is one of CHKP's main focus areas.Data security will always remain a competitive industry. We keep seeing data breaches occur on what seems like a daily basis. Enterprises are becoming more protective about their data, and recent regulation in Europe, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), brings hefty fines for enterprises that are found in violation of user data protection.CHKP continues to lose share in the firewall market to players such as FTNT, PANW, CSCO and emerging cloud security leader Zscaler (ZS), which reinforces the need for R&D spend. The company's mediocre Q1 earnings were right down the fairway with nothing exciting to look forward to.CHKP reported Q1 revenue of $472 million, growing 4% yoy, which has been the typical pace of revenue growth over the past few quarters. Non-GAAP operating margins actually dipped below 50%, coming in at 49.7%, compared to 52.8% in the year-ago period. Q1 margins also were below Q4 (53.1%) and full-year 2018 (52.9%). Even as the company pushes to move their mix shift toward more software, which typically comes on at higher margins, it's not a reassuring sign when operating margins begin to contract.Source: Company PresentationEPS of $1.32 was similar to consensus estimates and grew only $0.02 compared to the year ago period. The mere 1.5% growth was lower than revenue growth because margins contracted. Since the company is largely based on earnings rather than revenue (since revenue growth is not comparable to faster-growth security names), margin contraction can really impact the company's valuation, which is partially why the stock traded down so much post earnings.Source: Company PresentationCHKP breaks down its revenue into three main segments: Product, Subscription, and Maintenance.Maintenance revenue represented more than 45% of Q1 total revenue and grew nearly 4% y/y, in line with overall company growth. This revenue stream is highly correlated with Product revenue growth. As companies purchase more product from CHKP, there will be an increased need for maintenance operations. Thus, a slowdown in Product revenue could have a negative impact on Maintenance revenue over the long run.Product revenue, which represented ~24% of the total, decreased ~5% year-over-year in Q1, a slightly bigger decrease than ~3% seen in Q4. A few quarters ago, management noted IT spending is seasonally down in the first half of the year and expected positive Product growth during the second half of the year. While the 5% decrease is Product revenue may be related to some seasonality, it still represents one fourth of the business and is declining at a rather large rate.Finally, Subscription revenue, which represents just over 30% of total, continues to grow at an impressive rate, at 13% for Q1, which was a similar growth rates in Q3 and Q4. The key takeaway here is that CHKP continues to move away from legacy on-premise security products (found in the declining Product segment) and toward cloud-based subscription models. As these subscription-based models continue to grow at a faster rate than the overall company, they will naturally represent a larger portion of overall revenue. It's also likely that this will help drive operating margins up rather than the recent contraction seen in this quarter.Despite the recent pullback, CHKP continues to outperform the market year to date, though lags behind some of their peer groups. IT security stocks remain in favor of the investing community, and CHKP appears to be viewed as a bit more of a defensive name, which could shield valuation a bit from rapidly deteriorating.Data by YChartsDespite CHKP's revenue growth being the lowest of their peer group, the name still trades at the highest multiple. I believe part of the reasoning behind this is as the company's software blades gain more traction in the market and become a larger portion of their revenue stream, the company will be viewed as more of a software player. In this scenario, margins are likely to expand, revenues could have more visibility and predictability, and the company could increase their earnings.However, I do not believe CHKP should be trading at such a high forward revenue multiple compared to other leading security players which have a much better positioning in cloud security. FTNT, PANW, and even CSCO have better software security offerings and have done a better job transitioning to the cloud.Instead, CHKP should be valued on earnings since they have stable margins and have a lower revenue growth profile.Data by YChartsUsing the same peer group as above, there's a clear difference in the P/E ratios between the competitors. Legacy players such as CHKP and CSCO who grow at a slower rate trade at a much lower multiple compared to the faster growth, market share players such as FTNT and PANW.For now, even after the recent correction post earnings, I believe there's still some downside risk in the name. Especially as the other security companies report earnings in the coming weeks, investors may shift their money toward the faster growth names. However, I believe CHKP's valuation also has a floor to it. I find it challenging to believe the company's valuation will drop too far behind CSCO. Even if CHKP loses a few turns on their P/E valuation, the stock will likely stay above $110.For now, I remain on the sidelines for this name as I believe there are better security companies in the firewall space which grow at a faster pace and are more deserving of a premium valuation.Some risks to this thesis include CHKP's ability to maintain customers because of its legacy operations. Competition in the security market continues to increase, and the transition to cloud-based security subscriptions could prove to be challenging to CHKP's revenue growth."

(CHKP) is a frustrating company. It has so much promise but also such poor performance, it makes me want to cry. A conservative investment – yes, if you want to hold this stock for the very long term. Check Point is a company with phenomenal margins and a market leader in IT security. But be prepared for substandard revenue growth probably in the neighborhood of 5% YoY for the next couple of years. Ultimately, this company will complete its transformation into a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business, but even then, don’t expect the 20+% growth that we are seeing with other SaaS stocks. Check Point’s recurring revenues only comprise approximately 50% of total revenues and the recurring portion is only growing at 13%.The company is conservatively managed, while margins and profits are taking priority over high growth. It doesn’t appear that Check Point is going to let its hair down and go crazy any time soon with the “win at all costs” mentality that other SaaS companies have been exhibiting. I expect another disappointing year for Check Point, but I will check back in 2020 to see how much progress it has made. I almost feel that Check Point should declare a regular dividend instead of buying back shares. At least then the company would be a good income stock.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.Check Point had an unimpressive year compared to its SaaS peers with trailing-twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 3.4%. The company's 5-year annual growth rate of 6.6% is also uninspiring. This company has a lot of work to do in order to make the stock investment attractive. (Source: Portfolio123)Check Point's free cash flow margin TTM, at 58.4%, is astonishingly good. I don’t believe I have seen a figure this high before.(Source: Portfolio123)Given that the revenue growth is so poor yet the FCF margin so great, it appears that Check Point is resting on its laurels, content with success today without risking anything for a strong future.Check Point has great control of SG&A expenses which are approximately 42% of revenues, rising from a low of 32% in 2013. While Check Point doesn’t spend exorbitant amounts on Sales and Marketing or R&D, the amount has been increasing as a percentage of revenues as it converts to a recurring revenue model.(Source: Portfolio123)Note that SG&A includes sales and marketing, general & administrative, and R&D.42% SG&A expense is actually quite low for a software company and I believe Check Point is in danger of losing market share with new highflyers such as Zscaler, Inc. (ZS), CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (OTC:CRWD) and Okta, Inc. (OKTA), introducing innovations into the security market, and older players such as Fortinet, Inc. (FTNT) and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (PANW) achieving 20-30% YoY revenue growth.So, what is Check Point’s problem?The way I see it is there are a couple of things going on. First, the company is transitioning from a perpetual software license to a SaaS business model. The idea is to convert customers to recurring revenues. During this process, there is a lot of customer churn as it takes the opportunity to examine its options before making the commitment to recurring payments. This results in some loss of customers and dying direct sales, combined with a portion of recurring revenues being deferred. There is also a need to dangle a carrot in front of the customer, give them a deal such as a low subscription fee to get them onboard. But this is not all.It has been demonstrated over and over that, for SaaS companies, there is a direct relationship between revenue growth and an increase in sales staff. This seems obvious but the low SG&A expense that Check Point exhibits implies that the company may not be doing enough. It is employing different sales strategies, but perhaps it needs to increase manpower more than it is already doing.The company also needs to ramp up R&D spending proportionately to position itself with new products and services as well. It has acquired a couple of small companies but the product integration will take time and it probably should have started these activities a lot sooner.In any case, it appears that Check Point is more concerned about the high margins than it is about protecting its market share and growing the TAM. Perhaps it is time to let its hair down!A rule of thumb often applied to software companies is the ""Rule of 40."" This metric helps SaaS companies balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin as I believe that it is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's revenue growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has balanced growth and cash flow resulting in financial health.Check Point's revenue growth from the most recent 12 months was 3.4% while the free cash flow margin was 58.4%. Therefore,Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 3.4% + 58.4% = 61.8%Since the calculation comes out significantly higher than 40%, I conclude that Check Point is in good shape financially.This is where things get interesting and somewhat controversial. It seems logical to me that high growth companies should be valued more highly than slow-growth companies. To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of Enterprise Value (EV) / forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth. Note that only software stocks that pass the Rule of 40 are used for this evaluation.(Source: Portfolio123 /MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and “next year’s sales estimate” mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using “current year’s sales estimate” and “next year’s sales estimate” also provided by Portfolio123.The reason for using analysts’ estimates is because SaaS stocks tend to make a lot of acquisitions which can muddy the results of the scatter plot. The analyst estimates account for these acquisitions and the estimates are updated frequently. This makes for a cleaner chart. The sales estimates, unlike EPS estimates, are usually quite accurate for most SaaS companies except that they are usually a little on the conservative side.I use an exponential best-fit trend line as it appears to be more appropriate than a linear trend line for this application. As sales growth goes up, the valuation goes up exponentially. The trend line was calculated using MS Excel. I consider the stocks sitting above the trend line to be overvalued while stocks lying under the trend line are undervalued.As can be seen from the chart, Check Point is significantly higher than the trend line, indicating that its EV/forward sales are considerably higher than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. For comparison’s sake, Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks and ZScaler are also shown on the scatter plot. While Scaler has a very lofty valuation, both Fortinet and Palo Alto Networks have more reasonably valued stocks that are below the trend line. My overall interpretation is that Check Point is quite overvalued. As an investor, I would be more interested in Fortinet or Palo Alto Networks.Check Point has a superior free cash flow margin and has been a leader in security for a long time. The company is conservatively managed and has prioritized financials for rapid growth. If investors are prepared for substandard performance for the next couple of years, the company may pull through with perhaps 15% annual growth in the long term.The company scores quite well on the Rule of 40, a rule of thumb that estimates a software company's health. But in my estimation, Check Point is overvalued. At least for now, I believe there are better plays, such as Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, and a host of new hotshots that have very high revenue growth. I'll check back in 2020 to see if the company is a better investment at that point in time.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"

Finance; data as of 6/5/2019.Investors have become cautious as growth has slowed down (see below) and competition has intensified.Source: Morningstar; data as of 6/5/2019.Meanwhile, the valuation of Check Point did not join the price-multiple expansions of the overall equity market. EV/EBIT and P/FCF for CHKP have gone sideways or slightly down (see below).Source: GuruFocus; data as of 6/5/2019.Source: GuruFocus; data as of 6/5/2019.Actually, according to Morningstar below, the current valuation is slightly lower than its historical averages, pricing in some bearish sentiment.Source: Morningstar; data as of 6/5/2019.The company has been consistently delivering above-industry returns on capital with no debt and converting more than 100% of its net profit into free cash flow for owners.However, investors interested in the long-term value play here may need to figure out the secure (i.e., the highly predictable) and the insecure (i.e., the risk) of the business before holding a position in CHKP.By examining the long history of financial performance at Check Point, we noticed that the return on tangible equity (one of Warren Buffett's favorite ratios) trended down since the 1990s but stabilized at between 20% and 30% since the 2008 financial crisis. There was then the momentum of improving returns during recent years. Overall, the management demonstrated decent capital allocation skills.Source: GuruFocus; data as of 6/5/2019.The business also maintained its high margin over the years, thanks to the high quality of products and services.Source: GuruFocus; data as of 6/5/2019.In terms of cash generation, Check Point is one of the rare species that is able to derive more free cash flow out of sales every fiscal year (for the past 10 years at least), as demonstrated by the FCF/NI ratio below.Source: Morningstar; data as of 6/5/2019.This means that its TTM operating cash flow seldom (if any) drops below its TTM net income (see below). Such a strong cash generation comes from its software subscription and service contracting revenue models, where revenue recognition is often deferred (after cash inflow), as well as the low CapEx requirement to run the business (usually less than 1% of total revenue is needed every year).Source: GuruFocus; data as of 6/5/2019.The stock does not pay a dividend, but the company has been aggressively reducing its shares outstanding by more than 1/4 in total for the past decade.Source: GuruFocus; data as of 6/5/2019.With the P/E hovering around 20x in the past 10 years (see below), it appears that the management at least did not overpay when buying back the company's own shares.Source: Morningstar; data as of 6/5/2019.I think that the durable advantage of Check Point mainly comes from its superior quality of products and services, high switching cost involved in the cybersecurity space, and its recurring revenue model.Remember that I previously covered the topic on recurring revenue in terms of reducing equity risk. In recent years, the management at Check Point has committed greatly to converting the majority of its businesses to subscription-based.Source: Annual Report 2018.As displayed in their annual reports, the growth of security subscriptions has been substantial. The subscription segment also has the highest margin (see the operating expenses below).Source: Annual Report 2018.What is more important is that the subscription base leads to recurring revenue streams resulting from renewals and updates/maintenance over the long haul.At the end of 2018, only less than 28% of Check Point's total sales are one-off (i.e. through product and license sales). Going forward, I believe that the high margins and superior ROIC of the business are here to stay.Source: Annual Report 2018.Additionally, I appreciate the spending of 10% out of annual revenue on R&D, which should hopefully keep up the leading position of Check Point in its domain in the foreseeable future.The current CEO and also founder of the company, Gil Shwed, is considered the inventor of the modern firewall and authored several patents, such as the company’s Stateful Inspection technology. Mr. Shwed has received numerous accolades for his individual achievements and industry contributions, including the prestigious Israel Prize last year for his contributions to the Israeli technology industry.At Check Point, Mr. Shwed has amde a committed effort to build the business methodically by focusing on building a recurring revenue foundation via its subscription-based model and managing overhead, and he has been delivering so far.One more point worth mentioning is that Mr. Shwed requested to forego his salary and bonus for the past several years. As we can see below, major insiders own roughly a quarter of the company in aggregate.Source: Annual Report 2018.Wall Street analysts estimate a 3-4% annual increase in EPS, which I think is a bit short-sighted.Source: SimplyWallSt; data as of 6/5/2019.For the near term, the deferred revenue could be a good leading indicator for future growth and has increased YoY by high-single-digit or low-double-digit rates for several quarters now.For the longer term, however, there could be some uncertainties regarding sustainable growth due to competitions. The market for information and network security solutions is intensely competitive and competition is expected to continue to increase in the future.Major competitors include Cisco Systems (CSCO), Juniper Networks (JNPR), Fortinet (OTC:FNTN), and Palo Alto Networks (PANW). Check Point also competes with many niche players with specialized focuses on specific Internet and data security needs with better adaption to emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements.The cybersecurity market is estimated to grow at low-teens to mid-teens CAGR in the near future. Many players in this space, like Palo Alto, choose to pursue an aggressive growth strategy by spending heavily on sales and marketing.Unlike many of its peers, Check Point pays more attention to its steadily increasing profits, and therefore, does not post ridiculously high YoY revenue gains. Of course, the management should be fully aware of the situation and has increased their spending on sales and marketing, which caused some margin pressure for recent quarters. However, whether the initiative would revive the top-line growth while keeping costs under control remains a wait-and-see question.There are plenty of examples in terms of value destruction in a rapid-growing market/industry. Competition is for losers. I just hope that cybersecurity will not be one such case.With a less than 20x P/FCF, CHKP is traded at a fair price to me. The two-stage DCF model at SimplyWallSt confirms this judgment as demonstrated below.Source: SimplyWallSt; data as of 6/5/2019.Source: SimplyWallSt; data as of 6/5/2019.Source: SimplyWallSt; data as of 6/5/2019.However, I would like to build a bear case to gauge the margin of safety in this case. Let's assume the current FROIC (29%) will decay at 80 basis points a year, no dividend to payout, no debt to leverage, a discount rate of 18%, and a terminal P/B of 3x (vs. 4.7x at the moment).If we pay $16.4 on $1 of FCF, which is currently implied by the price multiple, then by Year 7, we should have all the initial investment paid back by the new free cash flow generated by the business. If we count in the terminal book value, then at the end of Year 5, we would have the total cash inflow presently valued at $24.4 - a 33% margin of safety.I am more comfortable with the economic moat, able management, and valuation at Check Point than with the growth prospects of the business in a highly competitive industry.The current price level already presents a sizable margin of safety for long-term buy-and-hold investors. For those who want more security, a P/FCF of less than 15x or waiting for a clearer growth outlook may work better."

However, it seems like investors' confidence was pretty low heading into earnings considering the stock has been up ~5% since reporting earnings.Revenue grew 4% during the quarter, which still lacks peer growth rates, such as Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT), by a significant amount. What was disappointing to me was billings growth during Q3 coming in below consensus expectations, a potential sign that revenue growth may continue to be low for the next quarter or so. However, management seemed to dismiss a weaker global economy, which was also seen by strength in international revenue growth.Data by YChartsCHKP is one of the legacy IT security players still competing in the market, and despite rebounding very strong from their December 2018 lows, which was up nearly 35% at one point, the stock has trended downwards and is ~15% from recent April highs. With the company reporting another in-line quarter with billings growth decelerating again, it is challenging to see this name have much upside from these levels.Valuation continues to remain below their comp group, which admittedly is one of the few reasons investors could see this as a potential good investment. However, investors should take into account a much slower revenue growth, billings growth, and margin potential.While I remain somewhat positive on the name over the long term, this is more of a bullish commentary around IT security spend over the next several years. CHKP has a few internal issues to resolve in order to accelerate revenue growth and start to close their valuation gap between competitors. With other security competitors growing at faster rates, accelerating billings growth, and expanding margins, I believe there are other areas in this market to properly invest your money.CHKP is an IT security solutions provider focusing on areas such as network security, endpoint security, mobile security, data security, and security management. They are considered one of the legacy players in the security market and has faced intense competition over the past few years. While CHKP provides efficient and effective IT security tools, it should not be valued on a revenue multiple, and investors should focus more on its earnings multiple.The main areas CHKP competes in have seen increased competition from companies that solely focus on a specific area of IT security. Network security has become very saturated by four main players: Palo Alto Networks, Cisco (CSCO), Fortinet and CHKP. Competitors are growing at a much quicker rate, thus taking market share from the company. This area of the IT security market continues to grow mid-single digits each year and is one of CHKP's main focus areas.Revenue during Q3 grew 4% to $491 million, which was similar to the 4% growth seen during last quarter. Revenue came in similar to consensus expectations and just ahead of the midpoint of management's previous guidance of $480-500 million. However, investors seemed to fear worse as the stock has popped ~5% since reporting in-line revenue. I believe investors were positioned to face a bigger downside scenario and the in-line report could be seen as a ""beat"" in some opinions.Source: Company PresentationProduct revenue continued their gradual decline, decreasing 2% during the quarter, marking the 9th consecutive quarter of decline. However, subscription revenue growth came in at 13%, which showed no signs of deceleration. Security subscription revenues are much more valuable than product because they are more recurring and have higher visibility. In addition, this revenue stream typically comes in the form of higher margins compared to product revenue, which has more expenses related to the hardware involved.International revenue was a bright spot in the report, with EMEA growing 7% during the quarter and likely surprised investors to the upside. Considering the economic slowdown and concerns going on in EMEA, CHKP was able to deliver 7% growth, nearly double the overall company's growth rate.Billings growth was flat during the quarter and was below expectations for ~3% growth. However, this is another area that seemed like investors were worried about. Usually when a company reports decelerating billings, the stock does not go up. However, I believe investors continue to worry about the billings growth in this name and took the flat growth as a positive.Source: Company PresentationOperating margin came in at 50.2%, and while above consensus estimates for ~50%, it was still down from 53.0% in the year-ago period. The ~280bps margin contraction was slightly better than the ~330bps contraction seen last quarter, though this does not give investors any improved confidence in the long-term trajectory. Continued pressure on the margins will not only continue to pressure EPS, but will continue to pressure the stock.EPS for the quarter came in at $1.44, which was above expectations of $1.40. Part of the beat was due to revenue coming in a little bit above expectations and a majority of the beat was likely due to one-time items that are non-recurring.Management provided guidance for Q4, which includes revenue of $527-557 million, or ~3% growth at the midpoint. While this was a little below expectations for ~$540 million, I believe the wide guidance range gives the company a large margin of error. Q4 revenue growth is also expected to decelerate slightly at the midpoint, which could be a little conservative given the ~4% revenue growth year to date. EPS is expected to be $1.93-2.04, above expectations for $1.97.This implies full-year revenue of $1.98-2.01 billion, or ~4% growth at the midpoint, and is pretty close to expectations. While the 4% growth during 2019 could be seen as a positive, I believe 4% growth is a good starting base to start accelerating revenue in the coming years.Despite the stock still down ~15% since its April highs, I believe the recent ~5% run in the stock post-earnings is not fully deserved. Even though the company likely reported revenue growth that was better than feared, a 4% revenue growth that was in line with expectations in addition to flat billings growth should not be rewarded this much.The company continues to lose market share from faster growth competitors such as PANW and FTNT, and even though the industry is growing nicely, there is room for improvement.Data by YChartsData by YChartsValuation remains a little tricky with this name because the faster growth competitors (PANW and FTNT) trade off of forward revenue. However, these companies have much lower margins and do not see the consistency of earnings as CHKP and CSCO do. For that reason, CHKP and CSCO are better off being valued using forward P/E.Consensus is currently expecting 2019 EPS of $5.71 and 2020 EPS of $6.08, representing growth of 6-7%. While I believe this is possible, it is more challenging to see EPS growing 10%+ next year unless either revenue growth meaningfully accelerates or margins expand.With the stock currently trading at ~$113, this implies a 2020 P/E of ~18.6x, which is near the forward P/E of CSCO (currently ~18.5x). I believe CSCO has a better potential for revenue growth accelerating and deserves to trade at a higher multiple. If we were to assume CHKP's 2020 P/E is closer to 17x, this would result in a price of ~$104, representing ~9% downside from Tuesday's closing price.As the chart above shows, CHKP's forward P/E multiple has not been above 19x in the past year, and unless the company's fundamentals change quite a bit, I do not see a forward P/E multiple above 19x in the near future. Using consensus 2020 EPS estimate of $6.08, this would cap the stock at $115, only ~2% above current prices.For now, I remain on the sideline and see the recent ~5% pop in the stock as a small relief rally after Q3 earnings. The competitive landscape remains challenging and CHKP will need to demonstrate to investors they are capable of re-accelerating revenue growth in order to deserve a higher valuation multiple."
4258190,24361,2019-05-01T07:30:00-04:00,"Check Point delivered a basically in-line first quarter, but the Street didn't like the soft (though as expected) billings number and the more second half-loaded guidance.Check Point continues to try to restructure its sales effort to focus on more comprehensive business relationships with customers and improve its channel partner interactions.I'm skeptical that Check Point can or will meaningfully improve its long-term revenue growth rate and the risk/reward balance on the shares isn't particularly exciting now.","Although not my favorite idea in security software (having expressed preferences for Palo Alto (PANW) and CyberArk (CYBR) in the recent past), I thought Check Point (CHKP) looked undervalued back in January even allowing for the suboptimal growth profile of this security company. Shares rose better than 15% since that last update, though the post-earnings sell-off has cut that in half and left the shares lagging Palo Alto, Fortinet (FTNT), and CyberArk (by a wide margin) since then.Once again the key concern around Check Point is whether the company can generate enough growth, particularly now that the company is clearly sacrificing margin to pursue growth. At today’s valuation, I’m pretty ambivalent about Check Point. I believe this company would/will fare better in an economic downturn due to its large, well-established legacy customer base, but it’s tough to make money long-term in low-growth software companies and I’m not sold on the idea that Check Point has a plan in place to drive a meaningful acceleration in growth, particularly when 2018 was a strong year for the sector and Check Point didn’t really participate.Check Point reported better than 4% revenue growth, which was fine relative to expectations. Product revenue was down almost 5%, marking seven straight weak quarters, while subscription revenue did grow 13% year-over-year. Gross margin was fairly stable, staying above 90%, as lower-margin product sales were a smaller part of the mix. Subscription gross margin did slip almost a point, though, and I’d keep an eye on that number in future quarters.Operating income declined 2%, more or less in line expectations, but operating margin slipped below 50% for the first time in over 10 years as the company continues to increase SG&A spending in an attempt to drive better revenue growth.Deferred revenue rose a little less than 13% for the quarter, but billings grew only a little more than 3%. On one hand, it’s well worth noting that the Street expected a relatively soft billings number, so there shouldn’t be anything surprising about it. On the other hand, this was still a pretty weak growth number in what is the easiest year-over-year comp in 2019, so the lack of a beat here is maybe not the strongest sign of reinvigorated growth.With management’s guidance for the second quarter, it basically looks like more of the full year’s growth is being shifted into the second half. Check Point is far from the only company fitting that profile (it’s commonplace in industrials now), and I’m not as concerned about that here as I’d be for some companies, but it doesn’t help the bull argument.In the meantime, Check Point continues to look for an overhauled sales effort to drive better results. The company is still in the process of trying to shift the sales effort away from a more transaction-oriented philosophy to one more focused on “architectural sales” and more comprehensive business relationships. Infinity Total Protect is still an important part of that, but it is still a small part of the business (a single-digit percentage of sales) and not all customers have sounded overjoyed about this offering.Check Point is also trying to address some legacy issues in its sales channel with its new Check Point Engage initiative with its channel partners. Time will tell if this makes a meaningful difference, but with Palo Alto recently shifting some of its sales focus, maybe there will be some incremental opportunities here.In the meantime, several of the major players are trying to carve out refreshed identities to drive better sales execution. Fortinet has really been pushing the converged networking/security angle (SD-WAN), but I’m not completely convinced the products/solutions they’re offering are really strong enough to make that work. Palo Alto, on the other hand, is pushing a more familiar message that they offer the best platform and the only platform that a customer really needs. For its part, Check Point is not only trying to improve its sales intensity, but also talk up the capabilities of new sixth-gen offerings and recent additions like Infinity and Dome9 (which seems to have pretty solid customer interest).I do like the new Maestro offering from Check Point, but I’m skeptical that it will be a big needle-mover for the company in terms of driving real growth acceleration. I likewise think ITP will take time to really make a major difference. I’m more bullish on Dome9 (cloud security), but it seems probable that Palo Alto will market hard against this offering.With an inline quarter, I don’t see the need to change much in my model apart from some fine-tuning. The end result is a basically unchanged long-term revenue growth rate around 4% and a slightly lower adjusted free cash flow growth rate. Against a trailing long-term growth rate of more than 8%, I’m clearly not a super-bull on the prospects for Check Point’s sales efforts to drive sales growth to a higher level on a sustained basis. For that to happen, I believe Check Point would need to invest in or acquire more disruptive technology that goes against its traditional fast-follower philosophy. Not surprisingly, my fair values don’t change much either, and with the share price move since my last article, I see the prospective annualized return down more to the mid/high-single-digit level.While Check Point has some annuity-like characteristics that create a valuation backstop, I don’t see enough upside here to be all that excited about the shares. A lot of names have shot up (CyberArk comes immediately to mind) and I suppose there could be a relative value argument here, particularly if the end-market (or stock market) turns, but I’d prefer to wait until the shares offer more upside."
4239639,104608,2019-02-09T07:45:28-05:00,Check Point reported a solid Q4 with revenue and EPS both exceeding consensus estimates.The company continues to ramp up their sales force in order to accelerate growth as they place more emphasis on their software solutions.Valuation remains at a premium level despite revenue growth much lower than the leading players.,"Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP), one of the legacy IT security players still in the market, has rebounded well since the market sell-off and has now recovered to pre-correction highs. The company reported solid Q4 results and provided a positive 2019 guidance. However, they continue to lose share to faster-growing firewall and cloud security players with management committed to spending more on their sales force in order to capture more market share.In a world where security is moving away from on-premise operations, legacy players such as CHKP could be left behind. Though the company has remained competitive in today's market, it continues to lose share, as revenue increased 4% this past quarter. Shares continue to tread along, remaining near the high end of valuation ranges for comparable security players.Data by YChartsData by YChartsAlthough CHKP has been a solid performer over the past year, I believe current valuation reflects positive investor sentiment and full expectations for the out year. Over the past 6 months, CHKP has generated nearly 8% alpha versus the market, a solid performance considering the volatility in a majority of technology stocks over the past few months.Investors are paying a relatively expensive multiple to own this legacy name which is growing revenue in the low-/mid-single digits compared to 20%+ growth seen in other security names.CHKP is an IT security solutions provider focusing on areas such as network security, endpoint security, mobile security, data security and security management. It is considered one of the legacy players in the security market and has faced intense competition over the past few years. While CHKP provides efficient and effective IT security tools, it should not be valued on a revenue multiple, and investors should focus more on its earnings multiple.The main areas CHKP competes in has seen a rise in new competition from companies that solely focus on a specific area of IT security. Network security has become very saturated by four main players: Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) and CHKP. Competitors are growing at a much quicker rate, thus taking market share from the company. This area of the IT security market continues to grow mid-single digits each year and is one of CHKP's main focus areas.Data security will always remain a competitive industry. We keep seeing data breaches occur on what seems like a daily basis. Enterprises are becoming more protective about their data, and recent regulation in Europe, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), brings hefty fines for enterprises that are found in violation of user data protection.CHKP recently completed the acquisition of Dome9, enhancing their Infinity architecture and cloud security offerings. Dome9 provides cloud-native security capabilities, including intuitive visualization of security posture, compliance and governance automation, privileged identity protection and cloud traffic and event analysis, enabling cloud deployments safer and more manageable (Source: Company Website). In what appears to be a very late attempt at improving its cloud security, CHKP continues to be well behind cloud security leaders such as FTNT, PANW, CSCO, and Zscaler (ZS).CHKP continues to lose share in the firewall market to players such as FTNT, PANW, CSCO and emerging cloud security leader ZS, which reinforces the need for R&D spend. The company's lackluster Q3 earnings were right down the fairway with nothing exciting to look forward to.CHKP reported Q4 revenue of $526 million, growing 4% y/y, which was near the higher end of management's previous guidance of $500-528 million and above consensus estimates of $518 million. Non-GAAP operating margins remained good at 53.1% but contracted compared to 57.7% last year. For the full year, margins ended up at 52.9%.Source: Company PresentationEPS of $1.63 was above consensus estimates of $1.63 despite operating margins contracting y/y. The EPS beat was largely driven by revenues exceeding consensus estimate.Source: Company PresentationCHKP breaks down its revenue into three main segments: Product, Subscription and Maintenance.Maintenance revenue represented over 40% of Q4 total revenue and grew nearly 4% y/y, in line with overall company growth. This revenue stream is highly correlated with Product revenue growth. As companies purchase more product from CHKP, there will be an increased need for maintenance operations. Thus, a slowdown in Product revenue will likely have a negative material impact on maintenance revenue over the long run.Product revenue, which represented ~30% of the total, decreased ~3% y/y in Q4. Going back to the Q1 call, management noted IT spending is seasonally down in the first half of the year and expected positive Product growth during the second half of the year. However, the decline in Q4 continued to demonstrate weakness in this segment despite the overall security market continuing to grow.Finally, Subscription revenue, which represents just under 30% of total, continues to grow at an impressive rate, at 13% for Q4, which was a similar growth rate to Q3. The key takeaway here is that CHKP continues to move away from legacy on-premise security products (found in the declining Product segment) and towards cloud-based subscription models.CHKP has underperformed the market this year and is well below comparable IT security companies. This is relatively warranted given its much slower growth rate and fears that it would keep losing market share. As the security market consistently grows at high rates, CHKP does not.Data by YChartsTypically, companies with strong, consistent gross and operating margins like CHKP should be valued on earnings or EBITDA. However, when looking at their revenue multiple, something seems off. Software companies with high growth rates and little-to-no earnings typically trade at premium revenue multiples, not legacy security companies slowly transitioning to cloud-based sales.It is challenging to reason why CHKP is trading at such a premium forward revenue multiple compared to other leading security players which have a much better positioning in cloud security. FTNT, PANW and even CSCO have better software security offerings and have done a better job transitioning to the cloud. Management did note they will look to spend more on the sales force and make improvement in an effort to accelerate revenue, but even if revenue growth doubled to ~8%, this would remain well behind the competitors.Instead, CHKP should be valued on earnings since they have stable margins and have a lower revenue growth profile.Data by YChartsUsing the same peer group as above, there is a clear difference in the P/E ratios between the competitors. Legacy players such as CHKP and CSCO who grow at a slower rate trade at a much lower multiple compared to the faster growth, market share players such as FTNT and PANW.For 2019, CHKP's management guided EPS to $5.85-6.25, a healthy growth y/y. However, I believe their current 19x multiple is a bit too high as they should trade more in line with CSCO who also grows at a low mid-single-digit growth rate.Assuming CHKP reaches the higher end of guidance, and trades at a ~17x multiple, which would still be a premium to CSCO, CHKP would have a price target of $106, slightly below the current price of $116. Right now, investors continue to give a premium multiple for this company. Even at a 19x multiple and using the high end of management's EPS guidance, CHKP would have a price target of $119.For now, I remain on the sidelines for this name as I believe there are better security companies in the firewall space which grow at a faster pace and are more deserving of a premium valuation.Some risks to this thesis included CHKP's ability to maintain customers because of its legacy operations. Competition in the security market continues to increase, and the transition to cloud-based security subscriptions could prove to be challenging to CHKP's revenue growth."
4237178,24361,2019-01-31T14:18:42-05:00,"Check Point beat expectations for the fourth quarter, and though management guided margins down for 2019, the increased spending on sales and marketing is a positive.Between firewall refreshes, new products, the Dome9 deal, easier comps, and increased S&M spending, billings growth in the first half of 2019 should be pretty good at CHKP.Check Point looks undervalued on a long-term discounted cash flow basis, but it's still tough to be all-in on a slow-growing company in the growth-driven software sector.","Check Point (CHKP) remains an intriguing, yet frustrating, investment option in the security space for me. On one hand, I like the company’s strong cash flow and large installed base. On the other hand, I continue to believe that the company has under-invested in the business and allowed Palo Alto (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT) and others to grow at their expense. With management stepping up its sales and marketing investments and an easier set of comps in the first half of 2019, the time may be ripe for Check Point to post a little momentum and perhaps outperform in a market that could still be pretty dicey in 2019, even though underlying security spending should remain healthy.Check Point didn’t post a perfect quarter, but I’d argue it was no worse than decent, as the company came in ahead of the Street on most metrics that matter.Revenue rose 4%, which frankly isn’t great for a software/security company, but that was still about 2% better than expected. Product revenue continues to erode (down 3%), but blade subscription revenue rose nearly 13%.Margins were also healthy, with non-GAAP gross margin improving 40bp year over year and beating expectations by 10bp. Operating income fell more than 4% from the year-ago period, but rose 12% qoq and beat by about 3%, with operating margin shrinking 460bp yoy but still beating expectations by 60bp.Deferred revenue jumped 13%, with short-term deferred revenue up about 12%. Billings were up 9%, beating expectations by more than 5%, with current billings up 8%. While I’ve already seen some analysts carping about declines in product billings, I think that’s just the way it’s going to be for Check Point going forward, particularly given the transition in the business.Guidance for 2019 was okay, though it will give bulls and bears alike something to anchor their cases. Revenue was on target relative to expectations (the midpoint of the guidance range matched the average estimate going into the qurater), but the midpoint of management’s range only contemplates about 4% growth in a year when security spending growth should be meaningfully higher than that. Management also guided margin expectations down, with a target almost two points below the prior expectation. Given that the revision is due to increased business investment (spending on sales and marketing) and the absorption of loss-making M&A like Dome9, I don’t really see this as a problem.Check Point continues to sport some of the best margins and free cash flow margins you’ll find in software, and that is both the good news and the bad news. That strong free cash flow gives Check Point staying power that other companies simply don’t have, and I believe it can help anchor valuation if and when the market (both the real-world security market and the perception-driven stock market) gets rocky. It’s also an anchor in other way, though, as I continue to believe that Check Point under-spends on the business. There is certainly a point of diminishing/negative returns for sales and marketing spending, but I believe Check Point has underspent relative to Palo Alto and Fortinet (among others), and paid a price for it in the form of losing some market share to these rivals (both Palo Alto and Fortinet are expected to post much higher double-digit billings growth for this comparable quarter).I also still believe that Check Point underspends on R&D and is to slow to innovate. Yes, it is cheaper to hire engineers in Israel than in Silicon Valley, but the fact remains that Check Point is never on the leading edge of new offerings and isn’t the company moving the bar up in terms of what enterprise security can be or do. Fast-follower strategies can work, and Check Point is far from a failing company, but if you’re not going to be first with innovation, I believe you need to make sure you don’t drop the ball when it comes to sales and marketing.Between increased investment in sales and marketing, an ongoing firewall refresh, new product introductions, the Dome9 acquisition, and easy billing comps for the first half of 2019, I believe Check Point is well-placed for some strong billing growth numbers in the first half of 2019. The comps will get more challenging in the third and fourth quarters, but hopefully those new product introductions and increased S&M investments will continue to offer some tailwind for the business.One potential risk is the ongoing growth of the company’s Infinity offering. If adoption accelerates, that is going to hurt near-term billings and deferred revenue numbers (but lead to better long-term numbers). I think that’s understood by the Street and most investors, but you never really know how the market will react to lower-than-expected quarterly growth numbers even if there’s a good reason for it (and it is for the long-term good of the business).My basic expectations for Check Point still haven’t changed. I expect the company to generate long-term revenue growth around 4%, as the company’s sizable installed base counterbalances share loss to more aggressive rivals and an ongoing evolution in the security space (one that doesn’t necessarily strongly favor Check Point’s legacy strengths). I do expect a slower pace of FCF growth, as I believe the company’s margins will be vulnerable in the future to more competitive pressures.Still, those adjusted cash flows do support a fair value a bit above today’s price and suggest a total long-term annualized potential return of close to 10%. For a company that scores well on quality and stability metrics, that’s not bad. I will again note, though, that “value” stories don’t often work out as well in the software space as you might think; it’s a growth-driven sector and the stocks of slower-growing companies often underwhelm. To that end, the shares are not undervalued using a mixed growth/margin formula that I have found effective in determining “fair” EV/revenue multiples for software stocks.In the low-to-mid-$90’s, it would be really easy to like these shares, but that’s not the opportunity on offer today. As is, I think Check Point is a decent name, and one that could do better if the economy and stock market get more volatile as 2019 goes on. I’d probably prefer to own Check Point in tandem with a riskier, faster-growing security name (a sort of barbell investment strategy), but as is I think there’s a decent investment case for Check Point today."
4231072,24361,2019-01-02T11:22:47-05:00,"Check Point's efforts to improve sales execution in North America seem to be working, but there's more work to do.
        Improving the company's cloud security offerings makes sense, but doing more to address opportunities in endpoint security and analytics could help the growth prospects.
        Check Point shares look a little undervalued now and the company's strong margins are a definite positive, but revenue growth acceleration would be well-received by the market.","Back when I paid more attention to football, my favorite team had a running back about whom I would say “if you need 3 yards, he’ll get you 3.5 yards; if you need 4 yards, he’ll get you 3.5 yards.” I’m reminded of that whenever I look at Check Point (CHKP), as this leading security software vendor continues to hold a strong position in the enterprise security market despite the inroads made by competitors like Palo Alto (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT) and steady competition from the likes of Cisco (CSCO), as well as new up-and-comers. Check Point is unlikely to ever be a truly impressive growth story again, but the company’s margins, cash flows, and strong installed base have value – particularly in situations where the market has become much more worried about near-term growth prospects and valuation for software.Check Point looks a little undervalued to me, and the company could benefit from somewhat easier comps in the coming quarters and improving salesforce execution, as well as ongoing growth in its Infinity Total Protection offering. Check Point isn’t going to be immune to an intense or prolonged sell-off in tech stocks, but I think it can hold up better than most and there’s decent underlying long-term value.As I mentioned in a recent article on CyberArk (CYBR), security spending remains a relatively healthy sector within overall IT spending and I believe mid-single-digit spending growth in 2019 is still a reasonable expectation. Between evolving threats and an industry-wide move toward more subscription-based revenue, I’m not too worried that Check Point is going to see shrinking customer budgets, even if the macroeconomic picture does start to deteriorate more noticeably in 2019.The “but” is that enterprise security spending is not homogenous. Areas like endpoint security, platform security, and analytics look to be particularly high on priority lists for spending, and none of these areas are particular strong points for Check Point, while competitors like Palo Alto, FireEye (FEYE), and Cisco have been improving their offerings to varying degrees, not to mention companies like Splunk (SPLK).On a more positive note, Check Point is stepping up its capabilities in cloud security, and with cloud adoption continuing to rise, I believe there is a real opportunity here and particularly among enterprises going with hybrid cloud ecosystems. In addition to its still relatively new CloudGuard platform, which covers an array of cloud-based applications from vendors like Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce.com (CRM), and ServiceNow (NOW) and is built upon Check Point’s core Infinity architecture, Check Point recently announced the acquisition of Dome9 – an up-and-coming specialist in cloud security platforms.Assessing Dome9 is a little challenging. On one hand, virtually all of the feedback I’ve gotten on the company has been positive, with a lot of praise for its active policy enforcement/application automation, its multi-cloud protection capabilities, and its ability to address real and meaningful problems for customers adopting/using cloud ecosystems. On the other hand, by all accounts the company’s revenue is tiny and so I don’t see how it can be solving all that many problems for all that many customers yet.Still, given Palo Alto’s acquisition of Dome9 competitor Evident.IO for $300 million in early 2018, I think this deal makes some sense. Check Point’s customers are increasingly adopting cloud-based systems and Check Point has to have a robust set of security options that address the particular needs and challenges of this environment. Cloud providers have solid security on their end, for instance, but they don’t really know what normal traffic looks like for particular customers (though I could see this changing over time, particularly with machine learning tools), so there is still a real need for enterprises to have strong security in place for these new environments.Sales force execution is always a looming threat in this market. Even Palo Alto has had its missteps and challenges, and between Check Point, Cisco, Fortinet, Palo Alto, et al, it’s really a “when, not if” question of when these challenges will crop up. It has been Check Point’s turn in the hot seat recently, with underspending relative to rivals and an aged (if not obsolete) go-to-market strategy weighing on sales.Check Point has made changes and those changes seem to be making a difference. Year-over-year revenue growth improved in the third quarter relative to the second quarter (back to mid-single-digit growth), and growth in North America accelerated to +8%, albeit against an easier comp. There’s still room for improvement, though, and management is working on getting its sales force to focus more on architectural sales (as opposed to more transactional business) while also increasing overall marketing spend. It takes time to reorient incentives and go-to-market strategies, but Check Point does seem to be on a better trajectory in North America and should have some easier comps in the coming quarters to help the reported growth rate.I don’t expect Check Point to ever be a growth leader in the security space, but I do expect the company to do a decent job of holding its own while generating very strong margins. Palo Alto is going to remain a hard-charging rival and Fortinet still seems willing to compete aggressively on price (at least in certain circumstances), but Check Point is not exactly bringing a knife to a gunfight; other companies may have better technology, but Check Point’s is still competitive and the company has shown a willingness to use M&A to acquire technology (often start-ups or companies very early in their commercial ramp) to maintain its fast-follower position. To that end, I do still believe Check Point could benefit from additional M&A, including acquisitions targeting the endpoint and analytics spaces.As Check Point’s third quarter was more or less as I expected, and not a lot has changed regarding my outlook for Check Point in 2019 and 2020, I’ve made only relatively trivial changes to my model. The net output of my model is a long-term revenue growth rate of 4% and a long-term FCF growth rate of 3%, which support a high single-digit long-term annualized return from today’s level.Near-term valuation metrics are a little less positive for Check Point, but that’s due to the fact that near-term software multiples are driven largely by revenue growth and not by margins (where Check Point excels). Although I don’t believe Check Point is particularly overvalued on the basis of its near-term growth rate, investors shouldn’t underestimate the importance of re-accelerated revenue growth as an important driver for improved stock returns.I think Check Point is a decent option to consider for investors looking to use a barbell strategy where Check Point is the steadier performer that can counterbalance a riskier, faster-growing name. On a standalone basis, I like Check Point a little more now, and I do believe management has the sales effort on a better track. I can’t say that the market will be particularly hospitable to tech stocks over the next six months, but I do think Check Point offers decent long-term value with some potential for modest outperformance in its next few quarterly reports."
4199192,24361,2018-08-14T20:56:25-04:00,"Check Point is still struggling with weak growth in revenue, billings, and profits, but some sales metrics seem to be improving and there could be some product cycle help.The company is due to release the next R80 iteration and is only getting started with its Infinity Total Protect concept.Check Point shares look a little borderline in terms of valuation, but improving growth momentum (if it happens) would be well-received by the market.","The 15% move in Check Point (CHKP) shares over the last three months looks pretty good against other security stocks like Palo Alto (PANW) and Proofpoint (PFPT), but stretch the time period out to just a year and Palo Alto, Proofpoint, Fortinet (FTNT), and CyberArk (CYBR) continue to outperform Check Point by wide margins, as Check Point continues to bumble along with low single-digit revenue growth and little-to-no near-term momentum in profits or free cash flow.Check Point’s chronic problems with top-line growth remain a sticking point with me, and I don’t find the valuation as forgiving as I did six months ago (the shares are up 13% since then, beating the NASDAQ). On the other hand, Check Point’s issues may be more cyclical than appreciated and the company may be in the early innings of a cyclical upswing that has seen annual contract values peak roughly every two years going back about a decade. The old boilerplate warning about past performance not guaranteeing future results certainly applies (particularly with the different revenue model with Infinity Total Protect), but I think this name merits a little closer watching now.Exceptionally sluggish top-line growth remains the easiest nit to pick with Check Point, as the last two quarters have seen top-line growth of just 2% (second quarter) and 4% (first quarter), with 1% and 2% operating income growth.The new Infinity Total Protect subscription-based consumption model has changed up the model a bit, particularly with respect to product sales, but blade subscription revenue growth of 12% in the second quarter was still weaker than the 14% growth in the first quarter and the 27% growth in the prior year’s second quarter. Likewise, while Check Point management has consistently reiterated that billings metrics are not predictive for the company’s growth, flat billings for two quarters and modest low-single-digit growth in short-term billings don’t help sentiment.Management continues to allocate more spending in sales and marketing, with spending up more than 8% in the second quarter (up 10% netting out SOE) and up more than 10% in the first six months of 2018. Along similar lines, Check Point has more job listings posted than at any prior point, and I don’t think management can be accused of ignoring the sales side of the equation.As far as sales execution goes, that’s been a pretty popular talking point around Check Point for several quarters now. As it happens, it’s a commonly-cited excuse by software companies (certainly within the security space) when sales underperform, as Palo Alto has also pointed to sales execution to explain away some less impressive quarters in its recent past.Assessing sales force execution is tricky, particularly as I think Check Point has been too slow to innovate in some aspects of enterprise security. So is it really an execution issue if a sales force can’t sell less competitive technology?Be that as it may, there was better momentum in the Americas in the second quarter, with revenue up a little under 6% on a sequential basis. Unfortunately, APAC sales were weak, so it may be the case that “execution” has improved in North America but there’s work to do now in the Asia-Pacific region. I’d also note the recent departure of Check Point’s head of worldwide sales (Pierre-Paul Allard). Check Point quickly replaced him (with Dan Yerushalmi) and it looks like Allard left to pursue a better opportunity (a “C-level” job with Juniper (NYSE:JNPR)), but this represents yet another potential disruption in what has been a sensitive area of company performance.I think an underrated part of Check Point’s performance issues could perhaps be product cycle stress. The R80.1 architecture is about three years old now, and Check Point is due to launch R80.2 here in the third quarter. In the past decade, Check Point’s annual contract value has shown a pretty regular cyclicality with peaks roughly every two years or so. With the last peak in late 2016/early 2017 (and the prior ones in late 2014/early 2015, 2013, and 2011), is it absurd to consider the possibility that Check Point could soon see a cyclical re-acceleration?Of course Check Point isn’t the same business as before and past trends don’t guarantee anything about the future. The new per-user Infinity consumption model is likely going to lead to lower appliance/product sales and smooth out some of the former cyclicality, but I think it’s nevertheless worth watching for signs of improving momentum in the business, particularly as there is some evidence that a sizable percentage of Check Point customers still run on older architectures.There’s still work for Check Point management to do, and Check Point management itself has pointed out that it is re-orienting its sales effort to focus more on architectural sales. I also believe Check Point may not do the best job of highlighting its strengths – while I think Palo Alto has superior single-pass architecture, Check Point’s management features are excellent and I believe there are customers for whom that could be a significant selling point.Whatever the case, my underlying assumptions haven’t changed all that much from a modeling perspective. I am looking for revenue growth to accelerate in 2019 and 2020 relative to 2018, but I think long-term revenue growth is likely to remain on the lower side (around 4%). Margins should remain strong, though, and I expect Check Point to continue reaping excellent cash flow from its business (a business that features substantial recurring revenue).I think Check Point is more or less fairly valued here, but still capable of producing a high single-digit annualized return. A pullback closer to $100 would certainly make for an easier call, but I’m leaning positive as is with my expectation that the company could see some cyclical re-acceleration. That said, sales force issues and weak revenue growth have dogged this company for a while and if the company disappoints in the next couple of quarters, I expect the shares to take a hit."
4216186,104608,2018-10-30T20:50:32-04:00,Check Point reported rather lackluster Q3 earnings with no real excitement.Revenue growth of 4% for the quarter and 3% for the year continues to demonstrate the company losing market share.Relative valuation based on forward revenue grossly overvalues the company.,"Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP), one of the legacy IT security players still in the market, remains overvalued even after reporting mediocre Q3 results. The company continues to lose share to faster-growing firewall and cloud security players with management committed to spending more on their sales force in order to capture more market share.In a world where security is moving away from on-premise operations, legacy players such as CHKP could be left behind. Though the company has remained competitive in today's market, it continues to lose share, as revenue increased a mere 4% this past quarter. Shares continue to tread along, remaining near the high end of valuation ranges for comparable security players.CHKP data by YChartsCHKP is down ~7% from its recent highs, but so is the overall market. Over the past few months, we have seen several higher-valued names across the tech world take a beating as investors reposition their growth names and take profits off the table. CHKP was not one of those names bleeding, but rather, it maintained its status quo. Investors are paying an expensive multiple to own this legacy name growing revenue in the low-/mid-single digits compared to 20%+ growth seen in other security names.CHKP is an IT security solutions provider focusing on areas such as network security, endpoint security, mobile security, data security and security management. It is considered one of the legacy players in the security market and has faced intense competition over the past few years. While CHKP provides efficient and effective IT security tools, it should not be valued on a revenue multiple, and investors should focus more on its earnings multiple.The main areas CHKP competes in has seen a rise in new competition from companies that solely focus on a specific area of IT security. Network security has become very saturated by four main players: Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) and CHKP. Competitors are growing at a much quicker rate, thus taking market share from the company. This area of the IT security market continues to grow mid-single digits each year and is one of CHKP's main focus areas.Data security will always remain a competitive industry. We keep seeing data breaches occur on what seems like a daily basis. Enterprises are becoming more protective about their data, and recent regulation in Europe, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), brings hefty fines for enterprises that are found in violation of user data protection.CHKP did complete the acquisition of Dome9, enhancing its Infinity architecture and cloud security offerings. Dome9 provides cloud-native security capabilities, including intuitive visualization of security posture, compliance and governance automation, privileged identity protection and cloud traffic and event analysis, enabling cloud deployments safer and more manageable (Source: Company Website). In what appears to be a very late attempt at improving its cloud security, CHKP continues to be well behind cloud security leaders such as Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW), Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) and even Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).It was interesting to hear management's commentary on the call as they discussed their need to increase the number of sales representatives and improve productivity within their sales force. In my opinion, this demonstrates management's willingness to spend more in S&M in order to improve the company's competitive positioning.CHKP continues to lose share in the firewall market to players such as FTNT, PANW, CSCO and emerging cloud security leader ZS, which reinforces the need for R&D spend. The company's lackluster Q3 earnings were right down the fairway with nothing exciting to look forward to.CHKP reported Q3 revenue of $471 million, growing 4% y/y, which was above the midpoint of its guidance and beat consensus expectations for $466 million. Non-GAAP operating margins remained healthy at 54.9% but contracted compared to 55.2% last year.(Source: Company Presentation)EPS was $1.38 increased 6% y/y and beat consensus estimates of $1.36. One point which was very impressive was CHKP's billings, which came in at $460.8 million compared to consensus estimates of $446 million. The big billings beat demonstrates that the company has a solid pipeline of future revenue streams over the next 12 months.In addition, CHKP repurchased 2.6 million shares for about $300 million during the quarter. Share repurchase are a fantastic way for a company to inflate its EPS, as there would be a lower denominator in the equation. Over the long term, I would expect share repurchases to continue, as the company generates relatively consistent cash flows and the share price has recently dipped.CHKP breaks down its revenue into three main segments: Product, Subscription and Maintenance. Maintenance revenue represented over 45% of Q3 total revenue and grew 3.7% y/y, slightly below overall growth. This revenue stream is highly correlation with Product revenue growth. As companies purchase more product from CHKP, there will be an increased need for maintenance operations. Thus, a slowdown in Product revenue will likely have a negative material impact on maintenance revenue.Product revenue, which represented ~25% of the total, decreased 5.9% y/y in Q3. Going back to the Q1 call, management noted IT spending is seasonally down in the first half of the year and expected positive Product growth during the second half of the year. The near-6% decline in product revenue demonstrates either one of two things: either the security market is declining (which we know is not true given significant growth rates seen from other legacy and emerging security vendors), or CHKP is losing significant share.Finally, Subscription revenue, which represents ~30% of total, continues to grow at an impressive rate, at 13% for Q3. The $136 million in Security Subscription revenue beat consensus estimates by nearly $3 million. The key takeaway here is that CHKP continues to move away from legacy on-premise security products (found in the declining Product segment) and towards cloud-based subscription models.CHKP has underperformed the market this year and is well below comparable IT security companies. This is relatively warranted given its much slower growth rate and fears that it would keep losing market share. As the security market consistently grows at high rates, CHKP does not.CHKP data by YChartsTypically, companies with strong, consistent gross and operating margins like CHKP should be valued on earnings or EBITDA. However, when looking at their revenue multiple, something seems off. Software companies with high growth rates and little-to-no earnings typically trade at premium revenue multiples, not legacy security companies slowly transitioning to cloud-based sales.CHKP EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsIt is challenging to reason why CHKP is trading at such a premium forward revenue multiple compared to other leading security players which have a much better positioning in cloud security. FTNT, PANW and even CSCO have better software security offerings and have done a better job transitioning to the cloud. Management did note they will look to spend more in the sales force and make improvement in an effort to accelerate revenue, but even if revenue growth doubled to ~8%, this would remain well behind the competitors.Through Q3, CHKP generated ~$1.4 billion in sales, and management is guiding to $500-528 million in revenue for Q4. Given the company has done a good job coming in at the high end of guidance, I am assuming Q4 revenue of $525 million, bringing FY18 revenue to ~$1.95 billion. Though revenue growth has been just over 3% though the first three quarters, I am going on a bender and assume revenue will accelerate to 7% for FY19, leading to revenue of ~$2.1 billion.Given the current market cap of $17.2 billion and net cash of $4 billion at the end of Q3, CHKP has an enterprise value of ~$13.2 billion. I do not believe the company is deserving of the 8x revenue multiple it currently trades at and believe this multiple will compress closer to 5-6x over the next year.A 5.5x revenue multiple using my relatively aggressive $2.1 billion in FY19 leads to an enterprise value of $11.6 billion. Adding back the ~$4 billion of cash gives me a projected enterprise value of $15.6 billion. CHKP has ~159 million shares outstanding, resulting in a target price of ~$98, a 10% downside to Friday's closing price.I believe the company will continue to repurchase shares throughout the next 18 months. However, my aggressive revenue growth projection (over 2x year-to-date growth!) more than makes up for share repurchases.Some risks to this thesis included CHKP's ability to maintain customers because of its legacy operations. Competition in the security market continues to increase, and the transition to cloud-based security subscriptions could prove to be challenging to CHKP's revenue growth."

Analysts expect the Israeli-based company to report earnings of $1.31 per share on revenue of $471.09 million. The company earned $1.30 per share in the first quarter of 2018, so earnings are expected to grow by a penny per share on a year-over-year basis.Over the last three years, Check Point has seen its earnings grow at a rate of 12% per year and the company saw its EPS grow by 6% in the fourth quarter. Sales are expected to grow by 4.1% for the quarter and that is right in line with the sales growth in the fourth quarter. Sales have grown at an annual rate of 6% per year over the last three years.While the earnings and sales haven’t grown as well as other companies in the software industry, the company’s management efficiency ratings are well above average. Check Point boasts a return on equity of 24.7% and a return on assets of 10.1%. The profit margin is at 56.4% and the operating margin is at 47.7%.It is also worth noting that Check Point doesn’t have any long-term debt at this time, and if we do see a global economic slowdown, it can help a company cope with slower sales if there aren’t any long-term debt payments to be made. Check Point has been able to grow its revenue incrementally over the last four years, growing revenue from $1.4 to $1.5 and then $1.6 and $1.7 in 2018.Looking at the overall results of the fundamental measurements of the company, Check Point has been pretty solid in the last few years. However, the chart is even more impressive in my opinion.The stock consolidated between $105 and $95 during the first half of 2018 before it broke out in the third quarter. The stock then retreated with global stocks during the fourth quarter, but it has rebounded in an impressive way. From the December low to the close on April 12, the stock is up 32.3%.A rather wide trend channel has formed on Check Point over the last few years, with the highs from mid-2017 and late 2017 forming the upper rail. The lower rail is formed by connecting the lows from 2016, the first half of 2018, and the low in December. The stock isn’t quite up to its upper rail yet, so it could still have some room to move up.The rally off the lower rail from the low in December has moved the weekly stochastic readings from oversold territory to overbought territory. The 10-week RSI wasn’t quite in oversold territory in December, but it has reached overbought territory at this time. Looking back at the beginning of 2017, we see that both of the oscillators were in overbought territory for almost the entire first half of the year.When I started researching Check Point for this report, I was shocked at how bearish the sentiment was and that got me excited to write about it. There are currently 36 analysts following the stock and only 10 rank the stock as a “buy”. There are 25 “hold” ratings and one “sell” rating. I have mentioned it many times before, but it is worth repeating. When a company has solid fundamentals and a decent looking chart, we usually see 65 to 75% of ratings in the buy category. For Check Point, only 27.8% of the ratings fall into the buy column.The short interest ratio is also showing extreme pessimism toward the stock with a current reading of 8.9. The ratio has been elevated for several months now with readings above 7.0 since the end of October. The number of shares sold short has remained relatively constant over the last five months, with the number of shares sold short holding between 7.2 million and 8.5 million. The ratio has vacillated more because of the average daily trading volume as a result.The put/call ratio for Check Point is also showing signs of pessimism. There are 15,259 puts open at this time and 10,754 calls open. This puts the ratio at 1.42 and that is well above the 1.0 level that I consider a sign of pessimism. The value of the high ratio does lose a little relevancy when we consider that the total open interest represents less than two days of average daily volume.What we see from the sentiment indicators is a great deal of pessimism toward Check Point and that pessimism doesn’t seem to be warranted. The only areas where the company is below average are the earnings growth and the sales growth.I see lots to like about Check Point as a long-term investment. The overall fundamentals are strong, the price performance has been better than most stocks, and the sentiment is far more bearish than it should be.The biggest concern I have is the overbought levels on the weekly overbought/oversold indicators, but as I pointed out, those indicators were in overbought territory for the entire first half of 2017 and the stock kept rising.Check Point has beaten its earnings estimates in each of the last 10 earnings reports, but that hasn’t always led to a jump in the stock. In the last year, we have seen a gap higher, a gap lower, and two relatively muted reactions. When it gapped lower, the stock consolidated for a few months before taking off. When it gapped higher, the stock pulled back a few days later.Given the reactions to earnings and how the stock has performed in the days following, I don’t think you have to buy Check Point ahead of the earnings report. But given the extremely negative sentiment readings, I think it is far more likely that the stock moves higher after earnings. If you are looking to trade it, I would look to go long with some call options. If you are you looking for a long-term investment in the stock, I would wait until after the report to buy the stock."
4211212,20521,2018-10-11T18:30:12-04:00,Competition is tough in the cybersecurity market and Check Point appears to be struggling to keep pace with the competition.Check Point saw its share of the market fall from 12.5% in the first quarter of 2017 to 11.5% in the first quarter of 2018.Palo Alto and Cisco are racing at a faster pace ahead of Check Point.,"According to a recent Visiongain report, the global cybersecurity market is expected to generate $98.8 billion in revenues in 2018 driven by increasing cyber attacks, coupled with a higher penetration of cloud, mobility, and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) trends. Tel Aviv, Israel-based, Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP) is seeing strong traction in the segment.Founded in 1993 by Gil Shwed, Check Point was known to be the pioneer in the FireWall-1 and the Stateful inspection technology. Since its inception, the company's products have helped secure its customers against Internet-based threats using an innovative Software Blade architecture that provides customizable, yet inexpensive, security solutions. Over the past 15 years, Check Point has added several capabilities through acquisitions including the security appliance business from Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and the application database from FaceTime Communications. Today, its customer list spans various industries, organization sizes, and regions.Check Point recently reported second-quarter results. Revenues for the quarter grew 2% to $467.8 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $460.9 million. It reported earnings of $197.7 million or $1.24 per share. On an adjusted basis, it delivered an EPS of $1.37, which also was ahead of the market's forecast of $1.31.By segment, Security subscription revenues grew 12% to $132.1 million. Revenues from the products division fell 9% during the year to $125.7 million. Software updates and maintenance revenues increased 4% to $210 million.Geographically, the Americas accounted for 48% of the quarter's revenues, followed by Europe's 36% share. Asia Pacific, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa accounted for the remaining 16%.Among key metrics, the number of new customers who signed deals of more than $1 million grew to 58 and customers who signed deals worth $50,000 and more accounted for 76% of the total order value.For the current quarter, Check Point forecasts revenues of $454-474 million with an adjusted EPS of $1.30-1.40. It expects to end the current year with revenues of $1.85-1.93 billion and an EPS of $5.45-5.75. The Street has forecast revenues of $466 million for the current quarter with an EPS of $1.36. It expects the company to end the year with revenues of $1.9 billion and an EPS of $5.67.Competition is tough in the cybersecurity market and Check Point appears to be struggling to keep pace with this competition. According to a recent IDC research report, the worldwide security appliance market is dominated by Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which accounted for 16.4% of the market in the first quarter of the year. Cisco's position has remained unchanged over the year, but its market share has grown from 15.3% a year ago. Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) is the second largest player with 13.9% market share compared with 12.8% share a year ago. Check Point, meanwhile, saw its share reduce from 12.5% in the first quarter of 2017 to 11.5% in the first quarter of 2018. Palo Alto and Cisco are racing at a faster pace ahead of Check Point.To address these concerns, Check Point recently entered into an agreement with BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) that will allow it to deliver joint go-to-market planning and selling of Check Point's mobile threat defense solution called SandBlast Mobile, along with BlackBerry UEM and BlackBerry Dynamics. The agreement will help deliver streamlined customer experience and improve service delivery by allowing BlackBerry to resell and serve as a single point of contact for professional services and support.Check Point also is addressing security concerns through product upgrades. It recently announced the launch of its new 23900 security gateway that will set a new standard of protection against the fifth-generation of cyber-attacks targeting enterprise and data center networks. Check Point 23000 family integrates comprehensive threat prevention with purpose-built hardware to deliver maximum security performance.There are quite a few security players out there for organizations to choose from. I would like to understand from users about the key parameters that they consider when they choose their security vendor. What makes them choose Check Point over others? What can Check Point do to gain more customers?Check Point's stock is currently trading at $114.34 with a market capitalization of $17.9 billion. It had touched a 52-week high of $120.81 earlier last month. It has recovered from a 52-week low of $93.76 that it had fallen to in May this year."
4255441,104537,2019-04-19T06:27:20-04:00,"Check Point reported Q1 earnings slightly better than the midpoint of the guidance.The company still expects to lose market share despite the ramp-up of its sales and marketing efforts.After the drop in the stock price, the market values the company at a fair price.","Check Point Software (CHKP) reported Q1 earnings above the midpoint of the guidance. Also, management confirmed the outlook for the full year.Despite the lack of negative results, the stock price dropped 7.37%. Considering the stock price increase over the last few weeks, the market reaction isn't that significant.This quarter confirms the company will still lose market share despite its efforts with sales and marketing activities.Even with the increasing expenses and the full contribution of acquisitions, operating margins are still impressive, though. But, taking into account the expected revenue growth, the company is fairly valued.Source: Check Point (security gateway appliance)During Q1, revenue and non-GAAP EPS grew 4% and 2%, respectively. The ramp-up of sales and marketing efforts explains a part of the lower EPS growth compared to revenue growth. Full contributions of Dome9 and ForceNock acquisitions are the other reasons for lower EPS growth.These results exceeded the midpoint of the guidance, but the stock price dropped 7.37% following the release of the earnings.Data by YChartsIn a broader context, the market reaction isn't that significant. The stock price is still in the high end of its range over the last 12 months.I interpret the market's reaction as a return to fair valuation due to the lack of a positive surprise.Over the last few years, the company has been growing at a slower rate compared to pure security players like Fortinet (FTNT) and Palo Alto (PANW).Data by YChartsCheck Point is also losing global market share as the security market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR above 10% over the next several years. The market growth rate estimates depend on the studies and their scopes. But the point is the company is far from reaching the global IT security market growth.Over the last few quarters, management ramped up sales and marketing efforts. The graph below shows the company is increasing its marketing expenses as a percentage of sales. In contrast, Fortinet and Palo Alto are decreasing their sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue.Source: YChartsDespite this opposite trend between Check Point and its competitors, Check Point still spends a much smaller percentage of sales and marketing expenses. During the Q1 earnings call, management indicated that the ramp-up of sales and marketing efforts was over and the results would materialize in the next few quarters.But the full-year guidance, confirmed during the earnings call, doesn't show any sign of significant revenue growth. Considering the midpoint of the guidance, full-year revenue should grow by about 4.8%. It's an improvement compared to the revenue growth of 2.71% in 2018. But the forecasted revenue growth is still lagging the IT security market growth. The expected growth is also below the revenue growth Check Point reported over the last several years before 2018.Source: Author, based on company reports and guidanceIn the short term, progress still needs to materialize in the U.S. with the increased sales force. Thus, management expects the midpoint of the Q2 non-GAAP EPS to be 0.7% lower than last year at $1.36 despite an expected 4.1% revenue growth.Despite the challenges, the company still delivered an impressive operating margin. During Q1, non-GAAP and GAAP operating income margins were 50% and 44%, respectively.With the confirmed guidance for the full year, the midpoint of the expected revenue is $1.990 billion.Considering the 2019 forecasted revenue, the EV/Sales ratio is high at 7.2. In contrast with other high-growth IT security companies, this high ratio is due to the high operating margin.The midpoints of the non-GAAP and GAAP EPS are expected to be $6.0 and $5.3, respectively. As I explained in several articles, I take into account the GAAP earnings instead of the non-GAAP earnings. Stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets represent real expenses to the shareholders.With the 2019 GAAP EPS of $5.3, the market values the company at a PE ratio of about 22.6x. The PE ratio ex-cash is approximately 17.6x.Considering the moderate growth rate, I estimate the company is fairly valued.The company delivered Q1 results slightly above the midpoint of the guidance. The drop in stock price after the release of the earnings is due to the lack of positive news and a return to fair valuation.Management confirmed the guidance, which means the company will still lose IT security market share with a 4.8% expected revenue growth.Considering the moderate growth, I estimate the market fairly values the company at a PE ratio ex-cash of about 17.6x.Note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on my latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4187427,104608,2018-07-16T07:23:59-04:00,"Check Point is a legacy security player growing at a much slower rate compared to other competitors.Current valuation metrics uses a revenue multiple, whereas an earnings or cash flow multiple is more appropriate.Competitive forces places significant headwinds on the company's operations, and upcoming earnings could be a downward catalyst.","Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP), one of the legacy IT security players still in the market, has become overvalued in the past few weeks as investors continue to focus on their increasing revenue multiple. CHKP is overvalued on this basis, and investors should be focused on their earnings or EBITDA multiple as a proxy for appropriate valuation.This difference in valuation metrics leads to increased downside risks. This, in addition to an increasingly competitive security industry, has placed a ton of pressure on the company's business model, however, CHKP has appreciated over 10% in the past few weeks. It reports earnings on July 25, and I believe that due to increased competitive factors, CHKP will face a downward trend pre and post earnings.CHKP is an IT security solutions provider focusing on areas such as network security, endpoint security, mobile security, data security and security management. It is considered one of the legacy players in the security market and has faced intense competition over the past few years. While CHKP provides efficient and effective IT security tools, it should not be valued on a revenue multiple, and investors should focus more on its earnings multiple.The main areas CHKP competes in has seen a rise in new competition from companies that solely focus on a specific area of IT security. Network security has become very saturated by four main players: Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), and Check Point. CHKP's competitors are growing at a much quick rate, thus implying they are all taking market share from the company. This area of the IT security market continues to grow mid-singe digits each year and is one of CHKP's main focus areas.However, some of the other areas CHKP competes in has new competitors, giving increased headwinds to the company's business model. Carbon Black (NASDAQ:CBLK) recently went public and is considered one of the leading endpoint security market players. I wrote an article on CBLK a few weeks ago which takes a deeper dive into the endpoint security market. The mobile security market has continued to increase in competition due to the rise in the use of endpoints to conduct business.Data security will always remain a competitive industry. We continue to see data breaches occur on what seems like a daily basis. Enterprises are becoming more protective about their data, and recent regulation in Europe, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), brings hefty fines for enterprises which are found in violation of user data protection.Since reporting Q1 earnings in late April, Check Point has remained relatively flat. Its earnings release was modest at best, with downward revisions to Q2 and FY18 expectations. Management has noted for the past several quarters the continued challenges the company is facing with sales execution, and this does not seem like it will go away anytime soon. CHKP will report its earnings on July 25, and I believe the stock will face a downward trend heading into and after the report.CHKP is a slower-growing tech company, albeit it has fantastic gross and operating margins. Despite passing the industry standard Rule of 40, the company’s valuations seem a bit pricy considering its growth prospects. CHKP will continue to be a leader in the IT security industry, however, it is overvalued and due for another correction and stagnant price movements. Currently trading at over XXXx FY18 estimated revenue, the company should be valued off of earnings and definitely not at a premium.In April, CHKP reported a soft Q1 and made downward revisions to its Q2 and FY18 expectations. Revenue grew under 4% y/y, while gross margins increased from 88.3% to 90.1%. CHKP continues to maintain high and marginally increasing gross margins because of its software and subscription-based offerings. These offerings have very little input costs, and as exemplified by its gross margins, a dollar of sales is nearly a dollar of gross profit. The small 4% revenue growth was facing a tough 7.7% revenue growth comp from last year.Non-GAAP EPS grew 8% to $1.30 from $1.20 the year prior. EPS was able to grow ahead of revenue growth because of slight gross and operating margin expansion. Despite what appeared to be somewhat moderate growth, CHKP’s revenue of $452.3 million and EPS of $1.30 were in line with consensus estimates.CHKP breaks down its revenue into three main segments: Product, Subscription, and Maintenance. Maintenance revenue represented over 45% of total as of the Q1 report and grew 5% y/y, slightly above overall growth. This revenue stream is highly correlation with Product revenue growth. As companies purchase more product from CHKP, there will be an increased need for maintenance operations. Thus, a slowdown in Product revenue will likely have negative material impact on maintenance revenue. Product revenue, which represented ~25% of the total, decreased 6% y/y in Q1. Management attributed this decrease to a historically weaker Q1, as companies' IT spend is typically down during this part of the year. Management did offer its expectations for positive Product growth during the back half of the year.Finally, Subscription revenue, which represents ~30% of total, grew at an impressive 14% y/y. However, this figure was slightly below consensus estimates. CHKP altered its operating model by switching from offering “bundled” security products to individual subscription-based products. Typically, the bundled product would include several necessary security offerings in a longer-term contract. Revenue from these contracts were typically stronger and longer in duration compared to the company's annual subscription based offerings.Management guided a much softer Q2 with revenues in the range of $445-475 million and EPS of $1.25-1.35, well below consensus estimates, even at the high end. This implies revenue growth of 3-4%. In addition, management guided FY18 revenue to $1,850-1,930 million and EPS of $5.45-5.75, again, well below consensus estimates. This implies revenue growth of roughly 0-4%.Initially, the stock dropped from ~$102 to ~$97, about a 5% decrease. Since the initial drop, the stock has traded flat and is currently trading at $109.31 as of Monday's close. Investors were definitely right about getting out of their CHKP positions post-earnings report; however, the stock is prime for another disappointing Q2 earnings release, and investors should be cautious.Q2 will be another struggle for CHKP, for two main reasons. First, it is facing even tougher comps from last year, which will make guided revenue growth of 3-4% even more challenging. Second, management continues to address the company's sales force execution issues, which I believe will continue to persist and place increased headwinds on revenue growth.The upcoming Q2 is facing a tough comp of 8.5% revenue growth last year. FY17 revenue growth amounted to 6.5%, with Q2 being the company's best-performing quarter. While IT spend is generally higher in Q2, the competitive landscape for IT security companies has only increased over the past year. Security tends to be dominated by the four main players: Cisco, Palo Alto, Fortinet, and Check Point. Aside from CHKP, the three other competitors have seen significant growth in their security business, easily surpassing CHKP’s 6.5% growth last year and are all on pace to eclipse its growth this year. As the other three competitors continue to take market share, CHKP is challenged by the current competitive environment despite the strong global IT spending.The other downside risks revolves around the company sales force execution, or lack thereof, especially within its Americas geographical segment. Based on deferred revenue, the Americas segment represented 47% of total, compared to 36% in Europe and 17% from Asia-Pacific, Japan, the Middle East, and Africa. The large Americas revenue concentration places even more pressure on perfecting its broken sales force immediately. During the Q1 conference call, management said, “Changing sales execution takes longer than what I'd like... our overall sales are softer than what I would have hoped to see. It will also slightly reduce our projection for the remainder of the year”.Assuming the sales force execution is incrementally better, management alluded to a multi-quarter rehabilitation effort to get execution to a more desired level. Any execution progress ahead of plan adds to CHKP’s upside potential; however, another quarter of disappointing sales execution, especially within its largest geographical segment, the Americas, would create heightened downward pressure on the stock.CHKP has underperformed the market this year and is well below comparable IT security companies. CHKP is up 6% YTD and down 4% over the past year, compared to the relative performance of CSCO (+9% YTD / +33% TTM), PANW (+49% YTD / +55% TTM), and FTNT (+52% YTD / +66% TTM).CHKP data by YChartsBecause CHKP has very strong and consistent margins (GM approaching 90% and OM near 50%), it should be valued off an earnings or EBITDA multiple. A revenue multiple for a software company is more appropriate when it is growing at faster rates and is not able to produce consistent and predictable cash flows. CHKP’s ~4% projected revenue growth and margin trends do not quite fit this stature. Both PANW and FTNT are more appropriate based on a revenue multiple, as they have negative/inconsistent earnings.For a comparable approach, I choose relatively larger IT security players, such as Cisco, Symantec (SYMC), Juniper (NYSE:JNPR), and F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV). All of these players are well-established and are growing at a more similar revenue growth rate.CHKP PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsWhen looking at EPS, I viewed management’s FY18 guidance of $5.45-5.75 and took the low end as a conservative estimate. CHKP currently trades at a P/E of ~20.0x, which compares to a customized peer average of 16.0x.When taking a high level view of cash flow, we can estimate this from management’s revenue guidance and the company’s historically consistent OM margin. Taking the FY18 revenue guidance of $1,850-1,930 million and historical OM margin of ~50%, we can conclude EBIT should be in the range of $925-965 million. Depreciation and amortization has averaged 2% of revenue over the past three years, resulting in an estimated EBITDA of ~$980 million using the mid-point EBIT estimate.CHKP EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YChartsWith 161.7 million shares and a current price of $109.31, we get a market cap of $17.7 billion, and adding in CHKP’s net cash balance of $1.5 billion gives us a current enterprise value of $19.2 billion. Using our estimated $980 million EBITDA, it currently trades at an EBITDA multiple of 19.6x. The above chart shows a forward EBITDA multiple of 15.6x, which is based on consensus NTM forward estimates, whereas I used FY18 management guidance. The selected peer group average EV/EBITDA multiple is 9.4x, a significant discount to CHKP's 15.6x multiple.CHKP trades at a premium on both P/E (19.5x versus peer group of 16.0x) and EV/EBITDA (15.6x versus peer group of 9.4x). I used a blended average of both P/E and EV/EBITDA multiple valuations to come up with a more appropriate price target. Using a P/E of 18.0x, about the midpoint between CHKP's multiple and the peer group average, this leads to a price target of ~$98. Using a similar methodology for EV/EBITDA, with a ~15.0x multiple, we come to a price target of ~$82. An average of the two multiples gives us a price target of ~$90, which still gives CHKP a premium valuation multiple compared to the selected peer group. This represents ~18% downside.Based on the peer group P/E and EBITDA multiples averages, the company still has a lot of downside risks not priced in. Even giving CHKP premium multiple valuations, they are still overpriced at current levels, and the recent 10% run-up in price over the past few weeks gives investors a great opportunity to either right-size their positions or take advantage of the downside opportunity.Some risks to this thesis included CHKP's ability to maintain customers because of its legacy operations. A strong Q2 earnings could send the stock up and gain positive momentum. Also, if investors continue to value the company based off a revenue multiple rather than a more appropriate earnings or EBITDA multiple, CHKP may continue to receive premium valuations."

And taking into account the Q4 guidance, the revenue growth is slowing down in 2018 compared to the previous years.Source: author, based on company reportsThe products segment is still declining. This trend is due to the growth of the subscription businesses for security solutions.Despite higher revenue, the company recorded a lower cost of revenue. But the operating margin dropped from 55% to 53% because of higher selling and marketing expenses during Q3 2018 to support growth.Management has announced this strategy during Q1 2018:- Gil Shwed, CEOSource: conference call Q1 2018But with sales and marketing representing 26.4% of revenue, the company is still spending a much lower part of its revenue compared to Palo Alto and Fortinet. These companies spend more than 40% of their revenue on sales and marketing expenses to gain market share at a high pace.Management stated:- Tal Payne, CFO and COOSource: Q3 2018 earnings call And the 11% growth of deferred revenue indicates the revenue would keep on increasing during the next few quarters.With the mid-range of the Q4 revenue guidance, I estimate the net income for 2018 at about $799 million. Management mentioned that tariffs won't have any impact.Source: author, based on company reportsManagement also indicated the Dome9 acquisition would not have a meaningful impact on Q4 revenue. For the estimation of the net income, I ignore the $175 million one-time costs related to the acquisition. I also prefer to take into account a tax rate of 18% instead of the 10%-12% range provided in the guidance to better reflect the real earnings potential.Thus, the valuation does not change compared to the last quarter.Source: author, based on company reportsThe EV/Sales ratio above 7 is high. But with an impressive net margin above 40% and with an important cash position, the PE ratio ex-cash amounts to 16.8.Considering the slow growth profile in a security market that is growing at about 8% per year, the company is fairly valued.Check Point reported better Q3 results than expected.

However, these results constitute a positive sign that will have to be confirmed in the next few quarters.The market positively reacted, offering a share price that I estimate slightly overvalued considering the uncertainties and the aggressive competition.Despite a tough comparison with last year's Q2 results, the revenue growth matched the top of the management guidance, progressing by 2%. Moreover, the 9% progression of deferred revenues constitutes a positive sign for the next earnings.The extract below shows that product and licenses dropped by 9.1% compared to the same quarter last year. Source: press release Q2 2018By contrast, subscriptions and maintenance services took the opposite direction, growing by 12%. The evolution of these segments was expected as more and more customers move away from products to adopt subscriptions services.Besides these accounting results, the management has insisted during the conference call on several important multi-year deals that are not accounted for - in deferred revenues - yet.Although the management does not give the amplitude of these bookings, they certainly counter balance the slight drop of long term deferred revenues highlighted on the balance sheet below.Source: press release Q2 2018The booking varies quarters by quarters and it will be interesting to follow the management communication about the booking during Q3 and Q4 earnings. Strong booking will obviously confirm the return to solid growth. For now, it is too early to say.Cash flow from operations dropped, but not for alarming reasons: the decrease is related to a combination of currency effects, sales and marketing efforts ahead of growth, and multi-years contracts not accounted for, yet.In my previous article about Check Point, I had mentioned the sales and marketing issues the company is facing. This quarter, the management has scaled up sales and marketing expenses as they now represent 26.6% of revenues against 25% in Q2 2017.During the conference call, the management has confirmed increasing the sales and marketing headcount, as planned.Although this evolution constitutes an encouraging sign that the management is taking care of these challenges, the progress against the additional marketing and sales expenses will have to be confirmed by driving revenue growth on the medium term.Besides the operational results, the company has continued to buy back shares at the same pace as the last quarters by purchasing 2.5 million shares for $250M.In addition to extending the authorized amount for share buybacks, the management has raised the limit of quarterly purchases from $250M to $325M, signaling ambitious future share buy backs.During the conference call, the management has confirmed the strong buyback policy, but stays open for acquisitions. The company can indeed afford both with a $4B net cash position.The management maintained the outlook for the FY 2018.Source: conference call Q1 2018The market appreciates the Q2 2018 results as the share price is rising 4.18% against 0.19% for the Nasdaq.With a $115.52 share price and 159,669,000 fully diluted shares, the market cap amounts to $18.45B. Deducting the $4B net cash gives an EV of $14.45B.Not taking into account the $4B cash and considering 2018 GAAP EPS at $5, the market attributes a PER of 18.1. The EV/sales ratio amounts to 7.6.As always with Check Point, the PER looks modest compared to the elevated EV/sales ratio, but the impressive 40%+ net margin explains this asymmetry.Considering that the growth is still below the market growth rate, these positive results must be confirmed. And taking into account the aggressive competition focused on revenue growth, the market seems to slightly overvalue the company.Palo Alto (PANW), Fortinet (FNET), and Cisco (CSCO) will announce their results in the next few weeks, providing more color on the security landscape to measure the progress of Check Point against these competitors.In addition to Q2 2018 results slightly above expectations, Check Point has communicated encouraging booking and multi-year deals. As a consequence, the market positively reacted.In addition to showing improvements this quarter, the company will have to confirm these results. Considering the uncertainties around growth and competition, the market seems to slightly overvalue Check Point."

I would consider buying shares at a price below $75.","I started my previous career as an IT engineer with a first job consisting of making sure that an IP Telephony application would be compatible with most of the network topologies. In order to fulfill this mission, the company I worked for provided a lab with the most popular network and security equipment. This was my first experience with a real commercial firewall and it was a Check Point (CHKP) device. That was 17 years ago.Today, Check Point is still a leading IT security company. However, it is losing market shares to aggressive competitors such as Palo Alto (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT).The share price evolution shows that the market acknowledges these difficulties.Source: SEEKING ALPHACheck Point, based in Israel, was founded in 1993 by Gil Shwed, the current CEO, who owns 19% of the company.Like competitors, Check Point proposes cloud and network security solutions with an emphasis on the integrated and automated functionalities. The company sells products (hardware and licences) and services (subscriptions and maintenance), as shown on the table below.Source: Annual report 2017In an 8% CAGR security market, where Palo Alto and Fortinet have been growing revenues, respectively, at 47% and 25% CAGR over the last few years, Check Point has been growing revenues at less than 7%, as shown on the table below.Source: Author, based on annual reports.Obviously, despite growing revenues, Check Point has slowly been losing market share.However, the company has shown impressive margins. For instance, net margins consistently stay in the range of 40-45%. Revenues and net income have been slowly and steadily growing while shares outstanding has been diminishing. As a consequence, EPS has been steadily progressing. The table below shows the corresponding data from the income statement.Source: Annual report 2017The diminution of the number of shares by 16% between 2013 and 2017 is related to the limited share-based compensation (SBC) and the regular buyback of shares with the cash that the company generates.Compared to other security vendors, SBC is very limited with less than 5% of the revenues, as shown on the table below.Source: Annual report 2017The extract of the cash flow statement below highlights the buyback activities of the company, with roughly $1B per year.Source: Annual report 2017The balance sheet below is clean with no debt and $4B of cash. Deferred revenues constitute an important part of liabilities. The goodwill represents 15% of the assets, which is reasonable.Source: Q1 2018The market does not like the fact that the company is losing market share to competitors who spend much more money - in absolute and relative terms - on marketing and sales.The table below shows the proportion of expenses for Check Point.Source: Annual report 2017With 23% of revenues, the company's sales and marketing expenses look poor compared to Palo Alto and Fortinet with about 50% and 45% of revenues, respectively.As a side note, research and development expenses represent 10% of revenues against 20% and 14% for Palo Alto and Fortinet, respectively. Due to its location in Israel, Check Point is benefiting from lower R&D costs. The table below compares the R&D resources between Check Point and Palo Alto.Source: Author, based on annual reportsBy all measures, R&D expenses are lower for Check Point, with almost twice as many employees as Palo Alto. In my opinion, this constitutes a huge advantage.Sales and marketing being more global, Check Point does not profit from the same R&D cost edge. The table below compares the sales and marketing expenses of security companies against their respective revenue growth over the last few years.Source: Author, based on annual reportsIt seems that, by raising sales and marketing to 30% of revenues, Check Point could easily match the 8% market growth.The management and has been discussing the issue during previous conference calls. The CEO has indicated that the company had been raising and reorganizing sales and marketing resources.Source: conference call Q1 2018As a result, sales and marketing expenses represented 26.5% of revenues in Q1 2018 against 23% in 2017.Answering to an analyst about sales and marketing expenses for the next few years, the CEO mentioned a controlled increase in spending.Source: conference call Q1 2018, Q&A sessionConsidering the discussion above, I assume that sales and marketing expenses at 30% of revenues will generate 8% revenue growth, corresponding to the market growth.With the regularity of the company, I suppose that everything else stays stable; therefore, I assume that the net margin dropped by 7% to 36% due to the 7% increase of marketing and sales expenses. In order to be conservative, I ignore the small positive tax impact.In addition, with the guidance from the management, I consider $1.9B of sales for 2018.Source: conference call Q1 2018With a share price of $102.81 and 161,711,000 fully diluted shares, the market cap amounts to $16.62B. Adding the net cash of $4B gives an EV of $12.62B.EV/Sales = $12.62B / $1.9B = 6.6PER (ex cash) = ($16.62B - $4B) / ($1.9B * 36%) = 18.5Due to the growth of deferred revenues, free cash flow is slightly higher than net income, allowing close to $0.9B of annual return to shareholders via net share buyback.The market seems to fairly value the company, taking into account its modest growth, its stability, and its management aligned with shareholders. I would consider buying some shares at a PER below 12, corresponding to a market capitalization of $12.2B and a share price of $75.Despite growing, Check Point has been losing market share during the last couple of years. The company did not keep up with aggressive sales and marketing strategies from competitors like Palo Alto and Fortinet.The management is taking measures to overcome these issues.The market seems to fairly value Check Point.

4143943,24361,2018-02-07T08:07:43-05:00,"Check Point delivered another lackluster quarter and another quarter of product revenue contraction, as sales execution issues coincide with a slowing primary market.Check Point's margins are stellar, and that's arguably part of the problem as Fortinet and Palo Alto continue to out-spend on sales and marketing and R&D.Management seems more receptive to M&A, and I'd really like to see the company pivot toward more cloud-relevant opportunities like analytics and orchestration/automation.Check Point shares do appear to offer some value here (on the basis of mid-single-digit FCF growth potential), but better revenue growth is likely key to share performance.","Normally, investors would be happy with a company that generated more than twice as much operating income growth as revenue growth and actually reduced operating expenses. But then, software isn't a normal sector and Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) isn't a normal company. In a sector where revenue growth is a major driver, Check Point's focus on expense discipline and organic/internal development hasn't been generating much revenue growth and hasn't helped the share price much next to Fortinet (FTNT), Palo Alto (PANW), or the Nasdaq.One of my biggest concerns about Check Point is that the company will keep itself lashed to the mast of a ship that's not going anywhere (traditional firewall-type security) instead of taking more aggressive steps toward growth in the evolving enterprise security world. I don't doubt that Check Point has the resources to change its trajectory, but I'm not sure it has the will. With that, although the share price/value proposition is interesting, I'm nervous about buying into a lower-growth software story, given how challenging and frustrating they can be.Although the fourth quarter is often a good one for Check Point, that was not the case this year as the company delivered its third straight set of disappointing results. Sales execution issues remain a significant issue, pushing sales in the Americas down year over year and helping to drive a modest miss on the top line.Revenue rose 4% as reported, with a 6% decline in product revenue offset by 18% growth in blade subscriptions and 6% growth in software maintenance and updates. That makes two straight quarters of -6% yoy product revenue performances and further deceleration in software blade subscriptions (which had grown at 20% or better for six straight quarters). Billings were also weak, with a 1% decline and a 6% miss relative to expectations.Gross margin improved about a half-point. Adjusted operating income was up 10%, and the operating margin expanded by three points. Operating expenses actually went down, with sales and marketing spending down 9% (and R&D spending up 6%) on a reported basis.It's weird to complain about a company generating strong operating leverage, but that's the situation Check Point finds itself in today. Market growth in the traditional firewall market has definitely slowed, with Fortinet reporting 15% overall revenue growth in the fourth quarter but just 2% product growth, and Palo Alto likewise seeing slowing growth (but still gaining share).In that environment, the significant relative underspending by Check Point on sales and marketing and R&D stands out as a concern. While Fortinet is about 80% the size of Check Point in revenue, it spent 60% more than Check Point on sales and marketing in 2017 and about 10% more on R&D. The story is broadly similar with Palo Alto, which has similar revenue but spends almost twice as much on both R&D and S&M.Bulls can defend Check Point as being a very efficiently-run company that also benefits from a long-held leadership position in firewalls, and that is certainly true, but it is also true that it takes money to make money, and this is hardly the first time that investors and analysts have worried that Check Point under-invests in its business.Given its large cash balances, its strong free cash flow generation, and some long-standing revenue/market share growth concerns, Check Point's name comes up a lot in discussions of M&A. To be fair, management has made a few deals, but they've been mostly on the smaller side. Now, management seems to be talking a little more openly about looking to do more in M&A soon.What Check Point targets should say a lot about how management views the enterprise security space. My concern is that the advent of cloud services is fundamentally changing how companies will approach security, potentially relegating the prior firewall-centric approach to a slow-growth fate. I've seen one analyst refer to firewalls as the ""future mainframes"" of the enterprise security world, and I think that is a worry to take seriously. Coupled with that is the risk that management is too tied to a vision of how the industry used to be - something that happens all too often in technology and likely explains why the big winners of a given decade are rarely among the winners of the next decade as well.Check Point's new CloudGuard suite of SaaS-delivered products sounds like a step in the right direction, as well as a per-user consumption model that could greatly simplify things for customers and direct more share-of-wallet toward Check Point. Beyond that, though, I'd really like to see Check Point step up in areas like analytics, orchestration, automation, and identity (more specific to the cloud environment). I'm thinking of companies like LogRhythm and AlienVault and other players in the security information and event management space, as I think new threats like Splunk (SPLK) could disrupt a market that is shifting toward a greater focus on identification, agility, and coordination.As is, I'm looking for around 4% long-term revenue growth and somewhat higher, but still mid-single-digit, FCF growth. Like I said, I'm not predicting doom and gloom for Check Point if nothing changes, but those cash flows still only discount back to around today's price, and I've invested in enough slower-growth, high-FCF software stories to know that that is a difficult way to generate alpha.This isn't the first slowdown or lull in Check Point's sales growth, and I don't think the situation has reached any sort of panic stage. By the same token, I don't have much use for ""analysis"" or investment rationales that go along the lines of ""well, it's always turned around in the past, and it will again this time, because … it always has in the past"".I believe Check Point needs to do more in terms of laying out a vision for how it will continue to lead in a changing enterprise security market and what it is willing to do (in terms of spending, M&A, and so on) to achieve it. I have to admit today's price/value trade-off is pretty tempting for a company I've liked for a long time, but I want more (whether that's more growth, more clarity from management, or more of a discount to fair value) before buying in with my own money."
4170844,103785,2018-05-07T15:10:16-04:00,Check Point has recently reported fairly good earnings results for 2017.The buyback program along with the growth of retained earnings will make sure that Check Point’s business stays afloat.I believe that Check Point shares are trading around their fair value and do not recommend acquiring them at the current price.,"Let's start with analyzing Check Point's (CHKP) annual reports provided by the company over the recent years. Over the past year, revenue grew to 7% YOY amounting to $1,855 million. The active demand for the company's products designed for small and medium-sized businesses as well as increased revenues from subscription served as the growth drivers. According to GAAP, the net profit in 2017 grew by 6.5% YOY amounting to $803 million. Earnings per diluted share increased by 15% amounting to $4.82. Check Point's management also provided projections for the entire year 2018. The company expects the annual adjusted profit of $5.50-5.90 per share at the revenue of $1.9-2.0 billion.If you look at the long-term indicators, you'll notice that the company is developing: its revenue increases steadily, its net income grows each year, while its operating margin remains stable and the highest in the industry.(source: company reports)In addition, there is a positive trend related to the retained earnings indicator. In recent years, both cash and cash equivalents of the company have remained stable and retained earnings have been steadily growing. The growth of retained earnings increases the financial stability of the company, revealing the source for its further development.(source: company reports)Sustainable financial performance allows the company to reward its investors through the buyback program. As you can see in the graph, the amount the company spends on these programs almost equals the operational cash flow. As you know, shares buyback program reduces the number of existing shares, increasing earnings per share (EPS) of a company.Last year, Check Point approved the new buyback program, under which the company will spend $250 million per quarter over the next four quarters to repurchase its own shares. It means that the company wants to demonstrate its investors that its shares are undervalued, and it has enough money for emergencies.(source: company reports)Let's take a look at the potential of the cybersecurity market in order to predict Check Point's future revenues. Let me remind you that about a half of Check Point's revenue comes from North America, where the largest player is, undoubtedly, the United States. It is expected that the U.S. cybersecurity expenses will continue to grow in the current year.The global cybersecurity expenses will also continue to rise and are expected to reach $96 billion in the current year. After a series of high-profile cyber attacks such as WannaCry, NotPetya, and Equifax, most companies recognized the need to increase budgets to prevent hacker attacks. It will allow the cybersecurity market to demonstrate the annual average growth of 6-7%, reaching $200 billion by 2021.If the cybersecurity market meets the growth forecasts, Check Point has all chances to become one of the main beneficiaries of this trend, therefore, its financial indicators will continue to grow. I believe that the new company's product line will also contribute to it.(source www.gartner.com)Taking all the available data into account, I think it is best to build a simplified DCF model to determine the fair price of Check Point's stock. In order to do this, I suggest using the cost of equity as the discount rate.As for the current company's beta, I used the data from multiple aggregators such as this and this. The current Check Point's beta is not high, which is a good sign. High beta means that the stock is highly volatile and reacts to any market movement with an even sharper movement. I used the returns on the U.S. 5- and 10-year government bonds as the risk-free rate of return. As for the Market Risk Premium, I used the data provided by this website.(the calculations and the table of the author)I built my projections of the free cash flow on the growth projections of the cybersecurity market (6-7%) and the growth of the free cash flow demonstrated by the company over 5 years (10%).(the calculations and the table of the author)Next, we need to calculate the terminal stock price, taking into account all future cash flows the company will demonstrate over the next five years. I used the conservative approach, using the 10-year bond rate (2.85%). I also used the previously calculated cost of equity (8.7%) to discount to the current price. Having calculated the terminal value and the present value of terminal value, we can calculate the total value. And finally, we divide the total value by the total number of shares. At the moment, the fair share price is $108.8 which does not look attractive at the current price of $98.(calculations of the author)Let's stop at the company's multiples. The company looks undervalued under most multiples in comparison with its closest competitors, most of which do not make any profit. At the same time, when we compare the company's multiples with those of the application industry (which is the median of the global software multiples), the majority of them looks a little overvalued.Source: gurufocusCheck Point is a growing company that has been demonstrating profit and revenue growth for several years now. The company operates in the rapidly developing cybersecurity market that allows talking about the growth of its financial indicators in the future. The company has a substantial cash cushion in the form of retained earnings, which ensures its financial stability. Moreover, Check Point runs buyback programs from one year to another which is good news for its investors.However, both the DFC analysis and the analysis of the multiples show that it is too early to talk about purchases at the current levels. In my opinion, Check Point's stock will be clear candidate for purchase from $80-85.(source www.tradingview.com)"

Check Point was trading towards all-time highs near $120, but guess what? After its earnings release, Check Point dropped right after reporting a beat for the third quarter, but also a mixed guidance for Q4 with revenues below consensus.One-month chart of Check Point, courtesy of Seeking AlphaI decided to do some research on my own to help investors understand whether it is a good time to load into this name. Let’s see.There is no point questioning Check Point. It has been an incredibly successful business in the past few years. CHKP margins are top-notch in the industry, and cybersecurity is a hot space to be. While it is sure Check Point will keep growing going forward, margins might drop a bit, but overall, the company should continue to throw off significant amounts of cash. While I may agree Check Point has still a lot of room to grow its top line, what I am concerned about is the company’s valuation. A realistic take on the company appraisal is going to be the focus of this piece, because as the old investing adage goes: “a good business doesn't make a good stock.”Let me say this first: analyst price targets are usually not my foremost concern when evaluating stocks. If I think an idea is correct based on my due diligence, I care little about the Street’s short-term logic, which often relates little to fundamentals. However, analysts’ actions were behind CHKP’s recent market correction, and it cannot hurt to see what they are thinking about Check Point.Analysts' action after CHKP Q3, Seeking Alpha (News of November 1)So, analysts lowered their TP to $115 after the earnings, but the market re-priced the stock all the way down to $102. Since CHKP is now still sitting at $104, it seems like an overreaction and an opportunity to scoop up shares at a 10% discount to fair value. To double check the numbers, let’s throw in the data in my DCF model and confirm whether the valuation is warrantedDCF valuation for CHKP. Author’s work (Prof. Damodaran’s template)Analysts are right! Let’s buy CHKP shares! Or…The truth is: I wanted to get $115, and it could have been just as easy to come up with $150 or $50. You give me the company’s supposed value; I make the appraisal to achieve that number. Prof. Damodaran explained in detail about the dark side of valuation (here) and performed similar exercises with companies like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB). Still, that does not make the practice useless. I did nothing special, as every analyst knows how to tweak numbers and squeeze out the result he wants to get. The advice is just beware about the quality of those figures! Because like Damodaran likes to point out: garbage in = garbage out.Once you know the trick, this type of valuation can be handy to understand the quality of the assumptions propping a specific target. Using analysts' price as a reference point for my own DCF model, I can better understand whether such objective seems reasonable or off the mark. The DCF model is susceptible to its input’s quality, and mostly to three key variables: Growth, Cash Flows (or EBIT as a proxy) and Discount Rate. So let’s get down to business and see whether the underlying assumptions justify a $115 price tag for CHKP or not.Cybersecurity total market is set to almost double from $137 billion in 2017 to $231 billion in 2022, an 11% CAGR. Considering Check Point’s P/E of 22, the PEG ratio doesn’t look very enticing when considering industry average. However, even more disturbing is perhaps that CHKP has been growing its top line in the last years below industry at around 7%. When contributor Kayode Omotosho pointed out in his article that Check Point was losing out market share to the competition, shareholding readers reacted with angry remarks. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like a good idea to be mad at facts. I won’t go as far as speculating that CHKP is losing market share to Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW) as the author did. However, considering the total cybersecurity market, it is unquestionable that the relative market share of CHKP is diminishing. The “better” scenario involves believing that Check Point is a focused company specialized in a niche of the total cybersecurity market and not as good as competitors are in other areas. It is a fair possibility, but still, growing less than competitors makes me wonder about the company’s future. Optimists can believe Check Point can improve and expand at a higher rate targeting competitors outside of its core area, but the opposite can happen as well (more competitors can enter CHKP's niche and contend its hefty margins). One thing is for sure: higher growth comes at a cost. It can be marketing; it can be R&D. In all cases, margins will be affected.To reach the $115 TP in my DCF model, I kept a growth rate of 7%, slowly diminishing it to 5% for year 10. On paper, a final growth rate of 5% is optimistic, considering that in the long run the growth rate should be a proxy for the risk-free rate. However, because of the model’s design, the impact of such assumption is limited. The model’s result for this hypothesis was not very much dissimilar from a simplified model which considers ten years of 7% growth rate before a drop towards the risk-free rate. Considering a continued growth spurt for cybersecurity in the next decade, the assumed growth rate for CHKP seems achievable. Although the proper growth rate for the model is the EBIT growth rate rather than the revenue growth rate, the company’s aggressive shares buyback program seems just enough to offset the declining sales growth. Because of the initiative, I believe the assumed growth rate is indeed attainable and not overly optimistic, although conversely, it seems that Check Point will be unable to use the program to attain a higher than top-line growth for its cash flow.Check Point is currently a cash flow machine, as the company can convert roughly half of its sales into operating profits. None of the competitors is nearly close to Check Point's results. The company does have a moat, but how sustainable is it in the long term?Readers should remember that a moat built solely on product innovation is usually very narrow. Unprotected new technologies get copied, and advantages obtained through patents do not tend to fare much better in the technology space; the competition manages to find a way to circumvent them. Check Point's solutions might be state-of-the-art and superior to some cheap providers, but it is hard to believe that in the medium term, the company will retain a significant technological superiority over competitors such as Palo Alto, Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) or Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT).Cybersecurity providers usually have a narrow moat based on customer lock-in. Once customers choose solutions from a vendor, switching costs tend to favor subscription renewals from the incumbent. Nevertheless, it is hard to argue this advantage alone will allow CHKP to retain high margins over the long run. Moreover, the very same thing works against the company when it tries to grow revenues from its competitors. After peaking in 2012, margins have slowly but inevitably started to shrink, and it is reasonable to believe EBIT will drop in the long term to a more sustainable (yet high) 25%-30% range. Unfortunately, it was only assuming that Check Point will retain its current 50% operating margin that the DCF could get to the $115 TP.Before moving on and discussing the discount rate, a clarification for those who might erroneously believe Check Point’s value should be higher because of its buyback policy. Shrinking the outstanding shares would mean double counting the company’s cash flow, and it’s a methodological mistake. The buyback is already accounted for once as cash flow growth and built into the model.The discount rate used for Check Point in the model was 8.75%. It is a pretty low number considering the company has no debt and therefore its WACC is equal to the cost of equity. Would shareholders be happy with an 8.75% return on their capital invested in CHKP? I am not sure, but I doubt most will be happy with anything less than 10% (at least, I wouldn’t). However, 8.75% might be a roughly appropriate rate in the current market environment. When the return is broken down as:2.35% - Current 10-year T-bond rate6.70% - Current Israeli equity risk premium (Damodaran, January 2017)The total would be 9.05%, which is not very far from the 8.75% considered to get to $115. Nevertheless, an adjustment to inch up the rate according to this theoretical value would be enough to drop the shares down to $106 and erase their current supposed discount to fair value.The cybersecurity arena is getting more and more competitive. During the article, I pointed at several of the biggest competitors of CHKP (Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, Fortinet), but there are countless “smaller” fishes (if a $1 billion company can be considered a small fish) still swimming as well. Imperva (NASDAQ: IMPV) and Barracuda (NYSE: CUDA) are just the first two names in the space that come to my mind, but keeping the focus on the other names mentioned:Although I believe there is no immediate threat to CHKP as the cybersecurity market keeps growing at double digits, its margins will be increasingly under pressure. Ten years is a long time, perhaps too long for a company to be expected to maintain hefty margins on its revenues. The business is now priced for perfection: a sustained growth, margins in check and a low discount rate. Betting on the company means to take a leap of faith and believe Check Point will navigate through the perilous waters of the market maintaining a 50% EBIT. Considering some of the disturbing signs that sent the stock price into a tailspin, such as the information released during Q3 earnings season that customers “with aggregated transaction valued over $1 million were 60 this quarter compared to 65 in the same period last year”. I am unwilling to take such risk and rate CHKP a hold."
4108525,24361,2017-09-21T09:41:54-04:00,"Check Point has been strong over the last year on renewed evidence that the company can, in fact, still generate some growth.Increased spending on sales & marketing seems to be paying off, and the company has ample resources to devote to M&A to augment its own R&D efforts.Check Point doesn't look like a compelling bargain today, but history suggests there will be opportunities to buy on pullbacks.","I've had a lot of respect for Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) for a long time, and the company's less impressive growth rates (and emphasis on margins) compared to Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW) and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) have created a few buying opportunities over the years. Buying opportunities emerged three times since mid-2015, with the latest run taking the shares up about 50% on renewed evidence that Check Point can still, in fact, generate pretty good revenue growth. I keep Check Point on my watch list to take advantage of those pullbacks but right now doesn't look like one of those opportunities. I think the company can generate high single-digit long-term FCF growth from here, and I think the opportunities in cloud and mobile are still meaningful, but I want more than the high single-digit return that seems to be figured into today's valuation. Check Point has been dedicating more resources to sales and marketing, and that seems to be helping translate the company's past R&D and M&A spending into better than expected revenue growth. Revenue growth has accelerated from 6% in the second half of 2016 to around 8% in the first half of 2017. Software blade subscriptions growth has accelerated above 25% and even maintenance revenue has picked up as discounting pressures have eased. Although the high end of the market has eased, Check Point is doing well leveraging its recent introductions. New product families now make up the overwhelming portion of appliance revenue, but the company still has a sizable installed base that has yet to refresh. Gross margins have stayed strong in the high 80%'s, but higher sales and marketing spending has been weighing on margins. I believe the growth can continue. The company's SandBlast technology has shown itself to be very competitive in breach detection and the Check Point should start leveraging past investments made to grow the cloud and mobile businesses. Palo Alto, Fortinet, and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) will, of course, be there competing in the market (not to mention numerous smaller players), but Check Point has done a good job of holding onto its base and I believe it is getting more competitive with new business. Sales and marketing have been a controversial point with Check Point for some time. Check Point management has long prioritized strong operating margins and they succeeded in delivering exceptional operating margins and adjusted free cash flow. Sometimes, though, you can have too much of a good thing, and I think Check Point went too far in prioritizing margin maximization. Check Point has traditionally taken the position that superior technology will sell itself, but that's not always the case and especially when companies like Palo Alto are exceptionally good at marketing. The company ran through multiple CMOs since 2014, due in part I believe to under-investment and under-prioritization of sales and marketing, but the company is now making up for that lost time.The security market is always evolving and the ongoing stream of significant data breaches offers pretty good evidence that there is still room for improvement. Given that there is a competitive dynamic at work (as long as there's money to be made stealing/selling data, hackers will keep working at it), I don't think “steady state” has much meaning. So while Check Point's still-strong share in firewalls is a good cornerstone for the business, the reality is that constant innovation and improvement is necessary. One of the things I like about Check Point is that, while they're often a “fast-follower” into new markets, they have shown a consistent ability to innovate into new opportunities, to acquire promising technologies, and then build upon those acquisitions with further R&D investment. With close to $4 billion in cash and long-term investments on the balance sheet, access to capital isn't a limiting factor when it comes to Check Point buying whatever it may need to stay in a leadership position. Although deferred revenue was still up almost 20% in the second quarter, billings growth slowed noticeably (up about 7%). Bears are going to point to that as a sign of coming trouble, and Check Point did lower guidance for the third quarter (though the timing of Yom Kippur seems like the biggest contributing factor), but billings and deferred revenue aren't as predictive for Check Point as for some companies (though they did start picking up ahead of this recent improvement in revenue...).I'm not that concerned about Check Point's near-term operational performance, but I do have some concerns that the Street is up to speed with the story and that it will be harder for the company to outperform higher expectations. I still believe the company can generate long-term revenue growth around 5% and good cash flow margins, even if management elects to maintain a higher ongoing level of sales and marketing spending (which I believe it should). Discounted back, though, those cash flows I model only support a high single-digit total return from today's price. I'm well aware that the Street will bid up stocks well ahead of what FCF would otherwise support when revenue growth is strong (and will also cut them down when growth disappoints), but I think FCF remains a good method for patient long-term investors. Check Point is back in the good graces of the Street, so I'm not all that surprised that it no longer looks like much of a bargain. History suggests, though, that concerns about growth and competition will re-emerge and push the shares down. Should that process take the shares back down around (or below) $100 again in the next six months or so, I'd certainly consider another go-around with these shares."

Among some of the products and services that they offer are network security, data security, and management solutions. Check Point provides security and support to protect the networks of data centers and small and large companies.Cyber security is becoming an increasingly important part of individual and business lives. Cloud computing is expected to increase to $162 billion in 2020. This presents an opportunity for cyber security firms as all that storage needs protection from cyber attacks and threats. The number of cyber attacks and complaints has increased as well. “According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, of the total complaints received in 2015, 44.1% reported a financial loss, with an average dollar loss of $3,718.00.” The increase in the number of attacks can be directly seen when looking at the total revenue from the security software industry. Now, where does this leave Check Point? Check Point has shown revenue strength, increasing year-over-year by 6.4%, faster than the industry average of 4.2%. Another positive sign is that the medium barrier to entry in the industry has led to more companies entering the market. This has lowered the market share of the top players Symantec (SYMC) and McAfee and made it easier for companies like Check Point to increase theirs.Source: IBISWorldCheck Point’s location in Tel Aviv, Israel, puts the company in a prime spot. Israel is in a constant state of conflict, and this has helped increase the need for protection from all fronts, including cyber security. The link between the military and IT has been growing stronger as more and more of the fight turns online in the form of cyber attacks. Many people, including Check Point’s founder Gil Shwed, started their career in the military and took what they learned there into the private sector. The threat of a cyber attack is very real for Israel, so the need to have companies that provide strong security and protection is essential. Israel is also one of the technology hubs of the world, receiving over 20% of the total cyber security investment in 2016. This is partly due to the fact that the Israeli government encourages science education, with a focus on IT and technology.Check Point's largest rival is Symantec. Symantec controls 22.6% of the market, while Check Point owns 3.8%. One of the reasons why I like Check Point more than Symantec is because of their income statement. They have no debt, and $1.6 billion cash on hand. Symantec, on the other hand, has $8.2 billion of debt and $4.26 billion cash. The debt/equity ratio of Symantec is 234.76. While Symantec has undertaken some large acquisitions recently with the purchase of Fireglass, LifeLock, and Blue Coat Systems, (spending over $7 billion for them) they also sold their Web Certification business for $1 billion to DigiCert. I believe this is because Symantec was running out of cash to keep their operations afloat and needed a cash injection. Symantec has seen total operating cash flow decrease every year since 2015, decreasing 27.6% from 2016 to 2017. The changing economic environment puts Symantec in a vulnerable position, with interest rates rising and expected to continue this rise into the future. A downturn in the economy can cause them to be put in a tough position. Check Point has been able to increase their investments while decreasing their financing expenses. This puts them in a stable position to potentially acquire smaller companies and expand their operations.Source: Google FinanceAs more and more devices become connected to the internet, that increases the number of devices that need protection. More personal information is being stored on these mobile devices as well, including credit card and banking information. The Apple (AAPL) Watch is a good example of this, as users can pay for items using Apple Pay directly from the watch. Convenience comes at a price, and so does the attractiveness of targeting these mobile devices. With the forecasted amount of internet connected devices expected to be 22.5 billion by 2021, it's no surprise that hackers are seeing this trend as an opportunity.Perhaps the biggest threat that Check Point faces is their competitors. The two largest of which are Symantec and McAfee. Both have larger market caps, and Intel’s (INTC) purchase of McAfee for $7.7 billion gave the firm more access to capital as well. Their relationship has helped boost McAfee’s profits by giving the company access to cross-sell their products to Intel’s customer base.Increasing prime rate may cause companies to borrow and spend less. New businesses require computers and software to operate, and if fewer businesses are opening, the cyber security industry has fewer potential customers to serve. As much of the security software industry relies upon the growth in computer and software products, this would be a cause for concern.Cyber security is becoming something more akin to insurance: you don’t want to buy it, but you’re screwed without it. Check Point has been able to capitalize on this by increasing revenue and net income year over year. The increasing number of devices that are connected to the internet poses an opportunity as more sensitive information is being inserted into them. Corporations are beginning to see an increase in their profit, resulting in increased expenditures in computer and software products. As the number of computers increases, so does the need for security. Check Point has strong financials with no debt holding the company down and is in a position to be able to expand their operations. I’m confident that we’ll see some big moves from Check Point within the year."

This quarter, it happened to be a 7 figure replacement at one of Australia’s largest banks.In its last conference call:The story was similar last quarter:And the quarter before:This explains a lot about the new revenue and market share projections/shift of top cyber plays.Market Share by Revenue of Top Cyber Security Pure PlaysBy revenue, Checkpoint’s market share of top cyber plays has been projected to fall from 13.5% to 11.9%. Palo Alto, on the other hand, will witness a market share gain from 14.5% to 15.2%. This also includes market share gains from the likes of Trend Micro (TMCY) and Proofpoint (PFPT) who offer niche solutions in areas like the cloud, email and endpoint security.Revenue Growth Projections of Top Cyber Security Pure PlaysThis explains the Street’s lofty revenue projections for its competitors. With the likes of Proofpoint, Symantec (SYMC) and Palo Alto projected to gain more grounds at Check Point’s expense.It will be interesting to understand management’s response to this competitive onslaught on its dominance and FCF sustainability.From a product perspective, management is positioning the Check Point Infinity security platform to take-on competition at it prepares to increase use cases and applicability of its product offering in a fast changing threat landscape. The architecture consolidates its firewalls, UTMs, mobile threat defense, ransomware solutions and security gateways.While these capabilities have been backed by top research firms in terms of effectiveness and innovativeness, Check Point still lags top competition in most security niches. This partly explains its incessant loss to competitors like Palo Alto in recent quarters.Also, Check Point still derives the bulk of its revenue from physical on-prem solutions. The bulk of the new market share gains in the cyber security market in recent quarters have been from attached subscription which has come at a huge acquisition cost to competitors like Palo Alto and Symantec.While Check Point has the best fundamentals in the cyber security market, sustaining that status will continue to be at the expense of market share erosion. It’s hard to understand how comfortable management feels with being low to moderately aggressive in a highly disruptive market. The fact remains that management has the capabilities to increase win-rate and while it keeps touting the superior capabilities of its products, it remains to be proven that new customers jumping on the cyber security bandwagon feel the same.With the introduction of new products mostly revolving around its security architecture of the future, I believe Check Point has the capability to weather near and long term competitive/macro headwinds. Its balance sheet with cash and short term investment which stands at $1.59 billion is more than the enterprise value of some of its small cap peers/competitors. It's far superior profit margins set it apart from the double task of managing profitability with ROIC and in seasons of demand softness. Therefore, I'm convinced Check Point will remain a safe haven for investors who want to diversify into top cyber plays.If you like my article and would like to stay up-to-date on the next one, you can click the ""Follow"" button next to my profile."

While technological advancement provides higher productivity and have several positive benefits for its users, there are some inherent threats lurking simply a click away. In today’s world, no particular technology is completely foolproof and almost every technology is vulnerable and could be under threat by a group of hackers.With recent proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT), there are already a billions of connected devices; and this is just the beginning. Gartner projects 20 billion IoT devices by 2020. With that kind of hyper connectivity, your bank account, mobile, car, television and even traffic signals, power plants, flights, missiles, satellites, etc. could be vulnerable. A threat of such nature is much more significant than even the biggest data breaches, be it Equifax or Uber that we have encountered. Imagine driving a car (not an autonomous one) and losing complete control over it or imagine terrorists getting access to nuclear power stations or flight management systems, it would be real panic situation (demo).There are economic cost associated with such cyber attacks as well. The Hiscox Cyber Report suggested that cyber crime cost the global economy over $450 billion in 2016 and most companies are ill-prepared to face such kind of an epidemic. An instance of data breach at Equifax (EFX) resulted in 35% decline in the stock price within a week. Now, imagine a few hundred cars of a leading manufacturer being hacked simultaneously causing accidents, injuries and loss of lives. What will happen to the stock price of the company and more importantly, how many of us are willing to buy cars from that manufacturer in the future?The cyber security market size is almost USD 100 billion and comprises of two segments: services and products. Services can again be broadly classified in two sub segments - corporate and consumer. Gartner predicts the industry to grow by 30% in the next four years.The index composition also reflects the kind of dependence we have on the connected world. Over the last few decades, technology is one of the sectors whose weighting has drastically increased in the composition of the S&P 500 (SPY). Today, top five constituents of the index - Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOG / GOOGL) - contributes over 13%, which is a reflection of the digital world we live in.

It was launched on 11/12/14 and tracks a tiered, equal-weighted index that targets companies actively involved in providing cyber security. As most of the companies from this industry are relatively small in market capitalization, the fund itself has a small-cap bias. The portfolio comprises of 42 stocks with weighted average market capitalization of $15.35B. Over 85% of the portfolio is invested in the United States, followed by 7% in the United Kingdom and 6% in Japan. Apart from software and IT services, which is the bulk of the portfolio, it also has almost 10% allocation to communications and networking and 2% to aerospace and defense.The top 10 holdings constitute 46% of the portfolio with Akamai Technologies being the largest holding with over 5%. In the top 10 holdings of the portfolio, three stocks - Akamai, Cisco and Juniper - are not directly related to cyber security. All these firms are indirect beneficiaries from the growing threats on the internet and have some products/services that cater to cloud security.If you own the S&P 500 index, you already have a small exposure to cyber security plays through Akamai (AKAM), Cisco (CSCO), Juniper (JNPR), Symantec (SYMC), F5 Networks (FFIV) and VeriSign (VRSN). The cumulative weighting of these securities is slightly above 1% to the S&P 500 index, while its contribution to the HACK ETF is about 20%.The P/E and P/B of HACK ETF are 161 and 5.04 respectively, while its dividend yield is 0.65%. The fund is reasonably liquid with an average daily dollar volume of $7.82M and has asset under management of $1.14B. Given its unique nature and being the first cyber security fund in the market, the fund charges an above average expense ratio of 0.60%.The cyber security industry is characterized by rapid technological advances, new internet applications, changes in customer requirements and frequent product upgrades. Hence, most of the companies in this industry are plagued with poor return ratios resulting from poor profitability and high fixed costs. One of the reasons of high P/E for the HACK ETF is negative EPS reported by many firms in the industry. Some of the firms have even negative EBITDA as shown in the table below.(Source: WSJ)These three firms are well managed in terms of their financial performance over the past decade with consistent double digit ROEs and have delivered moderate growth rates.

Being a European firm, it derives over 77% of its total sales from Europe.(Source: F-Secure Annual Report 2016)One of the most distinguishing features of F-Secure is that despite low growth and declining profitability in the business, the company has been able to grow through its internal accruals and have no history with debt. Even today, with a market capitalization of around €638M, the company has a cash pile of over €90M. Despite the consistent cash drag, the company has delivered over 20% return on equity (ROE) for the entire last decade which is unrivaled in the industry. It is also amongst the very few companies in this industry to reward shareholders with consistent dividends for the entire last decade. The company has a history of generating over €20M in operating cash flows for the last decade.Although F-Secure is one of the largest cyber security firms in Europe, it is quite smaller in comparison to its American peers. At the current price, F-Secure is trading above its historical mean and median valuations. Given the underlying growth rate, from a fundamental valuation perspective as well, the stock appears to be expensive. However, given the valuation of its peers, F-Secure appears to be fairly valued with an EV/EBITDA of around 20.Trend MicroTrend Micro is a Japanese multinational cyber security firm founded in Los Angeles in 1989 but with its global headquarters in Tokyo.

The firm has managed to stay clear of any kind of debt and is also averse to cash dividends. However, it has consistently rewarded shareholders by repurchasing its own shares. In the last three years, the management bought back shares worth $2.7B and had similar repurchase programs in the past as well. Check Point has delivered an average ROE of 18% in the last decade and has improved ROE in the last few years. Despite spending billions in the repurchase program, it still has over a billion dollars in cash on its books. At a market cap of $17B, the firm is trading near its all time high valuations. Although the revenue growth rate in recent past has declined to single digit, EPS growth has been in double digit aided by the buyback program.A portfolio of these three well managed companies offers great geographical diversification given their strong presence in different parts of the world.However, in terms of valuations both options aren't cheap.

Last month, the company announced quite a good financial report for Q1, in which it showed that the revenue increased by 7.7% Y/Y to $435.5 million and beat analyst consensus. The major catalyst for such a growth was the increased popularity for the company's top notch solution Sandblast, which gives a deeper level of inspection for all of the upcoming data and makes its users aware of the potential threats. The popularity of Sandblast also helped to increase overall subscription of the company's solutions to 25.7% from 21.8% a year before. As a result, operating income increased by 4.2% to $233.2 million and EPS increased by 1 cent more than expected to $1.20 (+13.2% Y/Y).

Also, the company improved its operating cash flow by 9.7% Y/Y to $355.4 million and purchased 2.6 million shares of its own stock. At the same time, it has the ability to acquire more than $512 million worth of shares as a part of its buyback program.Source: SECThe cyber security market continues to grow; a great number of companies from different industries continue to increase their budgets to tackle digital threats, and this is a perfect opportunity for Check Point to improve its positions there. According to analysts, the market for cyber security solutions is going to increase on average by 6-7% annually and will be worth $202 billion by the end of 2021. And I believe that Check Point has a real chance to drive this trend upward and benefit its shareholders along the way. According to IHS, Check Point has around 15% market share in the cyber security solutions market and could increase its position by a few points in the next couple of years.Source: Motley FoolIn addition, I should note that the current US administration is actively discussing different cyber security threats and ways to deal with them, which could benefit the players of the cyber security solutions market, and especially Check Point since it recently passed the certification in the US Defense Department. This means that the company now has bigger chances to struck a number of new deals from the defense sector, which will benefit Check Point shareholders in a positive way.Besides that, Check Point already has solid financials. It is a leader of gross margin and EBITDA margin percentages in comparison with its competition. If it continues to hold those percentages on higher levels, then we should expect to see the continuation of the growth of its income and free cash flow.Source: Capital CubeAs for the other financial metrics, Check Point has a number of competitive advantages against other players in the cyber security space.

The growth of cyber security market, big margins and no debt are going to increase Check Point's revenue in the foreseeable future. I believe that the stock's current technical level of $110 to $112 per share is the ideal spot to open a position in the company and believe that Check Point is a great investment in the cyber security space."
4075429,103135,2017-05-22T16:33:54-04:00,"Strategic shift towards focusing on subscription revenue will produce stable cash flows and increase stickiness of customers.Amidst growing cyber-security concerns, we expect businesses and consumers to purchase more software and services from companies such as Check Point.The company has displayed an ability to efficiently allocate R&D spending.","With all the current headlines about cyber security, we decided to discuss one of our favorite companies in the industry. The following article will outline the three pillars of Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) and why we love this stock.Thesis 1: Strategic Focus On Subscription RevenueWe are encouraged to see that the company has shifted their strategy in terms of revenue growth towards a much larger focus to subscription-based revenue. The graph below demonstrates the projected revenue of Check Point through 2020. (Source: CapitalIQ)As can be seen, growth is expected to be around 8% in 2018, which are solid growth numbers. However, we would like to shift the focus towards the breakdown of this revenue. We are specifically focused on the growth that is coming from the subscription segment. We have seen +20% growth for the past 3 years in this segment and expect it to become an even larger part of the company in years to come. Specifically, subscription revenue from the sale of IPS, Application Control, URL Filtering, and Anti-Virus services.We view this as a catalyst as subscription-based revenue allows the company to have stable cash flows and increases the ""stickiness"" of the customers. As customers buy subscriptions for specific services from the company, they will be encouraged to purchase complementary services that seamlessly integrate with all their other Check Point software. We believe the focus on subscription-based model will continue to drive up the share price for the next 3 years.Thesis 2: Growing Cyber Security ConcernsWith current events such as the WannaCry breach or the recent Zomato break which affected 17 million people, we are seeing increasing concern regarding cyber security. Simply Google search ""security breach"" and you will see 3 examples of cyber security breaches in the last 24 hours. In a research report conducted by Check Point 2016 Security Report and Exploits at the Endpoint: SANS 2016 Threat Landscape Study, the number of unknown malware increased 900%, with employees downloading a new unknown malware every four seconds.As this concern continues to grow for consumers and enterprises alike, we believe Check Point will be able to capitalize as they can leverage their strong security software portfolio to meet the growing demands of customers. Currently, the company has a wide variety of solutions including firewalls, virtual private networks, virtualization and much more. The wide range of products and services the company can offer results in Check Point being able to service enterprises, small and medium sized businesses, as well as consumers.Additionally, due to constant innovation and new products introduced to the security portfolio, it has become a single point of contact for all security-related activities for many large enterprises. Taking on large IT projects is often very costly for these large companies so they tend to remain with their current provider for long periods of time.We view this as a positive as the company currently services 94 of the Fortune 100 companies, ensuring stable cash flows for years to come. Lastly, we see significant opportunity in emerging markets at they begin to increase the adoption rate of the internet and experience demand for IT security products. With all these factors considered, we view cyber security as a source of growth for the next few years.Thesis 3: Proven R&D SuccessWith the ever-changing environment in the cyber security industry, there is significant need for research and development activities to occur for firms to remain competitive. We view this as a positive as Check Point is well positioned to thrive in such an environment with their already strong technological foundation and track record of successful R&D initiatives. For example, in 2016, the company launched SandBlast Agent, which was the first real-time zero-day protection for web browsers.The software integrated with web browsers and protected users from a multitude of threats. Later on in the year, the company released its brand new Check Point 770 and 790 appliances, targeted towards small- and medium-sized businesses. We would like to point out that although the company has consistently increased their R&D budget over the last 6 years, the company remained extremely efficient, keeping their R&D to Revenue ratio below 10%. We believe this is extremely important for the company's success as R&D becomes an even more important determinant of success in the industry. (Source: CapitalIQ)TakeawayWe are bullish on this company due to strong strategic decisions made by management, the current cyber security environment, as well as its R&D capabilities. Our rating is buy."

Its offerings include capabilities in network security, advanced security, and cloud security.Check Point remains the best investment idea in the cyber landscape due to it's a unique blend of product offerings, which offer low risk via diversification, low TCO, reliable growth story, and better ROIC compared to competitors.Optimal DiversificationFew firms in the cyber security space have the capabilities to offer best-of-breed solutions in network security, cloud security, and advanced threat security without recording a GAAP loss. This is because of the huge cost of acquiring talents or companies to field a complete and well diversifies security portfolio.Check Point stands out from competition due to the fact that the company has been a leader in network security via its NGFW (next generation firewall), which is rivaled only by other top security vendors like Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT).Check Point firewalls are ranked high in Gartner's magic quadrant for NGFW. Check Point is also highly ranked in Gartner's quadrant for UTMs (unified threat management) among SMBs.Recently, the company has been able to diversify its product offering into advanced security and cloud security. The market for cloud and advanced security remain one of the fastest growing cyber security segments. Cloud security is driven by rapid adoption of cloud platforms, including Office 365, Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS, three of the leading cloud platforms.Check Point Sandblast is a unique advanced threat solution that provides zero day protection by using intelligence malware sandboxing technology to provide threat detection and extraction. It ranks highly in NSS's BDS chart for malware block rate and with a low TCO.Source: CHKPIts cloud security platforms include dedicated solutions for AWS, Azure and Office 365. This has gained great reviews from third party testing sites.Low Total Cost Of Ownership (TCO)The low TCO of Check Point's products stems from the economies of scale derived from several years of developing capabilities in cyber security.Check Point has been able to offer its solutions at an attractive price point in a heavily congested cyber security industry. TCO is driven by block rate per dollar. By ramping up the effectiveness of its security solutions and throughput, this ensures network devices can detect and block more threats on multiple devices.Best ROICSource: MarketwatchCheck Point currently has the best ROIC in the cyber security industry. This is driven by a high operating margin, a result of low cost of talent in Israel. The massive immigration of foreign talents into Israel, mostly Russian mathematicians, scientists and engineers mean start-ups in Israel have always had what can be termed a talent surplus.This coupled with the low-cost of capital in Israel means Check Point has continued to increase total return to shareholders since its incorporation.However, Check Point's market dominance and competitive moat are being penetrated by the likes of Palo Alto and the shifting threat landscape.RiskCheck Point has had to rely on discounting in recent quarters to maintain its huge margins and increase total return to shareholders.In the latest IDC network security market share rank, Check Point might have lost its leadership position to Palo Alto in the firewall segment.It's still interesting to know that most of Check Point's competitors have had to gain market share at the huge cost of profitability. Most are running at a GAAP loss and any earning miss or negative news will affect them badly. Also, some are having the pressure of shareholders who are asking for profitability to deal with. This creates a dilemma for most of them. Should we increase market share or achieve profitability? Some of the victims of this impatience from investors include FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV) . Other include Fortinet , Barracuda (NYSE:CUDA), and Palo Alto who only see a decline in market cap anytime they fail to beat the lofty earnings target Wall Street continues to set for them.Check Point is absolved from most of these market euphoria due to its huge ROIC and profit margin.ValuationSource: Palo AltoCHKP has no debt, and to sustain its market share of 10%, it only has to grow revenue at 6% every year. When you factor in its huge ROIC compared to competitors, this is not hard to achieve.Using the projected growth chart from IDC, the size of the network and endpoint market is worth $18 billion. CHKP holds roughly 10% of that in revenue.Assuming a growth rate of 6% to 2019, CHKP will retain its market share without factoring growth from the cloud, APT and web security.Revenue growth (2016 - 2026)Maintaining a 50% operating margin and a 6% CAGR in FCF, CHKP will yield an intrinsic value of $100. This factors in a WACC of 9% driven by CHKP's favorable debt to equity ratio. FCF will be driven by net income which is a reflection of its operating margin of 50%, which I believe can be maintained into the near future.Also, CHKP has been able to manage its CAPEX which makes a net positive gain from working capital a driver of CFO. When we net out the CAPEX, FCF growth remains unhindered.If we factor in growth from cloud advanced threat security and IoT, CHKP will be worth miles north of $100.FCF growth projection (2017 - 2026)ConclusionCheck Point's huge ROIC makes it the safest and most attractive cyber security play in 2017. Investors who are skeptical about the cyber security landscape can still find solace in CHKP as it offers more upsides due to its solid financials and the brilliant management handle on the business."

4011696,96536,2016-10-12T12:31:08-04:00,Check Point Software Technologies is the largest pure-play security vendor globally.The company operates in a highly competitive industry and shares have been languishing the last few years.This article examines if this is temporary blip or a long-term deterioration of the business.,"Check Point Software Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ:CHKP) develops and markets software and hardware solutions for IT security. CHKP is the largest pure-play security vendor globally.CHKP operates at scale in a highly technical field, which should allow the company to maintain a strong competitive advantage. Additionally, CHKP provides mission-critical solutions to businesses so it's reasonable to believe they should be able to charge a premium for their services, further compounding their competitive position.However, while the narrative for CHKP is compelling, the cyber security field also is rapidly changing and highly competitive. So I'd like to dig into the data in order to better and more objectively understand how well CHKP is competing and serving customers in the growing cyber security market. Intriguingly, while shares of CHKP have done well historically, they've been treading water for almost two years. I'm curious to try and determine if this is a temporary anomaly or a serious deterioration of the business.CHKP Business Overview:The company's current CEO founded CHKP in 1993. Since then, the company has focused on the ever-evolving task of helping corporations operate in a secure Internet environment. CHKP has developed a number of security standards over the years related to firewalls, threat detection and threat extraction. And given the current market capitalization of over $13B, the company is clearly a big player in the information security space.The company reports their operating activities within one single segment. However, CHKP does break out the different ways they make revenue. The largest contributor to sales is software updates and maintenance, which makes up over 46% of the top line. One thing I like about this is it implies a large percentage of the revenue is sticky. Qualitatively, this makes sense: once CHKP has a customer, they aren't likely to suddenly stop worrying about cyber security. And the costs and inconveniences of going to another vendor can certainly be high.Next, products and licenses contribute 34% of revenue, while subscriptions make up the remainder, coming in at just under 20%. So as long as internet usage continues to increase, CHKP should be able to continue capturing growth. The proliferation of internet-enabled devices, particularly mobile devices, I think is more likely than not to continue. Looking ahead, analyst estimates also forecast growth over the next five years that's consistent with the company's past operating results (source).And remember, CHKP is providing a premium and essential solution for corporate customers from large enterprises to small-and-medium sized businesses. The reason this appeals to me is because they should be able to charge a premium for these mission-critical solutions. As a potential shareholder, I'm hoping this will result in more profits. The fact that the company has maintained a return-on-equity of just under 20% for the last five years is particularly impressive and should underscore this fact. However, to confirm these assertions are true, I'd like to look at the longer-term financial trends of CHKP.CHKP Financial History:To try and get a handle on the strength of CHKPs competitive position and economic moat, I like to look at long term operating trends. By examining the results over a 10-year period I can get better context on the most recent headline numbers.Plus, if I can find consistent trends, it makes forecasting and projecting analysis into the future a little more reliable. So using free data from Morningstar (source), I've created a few charts to highlight the key trends in CHKP. The first one shows the revenue results.I always like to start this part of my analysis with revenue because it gives the best indication of how companies are able to meet client demand in the market place. In the case of CHKP, you can see the results are pretty good. I'm particularly impressed because of the incredibly fast-changing industry in which CHKP operates. I think these revenue numbers go to show that the company has done a good job adapting and continuing to grow sales and re-bill existing customers.However, one concern I have is that constantly developing and marketing new products and services is expensive. If this is required to drive sales, I'd expect to see margin contractions and pressure on EPS. As a shareholder, this isn't something I'd be eager to see. Luckily, with CHKP this doesn't seem to be the case.To my pleasant surprise, the trend above was far more consistent than I had expected. It seems CHKP has well-developed methods and processes for consistently and profitably developing new solutions to cope with the ever-evolving online threats.I expected to see high gross margins due to the nature of the software business - there are few physical costs associated with selling the product - but the operating margins above 50% really undermine this point. Perhaps this shouldn't come as a surprise given the long history of this company, but it's reassuring to see. And as you'd expect, these healthy margins also benefit earnings.As you can see, shareholders have continued to benefit given the steady margins and ongoing revenue growth. Additionally, CHKP has reduced their share count from 238 million to 178 million shares outstanding over the last 10 years, which has helped to inflate EPS.Another place these results show up to the benefit of shareholders is in the book value per share number. As a longer-term oriented shareholder, this is a trend that I always like to keep an eye on. I'm eager to own companies that can grow their equity value on a per share basis because it's another way I'm getting value.While I think this trend looks pretty good, it is worth noting that compounded retained earnings are the main growth driver for CHKP shares. So I'd like to see this growth resume sooner than later. The company does not currently issue a dividend, and given the growth-oriented nature and high internal returns, management is unlikely to initiate one soon. That means shares of CHKP wouldn't be appropriate for income investors. But that's not the only possible downside to buying shares of CHKP.Potential Risks to Investing in CHKP:While CHKP does have some of the appealing attributes of an investment opportunity thus far, there are always risks to consider. In this case, there are a number of unique concerns that may be difficult to quantify.First of all, like most large cap global companies, CHKP is vulnerable in the case of a sustained global economic slowdown. While I don't think this is likely right now, it's always something to be aware of. But in addition to that, CHKP does face ongoing execution risks too. Not only is growth challenging and competitive, but if products aren't perfectly created and updated CHKP could face serious liabilities. And again CHKP needs to do all of this while maintaining consistent margins, not an easy task.Now although these risks are a concern, I think valuation does mitigate them to some degree. As you can see in the graph below (source) for the first time in years shares of CHKP are no longer trading at a premium to the broader market.Conclusion: Planning to Buy CHKPGiven the strong and consistent trends present in the CHKP operating results, plus the fair valuation, I think shares present an interesting opportunity. I'll be curious to watch results come in over the next few quarters and see how the share price reacts. Currently, I don't have a position because my portfolio is fully invested. But CHKP is certainly on my watch list and as soon as I have more cash to put to work I'll plan to pick up a piece of this company. But what do you think? Does CHKP deserve to be a part of your portfolio?"
4025818,68695,2016-11-23T06:31:35-05:00,"Markets expect Check Point Software Technologies to succumb to increasing competitive pressures and see UAFRS adjusted ROA fade in the future.However, CHKP has demonstrated the ability to sustain industry-leading Adjusted Earnings Margins for over a decade despite these headwinds.Moreover, management is confident about the strength of their appliance product line and SandBlast advanced malware prevention, and the sustainability of subscription growth.Given CHKP’s ability to sustain robust profitability in spite of increasing headwinds, and management confidence about their products, expectations appear too bearish, and equity upside may be warranted.","Performance and Valuation Prime™ ChartCheck Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP) develops and markets a portfolio of software and combined hardware products covering network security, endpoint security, data security, and management solutions. After pioneering the industry with the first commercially available software firewall to use, the firm's focus on end-to-end unified protection has allowed it to develop into one of the largest pure-play security vendors in the world, securing more than 100,000 businesses, and receiving numerous awards.Its world renowned status and unmatched catch rate of malware and other intrusions has allowed the firm to maintain robust profitability levels in the face of increasing competitive headwinds that have crushed the returns of other firms in the industry. This unique attribute makes the firm an ideal investment in a rapidly expanding industry.While CHKP saw UAFRS-based ROA decline dramatically from its peak of 392% in 2001, it has begun to recover in recent years. After bottoming in 2008 at 67%, Adjusted ROA steadily increased to 184% in 2015. Meanwhile, UAFRS-based Asset growth, which from 2000-2008 ranged from 5-52%, has since been more muted, but similarly volatile, ranging from -17% to 11% since 2009.For context, the PVP chart below reflects the real, economic performance and valuation measures of Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. after making many major adjustments to the as-reported financials. This chart, along with all of the charts included in this article, as well as the detail behind the graphics, can be found here.The four panels above explain the company's historical corporate performance and valuation levels plus consensus estimates for forecast years as well as what the market is currently pricing in, in terms of expectations for profitability and growth.This analysis uses Uniform Adjusted Financial Reporting Standards (UAFRS) metrics, or adjusted metrics, which remove accounting distortions found in GAAP and IFRS to reveal the true economic profitability of a firm. This allows us to better understand the real historic economic profitability of a firm as well as allows for better comparability between peers. To better understand UAFRS, please refer to our explanation here.Performance Drivers - Sales, Margins and TurnsIt can be helpful to break down Adjusted ROA into its DuPont formula parts, UAFRS Earnings Margin and UAFRS Asset Turnover, which are cleaned up margins and turns metrics used to calculate Adjusted ROA. The chart below details both Adjusted Earnings Margin and Adjusted Asset Turns historically, to help us better understand the drivers of the firm's profitability and performance.Trends in Adjusted ROA have been driven by trends in UAFRS-based Asset Turns. From 2000-2008, Adjusted Asset Turns declined from 7.8x to just 1.4x, before recovering to 3.9x in 2015. On top of this, while UAFRS-based Earnings Margins declined from a peak of 55% in 2001 to 42% in 2003, they recovered to 50% in 2007, and have stabilized at 45-47% levels since 2009.As addressed in our prior article about Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), the industry has seen a much different trend, which has led to somewhat suppressed valuations for CHKP, and these concerns appear unwarranted, given the firm's position as a market leader and its ability to continue commanding a premium for its offeringsMoreover, given the firm's stability in Adjusted Earnings Margins, and consistent trend of improving Adjusted Asset Turns since the depths of the Great Recession, the firm should be able to continue to drive Adjusted ROA expansion as they continue improving Adjusted Asset Turns back towards prior levels.Industry Analysis - Aggregate Earnings MarginsIn the following chart, we have aggregated several firms (PANW, PFPT, IMPV, CYBR, CHKP, FTNT, FEYE) within the cyber security industry in order to better understand trends in Adjusted Earnings Margins.As we can see above, Adjusted Earnings Margins for the industry have fallen steadily from a peak of 50% in 2007 to just 23% in 2015, driving industry-wide concerns about competitive pressures. However, as we illustrated earlier, CHKP has been able to maintain robust Adjusted Earnings Margins at levels the industry hasn't seen since before the Great Recession. Moreover, in recent years, CHKP has delivered stable Adjusted Earnings Margins almost twice the level of the industry as a whole.Such a dramatic difference highlights the value of the firm's products. While other competitors have fallen prey to increasing competitive headwinds and have been forced to reduce pricing in order to keep clients, the strength of CHKP's products command a premium that clients are willing to pay. This gives the firm a distinct advantage over competitors, allowing it to sustain substantially more robust Adjusted ROA levels, and alleviating concerns about future Adjusted Earnings Margin compression.Embedded Expectations AnalysisAs investors, understanding what the market is embedding in the stock price in terms of expectations is paramount to making good decisions. Without understanding what the market is pricing in, it is impossible to claim that the market is wrong. We derive market expectations for the firm from valuations and historical performance trends, to give a clearer picture into what the market is projecting for the firm.CHKP is currently trading at a 14.7x UAFRS-based P/E, which is near historical averages. At these levels, the market is pricing in expectations for declining Adjusted ROA, from 184% in 2015 to 153% in 2020, accompanied by immaterial Adjusted Asset growth.Analyst and Management Expectations and AlignmentAnalysts have bearish expectations relative to the market, projecting Adjusted ROA to decline to 121% in 2017, accompanied by 16% Adjusted Asset growth.However, Valens' qualitative analysis of the firm's Q3 2016 earnings call highlights that management is confident about the strength of their appliance product line and SandBlast advanced malware prevention, and they generated highly confident markers when saying that studies have shown that Check Point's technology is superior to other technologies in the marketplace. They are also confident about the sustainability of growth in their subscription revenues.Considering that market concerns largely revolve around the firm's ability to maintain superior margins, management's confidence in their product line, and the premium it commands is highly positive.Peer Analysis - Valuations Relative to ProfitabilityA major benefit of adjusting as-reported financial statements is to clear away accounting distortions, to allow for more accurate peer-to-peer comparisons. To this end, we have included a scatter chart below, that plots CHKP against its peers based on their Adjusted Price-to-Assets ratio (P/B) and Adjusted ROA.Looking across industries, markets, and time, there has been a very strong relationship between a company's Adjusted ROA relative to the corporate average (6%) Adjusted ROA, and the multiple the market will pay above the value of the company's Adjusted Asset base, in terms of a UAFRS-based P/B multiple. A company that generates a 6% Adjusted ROA will tend to trade at a 1.0x Adjusted P/B, and a company that generates a 18% Adjusted ROA will trade at a 3.0x Adjusted P/B, etc.Relative to its peers in the cyber security industry, CHKP appears miles ahead of the competition with its +150% Adjusted ROA and 23.8x Adjusted P/B. While CHKP may be trading at higher valuations than its competitors, this premium is justified by the firm's substantially more robust Adjusted ROA. Its next closest competitor, CYBR, generates close to a 40% Adjusted ROA and trades at a valuation not terribly far below CHKP's. Given CHKP's ability to maintain robust Adjusted Earnings Margins in the face of increasing competitive headwinds, it is clearly slightly undervalued at worst.Valuation Matrix - ROA' and Asset' Growth as Drivers of ValuationWhen valuing a company, it is important to consider more than a singular target price, and instead the potential value of a firm at various levels of performance. The below matrix highlights potential prices for CHKP at various levels of profitability (in terms of Adjusted ROA) and growth (Adjusted Asset growth). Prices that are in excess of 10% equity upside are highlighted in black, and prices representing an excess of 10% equity downside are highlighted in red.To justify current prices, CHKP would need to see Adjusted ROA fall substantially, from 183% in 2015 to 153%, with no growth at all. Given the firm has managed to consistently improve Adjusted ROA since 2008, driven by increasing Adjusted Asset Turns, and sustain extremely robust Adjusted Earnings Margin, this is likely too bearish. Moreover, considering management's confidence about their product performance and value, concerns about the strength of the firm's Adjusted Earnings Margins appear unwarranted.Should the firm only sustain Adjusted Margins and Adjusted Turns at current levels, equity upside would be warranted. Moreover, considering the firm's ability to maintain Margins, and their recent ability to expand Turns, they may continue to grow Adjusted ROA going forward, warranting substantial upside for the name.To find out more about Check Point Software Ltd. and how their performance and market expectations compare to peers, click here to access the open beta of the Valens Research database.Our Chief Investment Strategist, Joel Litman, chairs the Valens Equities and Credit Research Committees, which are responsible for this article.

Of the analysts covering Check Point, 11 recommended it as a ""Strong Buy,"" two recommended it as a ""Buy"" and 12 recommended it as ""Hold"".My Recommendation: Buy RatingI will recommend Buy rating for Check Point based on the following factors:"
3869466,24361,2016-02-06T10:46:05-05:00,"Check Point has boosted its top-line growth, but expansions of its R&D and sales efforts are draining the near-term margin leverage away.Platforms like SandBlast are exciting, but the fast-follower strategy means the question of what comes next will never go away.A deal for CyberArk would be intriguing, but CHKP as is seems undervalued below the mid-to-high $80s.","The more things change, the more they stay the same for Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP). While this Israeli IT security company still has a leading presence in enterprise IT security and margins that many CEOs could only dream of, a segment of the investing world remains steadfast that the company is doomed to lose share to Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), and other relative newcomers over time.To be fair, Check Point has lost market share ... but the erosion seen in recent years has been less than the bears predicted. What's more, while Check Point's ""fast follower"" strategy means it will always arrive after the party has started, the company seems to have a credible platform for advanced threat detection, endpoint security, and cloud. The shares aren't dramatically undervalued, but they do trade below fair value, and I still think this is a quality idea in the tech space.Basically On Target With Q4 ResultsThere's not too much to say about Check Point's fourth-quarter results, as the company produced financials that didn't include many surprises (and very few big ones).Revenue rose 9%, with product revenue up more than 7%, blade subscriptions up 22%, and other software revenues (updates, maintenance, etc.) up 5%. Gross margin ticked up a bit (about 40bp on a GAAP basis) with those higher blade revenues, but non-GAAP operating income growth (up 6%) trailed revenue as the company continues to invest in what management hopes will be growth-building efforts in sales and R&D. Reported sales and marketing expense increased more than 21% this quarter while R&D expense was up close to 17%.Billings slightly exceeded expectations with more than 8% growth while deferred revenue was up 16%.Can It Follow Fast Enough?Check Point's operating philosophy isn't to blaze new trails, but to watch what's going on in the IT security space and be a ""fast follower"". In threat emulation, for example, the company followed FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and it has been an increasingly meaningful part of the business. The problem, though, is that while Palo Alto wasn't first here either, it has leapfrogged CHKP and serious rivals FEYE for the title of best-in-class.Now, we'll see what happens with the company's efforts in segments like endpoint security. It acquired Lacoon about a year ago to help build this business, but will rivals like FireEye, Carbon Black, or Bromium outmaneuver them? I believe that Check Point has established a reputation for doing enough to stay relevant with its customer base (many of which include large enterprises which aren't necessary rapid/early adopters), but it won't quell the concerns on the company's future market share and relevance.To that end, I'd also note that Fortinet and Palo Alto both outspend Check Point on R&D despite generating about 60% of its revenue. Innovation isn't always about the absolute number of dollars spent in R&D, but I do think the company is likely to continue to increase its R&D spending if it wants to regain some revenue momentum. I should also note, though, that CHKP has a history of doing small tuck-in deals of companies that aren't too far removed from the start-up stage; I think you can argue that this is in some respects similar to ""back-dating"" R&D spending.CyberArk - Will It Or Won't It?A few weeks ago, there was a lot of buzz over the rumor that Check Point was bargaining with CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) on an acquisition of this much smaller (less than one-tenth the size of CHKP in revenue terms) Israeli security firm.This would be a marked shift in Check Point's strategy, given that any deal would likely cost it over $1 billion. That said, it's an interesting asset. Where most security companies focus on keeping the company safe from attacks that come outside of the network, CyberArk focuses on securing the privileged accounts that are assigned to IT admins. These are popular targets for hackers, because if you can get access, you can pretty much bypass all of a network/company's security efforts. It likely also doesn't hurt that CyberArk is also an Israeli company and that may make it easier for Check Point to get the clearances it needs to do the deal (unlike the attempt to acquire Sourcefire long ago that was blocked by the U.S. government).I realize that the history of adding value through large acquisitions is not good for tech (or any industry, really), but this seems like a move that would at least be worth serious consideration.Emerging Opportunities Among Rampant CompetitionCheck Point believes it has the growth drivers for the coming years. The company has spent to significantly increase its sales capacity, though I think a skeptic can argue that Check Point's biggest issue isn't that it's not good at selling, but doesn't have the best technology to sell.To that latter point, the new R80 platform does mark at least an incremental improvement. SandBlast, the company's advanced threat protection platform, may be more than just an incremental player. The sandboxing concept isn't new, but Check Point's approach doesn't run in a virtual environment. Instead, this product uses the CPU-level threat detection capabilities it acquired with the Hyperwise deal back in early 2015 and it seems to offer a unique way (thus far) of isolating and inspecting files that could contain malicious content, including a threat extraction process that should neutralize that malicious content. I think this is pretty interesting in light of the comments that Palo Alto has made in the past regarding how many/most IT security companies focus on detection/containment/mitigation and not prevention; if SandBlast works as advertised, it keeps the bad code from getting into the system to begin with.I'm looking for Check Point to grow revenue at a long-term rate of around 5%, which I believe is around the middle to low end of most projections for the long-term enterprise IT market growth. Although Check Point has indeed been losing share to the likes of Palo Alto and Fortinet in firewalls (as have Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Juniper (NYSE:JNPR)), I'm encouraged by the steps management is taking. At a minimum, I think it will slow the overall erosion in CHKP's security market share.I believe the software blade model will be good for gross margins, allowing a high-80%'s long-term margin, though with some erosion (around 50bp to 100bp) over time. I do believe that the company is past the point of peak margins (55.6% in 2012 and 57.3% in 2005), as I think it will have to maintain R&D spending at or above 9% of revenue and sales and marketing spending at/above 21.5% for the long term. Even so, I think the company can still generate 5% annualized adjusted free cash flow growth, supporting a fair value of about $85 today. I likewise calculate that a high teens ROE should merit a price/book multiple of around 4.5x, which supports a high-$80s fair value.The Bottom LineThe investment theses and outlooks between Check Point, Palo Alto, Fortinet, and CyberArk are startlingly different. Palo Alto and Fortinet are fierce up-and-comers disrupting the market and posting stellar growth. CyberArk is growing very well too, but isn't nearly big enough to really be considered disruptive to the likes of Check Point, Cisco, and Palo Alto. Then there's Check Point - the established leader fighting hard to keep what it has and stay on or near the leading edge.I still like CHKP as a company, and I think the valuation is decent. Whether or not decent is enough for you is your decision."
3995426,24361,2016-08-03T20:06:12-04:00,"Wall Street is once again worried about top-line lackluster growth at Check Point, though this time it seems more related to accounting treatment and not underlying demand or market share.Check Point has stepped up its R&D spending and has shown that it can adroitly combine internal R&D with select, small acquisitions, but the ""fast follower"" perception is a drag.A mid-$80s fair value doesn't inspire much urgency in either direction, and I believe Check Point remains a solid, but not spectacular, way to play IT security growth.","A few things seem to be perpetually true about Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP). Despite a prominent position in the market, including leading firewall market share, nobody is ever really happy with this Israeli IT security company. The company's growth is no longer in the double digits. The company doesn't spend as much on R&D as Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW) or Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT). The company doesn't ""play to win,"" but instead focuses on more or less holding steady in the market. And so on.I can't and won't dismiss these concerns out of hand - most of them are factually true. It's also true that Fortinet and Palo Alto have blown past Check Point in terms of share price appreciation over the last five years, though CHKP has outperformed (it has gone down less) in the past year as the security stock market has come off a pretty crazy bullish bender.I really do think this is a case of ""it is what it is."" What Check Point is today is what it will be tomorrow - a smart, well-run IT security company with a huge installed base, a ""fast follower"" strategy that mitigates risks and supports margins, and a better-than-credited core technology. With a fair value in the mid-$80s, it's a little undervalued today, but not dramatically so. I think Check Point is a good way to play long-term trends in security spending (which I would think would grow around mid- to high-single digits most years), with opportunities to build/lighten positions as market sentiment ebbs and flows.Okay Results, But Guidance Is A ProblemRevenue rose 7% in the second quarter, which was fine relative to expectations. Product revenue rose 3% while blade subscription revenue rose 21% and update/maintenance revenue rose 4%. Gross margin was basically stable while operating income rose 3% (adjusted) and operating margin shrank about two points as the company significantly boosted R&D spending (up about 22% on an adjusted basis) and sales & marketing (by almost 17%).While billings and deferred revenue looked okay (and aren't always as predictive as you might hope), management lowered guidance. Check Point's model is changing. Because the company is bundling in threat protection and extraction, it has to change its accounting treatment for the revenue, and that shifts sales out of appliances and into subscriptions. It doesn't have a meaningful impact on the cash flow, but it makes the reported results look ugly as product revenue is likely going to decline for a few quarters.A more concerning issue is that the company has had to discount its maintenance services and that is also a part of the negative guidance revision. Maintenance is absurdly lucrative (gross margins around 90%), so any harm to this line item is unwelcome, and it is not unreasonable to ask if this is a sign that rivals like Palo Alto, Fortinet, and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) are a bigger problem here of late.More R&D? Not A Bad Idea, But Not A Quick-Fix EitherMore than a few analysts and investors have lamented Check Point's prioritization of margins over growth. Given that Palo Alto and Fortinet both surpass Check Point in reported R&D spending (despite smaller revenue bases), are growing much faster, and taking share in the market, I can see where some of this concern comes from.Check Point arguably doesn't get enough credit for how it pursues product development. The company's new SandBlast threat emulation platform was a byproduct of both strong internal development and the integration of acquired technology (especially Hyperwise). It took less than a year, I believe, to translate that existing internal R&D and Hyperwise into a real product, and the company has ongoing projects in threat prevention. I believe this directly addresses a claim that Palo Alto has made in the past regarding other security companies focusing on mitigating attacks as opposed to stopping them outright. What's more, with only single-digit share and double-digit growth today, this can be a nice driver for Check Point in the next couple of years.Check Point is also leveraging its Lacoon acquisition and investing more resources into mobile security. While I of course think there will be more competition in the future, the market for securing mobile devices connected to the enterprise is large enough to matter for Check Point and growing fast.I like the fact that Check Point doesn't suffer from ""Not Invented Here Syndrome,"" and all you have to do is look at the biotech/pharma sector to see that spending billions on R&D is no guarantee of future revenue. Still, I think Check Point can do more. The company has great core technology and an enormous installed base into which it can sell new products. Palo Alto and Fortinet have been chewing on that base for a while now (Fortinet more on price, Palo Alto more on tech/product capabilities) and Cisco seems to have its act together again in security. I'm not suggesting that Check Point needs to invest substantial sums into risky ""moonshots,"" but I think it would help the company's market share and market sentiment if it could come with a little more ""wow"" a little more often and appear to cede innovation to companies like Palo Alto (at least not as often).Resizing The OpportunityWhile Check Point's revenue guidance necessitates some changes to the model, not all that much has changed from a cash flow perspective, and I'm still looking for long-term growth in the range of 5%. That supports a fair value in the mid-$80s, and I think my slightly higher revenue growth assumption (in the low 5%s) does anticipate some ongoing share loss. If Check Point can grow with the market, there would be upside here (provided the company doesn't have to radically alter its margin structure).I do worry that Check Point is too reactive and too willing to be that ""fast follower"" to companies like Palo Alto. So with that, I'm somewhat concerned that the company does over-prioritize its thick margins and is liable to ""playing not to lose"" - something that rarely works well in competitive markets. On the other hand, I don't think Check Point is a broken company, and if something's not broken, you have to be careful about just how far you go in trying to improve it.The Bottom LineCheck Point isn't quite cheap enough for me to be really excited about it, but that's not uncommon. I think this is a well-run company that will more or less grow along with the underlying market, but I do worry that a lack of reported growth and a perception that it is not dynamic enough will be a recurring issue with multiples, valuation, and stock performance."
3955976,98236,2016-03-04T18:51:09-05:00,"Symantec and Check Point have far more modest valuations than their faster-growing rivals in the enterprise security space.Check Point achieves remarkable margins, and as such, is one of the better GARP stories in the IT universe.Symantec: Now that the Veritas divestiture is complete, is a bet on a turnaround. But valuation provides a support for the bet.Both companies have competitive offerings, and in particular, CHKP has fully competitive solutions with its faster-growing rivals.SYMC has undergone many changes in its sales force - getting that right will determine the success of the turnaround.","The Investment ThesisMost tech investors need to have participation in the network security area to achieve reasonable alpha in their portfolios.A couple of days ago, I wrote an article about investing in the network security space. I outlined the case that network security continues to grow at rates at least 2X and possibly 4X as fast as the overall enterprise IT space. Overall, I suggested that spending on network IT elements would probably rise at rates of as much as 15%/year for at least the next several years. With that type of growth in mind, I suggested that any portfolio with a significant tech weighting ought to have some representation in the group.That article focused on the high growth/highly valued names in the group, Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW) and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT). One of the issues with highly valued companies is the difficulty of finding something that is unknown about the business. Both PANW and FTNT are covered by plenty of analysts and most of them love the names. So they are the antithesis of a dusty corner or an undiscovered value. Many readers of Seeking Alpha are looking for value and the undiscovered name that is in plain sight but has not been appreciated.There are many, many names in the network security space - most of these companies sell point solutions that merely address one part of the overall security problem. While some of these companies may be successful for a time, and more than a few are going to get bought, some perhaps at excessive valuations, the era of point solutions in the network security space is effectively over. Even in the SMB market, where Barracuda (NYSE:CUDA) holds sway, users really want security that is platform based and which incorporate all of the necessary elements of a total solution including ""next generation firewalls,"" endpoint protection and threat intelligence detection.There are two companies within the network space that have relatively more modest valuations that still either offer true platform security solutions or have the capability of migrating their technology in that direction. Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) in fact offers solutions that are at least competitive with its rivals Palo Alto and Fortinet. The company continues to enjoy high ratings from Gartner, more or less across the board, and it still has leading market share in the space.Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) is a company that essentially is in the process of reinventing itself. The company has a large installed base, but one that is shrinking. It also has market-leading positions in components of the security stack. The company has been dysfunctional for many years - perhaps now without the distractions of Veritas, it can become a real player in the space.Check Point SoftwareOne of the Best GARP investments in the tech space with many pregnant possibilities.Check Point is actually one of the founders of the enterprise security space. It is still the largest independent company in the space although that distinction is likely to pass to Palo Alto sometime in 2017. The company remains a market share leader and continues to be evaluated in the top quadrant in many sectors of the network security space year after year. This is one of those value investments that is hiding in plain sight so to speak. The company has a deep and stable management team. Indeed, the senior management of CHKP today has all been with the company for at least seven years and the CEO Gil Shwed is one of the founders and is considered the inventor of the modern firewall and in particular has secured a patent for stateful inspection, still one of the foundations of enterprise network security.The company has an array of products that matches up with the best of class in the industry, at least as far as I can determine. It has an enormous installed base that throws off hundreds of millions a year in maintenance revenues. As a result, it is one of the more profitable software companies in the world these days with operating margins that reached 57% last year. It enjoys a gross margin approaching 90% on 43% of its revenues that come from software maintenance.What the company doesn't seem to have is the willingness to invest in sales and marketing and to a lesser extent in R&D to the extent necessary for it to challenge the fastest-growing companies in the space. The company spent just 22% of its total revenues on sales and marketing last year, and in Q4, typically a high point for sales and marketing spend during the year for most IT companies, because the commission accelerators kick in, it still spent 22% of its revenues on marketing.R&D spending at $150 million for the past year is quite modest for a company in a space that seems to be changing almost by the month. R&D spending for Check Point is 9% of revenues. R&D spending for Palo Alto was $133 million in just the last six months, and given the company's guidance, it is reasonable to assume that it will spend at least $320 million on R&D in its current fiscal year. That will be about 24% of revenues. Fortinet spent $158 million on R&D in calendar year 2015, which was almost 16% of revenues. I'm sure that there are readers who will fault me for just citing spend rates in analyzing R&D, but when the largest company in the space chooses to spend less money developing new products than its two smaller competitors - either the competitors do not know how to run their R&D effort or Check Point could realize a huge amount of leverage in its business by spending more. I know there are readers who will hate me for saying so, but I believe that CHKP literally makes too much money for its own good.There are many readers and observers who talk about how unprofitable it is for companies to spend too much on customer acquisition and too much on development spending. The huge annuity type cash flow that Check Point is getting from its installed base ought to put an end to that argument. The fact is that security products stay installed a very, very long time. And the newest products that CHKP is selling, its software blades within its platform, are going to stay installed for even longer periods than its older point solutions.I think that investors can take the 57% margin and be satisfied. This company rarely loses customers. The company's maintenance stream is now $755 million and growing at 5-6%/year. Maintenance revenues have extremely high margins that usually approach 90% or so in the software space. There is little investment required to man help desks and these days automated, self service systems are often making software maintenance even more profitable. With that kind of a maintenance stream that throws off an enormous level of free cash, this company has the flexibility to make investments that will accelerate its growth rate materially.There is no real reason why this company could not compete successfully and forcefully with Palo Alto and Fortinet, and to some extent, it does. It will never have headline revenue growth rates as high as the other two companies because of its large base of maintenance revenues that are not fast growing at this point. Further, the growth in maintenance revenues will be limited as the company sells more of its newer blade products on a subscription basis. But it certainly has the opportunity to grow subscription revenue as fast as its main rivals, and it could, if it chose to do so, move to a much higher content of subscriptions by accelerating the growth of its blade products.I thought about describing this company as a sleeping giant, but it really is nothing like that at all. It has essentially chosen to grow at a 10% rate and achieve exceptional profitability and cash flow. This company could readily up marketing spend by 50% and could do the same with R&D spend and compete for market share with PANW and FTNT. That might be a bit uncomfortable for current shareholders, but I think achieving at least 15% top-line growth is well within reach and reaching 20% top-line growth is not unimaginable for this companyToday, Check Point remains one of the better GARP names around, perhaps the best there is in the enterprise software space. It could, if it so chose, become a real momentum growth story. My own guess is that this management is not likely to do anything too dramatic based on its background and its time with Check Point. But even if this management team does very little to overtly change directions, I think growth rates are going to start to increase simply because more and more revenue will come from the software blades and from subscriptions and that is the part of its business that has growth rates far above the corporate average - 22% last quarter, in fact.Check Point's shares may not seem all that cheap on some metrics. The company has an EV/S of about 7.7X based on current year revenue estimates. On the other hand, because of its enormous profitability, the company has a P/E of 18.6X based on current year earnings projections. In addition, the company generated over $900 million of operating cash flow this year, which is a cash flow margin of no less than 56%. It has negligible capex and thus has a free cash flow yield based on 2016 estimates of 7.5%.CHKP rarely makes any of the lists of potential acquisition candidates. Partially that is because management owns 28% of the outstanding shares and shows no inclination of wanting to sell and partially it is because the EV/S is quite high. But this company has an impressive technology stack that could be better monetized in terms of shareholder value in my opinion (I doubt that anyone thinks it possible to have cash flow margins of greater than 56%. There is no conceivable way that any acquirer might imagine that the company could be run more efficiently than this management has been doing). If IBM (NYSE:IBM) or HP (NYSE:HP) wanted to do something really transformational, buying this company would achieve that goal. While I doubt if it is going to happen in the next year or two, at some point, Messrs. Shwed and Bar-Lev are going to retire. When that happens, I would not be surprised to see this company acquired.I confess that I like to see companies that are trying to maximize their revenue growth and long-term profitability. But I think that the potential for this company remains underappreciated. I think that the bet investors make is that the company continues to be run along the lines that it has been in which case I suppose returns of 8-10%/year are reasonable to expect. Should the leopard choose to change its spots, there may be some initial consternation among a cohort of the shareholders, but valuations for a company in this space can be pretty high. I like the risk/reward of this name.SymantecCan adult supervision find a solution for Symantec's problems?Symantec is a much harder company to simply classify. It is only a few weeks since it managed to shed one of the largest albatrosses that any company has ever had to deal with in its Veritas operation. The company has seen so many sales force reorganizations that I have simply lost count. The company continues to derive much of its revenue from consumer end-point security. Consumer end-point security is basically the anti-virus packages that most of us buy when we get a new PC. With PC shipments, at best trending flat, I doubt that it would be easy for even an outstanding marketer to get the top line to grow in the anti-virus space in which Symantec's Norton competes.Obviously, it is really hard to grow that line in the income statement absent a change in market share or some fantastic new add-on product or technology. And the fact is that at the moment, most users see little product differentiation between many vendors. In that environment, price means everything and that has wound up benefiting vendors other than Symantec. And while Symantec is in Gartner's ""Magic Quadrant"" for end-point protection platforms, its solution is rated behind competitors including Trend Micro (OTCPK:TMICY) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) (McAfee.) It looks to be in fourth place out of 18 products rated by Gartner. As I said in my prior article, it is possible to find many different ratings for products in the IT space depending on the organization doing the testing and the specific segment being tested. One organization called AV-Test Institute has called Symantec's end-point protection ""the best for consumers."" So, it might be the best of the anti-virus products, or the fourth best, but regardless, the company is not increasing its market share, and the space is contracting and neither of those trends is likely to change any time soon.Unlike the other three companies that I have mentioned as potential investments, Symantec has continued to shrink. Maintenance revenue was down 7%. The company's consumer security segment revenues fell by 10% last quarter to $414 million, and its enterprise security segment fell by 3% to $495 million, although it did grow 1% in constant currency. I don't imagine there are too many observers who think that the consumer security space for Symantec or for anyone else is going to thrive any time in the near future.Needless to say management presented a reasonable and seemingly thorough strategy to monetize its anti-virus technology. I think at this point, most observers would just cheer results that were stable. Is that going to happen? I have heard many pronouncements on the subject from management of this company.The fact is that there are far too many companies within the anti-virus market space. The space is shrinking and many users think of the different solutions as commodities. The economics favor consolidation. I think that Symantec has a reasonable chance of either stabilizing its revenues and improving its profits in consumer end-point security or in selling the division and focusing on what has to be its core asset as this point.Before laying out a potential case for Symantec stock, it is necessary to clear away a bit of underbrush. Symantec's shares went ex-dividend on March 4th with regards to the $4/share special dividend being paid to shareholders as part of the proceeds from the sale of Veritas. The sale of Veritas netted the company $5.3 billion net of taxes. For those interested in such things, Symantec paid $13.5 billion in a stock deal to acquire Veritas in the summer of 2005. In any event, the special dividend cost the company approximately $2.6 billion in cash. In addition, it has committed to purchase an additional $2.3 billion worth of its shares through March 2017. At current prices, $2.3 billion of Symantec's shares would buy close to 140 million shares or about 21% of the shares outstanding. So, essentially Symantec is returning all of the proceeds from the sale of Veritas to its shareholders.In addition to the above, Silver Lake Partners, a well-known and highly regarded VC firm, announced that it was making a $500 million investment in Symantec. The investment will take the form of a 2.5% convertible senior unsecured note which is due in 2021 and which is convertible to SYMC's shares at about 27% above current levels. As part of the transaction, the managing partner of Silver Lake, Ken Hao, will be joining the board at the close of the investment. At this point, nine of Symantec's 10 directors are independent.So, is there a clear path for Symantec going forward? First of all, I have to comment that the old adage about forecasting the future being very difficult because it hasn't happened yet applies here in spades. There is no trend, not really. The CEO has spoken a good game, but the fact is that Symantec's latest quarter saw its Enterprise Security operation increase by 1% in constant currency. The comparable number for Check Point was 9% - but that also included a 56% operating margin, for Fortinet, quarterly organic growth in revenues was 25%, and for Palo Alto, the revenue growth was 54%. So obviously, SYMC has a huge road to climb just to get back to respectability. It obviously has some tools to achieve some measure of success or I wouldn't waste my time writing about this company - I've had my share of misfortunes believing some of what I was told by prior management teams of Symantec.The company has a leadership share in what is called Enterprise Data Loss Prevention. It has a 47% market share in the segment compared to an 18% share for Intel/McAfee and a 4% share for EMC. Gartner's Magic Quadrant for the space shows Symantec with a strong lead compared to the other nine vendors in the survey, most of whom are point providers who, in my opinion, are doomed to extinction by acquisition. DLP is a reasonably strong space with growth apparently around 10%, and Symantec is a share gainer as it has been growing at 15%/year and that trend should continue into the future.Of course, that means that the rest of Symantec's enterprise security portfolio revenues are shrinking. On the latest conference call, management talked a good game with regard to pipeline building and prospect identification. It was all marketing 101, but Symantec has spent a very long time being unable to achieve even a rudimentary level of execution. If it can just implement marketing 101, that would go a long way to improve this company's results.And the company talked about its Unified Data Management Platform and in particular about its Advanced Threat Protection solution and its Managed Security capability. Nice words, and I have heard other similar pledges many times in the past. What's different is that there is little excuse for failure - the Veritas ulcer is gone and not taking management cycles from the key issue that is facing this company. And the other key change is the board. Silver Lake is not known for either its patience or its kinder, gentler approach to performance problems. Ken Hao is one of the consummate dealmakers of all times, and if the strategies for either consumer or enterprise don't work, I think it is relatively clear that the two components of Symantec are likely to go up for sale. This will not be a Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) in the sense that the management team is going to be on a very short leash in which to perform.Like I said, forecasting the future is hard when there are few signposts or trends to aid in the process. The market for enterprise security solutions is strong, the company really does have technologies that are highly rated and seem to work well. About the furthest I can go at the moment is to say is that the downside risks for this company, which has an EV/S of around 2X when all of the underbrush surrounding the Veritas transaction and the payment of the special dividend is cleared up, is that the downside is quite limited, in my opinion. I think the bet one makes in owning Symantec is that the company succeeds, just moderately, and the shares come much closer to the EV/S of other companies in the space. And if it doesn't work out this time, the assets are probably going to be sold aggressively and should almost surely realize more than the current enterprise value. In the meantime, the new dividend rate of $.50/year provides investors with a yield of just about 3%.There are still puts and takes surrounding the Veritas divestiture and one of the bigger puts is the $400 million or so of stranded overhead costs. Management has announced a $400 million/year cost remediation program to rescue the stranded costs and to improve profitability. Again cost reduction programs have been announced several times in the past. I actually do imagine this time will be different because there is adult supervision of the company in the form of nine outside directors.The company has a baseline of $700 million/year in operating cash flow, of which about 20% is derived from the stock-based comp. Capex for this company has been running at a surprisingly high rate of $300 million year. I'm sure that now the divestiture is over, that kind of capex level is going to come under extreme scrutiny. Net of the cost of the dividend and the capex, at the present time, free cash flow is quite a small number. That said, however, free cash flow ought to rise dramatically as the cost savings from the cash reduction program kick in.Some Final ThoughtsNormally, at this point, I would put together lots of background material about both Check Point and Symantec and review their valuation. But some readers have requested shorter articles and hopefully this format fulfills that request.Just to summarize: I think that any investor or portfolio manager who wants representation in the tech space can do much worse than to invest in the enterprise security space. There has been no slowdown in growth in the space, which I believe is probably running at as much as 15%/year and should stay at that level for at least the next two or three years.Many enterprise security companies have valuations at ""nosebleed"" levels as a consequence of their rapid growth and the hidden assets they are building through building a subscription revenue model. Two enterprise security companies with far more modest valuations than their brothers are Check Point and Symantec. In my view, Check Point remains a great GARP story that might easily transform itself into a momentum growth story. Its operating margins of 57% are spectacular, and in the view of this writer, too high. But there are many investors who like current profits in lieu of future growth, and for them, a Check Point investment is ideal.Symantec, simply put, is more of a crap shoot. The sale of Veritas is surely a wonderful thing that will allow the company a fresh start. The addition of Ken Hao to the board, in my mind, guarantees that this company will do the best job that it can within the constraints of the enterprise software market. If the turnaround doesn't show rapid progress, I imagine that the nine outside directors led by Mr. Hao are going to insist on further divestitures. Either way, it seems to me the risk/reward favors investors."

(NASDAQ:FB), one of the most successful technology companies ever, Zuckerberg is a genius when it comes to technology.But despite Zuckerberg's financial resources and tech smarts, the young billionaire recently fell prey to hackers.In early June, Zuckerberg's Twitter and Pinterest accounts were hacked.The perpetrators found Zuckerberg's passwords --""dadada"" -- in a database of more than 100 million usernames and passwords that were stolen from LinkedIn in 2012.Although Zuckerberg suffered little reputation damage from the incident, the hacking was a bit embarrassing. After all, his company warns its users not to use their Facebook passwords anywhere else online.However, the hacking actually places Mark Zuckerberg in good company.Hacking is going viral in 2016. The headlines have been filled with high-profile hackings threatening the most powerful private and public institutions in the world.In May, Myspace was hacked and had 360 million email addresses and passwords stolen.Experts are saying it could be the largest hack ever.Last week Dropbox, one of the world's largest suppliers of cloud storage, had more than 68 million account details leaked.Hacking is hitting the public sector just as hard.In July the Democratic National Convention was hacked.Hackers recently breached databases for election systems in Arizona and Illinois.Leakedsource.com, a company that sells access to stolen data, says it has added more than a billion records to its databases since May.Being hacked can be devastating for a company, costing tens of millions in lost revenue and legal fees. Add in reputational damage or patent infringement, and losses can spiral into the billions.Sony is the perfect example. When the global leader was hacked in 2015 the breech brought the company to its knees. Estimates suggest the hacking cost Sony $35 million in IT repairs alone.The threat of being hacked will have companies and governments has sent cyber security spending soaring in the last five years. Take a look below.Looking forward, cyber security spending is set to accelerate.According to market research firm Gartner, the global cyber security market topped $75 billion in 2015. Gartner expects the market to grow to $100 billion by 2018. Market research firm Markets and Markets expects the global cyber security market to hit $175 billion by 2020.This tidal wave of spending is creating a great investment opportunity. It has never been a better time to be a cyber security company. These companies are in position to record revenue and earnings.Today I am going to help your profit from this trend.One way to profit is with PureFunds ISE Cyber Security (HACK). Launched in December of 2014, this ETF has been around for less than two years. This fund currently holds 34 cyber security stocks, making it an excellent way for investors to gain diversified exposure to the cyber security industry.Another way to profit is by investing in an individual company. Below is a list of industry leaders that I expect to benefit from more spending on cyber security.From this list, two stocks caught my attention in particular. Both of these companies recently reported record revenue, and I am expecting more of the same in the second half of the year.Check Point Software (CHKP) develops both hardware and software designed to increase network security for large companies. Checkpoint has been on a roll in 2016. Revenue just hit a new all-time high, putting Checkpoint on pace to grow earnings by 8% in 2016. Analysts are projecting another 7% earnings growth in 2017. Many cyber security stocks trade with high valuations, but not Check Point. Its forward P/E of 18 is a sharp discount to the industry average 78, and is in line with the S&P 500.CyberArk Software (CYBR) develops cyber security software with a focus on the financial, energy, retail and healthcare industries. In the last five years, CyberArk's revenue has surged, climbing 164%. Take a look below.Those impressive revenue gains have helped CyberArk crush earnings expectations, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 68% in the last four quarters. Looking forward, analysts expect CyberArk to grow earnings by 30% in 2017.Risks To Consider: Investors are expecting big things from cyber security stocks. That has many of the industry's most promising companies trading with nose-bleed valuations. The industry has an average P/E ratio of 78. CyberArk has a P/E ratio of 69. The industry will need to continue delivering huge revenue growth for shares to move higher.Action To Take: For conservative investors, HACK and Check Point are the best fit. HACK offers diversified exposure to the industry by holding 34 stocks, while Check Point is one of the industry's biggest companies. For aggressive, growth investors, CyberArk is the best fit.This article was originally published on StreetAuthority.com."
3615056,50662,2015-10-28T14:50:44-04:00,"Check Point Software is a free cash flow cow and will generate $700M+ in free cash flow this year.Not only does the balance sheet have positive working capital of almost $700M, it has an additional $2.3B in marketable securities as long-term investment.The continuous share buybacks will boost the free cash flow per share to $4.70 by the end of 2017.","IntroductionOne of my readers told me I should have a look at Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP). After carefully reading the company's SEC filings, I wish I had done this sooner as Check Point has all the elements I have been looking for.Everything seems to be going as planned at Check PointCheck Point Software didn't disappoint in the third quarter of the current financial year as the revenue increased by almost 10% compared to the same quarter last year. The amount of operating expenses remained very limited, but increased slightly faster than the revenue, leading to an operating income of $204.6M, or approximately 4% higher than the previous year. I'm almost blown away by Check Point's operating margin, which was in excess of 50% in the third quarter.Source: SEC filingsThat wasn't just a lucky shot as the operating margins have remained quite stable throughout the entire financial year and the average operating margin in the first nine months of this year was 51.2%! It's also extremely refreshing to see the company actually reported positive financial income instead of having to pay interest expenses on debt. This $25M cash inflow in the first nine months of the financial year and the relatively low average tax rate of approximately 20% allowed Check Point to report a net profit of $491M in the first nine months of the financial year, a very nice 3.7% increase compared to the same period last year. And because Check Point Software has repurchased in excess of 9 million shares in the past 12 months, the EPS actually increased by 8.8% to $2.72.I admit I'm a cash flow nerd and I prioritize the importance of a company's cash flow statements over the income statement. What I'm usually looking for is companies that are able to convert a nice part of the revenue and net profit into free cash flow.Source: SEC filingsAnd that's definitely the case at Check Point Software. In the first nine months of the current financial year, the company generated $705M in operating cash flow and even after adjusting this number for the changes in the company's working capital position, the adjusted operating cash flow remains quite high at $558M. Most software companies only have limited amounts of capital expenditures, and Check Point's situation isn't different at all. The capex in the first nine months was just $10.2M (less than 1% of its revenue), resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of $548M. I do expect the capex to increase a bit in the final quarter of this year, but I'd be really disappointed if Check Point Software would generate less than $700-720M in free cash flow in this year. Based on an expected amount of 175M shares outstanding by the end of this year, the free cash flow per share should be in excess of $4.The working capital position might give you the wrong idea about the balance sheet strengthAt first sight, Check Point's balance sheet looks okay with a working capital position of almost $700M. What's important is that a stunning $1.3B of the company's current assets consists of cash, marketable securities and short-term deposits and the total value of the receivables is just $220M, or just 6 weeks of revenue. That already is extremely robust, but there's an additional positive factor here.Source: SEC filingsThe company has an additional $2.3B in marketable securities, but has chosen to add these to the long-term asset side of the balance sheet. This means the total amount of cash, ST deposits and marketable securities is in excess of $3.6B and that really is an enviable position.It also allows the company to continue its share repurchases at a rate of $250M per quarter, even though the adjusted free cash flow is lower than that amount. In the first nine months of the current year, Check Point has spent a total of $676M on share repurchases (net of option exercise proceeds). Should Check Point continue to spend approximately $1B per year on share repurchases, I'd expect the company to end the financial year 2017 with just 152-155 million shares outstanding. So even if the free cash flow would remain stable at $725M per year, the FCF/share will very likely increase to around $4.7 resulting in a forward free cash flow yield of 5.5%.Investment thesisThe current free cash flow yield based on the company's market capitalization isn't very high, but as Check Point has several billions in relatively liquid assets and no long-term debt, the enterprise value is much lower (if you'd include the long-term marketable securities in the equation) resulting in an adjusted free cash flow of almost 7%.I'm very interested in initiating a stake in Check Point Software, but might opt to write a put option for the time being. I'm particularly interested in a put option expiring in April of next year with a strike price of $77.5/share. The option premium is $2.35, which is approximately 3% in six months' time. And If I'd be assigned to acquire the shares, I'd do so at $75.15 per share resulting in a forward free cash flow yield of 8%!"
3493736,37771,2015-09-07T14:12:18-04:00,"Check Point has largely been absent from the rally in cybersecurity stocks this year, but its place as one of the most established players in the space will be a positive.The company has no debt, stellar margins, and $3.6B in cash and investments on hand.Check Point has been increasing its stock buyback authorization and has a threat prevention partnership in place with FireEye.","Despite the volatility and bearishness we've seen in equities during the months of August and September, cybersecurity companies have largely done pretty well this year. By the end of June, many of the big name cybersecurity stocks were up 30% or more on the year. That is, all except one.CHKP data by YChartsCheck Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP) was noticeably left behind in the cybersecurity boom earlier this year. By all accounts, it delivered solid earnings reports for each of Q4, Q1 and Q2 delivering earnings & revenue beats, announcing stock buybacks and partnerships with other firms like FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE). The one thing that each of those reports lacked was strong forward guidance. Each quarter's guidance came in essentially in line with previous expectations. In a high growth sector like cybersecurity, in-line guidance just doesn't cut it.That's not entirely surprising given where Check Point is in the business cycle compared to the likes of other cybersecurity companies like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and FireEye. Whereas most in the sector have been publicly traded companies for only a year or two, Check Point has been public since 1996. Whereas its peers are spending heavily in the name of growth at the expense of profit, Check Point is at a more mature stage of the business cycle, and is being valued as such.Consider the 5-year growth projections of many of the big names in cybersecurity.Check Point is easily expected to grow at the slowest pace of any of its main competitors. But as we've seen in the market over the last few weeks, growth is not always rewarded. Investors who still want exposure to the cybersecurity space, but maybe not as much of the risk that comes with some individuals names, might want to focus on Check Point because it is perhaps the most mature and fundamentally sound of all the companies in the cybersecurity space.When comparing these companies, I like to use a handful of ratios and figures that I'll discuss in a moment. It's not meant to be all-inclusive but it does point us in the right direction. A word of warning right off the bat... I'm aware that others like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) are also in the cybersecurity space. For this exercise, I'm just considering these eight larger companies below whose primary business is cybersecurity.Comparing high growth companies like these using a price/earnings multiple is largely not useful, considering most aren't focused on earnings at this point, so I like to look at price/sales instead.Check Point falls roughly in the middle of this group, but well ahead of big players Palo Alto and FireEye. Infoblox (NYSE:BLOX) actually looks pretty reasonably valued, especially considering that it's now turning a profit but concerns over the notion that growth might not be sustainable as well as the fact that the company's CFO is leaving has cast a bit of a shadow over the stock.Check Point's balance sheet also looks pretty clean considering it has over $3.6B in cash and investments on hand and no short or long term debt. Debt is largely not an issue in this space, however. Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), Infoblox and Barracuda (NYSE:CUDA) essentially have no debt either. FireEye just added debt in the last quarter and Palo Alto's debt just moved from the long term to the short-term line item so it could be in the process of disappearing.The real differentiator for Check Point is in its margins. Profit and operating margins for Check Point have been stellar for many years. That shouldn't necessarily be surprising for a company that's been around for 20 years and its competitors are still in their relative infancy, so it's expected we'd see negative margins there. It does, however, distinguish Check Point as a more stable and established company with solid fundamentals when compared to its fast growing counterparts.ConclusionCybersecurity has been a hot sector for several months now, and with many of these companies, it's not surprising that fundamentals are largely out of whack. Check Point has been the exception to the rule. It consistently beat earnings & revenue estimates, its margins are high, it's debt free, and it's reasonably priced (as could be evidenced by its forward P/E ratio of 17).For those looking to limit risk, the cybersecurity ETF (NYSEARCA:HACK) is another good option. However, if you're looking at individual names in the sector and want a less risky, more established name that will likely survive any future consolidation in the sector, Check Point might be where you want to start."
3977336,98236,2016-05-24T09:29:43-04:00,"Check Point appears to be in the process of losing its position as the world's largest network security vendor to Palo Alto.The company is one of, if not the most profitable IT company in the enterprise IT space.That position is a function of sky-high gross margins of above 80% on hardware.It is also a function of lower than normal spending on both R&D and G&A.The company has a capital allocation strategy unusual for a growth enterprise and is not broadening its product footprint by acquisition despite user desires to deal with fewer vendors.","Check Point-Becoming #2 is really an uncomfortable place to beI have always wondered what it must be like to have had a long run as #1 in the world and then cede the title. Friday's WSJ carried an article to the effect that Rafael Nadal had been bumped up to a 4 th seed at Wimbledon because of an extended recovery period for Roger Federer. Rafael has apparently lost much of his hair and has a plethora of injuries and is only ranked 9 th in the world tennis rankings. I know that the purpose of the article was to make us realize the valor and pluckiness of the erstwhile champion, and perhaps I should feel that way-but really feeling sorry for Rafael Nadal is a bit beyond my compass.Perhaps less heralded, but of equal significance to that narrow group of people who follow tech stocks is that the crown in the cyber-security space is in the process of passing from Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) to Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW). Not in profits to be sure-that day is in the unforeseeable future. But in terms of reported revenues which is an important milestone, I believe. PANW is expected to report around $340 million in revenues when it releases its fiscal Q3 earnings after the close on Thursday. Depending on how it guides and the inevitable revisions to analyst consensus estimates, PANW is forecast to reach $390 million in revenues in the quarter that will end 7/31.There are many readers on this site and elsewhere who have essentially anthropomorphized Check Point shares. I can understand that readers/investors do not like to see their investment beliefs challenged. All I can say is that I try to be open and objective to commentators but I also try to do analysis of what I see and not to accept the received wisdom. And this article is not meant to be an evaluation of the company's technology vis-à-vis its competitors. It is meant to be a discussion of what the financial outlook is for this company as it loses its long held #1 position in security networking. It is really meant to be a discussion in whether Check Point can produce positive alpha for investors.To be sure, there was a high visibility call by brokerage Piper Jaffrey earlier this month to the effect that its most recent survey had found weakness in demand for Palo Alto solutions. The specifics of the call were that headline numbers would be good but that bookings would be below expectations. I don't know whether that call is accurate or not and whether or not any bookings weakness at PANW during its fiscal Q1 might translate into broad weakness in the network security space. Palo Alto will report its numbers later this week and I have no particular insight as to what they might be. But regardless, I think the trend that I will lay out in this article will be valid with regard to the outlook for Check Point, regardless of PANW's quarterly report.Just to set the scene, in the current quarter that ended on April 30th, PANW is supposed to achieve $340 million of total revenues up 45% from the year earlier period. Estimates for the next several quarters are that the company will average between $50-$100 million/ quarter in growth.Check Point, on the other hand did $404 million in total revenues in its March ending quarter and is expected to achieve $422 million in its June ending quarter and then to record $433 million its September quarter and average between $20 million and $50 million the33reafter.. So, depending on the exact impact of seasonality, in either Q3 or Q4 of PANW's fiscal '17 year, (ends 1/31/17) it will likely take over the top spot in terms of revenues in the cyber security world.Interestingly, Piper, it seems, wants to have it both ways. It reduced the price target for PANW significantly based on slowing growth but it kept the shares as buy rated. It says that regardless of what PANW prints later this week it is its favorite network security name and that it has top spot in network security growth.Being #1 or being #2 may not sound like all that much. There are business segments where being #1 counts for little. Some years ago there was a major ad campaign in which Avis bragged about #2. Being #2 made it try harder or so the slogan went.In the IT world where perception and momentum can be important the just product quality or product functionality, the loss of a #1 position will not be a trivial event. I would be surprised if there were not a ton of press releases heralding the changing of the guard, so to speak.I initially wrote about Check Point as a value play in the network security space back in early March when the shares were $84 and they are now $83. Not much alpha in that. Over that same period, the IGV software tech index has gone $96 to $103 while the shares of arch-rival Palo Alto have gone from $151 to $142. Check Point's share price performance issue has been essentially a product of the company's Q2 guide down. The shares fell from a peak of almost $90/share set just before the earnings release to a trough of $83/share set in the wake of disappointing Q2 guidance. The Q2 guidance was far more a function of the accounting treatment of the mix between the company's hardware/appliance products which is recognized when delivered and the company's blade software products which are typically a part of the company's appliances and are thus recognized over the course of a year. The CFO of Check Point, Tal Payne, suggested that about $5-$10 million of revenue, and about $.03 in EPS would move from Q2 to the last 2 quarters of the year.I am not particularly distressed or concerned about how a bit of revenue is being recognized. What bothers me far more is that the company's transition from #1 to #2 in its space is continuing. And what bothers me is the steps that management is likely to take in order to try to stop from losing more share in a highly competitive market.At some level, and based on current consensus estimates for the current year and the next, this company really doesn't have a completely elevated valuation. The P/E is just over 18X although the EV/S is about 7.5X because of the company's very high profit margins which elevate earnings far beyond those that are typical for most technology companies.My concerns are that the company's exceptional margins are likely to come under pressure going forward. My concerns are that the company may find it more difficult than appreciated to stop hemorrhaging market share. And overall, my concern is that the company will no longer be able to deliver steady, solid increases in EPS and revenues that have been its hallmark for several years now. Not, perhaps, a strident short call-I have no smoking gun or catalyst that would lead to a short term share price implosion, but a suggestion that despite its apparent value this is a name that should be avoided by investors.A high level discussion of what is the currently driving market share Enterprise Network Security Space!There really is no way I can make this discussion simple and straightforward. Were I able to access a graph, depicting the market share of CHKP and its numerous competitors, making some kind of projection for future market share changes would be far simpler than it is. Sadly, such charts really don't exist. About the best statistics that we have is that what is described as the network security space will surpass $10 billion this year and it is projected to grow at 9.5% until 2020. So, if CHKP is growing at 7% as consensus estimates suggest, it is losing market share. I suspect, actually, that a more encompassing definition of the network security market would show a significantly larger revenues with a growth rate noticeably higher than that projected by Gartner. Definitions in this case are really in the eyes of the beholder. But the question has to be why has CHKP been a seemingly serial market share contributor and what are the consequences of continued market share declines.As many readers know, Check Point essentially developed the first cyber security technology. Founder and CEO Gil Shwed had the initial idea behind the company's core technology, ""stateful inspection."" The company's initial product, Firewall-1 speaks to the company's innovation at that point. Shortly thereafter, the company launched its VP-1, one of the first VPN products to be released. By 1996, the company was named #1 in worldwide market share for firewalls, with a share of 40%. By that time, the company launched its IPO and raised $67 million. Although modified and improved many, many times with additional features added, the R77 version of VPN-1 is still a Check Point product.Initially the company distributed its products through OEM agreements with Sun, Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and others but it has developed a hybrid model that involves direct salespeople, independent reps and independent dealers.I don't intend to get into a debate as to whether or not CHKP products are better than those offered by its principle competitors such as Palo Alto, Fortinet, Fire Eye and many, many others. The fact is that there are some readers who use or have used network security products from different vendors and have formed their own opinions as to which solutions work better and which are deficient. But in the enterprise software/network security space, the race is more often to those vendors who have mastered the arts of selling and of marketing. And that appears to be exactly what is happening in the network security market.The 2016 Gartner network security report will not be released until the end of this month. So the comments I'm going to quote from, are, of necessity, from the June 2015 report but worth looking at nonetheless. Check Point and Palo Alto are alone in the leader's quadrant according to Gartner with the Challengers box limited to just Fortinet and Cisco. There are no fewer than 16 other niche players competing for the market. A relatively well known security specialist, Fire Eye is not included in network security because it offers a far more specialized solution for breach detection, while other vendors offer breach detection solutions as part of their total stack.In any event, the relevant Gartner review on CHKP says that Check Point continued to demonstrate strong technical scores and execution. Gartner praised the company's pervasive channel ecosystem and broad product footprint. Check Point appears to have two major problems according to Gartner. In addition to be a market leader in technology it is apparently a market leader on price, having what are perceived to be expensive solutions that are frequently undercut by competition, particularly on renewal deals. But most telling to me, is Gartner's comment that Check Point customers also tend to be more hesitant to adopt more emerging technologies which Garner blamed in part on Check Point's insufficient marketing operations.The articles I write are not intended to be a buyer's guide for technology but a guide to achieving positive alpha in the space. The number of times I have seen Gartner use a word such as ""insufficient"" is quite rare. The organization is loath to criticize industry participants directly given that these participants are one of Gartner's chief sources of revenues. So, I can only imagine that Gartner saw glaring weaknesses in Check Point's marketing capability. One thing I think ought to be evident to investors is that in the IT space, vendors who have insufficient marketing presence and high prices will tend to lose market share over time and will rarely be companies that can produce positive alpha.By comparison, Gartner is impressed by Palo Alto's product road map and its partnership with VMware NSK (NYSE:VMW). Interestingly, Gartner wrote that Palo Alto's foray into end point security hasn't been the same wild success as it has had in the firewall market. They felt that PANW was being far too optimistic about the performance of the company's anti-virus solutions and they saw it as a high risk strategy that could backfire. Is it possible that there are now too many security specialists all with comparable solutions?In the interests of space efficiency, I am not going to review in any detail Garner's commentary on either Fortinet or Cisco. Basically the Gartner analysis said that Fortinet has effective products and is displacing competitors based on value and performance but some specific features and its ability to articulate its vision are holding it back. But in summing up, it was Gartner's opinion that the company. could do a better job marketing its Feature Select as a made-for enterprise solution. Further the company needs to overcome its lingering brand disadvantage. Products good, marketing not so much. When it comes to network security there are quite a few vendors with decent solutions but many of them don't know how to sell what they have.Cisco is said to be winning, when it does win, because of its strong channel and aggressive discounting. Cisco mainly wins in situations where the user is buying a whole suite of networking solutions of which just a part is network security. The company actually scores quite low versus competitors in assessments both based on its technology and user satisfaction with performance. The company's recent earnings release depicts the relative strength of its security offering even though Gartner says its product ranks low in user satisfaction.There are no fewer than 13 competitors in Gartner's niche quadrant. A niche rating is a bad place to wind up and there are some big names in the space such as Intel/McAfee, Dell/SonicWall, and Barracuda.I think a few sentences about Barracuda are of interest. Gartner says that Barracuda is a strong competitor with clients who choose based on price, have other Barracuda offerings, or are looking for a simple deployment. But its negatives, cited by Gartner, were that its client base was not yet well established and none of its competitors named it as a significant threat. Further, Gartner said that the company's product naming was confusing for enterprise clients. While the NG Firewall solution is effective in the market at which it is targeted, the company does not effectively sell its enterprise capable product outside of Europe.Sadly, none of the vendors in the Gartner study is considered a visionary. I actually thought that being a visionary was a good thing but its box is below the Leader's quadrant. Why a leader is better than a visionary I leave to the good folks at Gartner to explain. I would like my articles that I publish on this site to be considered those of a visionary, but the Seeking Alpha team doesn't make those kind of ratingsSome conclusions worth drawing and how they relate to Check PointI think one thing worthy of note is just how many times Gartner used the words marketing or sales execution in its analysis. And the fact is that many companies have decent products but lack a decent sales effort and thus are on the fringes of the network security space looking in. There are simply loads of decent network security solutions, so many in fact that users are hard put to differentiate simply based on product quality. So, some of them make decisions based on who has the best presentations, the most impressive product road maps or who can establish some kind of working connection with decision makers at clients.Other potential users, faced with too many choices do what rational buyers have always done and put a security project up to competitive bid. If the products are more or less the same, than cheaper is better. Most users in the 2nd decade of the 21 st century realize that price is a tendentious term. It isn't so much the first instance price that matters but the total cost of ownership (TCO). And the TCO is going to be quite different depending on the circumstances and requirements of particular users. Vendors just can't announce a low price and expect customers will be a path to their respect doors. The saying ""When a tree falls in a lonely forest, and no animal is nearby to hear it, does it make a sound"" is certainly relevant here. And finally, it appears that users very much want to use fewer vendors who can take care of more than just security. Indeed, users can tolerate mediocre products and stiff prices if a vendor can offer them a soup to nuts menu of network and network security solutions.If one takes these conclusions together they spell some significant challenges for CHKP going forward. Not because the company's products aren't the best. Multiple surveys show that if Check Point doesn't have the best solution in a specific category they are second or third and the CEO, Gil Shwed is the founder of network security and is obviously one of the visionaries of these times regarding trends in the space. But to the extent that marketing is important in the selection of vendors, CHPT has a problem since it is said to have inadequate marketing by none other than the leading market research firm in this space.To the extent that price is important, CHKP has issues. Not only do users talk about that but it is borne out by gross margin analysis. I cover that below with a bit of granularity. (I have to say at this point, that just looking at GM between vendors is a fraught exercise. Palo Alto sells lots of software and Check Point has a revenue mix in which its software blades only make up 22% of total revenues. Software gross margins are inevitably higher than hardware gross margins by a huge amount. In this case, as I show below, that really doesn't matter all that much.) But often it is perceptions more than reality that matter.Another point that can be made is that network security companies would probably be well advised to become more than network security companies. Cisco would have a negligible market share if it weren't the leader in overall networking. And as was seen in last week's earnings report, network security is one of the few growth parts of their business. The inevitable concomitant of that is that Cisco will intensify its efforts in the space and at some point could be, a competitive problem for Check Point.To sum up, even with the best products in the world, if a vendor has inadequate marketing, has a reputation, deserved or not, for high prices, and sells network security and nothing but network security, that vendor, which in this case is Check Point is going to have problems in maintaining a dominant market share.There are to be sure solutions and management is well aware of some or all of these issues. During the conference call in the wake of earnings, Gil Shwed in his prepared remarks talked about extending the company's product footprint into the IoT. The company continues to emphasize product differentiation such as through the release of its newest R80 converged security management platform. The company has recently started offering multi-year discounts in some instances to ward off competition. Another quote from Mr. Shwed is also relevant, ""It's a very competitive environment. And as we invest in augmenting our sales force and in being-and in having more people on the street, so do our competitors. So we have no intention to scale that down…"" I think that one may infer from that comment is that Check Point management is beginning to feel some heat and that it has decided to ramp its sales and marketing spend to attempt to deal with that problem regardless of the short term financial consequences.I think I see where you are going with all of this-but isn't it time to take a look at the financials?Check Point is perhaps the most profitable company that there is in the enterprise IT space. Last year, it posted non-GAAP margins of 57%. That is extraordinary for a software company; it is simply unprecedented for a company that actually gets some of its revenues by selling physical products. In Q4 2015, typically the yearly highpoint for margins, non-GAAP operating margins came to 57%. In Q1-2016, non GAAP operating margins were 55% compared to 58% in the year earlier period. While Check Point has some stock based comp, it is less than 5% of revenues and it is falling. It will have no impact on this discussion.The company had GAAP gross margins of 89% in Q1-2016 compared to 89% last year and 88.5% for the full year 2015. In that number, the company's product margin was 82% in the full year of 2015 and was 81.5% in this year's Q1. To say that it is unusual to see gross margins at such levels is an understatement. To see product gross margins in excess of 80% is basically unprecedented. Check Point may have superior technology and stop more threats more quickly than its competitors. On the other hand, unless this company has discovered a secret for building its appliances unknown to everyone else in this business, its gross margins almost inevitably are a significant target for other industry participants. Value engineering and reverse engineering happen all of the time in the tech space. It is hard to enjoy long term advantages in the cost of building solutions.Just for comparison, Cisco had overall gross margins of about 64% and product gross margins of 64%. Looking at PANW, that company's overall gross margins in the latest reported quarter were 72% and product gross margins were 73%. All of the above figures are GAAP. So Check Point had significantly higher gross margins than those achieved by Cisco, a much larger company and higher gross margins than PANW, the company most comparable to Check Point.The usual resolution of those kind of margin anomalies is not pretty. It is really hard to believe that Check Point, without economies of scale compared to Cisco, builds its products more cheaply than that company. And PANW is constantly introducing value engineered refinements in its offerings. Again, over time, companies that sell their products for gross margins percentages almost unheard of in any business, let alone the IT world, will usually find themselves undercut by competition and will start to lose share. Check Point management is hardly unaware of these trends. It believes that its network management platform,particularly the relatively new R80 offering is a significant and unduplicated offering.There faint, very faint signs of what might be price competition emerging. On the call, the CEO was asked about the introduction of long term contracts with discounts. He chose not to answer the question which is not terribly surprising. No CEO is ever going to tell a large audience that his pricing is in response to price competition. But he did say this much, ""Deferred revenues are affected by customer wishes, sometimes there can be a few large transactions as the customer brings a deal of three, four sometimes even five years, and it can easily fluctuate the number…"" I tend to look at deferred revenues sequentially because that is how they happen. Long term deferred revenues were down by $95 million or 34% sequentially and current deferred revenues were down by 3%. Again, I think that listeners were supposed to infer from those remarks that the company does offer multi-year discounts and because this has become more prevalent, in quarters where users do not sign as many long term deals, deferred revenues can decline.There are reasons why that might happen other than discounting including seasonality. But perhaps it is a portent. That is about all I can say at this point.The issue of marketing spend is what it is. I do not spend my life buying network security products so I could not objectively suggest that Check Point's solutions aren't sold as well as they could be. But the numbers themselves tell the tale. Last year, Check Point's sales and marketing expense rose from 20% of revenues to 22% of revenues. In Q1 of this year, Sales and marketing expense rose to 22.6% of revenues compared to 20.4% in the year earlier period. I don't imagine that the changes, small though they were, were accidental. Check Point is feeling some of the cold winds of competition and needs more sales heads and a higher profile to respond.And looking at spending by Palo Alto, which over the past 12 months was about 30% smaller on a sales basis than Check Point brings home the point. . In the last 4 quarters, PANW spent 55.5% of revenue on Sales and Marketing. In its last reported quarter, the ratio was 56%. Again, all of these figures are GAAP which most accurately reflects the people and resources being thrown at sales and marketing. In aggregate dollar terms, PANW spent $639 million on sales and marketing and marketing over the past 12 months' while CHKP spent $375 million. So, just looking at the past 12 months, Check Point, which averaged 30% higher in revenues over the period, spent just 59% of the sales and marketing dollars when compared to PANW.I am just going to touch on R&D spending comparisons for a moment. Over the last 12 months, Check Point spent about 9% of its revenues or $161 million on R&D over the past 12 months. The comparable figures for Palo Alto have been a spend of 20% of trailing 12 month revenues, or $235 million. There is a hoary saying by both Voltaire and by Napoleon to the effect that ""God is on the side of the big battalions."" We would have to alter that quotation to fit the circumstances of modern military engagements where technology is at least as important as numbers. But surely Palo Alto gets something for its extra 50% R&D spending dollars. And I think it would be difficult to say that Palo Alto spending is unwise or improvident. After all, Nir Zuk, the company's founder and CTO was once upon a time the chief engineer at Check Point and was one of the developers of stateful inspection technology. And one of the company's other founders, Rajiv Batra who continues to have an integral role in managing engineering teams at Palo Alto held similar jobs at Bay Networks, VitalSigns and Perlbit.There are going to be some readers who will say that Check Point is very well known and PANW has to spent such a huge amount of its revenues on S&M just to catch up. Some readers might say that Palo Alto spends its sales and marketing costs unwisely or that contrariwise Check Point is far more efficient in its sales and marketing spend. Some readers might say that PANW can't keep up such a high level of sales and marketing spend and that all Check Point need do is outwait that company. There are other readers who say that PANW is not getting anything substantive in terms of product advantage for its elevated R&D. And others will say that R&D spending cannot be long sustained by Palo Alto at such elevated levels.But the fact is that PANW does report some level of non-GAAP profits and its recorded cash flow from operations over the past 12 months was $499 million or a cash flow margin of 43%. It would be hard to argue that PANW will not spend a huge sum of money on sales & marketing and R&D so long as it is sustaining a high growth rate and taking significant market share. The fact is that its business model generates huge amounts of deferred revenue ($393 million over the past 12 months.) It has all the resources it needs to continue to spend an outside proportion of revenues on sales and marketing and R&D.So what is really going on? Of course it is a function of opinions. One doesn't expect management to be forthright on the point, and some managements simply want to confronting issues like these with what will inevitably be uncomfortable transformations. When I look at these types of comparison, I'm inclined to believe that the simplest answer is most likely to be correct. For some years Check Point was king of the hill. Now it is having to fight to retain its market share but it is doing so with one very important hand tied behind its back. I really do not wish to try to figure out whose NexGen firewall is the best. I do want to suggest that at least in marketing spend and R& D spend, God is really on the side of the big battalions. The CEO of this company has a decision to make. Does he accept demotion to second place in the network security space or does he ramp sales and marketing spend significantly. Neither choice is going to be palatable to investors.The last issue, which really doesn't relate to anything quantifiable is how CHKP can or should broaden its product footprint through acquisition. Check Point, for a company that has been so successful and which is so profitable, has really not been a particularly acquisitive company over the years, Last year it made 2 acquisitions including Hyperwise and Lacoon Mobile. Hyperwise was essentially the purchase of a development start-up in the area of CPU threat Prevention. Lacoon Mobile apparently cost $80 million The company provides advanced threat protection in the area of what are known as Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD) that are running IOS and Android operating systems.Last year, CHKP generated $917 million of operating cash and spent $986 million buying back shares as well as spending $96 million on acquisitions and $17 million on CapEx. There are many readers and analysts who might favor that kind of capital allocation strategy. It is certainly appropriate for mature companies in mature industries. I simply don't think that the network security space, which is, overall, growing at 10% or so, one of the highest growth rates in any enterprise IT sector is mature. I happen to believe that spending more than 100% of cash flow on buying back shares is not an optimal asset allocation strategy for a growth company in a growth industry. Ultimately, it leaves the door open for other competitors to find acquisitions that can change the competitive playing field.I mentioned above, in reviewing the Gartner comments on companies in the space Gartner about companies in this space strongly suggest that customers want companies with broad product lines. Indeed, it is apparent that Cisco's success in network security is almost entirely a function of it being able to offer an end to end network solution. Other vendors similarly situated include Dell's SonicWall , Juniper and McAfee/Intel.Not all companies are fond of making acquisitions or have the skill set to be industry consolidators. It could be that the management of CHKP is content to lose market share if the alternative means taking the risks of acquisition. But given the issues that this company has with regards to market share losses highlighted above, and given its massive operating cash flow which is no less than 56% of revenues last year it seems that a prudent strategy, to nothing of an aggressive strategy would be to open the spigot on spending to broaden the product line or to enter adjacent area.. The company has more than $1.2 billion in cash available and no debt and as it is an Israeli company the familiar problem of the location of cash balances is not an issue.OK-But just because it seems to have an issue in terms of growth doesn't necessarily make it a bad investment. Cisco isn't growing much but it has been a far better stock than some of the higher valued names lately.But the big difference is that CSCO has a dividend and provides investors with a nearly a 4% yield which is a payout ratio of 41% Even if Check Point chose to payout 41% of its after-tax income, which is buoyed to some degree by a very low Israeli tax rate, its' yield would be just 2.4%.I have discussed some of the standard valuation metrics at the start of the article. These included an EV/S estimate of 7.5X and a P/E on the consensus estimate for 2016 of 18.3X. The company has a free cash flow yield of 7.1% and it would be higher than that on the likely cash flow it will generate in 2016. Check Point's valuation would be modest for a growth company that had strategies in place that would at least preserve its market share. At the present time, without those strategies, the company seems to be a long term market share donor. Donors are nice things to be in some walks of life. But they are not things you want your investment to be, not if you want to reap differentiated positive alpha.The company has a mean price target of $90 from 25 analysts offering opinions. Their ratings on the name are right in the middle of the ratings scale. Analyst estimates are for earnings to grow by 9% next year compared to 7% growth rate estimate. Most of that difference is a function of anticipated share buybacks. Overall, looking at consensus expectations, analysts do think that CHKP shares are cheap since their price target is just 8% higher than the current price of the shares. But more concerning to me, is that there are many more ways this company could miss consensus expectations rather than beat them.Wrapping Up!I initially wrote about Check Point in a favorable light in my article titled ""The value cohort of the network security space."" In general, network security stocks have not been fun investments to have made over the last couple of months and this one, down now by 2.4% since that time has underperformed the IGV software index by a few percentage points. The major reason for that was, ironically, a Q2 guide down that was basically meaningless as full year guidance was left unchanged.My issues with this company stem from structural issues that will cost the company its number 1 ranking in the network security space that it has maintained in network security since it pioneered the space more than 20 years ago. While not discussing the specific impacts of losing its title to competitor Palo Alto, they are likely to manifold and visible.The company's basic problem is not the breadth or quality of its offerings in the network security space which seem to be as formidable today as they have been for many years. It has a couple of basic issues that are part of a conundrum. This company is one of the most profitable IT companies that there have ever been. Its profitability is primarily a product of sky-high gross margins, higher than any of its competitors and very low relative spend on both marketing and R&D.The Gartner survey has suggested that many users of Network Security buy on price and this company is perceived as having significantly higher prices than its competitors. There are signs, however faint, that management recognizes that price competition may become more formidable and the company has chosen to offer its largest customers, discounts on multi-year deals to prevent erosion of its installed base.The company was said both by consultants and customers alike to have a deficient marketing strategy. Why that might be, I can only guess. But the fact is that until recently, this company had been more or less complacent in terms of the competition. With surveys showing just how important marketing is in terms of sales momentum something is going to have to change. Either this company significantly increases its S&M spend, or it will remain a market share donor.Finally, the company's capital return strategy is disappointing for a growth company. Last year the company made two small acquisitions and returned all of the rest of its cash flow to shareholders in terms of buybacks. It seems apparent that Check Point could achieve some significant benefits for itself and please its customer base by broadening its offerings into adjacent spaces.I have no smoking gun or catalyst to call Check Point a short. I have no reason to believe that Q2 will not turn out to be successful in terms of the company meeting expectations and guiding in-line with previous forecasts. I do believe, however, that the company has taken itself into stormy seas and its share are best avoided for a while."
3370715,24361,2015-07-30T14:52:40-04:00,"Check Point is keeping pace with the industry, despite aggressive growth and competition from Palo Alto, Fortinet, and FireEye.Check Point recently returned to M&A with two small deals, and the company seems more serious about addressing opportunities in markets like endpoint security, where it has little share.If Check Point can hold its share in firewalls and grow in markets like endpoint, web, and messaging security, an $85 fair value seems reasonable today even without hyper-growth.","The way things have been going lately, you'd think that Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP) showed up to a Formula 1 race on a tandem bike. Check Point is certainly being outgrown by up-and-comers in security like Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), and FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), and the shares have largely missed out on the hockey stick rise in security stock prices, but I wouldn't exactly call this leading firewall company chopped liver either.I do believe that Check Point will hold more share in firewalls than many seem to think, and I think the company's fast-follower approach into areas like endpoint security do offer growth in the coming years. But to recycle that prior metaphor, talking about fair value in the context of software stocks can often feel like bringing a bike to a car race, and Check Point shares don't exactly jump out as shockingly undervalued on an absolute basis.Still Growing …Check Point continues to show that it can grow its business more or less in line with the overall security sector. Revenue rose 9% this past (second) quarter, with product and license revenue up 6%, blade subscriptions up 20%, and updates/maintenance revenue up 7%. Gross margin was basically stable, and the company saw slight operating margin erosion (110 bps) as the company fulfilled a pledge to spend more on R&D and sales & marketing.Importantly, billings grew 11% for the quarter and came in about 5% higher than analysts expected.… But Not As Quickly As SomeMost surveys and third-party analyses of the security industry indicate that the market is seeing mid-to-high single-digit growth right now in the wake of numerous high-profile data breaches. As hackers have gotten more sophisticated and more malicious, enterprises have started waking up to their own vulnerabilities and the need to upgrade their security infrastructure.If the data are correct that the underlying market is growing around 6% to 8%, Check Point has little to apologize for - the market leader (in firewalls) is keeping pace with the market, while Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) have had their challenges keeping up (on an organic basis).Turn to Palo Alto, Fortinet, and FireEye, though, and the picture changes dramatically. Fortinet is the slow-poke of this bunch in terms of recent growth, with revenue up ""only"" 30% in the last quarter, while Palo Alto reported 55% growth and FireEye reported 70%. To be sure, Palo Alto and Fortinet have done a lot of things right in the firewall market (and have emerged as strong rivals to Cisco and Check Point), and FireEye has done very well in endpoint security.Palo Alto in particular deserves special mention in my opinion. As I mentioned previously, Palo Alto pursues its business with a very different philosophy - many security company executives believe that it is all but impossible to stop attacks (and that the focus should be on rapid detection, containment, and mitigation), but Palo Alto does not accept this viewpoint. If it is right, that's a powerful weapon in its arsenal (it's a great thing to compete against opponents who don't believe the battle can be won). Palo Alto has also been relentless in expanding its addressable markets, with multiple acquisitions to strengthen its endpoint security offerings (a market that sources like IDC and Gartner believe is about two-thirds the size of enterprise firewall/UTM and growing faster).Where Does Check Point Go From Here?Check Point is never going to be the first player/entrant in a market - a fast-follower philosophy basically precludes that. But Check Point has done well evolving with the market. The company's blade approach has seen good adoption and it has supported a continuation of the strong margin structure. With that, Check Point has been holding fairly steady with a mid-teens share of the overall security market and a nearly one-quarter share of the firewall market - even as companies like Palo Alto boast of competitive take-aways.Check Point has also recently, and finally, gotten into gear with M&A again. For all of management's talk that they see the company as a consolidator, there was little action on that front for a number of years. In the last six months, though, the company has acquired Hyperwise Security and Lacoon Mobile. The former offers a CPU-level threat protection engine that can eliminate threats on a ""pre-infection"" level, while Lacoon enhances the company's endpoint offerings with solutions that secure mobile devices and block attacks on/through those devices.The problem for Check Point is that it's going to be challenging to post growth that can come close to matching rivals like Fortinet and Palo Alto, and the Street never gets as excited about a company protecting what it already has as it does about new entrants grabbing share and taking real estate away from incumbents. That said, Check Point's low current day share in endpoint security (low single digits), web security (low single digits), and messaging security (barely any at all) and a relative lack of innovation by the incumbents (Symantec (SYMC) and Blue Coat) do at least live the window open a bit.Hold And BuildAs it does seem that Check Point is more willing to be more aggressive in going after opportunities in markets like endpoint security, I've bumped up my growth estimate a bit. I'm looking for revenue to grow at around 5% to 6% for the long term, which I believe is about 1% to 2% above the underlying growth rate. Given how many analysts and investors seem to expect Palo Alto (and to a lesser extent, Fortinet) to eat Check Point's lunch in firewalls, that may ultimately prove to be a bullish/aggressive viewpoint. On the other hand, simply holding serve in firewalls and gaining some share in endpoint, web, and messaging security could lead to a re-rating for the shares.I'm still expecting some margin erosion, as I think the company is going to have to spend more to keep what it has and/or build upon it. Nevertheless, I'm still looking for adjusted FCF margins above 50% for the long term. Discounted back, that's worth almost $85 today. I'd also note that Check Point has ample cash with which to pursue additional M&A, but Check Point's apparent preference for small, select, technology-driven deals likely won't disrupt the near-term revenue/margin outlook all that much.The Bottom LineThat Check Point is remotely close to a reasonable fair value makes it a relative bargain in the space, but tech investors don't often favor slower-growing incumbents when there are aggressive newcomers making a splash in the market (and showing strong revenue growth). Check Point is still a name I think is worth keeping an eye on, but growth-oriented investors are likely going to find much more momentum in names like Palo Alto, Fortinet, and FireEye."

        Check Point continues to be the worldwide leader in Firewall Equipment.
        Extremely profitable business model outperforms competitors.","What do Target, Home Depot, J.P. Morgan and Sony have in common? They are all recent victims of a cyber attack. The New York Stock Exchange and United Airlines had major software issues that shut down mission critical systems just yesterday, although both companies say that they were not hacked. Nonetheless, cyber security is certainly in the news.No sector, network, or system is immune to all threats. The result is that companies are investing record amounts to protect themselves from system breaches. Investors can profit from this trend by investing in a global leader in cyber security, Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP).Leader In Expanding IndustryCheck Point continues to be the worldwide leader in market share for firewall equipment and currently provides security systems for 98% of the Fortune 500 and over 100,000 businesses in total. After reporting its 1Q15 results, despite continued strength in revenue and profit growth, shares are actually down nearly 3%. With a growing user base, rapidly expanding industry, and product improvements on the horizon, Check Point shares are not getting the valuation they deserve.Highly Profitable SAAS ModelCheck Point has grown revenues by 11% compounded annually over the past ten years in large part due to its combined hardware and software based business model. In addition to traditional hardware sales, Check Point creates recurring revenues through its software as a service business model.The real determinant of a great company is if management can translate that revenue growth into profit. Over the past decade, Check Point has grown after-tax profit (NOPAT) by 14% compounded annually, even faster than revenue. The consistent profit growth is a testament to Check Point's efficient operations. Since 2010, Check Point has achieved gross margins above 85% each year, and 88% in 2014. Check Point's pre-tax (NOPBT) margin has been upwards of 50% over this time period and was 54% in 2014.Check Point currently earns a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 180%, up from 37% in 2008. The company has generated over $2 billion in free cash flow since 2011. With the large amount of free cash flow, Check Point has ample ability to continue its $1.5 billion share repurchase program that was approved in early 2015 and continue to invest in developing market-leading solutions.Building For The FutureInvestors fear the rapid pace of cyber attacks will make current security providers obsolete. What they fail to realize is that Check Point has faced strong competitive forces since its founding in 1993. Competing against large tech firms to smaller startups, Check Point has maintained its market leading position and has continued to innovate along the way.The key differentiator for Check Point is its robust and flexible product offerings. As the largest pure play security vendor in the world, the company can offer a higher degree of customization and focus to its clients.Smaller peers such as Palo Alto networks, although growing rapidly, cannot compete with the multi-layered line of defense from Check Point. In addition, Check Point recently acquired two smaller firms to further their security offerings. Hyperwise is considered to be a direct competitor to Palo Alto's security prevention platform and will be integrated into Check Point's existing platforms. Lacoon Mobile on the other hand, provides security for iOS and Android operating systems that can be integrated into a company's existing security infrastructure.Check Point is ensuring that it can provide solutions across the entire IT security value chain in addition to providing market leading firewall equipment.It Pays to Be FirstCheck Point has strong advantages over its competitors across many key metrics. Many of Check Point's competitors are either newer entrants into the market, or smaller businesses that must spend large amounts to attract clients and build out system operations. As shown in Figure 1, Check Point derives much greater returns on the capital invested than its competitors. Being more profitable than its competitors gives Checkpoint pricing power and staying power for developing market-leading solutions.Figure 1: Check Point Operates Above the RestSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsImpact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic AccountingTo reveal the true economic performance of Check Point, we look deeper into the company's 10-K reports. By removing nearly $35 million in reported non-operating income, largely in the form of interest income, and $12 million in tax adjustments, we see that Check Point's NOPAT was lower than GAAP net income in 2013.2014's NOPAT was also below GAAP net income but after the removal of non-operating items we see that NOPAT grew 5% year over year while reported net income only grew 1% in 2014. Without an understanding of the accounting adjustments required to derive the true recurring cash flows of a business, investors would have underestimated Checkpoint's rate of growth.Invest Now Before Check Point's True Value is RealizedAt its current price of $80/share, Check Point has a price to economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 1.2. This ratio implies the market expects Check Point's NOPAT to grow by only 20% from the current level over its remaining life. While 20% NOPAT growth is nothing to balk at, after growing NOPAT by 14% compounded annually for the past decade, it seems overly pessimistic to expect Check Point to increase NOPAT by only 20% over the remaining life of the business.Given Check Point's market leading position and strong fundamentals the company is undervalued. If we give Check Point credit for 9% compounded annual NOPAT growth for the next decade, well below what it achieved in the preceding decade, the stock is worth $110 per share today. This price represents a 39% upside from current levels.Disclosure: David Trainer owns CHKP. David Trainer, Allen L.

(NASDAQ:CHKP) is a cutting-edge network security firm within the Information Technology sector of the S&P 500. Founded in 1993, the Tel Aviv-based firm broke into the field with its revolutionary breakthrough, Firewall-1, the world's first firewall. Today, Check Point has made strides to become one of the most respected competitors within the market and is credited with some of the biggest breakthroughs in threat prevention, security management, firewall security and mobile security. It is currently trading at just under $83 a share, just shy of its 52-week high of $85, but is expected, along with the entire IT sector, to be a smart investment going forward. What separates Check Point from the rest of the software security firms is its position in the market, superior client base, as well as continued commitment to success.Dominant Market ShareIn its 20-year existence, Check Point has never experienced a dramatic drop in its market value of equity. From the outset, it infiltrated the market with its innovative firewall design and has never looked back. As the largest pure-play security firm in the market, it holds a relatively massive market compared to many of its primary competitors. Currently, Check Point is estimated to hold 21.9% of the entire firewall market, a whopping 5.3% and 10.2% over its next closest competitors. This is a market that Check Point has dominated for nearly 25 years and the firm shows no signs of slowing down. They continue to innovate, ensuring they not only hold, but also grow, their market share over time, as exemplified by their Threatcloud technology. Introduced in 2012, Threatcloud was the first technology of its kind to stop attacks from unknown sources.This is all vital to growth because this market share occurs in a sector which, according to International Data Corporation, an information technology research firm, is expected to grow by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4%. Network Security also is expected to be the largest sub-sector in security by 2018, with annual revenues of $11.6 billion. Of that market, Firewall and Unified Threat Management are expected to grow by a CAGR of 9%, making up $8.5 billion, or 73%, of the total $11.6 billion. The position in this high-growth market gives Check Point the opportunity to see major positive effects on its balance sheet. Check Point has industry-leading operating margins, right between 58%-60%. High margins such as these mean that the company's top and bottom line growth will grow together, meaning that as the market increases in value, so will the company's profits.ClienteleOn that note, the information technology sector will continue to expand and provide excellent opportunities for investors, but Check Point has a specific advantage that will propel it much further than its competition: its superior client base. Check Point covers a wide array of large corporations and small to mid-sized firms, including over 100,000 businesses. The most important of the aforementioned 100,000 businesses are those that are part of the Fortune 500. Check Point covers 98% of Fortune 500 companies and 100% of Fortune 100 companies. Many of these companies are entered into contractual agreements, creating recurring revenue unmatched in the rest of the industry. Additionally, new federal government cyber security initiatives require federal agencies to obtain large-scale security contracts, most of which are filled by Check Point.These contracts come at a time when the risk for cyber security breaches has never been higher. What do Sony, Anthem, Target, Home Depot have in common? They were hacked, and each time it was all over the news. Not only did hackers get away with credit card information, but each company's public image took a major hit. The most surprising statistic however is the total cost of these attacks, nearing almost half a billion dollars. It is more vital than ever for firms to protect their assets. Many analysts are expecting high attack sophistication to require stronger defenses, and ""high-value"" targets, such as financial companies, retail, government, and critical infrastructure, will need to spend more than ever in threat prevention. Here is where Check Point cashes in. Not only will Check Point see the increase in business in the sub-sector they already dominate, but also the luxury of covering such a high percentage of these ""high-value"" targets should prove more than lucrative. This is something everyone is overlooking when evaluating Check Point. Yes, the stock is at or near its all time high of $86.00, and of course basic investment logic will tell you to sell high and buy low. However, when you combine a growing industry with the most profitable clients, your business has nowhere to go but up.Corporate IngenuityDoes Check Point offer impressive growth opportunities in the future? Absolutely. But Check Point also offers something many companies do not, namely, a firm you can trust to continue to succeed. Check Point has consistently increased revenues and EBIT by an average of 8.5% and 11%, respectively, and many analysts expect to see continued year-to-year growth in revenue of 6%-7% in the foreseeable future. As previously mentioned, Check Point has some of the best margins in the industry, so this top-line growth will only further bottom-line growth. Aside from that, Check Point continues to make strides in order to maintain its vice grip on the market. Since the invention of Firewall-1, they continuously drive the sub-sector as they lead by example. They have recently declared a 25% increase in share repurchases and also used their free cash to purchase another Israeli firm, Hyperwise. This purchase, for just $80 million, is much more significant than the price tag. The firm is another cyber security hardware firm poised to diversify Check Point's already-strong threat prevention product platform. The purchase was driven by the need to increase competitiveness in the field of threat prevention with Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), which recently acquired Cyvera, a firm that operates similarly to Hyperwise. While past performance is no indicator of future success, Check Point continues to make strides forward leading the market, ensuring future competitiveness, but also actively monitoring competition and making the necessary moves to preserve its dominant market share. Its management, led by impressive CEO and Chairman of the Board Gil Shwed is committed to progress, and shows it by making all the moves required to keep track of competition and stay on top.FundamentalsFrom a fundamental standpoint, Check Point checks out. After performing a 10-year Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, Comparable Company Analysis, Multiples and Ratios Analysis, the valuation ultimately backs up the aforementioned points. We are fairly bullish, for we feel past cash flows are not reflective of the increases in revenues and profits Check Point will see in the future. As a result, we have given the firm a price target of $103.89, deciding an appropriate entry price of somewhere around $80.00. Currently trading right around this entry price, we feel now is an excellent time to invest.Check Point is not without risk. From an industry standpoint, a global recession caused by a number of events, such as the Greece debt crisis or slim Chinese growth, would cause businesses to delay IT upgrades and new projects. Technology spending is always driven down in a crisis. Furthermore, these earnings forecasts are reliant on other firms, and based on corporate sentiment they may not be met. Check Point specifically faces a few risks. Currently trading near an all-time high, this is often coupled with high investor skepticism, which may prevent the stock from rising even higher. Its acquisitions may also prove less than ideal. Check Point has always been a network security firm, and obtaining other companies may lead to the company over-diversifying, diverting efforts from its core competencies. Additionally, the potential for dilutive mergers, which would hurt earnings per share, cannot be ignored.ConclusionWhile Check Point does face several risks, the upside potential for future growth greatly outweighs the downside of information technology risk. The combination of sector growth, a lucrative client base, and a management team continuously proving its commitment to success provides a juicy investment opportunity with a sky-high ceiling. With the fundamentals backing it up, Check Point seems poised to perform as an undervalued stock that's part of an information technology sector you are going to want to invest in sooner rather than later."
3209446,24802,2015-05-26T16:00:00-04:00,"Check Point's cash balances have now grown to over $3.7 billion, representing almost a quarter of the company's market capitalization.Buybacks continue at an aggressive pace, but there is more to be done.After returns approaching 30% since October 2014 (far outpacing the broader markets), we downgrade shares of Check Point to hold.Check Point continues to invest in both R&D and sales efforts to maintain market position.","Since our initial recommendation to purchase shares of Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP) in late October, shares of the enterprise security company have returned over 28% through the close of trading on May 22, handily outperforming the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF's (NYSEARCA:SPY) ~~14% return over the same time period, as well as the ~20% return of the NASDAQ, as measured by the Fidelity NASDAQ Composite Index Tracking ETF (NASDAQ:ONEQ). Check Point has continued to show decent growth since our initial write-up, and the company has been active in buying back stock. However, we see further upside for shares of Check Point.One of the core problems highlighted in our initial write-up, that of the company's bloated balance sheet, remains unresolved. Even a 40% surge in share buybacks over the last 12 months has done nothing to deplete the company's balance sheet of its cash. While Check Point is to be praised for returning the bulk of its current free cash flow to shareholders, the company, as we noted in our initial write-up, generates so much free cash flow that its current pace of buybacks is still not enough to lower its cash balances, which now stand at over $3.7 billion (we remind investors that the company has no debt).Check Point's Q1 2015 results, released in late April, confirm that the company continues to grow. While Check Point may not be showing the torrid growth of peers such as FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) or Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), the company's valuation is also nowhere nearer that of its smaller peers. And Check Point's ability to generate cash from its business remains the envy of the security industry. In our view, shares of Check Point should remain a long-term holding in investors' portfolios. The company's aggressive buyback program is continuing unabated, and billions in cash continue to give Check Point the flexibility to deploy capital as it sees fit, either on an even more aggressive pace of buybacks, or on acquisitions to further enhance its leading market position, which, as the company's Q1 2015 results show, remains strong.We now turn to a review of Check Point's performance in the quarter, to be followed by a discussion of its current capital structure and capital return program, as well as an updated valuation of the company. Unless otherwise noted, financial statistics and managerial commentary used in this write-up will be sourced from Check Point's Q1 2015 earnings release, its Q1 2015 earnings call, and other historical financial filings.While we believe that Check Point remains a core security holding for long-term investors, we are nevertheless downgrading our recommendation on the shares to hold, given what we see as somewhat limited upside in the near term. With returns of almost 30% since October, shares of Check Point have moved nicely to close the valuation gap that existed between the company and its peers, and we believe that to drive further upside of such magnitude, Check Point must demonstrate a commitment to increased M&A activity and/or a more aggressive pace of share repurchases.Q1 2015 Results: Broad Security StrengthAs we discussed in our initial write-up, Check Point's days of torrid, triple-digit growth have long since passed, and the company has joined many other ""blue-chip"" enterprise companies in reporting uninspiring, but steady growth in both revenues and EPS. In the table below, we present a consolidated overview of the company's results for Q1 2015:Check Point Q1 2015 Results (in Thousands of $)Total revenue grew by almost 9% in Q1 to $372.576 million, beating consensus estimates by ~$2.2 million, with EPS up by 13.1% to 95 cents (aided by buybacks), beating consensus by 4 cents. Revenue growth in the quarter was led by Check Point's blade business, which grew by almost 21%, and with this segment being the company's most profitable from a gross margin standpoint, it helped push total gross profit up by 9.28%, and gross margins up by 32 basis points to 89.04%. The growth in blades was driven by continued strong demand for Check Point's new threat prevention offerings (discussed in more detail in our initial write-up), and we expect this segment to continue growing in the quarters to come.Importantly, Check Point continues to grow the proportion of its revenue generated from large deals, a testament to the company's size and clout within enterprise security. Management noted on the company's Q1 2015 earnings call that the company saw a 19% year-over-year increase in transactions valued at $1 million or higher, and deals larger than $50,000 accounted for 68% of the company's aggregate order value by dollars versus 66% in Q1 2014. This emphasis on higher value deals translated to a robust 17% increase in deferred revenue, well above Check Point's reported revenue growth of ~8.9%.On the expense side of the business, Check Point has continued its investments into sales & marketing, with a clear eye towards retaining its leading market position. Management has made clear that recruiting new employees in sales, marketing, and R&D will continue throughout the remainder of 2015, and the acquisitions of two companies (Hyperwise and Lacoon, more on this later) in recent months resulted in increased costs. Even so, Check Point was able to grow its EBIT margin by 29 basis points year over year to 58%, a level that none of its peers, not even Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), can match. However, we expect a temporary pause in Check Point's margin expansion in Q2 2015, as the company works to integrate its acquisitions of Hyperwise and Lacoon, and ramps up investments in R&D and sales & marketing. This is reflected in the company's guidance for Q2 2015, which we present below (at the midpoint of the given range):Check Point Q2 2015 Guidance (in Thousands of $)Source: company filingsCheck Point's guidance for Q2 2015 suggests continued stable, but healthy revenue growth, aided by continued investments in its products, services, and sales & marketing efforts, as well as two acquisitions made in recent months, which are aimed at enhancing Check Point's product offerings.Growing Check Point's MarketThe first of these two acquisitions is that of Hyperwise. Founded in 2014, Hyperwise specializes in CPU-level threat detection, a form of sandboxing. The goal of Hyperwise's technology is to stop malware at the moment it attempts to exploit a security flaw, therefore stopping it before any damage can be done. The theory behind CPU-level threat detection is that because the CPU is external to the operating system, it is better positioned to stop malware from taking advantage of large numbers of security flaws in a given system. Hyperwise will be integrated into Check Point's Threat Emulation blades and cloud service in the coming months, thereby allowing the company to blend together hardware and software threat detection more efficiently. Although Check Point itself did not disclose the price it paid in February 2015 to acquire Hyperwise, reports indicate that the company paid $80 million for the acquisition.The second of these two acquisitions is that of Lacoon Mobile Security, a startup founded in 2011 acquired in April of this year. As was the case with Hyperwise, no official price was disclosed, but the rumored price, as discussed in Israeli media (where Lacoon is based) suggested once again a price tag of $80 million. Lacoon specializes in threat prevention for the iOS and Android platforms; Check Point has noted that Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Dell are all key clients (Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) itself is not a client, but Lacoon can be used on iOS devices).Lacoon blends together device and cloud-level technologies to prevent mobile malware, and is aimed at businesses with sensitive operations. Check Point CEO Gil Shewd highlighted the dangers that mobile malware imposes upon both document security and the tapping of mobile phones. Unlike most traditional mobile device management offerings, Lacoon's focus is not on responding to security threats, but on protecting the data on mobile devices from malware in the first place. It should be noted that these acquisitions were not undertaken for their specific revenue contributions to Check Point. Rather, they are designed to fill holes in the company's enterprise and mobile security offerings. Hyperwise will be fully folded into Check Point's core threat prevention services and software blade business, whereas Lacoon will be part of the company's burgeoning Capsule suite of mobile security offerings, which itself is not yet a material contributor to Check Point's revenue.In conjunction with its Q1 2015 results, Check Point also announced a security partnership with FireEye, which raised eyebrows among analysts (given that FireEye is one of Check Point's fastest-growing competitors in enterprise security), who wondered how this partnership would work in practice. CEO Gil Shewd noted that the key driver of this partnership was system openness, which he noted is a key desire for customers of both Check Point and FireEye. Check Point and FireEye will now share threat data between their platforms in near real-time, creating what Check Point states is the world's largest collection of threat intelligence. For the time being, we believe that the explicit goal of this partnership is not to drive incremental sales of Check Point products and services, but to keep the company's customers happy, who will then continue to buy from the company. We look to Check Point's Q2 2015 results, due out in July, to see whether or not the company has seen any positive impact from this partnership from a financial perspective.In short, we believe that Check Point's market position remains secure, and that the opportunities before it continue to grow. Gartner data for Q4 2014 indicates that Check Point has maintained its leading position in the firewall market, with 23% global market share. The company's guidance indicates healthy growth in Q2, and we expect 2015 to be another good year for the company as it works to tackle the security problems of its customers. However, even as the company works to tackle external security problems, it has continued to fail in solving an internal problem: the problem of too much cash.Check Point's Cash Hoard: What is to be Done?In our initial October write-up, we highlighted Check Point's pristine balance sheet as a core component of our bullish thesis for the company. Then, Check Point's balance sheet was bloated with cash; the company held $19.18 per share in cash (again, we remind investors that the company has no debt), equivalent to almost 29% of its market capitalization. At the end of Q1 2015, however, the company's cash balances have risen to $19.90 per share, a result of both the company's continued buybacks as well as the strong cash flows generated by Check Point's business. In the table below, we highlight Check Point's current cash balances:Check Point Cash Balances (in Thousands of $)Source: Company filingsCheck Point ended Q1 2015 with over $3.7 billion in total cash & investments, a ~2% increase versus Q1 2014, and a ~6.4% increase on a per-share basis. It should be noted, however, that this is not a function of Check Point's failure to return free cash flow to shareholders; indeed, the company has only stepped up its pace of repurchases over the last 12 months, as we show in the table below:Check Point Capital Returns (in Thousands of $)Source: Company filingsOver the past 12 months, Check Point has returned almost 97% of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of buybacks, ramping up buybacks by almost 40%, which was accompanied by a more than 37% increase in free cash flow, aided primarily by strong growth in deferred revenues. However, Check Point's growth in buybacks, while admirable in absolute terms, becomes less meaningful when viewed in the context that it is only slightly higher than the company's underlying growth in free cash flow. The company's admittedly aggressive pace of share buybacks has done nothing to address the underlying pile of cash & investments that has accumulated on Check Point's balance sheet, which still equals almost 23% of the company's current market capitalization. With over $3.7 billion in cash & investments, Check Point continues to hold ample capital to both dramatically ramp up its buybacks even further, or engage in strategic M&A activity. CEO Gil Shewd noted as much on the company's Q1 call, stating the following:We expect Check Point to continue to be an acquirer, but with a focus on smaller companies aimed at complementing its existing offerings. However, should public company valuations decline due to a technology sector selloff, we believe that the company would at least examine the acquisition of a more major, publicly-traded enterprise security player, something that the company's balance sheet could easily afford. We note that not only does Check Point hold over $3.7 billion in cash, but it is also debt free, meaning that the company could leverage its balance sheet to enhance its M&A capability even further.But perhaps just as important is the fact that Check Point's bloated balance sheet continues to be a calling card for activist investors. For activists, draining balance sheets of excess cash is a time-tested strategy for increasing shareholder value, either through changes to a company's capital return strategy or through strategic actions such as M&A. With no dual class stock structure and a balance sheet that is clearly rich in cash, we believe that even with a return of almost 30% since our initial October recommendation, Check Point remains vulnerable to activist involvement, particularly if its performance were to stumble.Updated Valuation: Upside Remains, but Downgrading to HoldAs we noted in our initial write-up, we believe a valuation of 20x operating cash flow is fair, given Check Point's structural ability to generate cash at a rate far higher than that of its peers. For the time being, we see no reason to raise our multiple, but may do so in the future. A valuation of 20x operating cash flow yields a price target of $92.24 for shares of Check Point, based on the following figures:Check Point's Revised Price TargetOur price target implies additional upside of only ~6% from current levels, which leads us to downgrade our assessment of Check Point stock to hold from buy. To drive further upside, we believe that, as mentioned above, Check Point needs to demonstrate its continued commitment to M&A activity and/or ramp up its pace of buybacks. Check Point's cash balances have only grown since our initial October write-up, even as the company has increased its share buybacks by almost 40% over the last 12 months.ConclusionsWe believe that investors should continue to hold shares of Check Point at current levels. With returns of almost 30% since our initial October recommendation, shares of Check Point have closed a good deal of the valuation gap that existed between the company and its peers. However, the fundamental ""problem"" of Check Point's cash remains unresolved. The company ended Q1 2015 with over $3.7 billion in cash and investments, and CHKP's current pace of buybacks is simply not enough to actually deplete its cash balances. But, it is an admittedly good problem to have, and we believe that its potential resolution will benefit Check Point's shareholders greatly, and that continued exposure to the company is warranted."
3024446,74695,2015-03-24T11:57:10-04:00,"Check Point Software is extremely well-positioned in the hugely promising cybersecurity industry.
        Check Point has nearly unparalleled technological sophistication and geographical diversification, making it one of the most competitive cybersecurity firms.
        While Check Point has huge potential moving forward, investing in the constantly evolving cyberspace is risky.","Cybersecurity has never been more important, especially given the fact that 2014 marked a record year for cyberattacks. With an increasingly digitized state of affairs, cybersecurity is becoming a priority for modern day society. Governments, corporations, and even individuals, have become prime targets for cyberattacks, which have amounted to untold billions, and even trillions of dollars in damages. Fortunately, a new breed of cybersecurity firms is emerging to tackle this growing threat. Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP) is one of the companies at the forefront of the cybersecurity industry, providing both software and hardware solutions for customers.Check Point, along with Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), has found great success in recent years as demand for cybersecurity has skyrocketed. As cybersecurity becomes even more vital for governments and corporations in particular, it would not be surprising to see Check Point experience even greater demand moving forward. On top of general growing demand for cybersecurity solutions, Check Point as a nearly unrivaled geographical presence, and some of the most sophisticated cybersecurity technologies available.Cybersecurity Demand TrendDemand for cybersecurity has grown exponential over the past few years, and may likely even grow faster still as cyberattacks become more pervasive and advanced. The extraordinary increase in the frequency and severity of cyberattacks over the years in not so surprising given the incredible advances made in computer hardware/software technologies. Fortunately, the increasing complexity of computer hardware/software has also allowed cybersecurity firms like Check Point to keep up in the cyberspace.As an example of how severe the cybersecurity threat has become, DDoS and malware attacks have grown over ten-fold in a few years time, and hundreds-fold in a decades time. The exponential nature of cyberattacks will only continue into the future, which also means that the demand for cybersecurity will likely track this growth. This is obviously great news for Check Point, as the company should be able to capitalize on the projected demand growth of cybersecurity solutions/products. The growing demand for the company's cybersecurity products are no more apparent in the company's consistent revenue increases, with the company reporting $421M in quarter 4 revenues alone.Check Point's Technological SophisticationCheck Point has the technical expertise to address the growing cybersecurity demands of governments, corporations, or other entities. The company has been innovating at a relentless pace, constantly introducing some of the industry's most sophisticated and advanced cybersecurity solutions/products. This past quarter has been a great example of the company's relentless pace of innovation.The company has been at the forefront of the evolving malware threat, which ranks as one of the biggest cybersecurity threats. Given that awareness is perhaps one of the largest problems when it comes to malwares, Check Point has introduced InteliStore over the past year to combat this very problem. This security platform allows customers to proactively receive information about malwares relevant to them, giving InteliStore users the initiative.Check Point also has one of the most competitive Threat Emulation platforms in the industry, with its platform having a 100% catch rate in Miercom tests. The company's Threat Emulation platform's perfect catch rate was significantly better than that of its competing vendor's products, which had catch rates ranging anywhere from 70%, all the way down to 27%. Clearly, Check Point is far ahead of its competition in terms of cyberthreat identification, which should give the company a huge competitive advantage moving forward. This aspect of Check Point's business is especially promising given that a large part of cybersecurity is actually identifying the threat.On top of this, the company's core products relating to Network Security has never been more robust, with constant innovations of its Next Generation Firewall, Next Generation Data Protection, etc. As these are still some of the top brands in the cybersecurity industry, Check Point's core business is stronger than ever. The company's innovations in guarding against the newest, most sophisticated forms of cyberthreats are nearly unparalleled within the industry.Smart Geographical DiversificationA major strong suit of Check Point's business is its geographical diversification. The company is remarkably well-balanced(in according to respective market sizes) across the major markets of North America, Europe, and the rest of the world. In addition, growth has remained remarkably consistent in these three major markets, with the Americas unsurprisingly holding nearly half of the company's business at 48%, Europe containing 38% of the company's business, and all other regions containing the rest.It is not a bad thing that much of the company's business is concentrated in the Americas and Europe, given the fact that these regions represent the most promise for demand. The Americas and Europe are the most frequent targets of cyberattacks, which means that Check Point is extremely smart if focusing on these markets. While the company is geographically diversified, there are limits to how diversified the company can get in light of ethical concerns, i.e. selling cybersecurity solutions/products to unstable/rogue government/entities would be inappropriate.Here is a graphic showing the regional distribution of cyberattacks. Notice that the United States suffers from a disproportionate amount of cyberattacks.Source: hackmageddonRisksWhile cybersecurity demand will almost certainly continue growing moving forward, there are no guarantees which companies will benefit from such demand growth. Unlike most other industries, the landscape of the cybersecurity industry could literally change within a few years, as newer software/technologies could render cybersecurity solutions obsolete almost overnight. Because of the fast-evolving nature of the digital sphere, no cybersecurity company is ever safe from obsolescence, no matter how much market share they have.Although Check Point is not exempt from the unforgiving nature of the cybersecurity industry, the company has proven to have the innovative drive and technical expertise to outcompete the vast majority of its rivals. While there are a few worthy competitors, namely Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, Check Point has all the tools to prosper moving forward. Despite this, the company's future relevancy is never guaranteed in the high risk cybersecurity industry.ConclusionDespite Check Point's surging stock price, the company still has more room to grow at a market capitalization of $15.65B. The company's trailing P/E ratio of 24 does not fully reflect Check Point's superior market positioning, and the general demand growth of cybersecurity solutions/products. With such a great positioning in a booming industry, Check Point is poised for upside. The ever growing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks will make Check Point's services more crucial than ever."
2903716,24361,2015-02-11T14:46:18-05:00,"Software blades continue to show strong growth, while Check Point continues to do very well at the margin line.Increased spending could boost long-term revenue growth, as could an increased willingness to use M&A to augment the company's next-gen offerings.Check Point is likely never going to be a growth leader, but the company offers a solid growth/value mix and can still make sense as a core tech holding.","I've liked Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP) as a good risk-reward play on the IT security space for some time and the stock worked reasonably well since my last article. The roughly 20% appreciation since then absolutely pales next to the performances of other security firms like Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW) and Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV) (which have more than doubled), as well as Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) and FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), but relative to old school tech stocks like EMC (EMC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), the comparison is more favorable to Check Point.I continue to like Check Point as a Goldilocks tech stock, but I don't think it is significantly undervalued today. Mid-single digit long-term growth supports a fair value close to $80, but Check Point doesn't seem structured to generate the sort of absolute revenue growth or relative share growth that would support major reratings.Check Point Delivers More Upside In The Fourth QuarterCheck Point didn't blow the doors off with its fourth quarter results, but it was still a better quarter than the Street expected.Revenue rose more than 7%, good for a slight beat relative to the average sell-side estimate. Product revenue was slightly sluggish (up 6% and slightly below expectation), but software was strong (up 8% and about 3% higher than expected) and software blade revenue was about as expected with more than 19% growth.Margins continue to develop relatively well for a company that has long been a margin leader in the tech space. Gross margin did decline a half-point from last year (and 30bp sequentially), but were about a half-point better than expected. Operating income (adjusted/non-GAAP) rose more than 8%, with operating margin staying steady on a year-over-year basis and beating expectations by about half a point.Check Point Looking To Press Its Strengths, But It Will Have A CostOther metrics of demand for Check Point's products were strong for the fourth quarter. Deferred revenue rose 17% and beat expectations by about 3%, while billings rose 11% and surpassed expectations by about 5%. Demand for threat emulation, anti-bot, and app control blades remains strong and it looks as though threat emulation could become a top-three product for Check Point in 2015 despite strong competitive efforts from Palo Alto and FireEye.In recognition of the opportunity that the company has to drive blade sales for threat emulation, anti-bot, mobile, and so on, as well as the opportunity for more bundling, Check Point is stepping up its hiring. Most of this hiring will be focused on sales and marketing and the near-term consequence is a hit to margins and $0.11/share of downside guidance for FY 2015 relative to the pre-report average.I don't have a problem with Check Point investing in efforts to drive better growth. I have commented in the past that I think Check Point's management is sometimes a little too focused on margin and consequently underinvests in sales and marketing and R&D. This hasn't wrecked the company by any means, and it remains a ""fast follower"" with double-digit market share, but I nevertheless like the recognition that it takes money to make money. The one problem? The spending is a virtual guarantee, but the benefits are not and rivals like Fortinet are also increasing their spending. If everybody steps up their sales/marketing efforts to a similar degree, there will likely be some share gains from smaller players unable to keep up, but the benefits will still likely underwhelm.Build, Buy, Or Both?Check Point hasn't been a very active acquirer, with the last notable deal in 2011. Management's comments on the matter seem to have gone in a more accepting direction lately, and the company does have a sizable cash balance that could be deployed toward deals. There are plenty of private companies out there (Bit9, CrowdStrike, Tanium, Bromium, et al) as well as publicly-traded companies that could enhance Check Point's next-gen offerings.That said, Check Point may not feel the urgency. Given the complexity of various security offerings and the challenges of getting them to work and play together well, it seems as though many customers are increasingly willing to forgo best-of-breed in lieu of integrated systems. That plays to Check Point's strengths (as well as Cisco's and arguably Palo Alto's) and perhaps mitigates some of the risks of the company's ""fast-follower"" approach that rarely sees it first to market with new technology.Good Enough Still Good EnoughI'm looking for Check Point's long-term revenue growth to slow into the mid-single digits. I'm looking for overall network/enterprise IT security demand to remain solid, though, as ""breach of the month"" stories (Target, Anthem, et al) keep security in the news. I do think that the company's renewed focus on sales and marketing could help support better growth in the near-term, and I do continue to see better growth potential in the company's blade business, but I don't want to underestimate the potential of rivals like Palo Alto to limit Check Point's future share growth.On the margin side, I don't think the company's anticipated hiring surge is the start of a major break from the company's past model. I'd also note that I have always expected erosion in the company's operating margins/FCF margins over time - maybe evolving security threats will make this market an exception, but most markets don't really facilitate a company maintaining outstanding margins indefinitely. More specifically, I think the company will find over time that it takes more sales and marketing spending to support its business, and that will have operating margin consequences.The Bottom LineIf Check Point can deliver long-term FCF growth in the neighborhood of 5% a year, I believe $80 is a fair price for the shares today. That offers a little bit of upside today, and there would also be upside if the company can do better with revenue growth (each 1% of long-term revenue growth is worth about $4/share) or margins (1% of long-term FCF margin is worth about $0.75/share).All in all, I think Check Point is still a solid holding for investors who want tech exposure but may not want the volatility/risk of spicier names like Palo Alto, FireEye, and so on. From a GARP perspective, the shares still hold some appeal, though I'd be more interested if the Nasdaq has a series of bad days and pulls Check Point down with it."
2594705,32711,2014-10-24T11:52:13-04:00,"As data breaches continue to plague large corporations in the US and beyond, demand for security products is increasing.Check Point and Fortinet have managed to benefit from this demand.As the trend is expected to continue, assuming decent execution, the firms should continue to prosper.","Several high profile data breaches, such as the ones that affected Target (NYSE:TGT), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and now perhaps Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS), have highlighted the need for comprehensive enterprise security solutions, not only to protect the businesses that suffer breaches, but especially the consumers whose data is being picked apart by hackers. As a result, there has been increased demand for the services provided by security software companies. Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) and Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) have both managed to profit from this trend, judging by their most recent financial results.Breaching left and rightWe all know that for the last few years data security has been a concern. However, the scale upon which this has been happening has caught the corporate world with its pants down. Last month, it was revealed that an astounding 43% of businesses have suffered a data breach in the last year. The report by the Ponemon Institute also stated that this figure was up 10% from a year ago.Not only the number but also the size of breaches is increasing. Worryingly, some 27% of firms did not have a data breach response plan or team, although this figure is luckily down from 39% last year.This increase is providing lucrative opportunities for companies active in the software security space. According to an FBR Capital Markets report, spending on security solutions is expected to increase by 18% this year.As companies upgrade to more complex security systems, partly due to the growing threat of data breaches, companies like Check Point and Fortinet among others are seeing their order books swell. This positive momentum is expected to continue into 2015 and beyond as hackers employ sophisticated methods of breaking into databases.The numbersLet's start off with Fortinet. The Sunnyvale, CA,-based company reported Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.12, beating by a penny, although GAAP operating income was down to $15.5 million from $18.3 million a year ago. Excluding items, operating income of $30.4 million was more or less flat compared to last year's $30.5 million.Revenue rose a very healthy 25% year-over-year to $193.3 million as billings increased by 29%. The company ended the quarter with more than $960 million in cash and no debt on the books. According the management, the company is benefiting from solid demand, and upgrades among its customers, and the company is well positioned moving into 2015.Check Point Software also came out with some strong numbers for its third quarter report. Excluding items, the company earned $0.93, up from $0.85 a year ago and two cents above the consensus estimate. Overall revenue rose 8%, also beating estimates.Demand was driven by enterprise security appliances, as well as next-gen software blades, a type of a modular software solution which provides companies with targeted systems tailored to their needs.Moreover, in the second quarter, the company is reported to have extended its lead in the firewall equipment market as well as the combined firewall and UTM appliance market. The firm continues to see strong demand for its next-gen product launches, and like its competitor, looks well positioned moving into the last quarter of the year.ConclusionAs data breaches among large firms become increasingly commonplace, the demand for comprehensive security software solutions is growing rapidly. Two of the main companies active in the industry, Fortinet and Check Point, have delivered solid numbers for their third quarter report. Fortinet especially seems to be doing a good job of growing revenue, although the bottom line looks stronger at Check Point. In any case, both firms should be able to profit from growing demand for complex security systems."
3445746,32711,2015-08-17T15:08:48-04:00,"Check Point has largely missed out on the industry's rally this year.This is despite the fact that its bottom line performance is vastly superior to that of its smaller competitors.Combined with a low valuation, the stock seems to offer considerably more upside than downside.","While names like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) have soared this year, Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP) has been largely left behind by the industry's rally. This creates an interesting buying opportunity. Although it is indeed not growing revenue as quickly as its two smaller competitors, its bottom line performance is far more reliable. The underperformance in stock price compared to its competitors, despite the fact that it is growing earnings consistently and trades at a steep discount to the industry, suggest that the stock has more room for upside than downside at the moment.Rally running on salesCompared to Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet, Check Point's performance this year seems sluggish. Palo Alto and Fortinet are up around 41.5% and 52% respectively, while Check Point is up only around 3% over the same period. Over the last two years, the difference is even more extreme, Palo Alto up 263% and Fortinet up 135% versus Check Point's 43% increase.Palo Alto is a classic example of a sales momentum-driven stock. The firm is consistently delivering sales growth in the mid-to-high double digits, with revenue growth of more than 50% last year. As a relatively small player in the industry, with TTM revenue of around $822 million versus Check Point's $1.56 billion, it has had considerably more room to grow than its larger competitors.This growth has come at a cost to the bottom line, which on the whole looks fairly weak. Palo Alto Networks has yet to post an annual net profit in GAAP terms during its history as a publicly traded company. Its operating margin has consistently been in the red, with the exception of fiscal 2012 when it eked out 1.5% in the black. Between 2013 and 2014, operating margin fell from -4.7% to -36%, and for the last twelve months, it is at -15.1%.Fortinet shares a similar history, and although its bottom line looks a bit steadier than Palo Alto's, earnings have been falling in recent years. After hitting around $67 million in net income in 2012, this figure fell to $25 million by 2014 as operating expenses ballooned by some 68% over the same period, outpacing revenue growth of 44%.Margins matterBy contrast, Check Point as a more mature company has consistently delivered a rock solid bottom line performance over the last few years. The company's operating margin hasn't dipped below 50% since 2010, and it has more than doubled its net income since 2008 to $660 million last year. Its latest earnings report once again showed an improvement in earnings, operating income up 5% and EPS up by 6%, with the operating margin down but steady above 50%.Additionally, Check Point's balance sheet is in fantastic shape. It ended the most recent quarter with a cash balance of $3.61 billion, and has no debt whatsoever on the books. This will allow the company to continue its $1.5 billion share buyback program, as well as continue its recent acquisition activity, having picked up 2 new companies this year.So what explains the company's underperformance? Its top line growth simply isn't as impressive as that of its smaller competitors. Check Point grew revenue by only 36% between 2010 and 2014, while Palo Alto saw revenue explode by more than 1200% over the same period and Fortinet by nearly 240%.At some point though, as Palo Alto and Fortinet see their business mature and revenue growth start to normalize, it is likely that margins will start to matter again. This might bring a very abrupt ending to the spectacular rally in their share prices, considering their astronomical valuations, Fortinet trading at around 667 times trailing earnings and Palo Alto at around 17.6 times sales and a negative TTM P/E multiple.When margins start to interest investors again, Check Point is clearly in a better position, and it is likely to outperform these high flyers. Although its sales growth isn't as high, it is steady and moreover benefiting the bottom line substantially as well.Finally, the stock is in value territory. It trades at only 22.7 times trailing earnings and around 18 times forward earnings, which is a bargain compared to its rivals' valuations. If its TTM P/E multiple were in line with the 33.6 industry average, the stock would trade at around $120, or a premium of roughly 50% to its current levels. Even if it came only halfway to closing the gap, it would trade at $100.ConclusionAlthough companies like Palo Alto and Fortinet have easily outperformed Check Point Software over the last few years, Check Point currently looks like the better bet. Contrary to its smaller competitors, Check Point's bottom line performance has been consistently strong, and although revenue growth is not as high, sales are still expanding at a good clip. Combined with the fact that it trades at a fairly steep discount to the industry, Check Point looks like it has more room for upside than its high-flying rivals."
2498755,66493,2014-09-17T11:15:19-04:00,"Check Point's growth has slowed over the last several years. In the first half of 2014, revenue growth has slowed to 6.3%.
        Check Point's slow growth isn't the result of a tough economy but tougher competition. Several smaller vendors are beating and replacing Check Point's solutions.
        Check Point has struggled internationally and is partially attributing their struggles to the economy. Yet, two major competitors are performing very well in international markets.
        The recent rise in Check Point's stock has driven the stock into overvalued territory compared to peers.
        Check Point's slow growth, very competitive market environment, and overvalued stock make Check Point a poor investment.","Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP) is a provider of cyber security solutions. The company specializes in producing computer firewall systems. In 2014, Check Point's stock has performed well. The stock has risen 11.32% year to date. Although, the majority of the stock's rise has occurred in the last month. The company's stock has gained 7.5% in the last month alone. The stock's recent rise has been driven by a general rise in cyber security sector rather than financially driven. Check Point has been in the firewall market for many years. Yet, the company's recent financial performance has lagged behind competitors. These competitors are gaining market share and disrupting legacy vendors like Check Point. From 2009-2013, revenue grew at a CAGR of 10.8%. Yet, revenue growth has slowed during the period. In 2010, revenue grew 18.8% but in 2013 revenue growth slowed to 3.8%. Although, gross margin has risen. Gross margin has risen from 85.6% in 2009 to 88.3% in 2013. Check Point's growth has been better in 2014 but still is only in the single digits. Revenue has grown 6.3% while gross margin has continued to rise reaching 88.7%. The company's slowing growth has been caused by an increase competition. These competitors have grown larger, are spending heavily, and have top quality solutions. Check Point is going to continue to underperform the competition.Tough CompetitionCheck Point's management continues to see strength in the Americas market. On the Q2 conference call, Gil Shwed CEO talked about growth in several key markets ""The U.S. continued to be the standout, Europe posted very nice product growth, Latin America had some major wins and most regions in Asia grew nicely."" The strong Q2 growth in the Americas region is a continuation of the company's solid Q1 Americas revenue growth. On the Q1 conference call, Tal Payne CFO talked about solid growth in the Americas region ""Specifically, we had over 20% product sales growth in North America, the most competitive marketplace."" Yet, Check Point has only grown 6.3% year to date. Additionally, competitors are beating and replacing Check Point's solutions. This is because smaller vendors have started to become major competitors and have better solutions. In fiscal 2011, Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) was a relatively small company with revenue of $119 million. However, revenue has reached $598 million in fiscal 2014. Palo Alto Networks has grown rapidly and is starting to compete fiercely with Check Point.On Palo Alto Networks' Q4 2014 conference call, Mark McLaughlin CEO talked about competing with Check Point ""...a Canadian government agency where we beat Check Point and replaced Juniper to become their agency wide security provider and a substantial expansion of our footprint and one of Check Point's largest global customers in financial services."" Palo Alto Networks is not only competing fiercely for new customers but is also replacing Check Point's systems. On Palo Alto Networks' Q4 2014 conference call, Mark McLaughlin talked about replacing legacy systems ""...everybody has got a legacy vendor in a lot of cases, those are Checkpoint. So, in almost every situation, we come into as we have said we are displacing it."" Palo Alto Networks is stealing customers from Check Point. Unfortunately for Check Point, Palo Alto Networks rapid growth has made it a much more formidable opponent. Check Point will continue to struggle to beat Palo Alto Networks. Palo Alto Networks is slowing Check Point's growth but Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) is also impacting growth.Fortinet's Top Quality Solutions Are Causing ProblemsFortinet has grown revenue from $324 million in 2010 to $615 million in 2013. Fortinet's growth has been driven by their top quality firewall solution. Fortinet's top quality solution has helped the company gain market share. On Fortinet's Q2 2014 conference call, Drew Del Matto CFO talked about the company's market share gains ""We also continue to gain market share in the worldwide network security market growing 24% to 7.1% market share according to the latest IDC data."" Fortinet's rise has been driven by solid growth in all geographic regions even the Americas. Fortinet's Americas revenue grew 33.9% in Q2 2014. Check Point is struggling to compete and beat Fortinet. On Fortinet's Q2 2014 conference call, Drew Del Matto talked about beating Check Point ""the Americas region included a seven-figure data center firewall deal with an existing Fortune 50 technology customer...we competed with and replaced CheckPoint firewall in various areas of their expansive and complex network.""These are large deals and Fortinet isn't only competing but replacing Check Point's solutions. Check Point's solutions just aren't as good as Fortinet's solutions. The caliber of Fortinet's solutions is demonstrated by their ability to beat top vendors. On Fortinet's Q2 2014 conference call, Drew Del Matto talked about competing against top vendors ""They evaluated our products against a broad set of competitors including Palo Alto networks, CheckPoint, Juniper, Cisco and McAfee."" The above situations highlight the strength of both Fortinet's and Palo Alto Networks' products. Check Point's revenue is over a billion but is facing stiffer competition from smaller vendors. These vendors are competing fiercely in the Americas region but also internationally.International Markets Are HealthyCheck Point has been struggling especially in international markets. On the Q1 conference call, Tal Payne talked about a slow start in two important geographic regions ""In Europe and in Asia, we experienced a slow start to the year..."" The company's slow start in Q1 has continued into Q2 with slow growth out of Asia. On the Q2 conference call, Gil Shwed talked about the situation in Asia "" I think we always can do better, and I think we've pretty much now replaced most of our management in Asia. We are adding more sales people and changing that."" Slow revenue growth in Asia has caused Check Point to replace their management. Yet, Check Point's management also attributes part of their struggles to the economy. However, Fortinet and Palo Alto Networks have been performing well and see strong demand in this market. Fortinet's Asia-Pacific revenue grew 18% y/y while Palo Alto Networks' revenue grew 7% y/y. Palo Alto Networks' single digit growth is the result of the company lacking a large sales infrastructure. However, management still sees Asia as a strong and very lucrative market. Additionally, Fortinet has a stronger international presents and is performing very well. Like Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet's management has noticed growth across the entire region. On Fortinet's Q2 2014 conference call, Drew Del Matto talked about strength in Asia ""...we were very pleased with our performance in APAC. Primarily driven by strength in Japan, especially with large service provider deal as well as from Southeast Asia, China and India."" The Asian market has been weak for Check Point due to subpar sales execution rather than a struggling economy.Additionally, competitors are also performing well in the EMEA region which has been another weak spot for Check Point. Fortinet's EMEA revenue grew 23% y/y while Palo Alto Networks' revenue grew 54% y/y. Yet again, Fortinet's management hasn't seen weakness in the region. On Fortinet's Q2 conference call, Drew Del Matto talked about strong execution in the EMEA region ""With regards to EMEA, our strong execution resulted in nearly all sub-regions over performing. We saw exceptionally strong results from the UK and Middle East as well as Central, Southern and Northern Europe."" Also, Palo Alto Networks has grow rapidly due to a better distribution network but hasn't seen significant issues in the European market. Both Fortinet and Palo Alto Networks have performed well in international markets. Check Point believes these markets are struggling. However, Check Point's real problem is with the more competitive market environment and subpar sales execution. Check Point is a large and an established firewall company but is facing increased competition in the Americas and international markets. These competitors are impacting the company's revenue growth. The company's slow revenue growth combined with the stock's recent rise makes Check Point a poor investment.ValuationData: Yahoo Finance- Key StatisticsCheck Point's revenue growth has slowed but the stock has experienced a significant rise in the last month. This rise is mainly due to a general rise in the cyber security sector. Check Point's recent rise has driven the stock into overvalued territory based on peers. On an earnings multiple basis, Check Point can't be considered overvalued based on the P/E or Forward P/E ratios. Yet, the company's stock is trading at a significant premium based on revenue based multiples. Check Point would be considered overvalued based on the P/S and EV/Revenue ratios compared to both Barracuda Networks and Fortinet. These two companies are growing faster but trading at a significant discount to Check Point's stock. Check Point isn't over valued based on earnings multiples but is overvalued based on revenue multiples. The recent rise in Check Point's stock has made the stock overvalued compared to peers.Too Much CompetitionCheck Point has been experiencing gross margin expansion while suffering from a significant slowdown in revenue growth. The company's slowdown in growth is the result of increased competition in all geographic regions. Several of Check Point's competitors have grown rapidly. As a result, Palo Alto Networks has transformed into a strong competitor. They have grow rapidly due to a top quality firewall system and aggressive sales and marketing spending. Palo Alto Networks now has more resources and is building their global infrastructure to more effectively compete. Although, they currently are competing and replacing Check Point's solutions. Additionally, Fortinet is causing similar problems for Check Point. Fortinet has a substantial global presents and is performing well both domestically and internationally. Fortinet's solutions have been able to compete effectively against top competitors like Check Point. Check Point's growth is being slowed by competition rather than a slow economy.Yet, Check Point's management partially attributes their international struggles to a sluggish economy. However, Fortinet and Palo Alto Networks have been able to grow well in international markets. Additionally, their management teams haven't seen a slowdown in these economic regions. They have actually seen strength. Check Point has a quality firewall solution but other vendors have better solutions. Check Point's slow growth, struggles with the competition, and high valuation make Check Point a poor investment."
2569295,24802,2014-10-18T05:00:00-04:00,"Check Point's balance sheet is bloated with cash, with net cash & investments amounting to almost a third of the company's market capitalization.The company's operating margins and cash flow generation are higher than any of its competitors, including Microsoft.Combination of steady, but uninspiring revenue and EPS growth and continued growth in cash balances has created an attractive entry point for activist investors.Check Point has a long track record of share buybacks; since 2006 the company has bought back over 20% of its shares.","Within the technology sector, companies can be divided into one of three broad categories. The first is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL); the company's status as the world's largest company by market capitalization, and an icon of consumer culture causes it to be placed into its own category within the sector. The second is that of nimble young startups, seeking to disrupt entrenched incumbents among a wide swath of industries within the sector. This second category includes companies such as Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), and Demandware (NYSE:DWRE). And the third category is that of the incumbent technology company. Companies within this category often occupy a place of historical significance within Silicon Valley and the industry, or are the incumbents within their respective industry. Examples include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and IBM (NYSE:IBM). And it is within this category that Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP) falls.Founded in 1993, Check Point is no longer the nimble startup that it once was. With an enterprise value of almost $9 billion, and 2013 sales of ~$1.4 billion, Check Point is now more of an incumbent than a disruptor within the Internet security industry. Annual revenue growth has fallen below 10%, and while that is better than many of its ""incumbent"" peers such as Cisco, IBM, or Intel (as we will show later), the company's sales growth lags far behind competitors such as FireEye or Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW). If an investor were to merely examine Check Point's income statement, they would find a company that appears to have little to entice investors to purchase its equity. But as is often the case, Check Point's growth rates alone do not tell the whole story, which can be summed up in but one word: cash. Check Point's balance sheet is bloated with cash, with the company holding more cash as a percent of its market capitalization than any of its competitors, including Microsoft. Furthermore, Check Point generates more operating cash flow as a percent of sales than any of its competitors (again besting Microsoft in this category). Over the last 12 months, the company has collected over 40 cents in cash flow for every dollar of revenue, and the company cannot repurchase shares fast enough to offset its structural ability to generate cash (in both 2013 and the first half of 2014, share repurchases failed to offset the company's organic increase in cash & investments).Combined with management's reluctance to deploy cash towards acquisitions, the situation at Check Point has now become ripe for the involvement of one or more activist investors, creating what we see as an asymmetric risk-reward opportunity. With the company holding more cash than any of its peers (and holding no debt), there is ample room for aggressive deployments of capital, either on bold acquisitions within the Internet security sector, or in the form of accelerated buybacks or special dividends. When combined with decidedly modest multiples across a variety of metrics, we believe that shares of Check Point are meaningfully undervalued at present levels, and see upside of over 20% relative to the company's current share price, with little downside if Check Point continues to execute successfully, delivering modest, but positive revenue and EPS growth, and continuing to repurchase shares. Unless otherwise noted, financial statistics and managerial commentary will be sourced from the following: Check Point's Q2 2014 earnings release, Check Point's Q2 2014 earnings call, and Check Point's 2013 20-F.OverviewCheck Point, based in Tel Aviv and San Carlos, California was founded in 1993, and is now one of the largest pure-play Internet security companies in the world. With 2013 sales of ~$1.4 billion, Check Point's product offerings span a wide range of software and hardware, ranging from its ZoneAlarm home anti-virus offerings, to its enterprise firewall and data protection offerings. As of the end of Q2 2014, Check Point was the #2 security appliance company by revenue (behind Cisco), with 12.9% of the global market, per figures from IDC. And per figures form Gartner, Check Point was the #1 firewall equipment provider in Q2, holding 22.2% of the global market, up 590 basis points from the first quarter.At the core of Check Point's enterprise offerings is its software blade technology. For those unfamiliar with software blades, they are in essence one of the key logical building blocks of Internet security. They are independent, modular, and centrally managed, and can be customized by Check Point's customers to meet and adapt to their security needs. Check Point introduced its software blade technology in early 2009, which gave its customers the power to customize its offering to suit their own security needs. Customers can choose from any number of more than 20 ""blades"" to craft a security system that suits their needs; they can choose from firewall, VPN, anti-bot, or application control blades, to name but a few of Check Point's offerings.And in early 2014, Check Point introduced its next core technology: software-defined protection, or SDP. SDP is a new security architecture that contains three interconnected layers: enforcement, control, and management, as shown below.The goal of Check Point's SDP technology is to enable its customers to better protect themselves from unknown threats, not just those that are already in Check Point's database. By splitting the control layer from the enforcement layer, Check Point's customers can receive real-time updates from the control layer, thereby offering more immediate protection. SDP technology will play an increasingly important role for Check Point in 2015, helping the company counter multiple competitors aiming to usurp its position within the field, such as FireEye or Palo Alto Networks.While new product offerings are helping Check Point maintain its growth, the growth that the company is posting pales in comparison to those of younger competitors such as Palo Alto Networks, and is more in line with the kind of steady, but uninspiring top-line growth being generated by ""Tier 1"" technology companies such as Cisco. At first glance, an analysis of Check Point's Q2 2014 results would suggest little to incite passion amongst investors. But, there is more here than meets the eye.Q2 2014 Results: Modest Results, But More Than Meets the EyeCheck Point's Q2 results, released in late July, serve as a reminder of Check Point's incumbent position. While the company may be solidly profitable, growth is no longer as easy to come by. While Check Point's software blade segment is growing rapidly, it is not yet enough to counter more anemic growth in the company's other segments. We provide a quick overview of Check Point's three reporting segments below.We present a consolidated overview of Check Point's Q2 and H1 2014 results in the table below.Check Point Q2 2014 Results (in Thousands of $)As the table above shows, Check Point's total revenues grew by less than 7% in Q2 and the first half of the year. As was the case last quarter, Check Point's revenue growth is being driven by double-digit growth of its software blade business, which now accounts for ~18% of total revenues, with application control, anti-bot, and filtering blades being areas of particular strength. In particular, application control blades are a source for continued growth. Management noted that just 20-25% of customers have installed application control blades, thereby providing the company with a meaningful runway for future growth in that market. Within products & licenses, the segment's ~4% revenue growth was driven by strength in high-end data center appliances and accompanying software licenses. During the quarter, Check Point released multiple new appliances and other security products, including ThreatCloud IntelliStore, which we see as perhaps the most notable launch of the quarter. The IntelliStore, which builds on Check Point's ThreatCloud real-time security infrastructure is designed as a sort of ""security marketplace"" that customers can utilize to create custom security solutions. Through the IntelliStore, customers can select from a variety of offerings from both Check Point and its security partners to create security systems that match their own needs. For example, a customer can craft a custom system that offers cyber espionage protection from iSIGHT Partners and unified malware analysis from ThreatGRID. The IntelliStore is designed to offer more flexibility for customers to be able to pay for only the security services that they need, thereby driving more of them to choose Check Point as their single source for security hardware and software. We expect more color on the performance of the IntelliStore when Check Point reports Q3 2014 results later this month.We note that Check Point is increasingly using its scale to sign larger and larger deals. During the quarter, 72% of deals were $50,000 or higher, up from 68% a year ago, and 54 customers are now signing deals in excess of $1 million, up from 40 customers a year ago. This is the byproduct of Check Point's increase in sales & marketing, which now totals just under 21% of revenue. But is this increase a cause for long-term concern? We do not believe that it is. As Check Point's overall gross margins demonstrate, the company has maintained its pricing power; consolidated gross margins expanded 20 basis points to 88.78% in the quarter (and 11 basis points in the first half of the year). The increase in sales & marketing expenses is designed to help secure Check Point's position as a leader in enterprise security, and as management noted on the company's Q2 earnings call, this increase in investments is likely to benefit the company's top-line growth in the 2nd half of the year, as well as 2015. Furthermore, a portion of the growth in sales expenses was tied to above average growth in attendance at the company's Check Point Experience conferences, with record attendance in both the European and U.S. conferences. With greater attendance comes greater marketing expense, even though the revenue that may be derived from said attendance takes several quarters to materialize.We note that Check Point's growth in sales & marketing expenses was offset by a meaningful reduction in general & administrative expenses, as the company works to maintain tight control over more discretionary expenses. R&D spending rose almost 16% during the quarter as Check Point moves to counter efforts by nimbler competitors to usurp its market-leading position. While this did put pressure on operating margins during Q2 and the first half of the year, we believe that the increase in R&D is necessary for Check Point to maintain its market position and pricing power. While it is true that Check Point's operating margin fell by almost 2% during the quarter and first half of the year (to 57.1% and 57.4%, respectively), that margin is still the highest in its peer group, and is more than double its peer average, and over 98% higher than that of Microsoft, long seen as an industry leader in operating margins. It should also be noted that unfavorable currency movements played a role in elevating operating expenses during the quarter; management noted that these unfavorable movements elevated expenses by ~$2 million, and trimmed EPS by a penny. Absent these currency-related movements, consolidated operating expenses rose 9.09%, versus the company's stated 11.02% expense growth. In any case, Check Point's margins remain higher than any of its competitors (more detail on this to follow later).Check Points' overall revenue growth was broad-based in the quarter, from both a geographic and market perspective. Management noted that the U.S. market (49% of total sales) led the way in growth, with all other regions, including Europe contributing positive growth. From an end market perspective, small and medium-sized businesses appliance continue to grow in terms of units, and while they are not yet ""moving the needle"" in a material fashion, they are nevertheless beginning to contribute to Check Point's overall top-line growth. SMB unit sales doubled year-over-year in Q2, with further growth forecast for the market. And threat/intrusion prevention sales, now anchored by Check Point's IntelliStore and ThreatCloud service, are now on pace to generate $250 million in annual sales, with management noting that the market is in the early stages of growth.We turn now to the subject of guidance. Back in January, Check Point's guidance for 2014 called for total revenues of $1.475 billion at the midpoint, and EPS of $3.60 at the midpoint, representing growth of 5.8% for revenues and 4.96% for EPS. While Check Point did not specifically reiterate 2014 guidance on its Q2 earnings call, management issued no downward revisions, and stated that ""everything is progressing in line here.""However, there is always the possibility that Check Point will see weakness in the 2nd half of the year (while there is no indication to suggest that this will be the case, the possibility does exist). But this weakness need not necessarily be seen as a weakness. As is often the case, a weak quarter or two can often open the door for investors to push for a meaningful change in either the company's strategic direction, or its capital deployment strategy. And here, Check Point's bloated balance sheet and ability to generate cash, particularly in relation to its peers, can serve as the ideal calling card for activist investors to enter the fray.Peer Comparison: Checking Up on Check Point's CashWhen simply looking at Check Point's forward growth, there is little to inspire investors' passion. While Check Point is set to grow sales faster than competitors such as Cisco or Intel (which competes with Check Point via its McAfee unit), the company's growth pales in comparison to companies such as FireEye and Palo Alto Networks. However, what Check Point lacks in double-digit growth, it more than makes up for in its ability to generate cash. We present a comparison of Check Point in relation to its security competitors (defined as Fortinet, Juniper, Microsoft, Symantec, Cisco, HP, Intel, IBM, Palo Alto Networks, and FireEye) below. (Notes: share prices and estimates are accurate as of the close of trading on October 16, 2014 and are subject to change. Price-to-operating cash flow multiples exclude each company's respective net cash per share. Financial figures and estimates are derived from relevant company filings and Reuters's consensus forecasts).Check Point Peer Comparison (in Thousands of $)Several items from the table above are worthy of mention. First is Check Point's operating margin. In its last full fiscal year, the company posted an operating margin of 58.46%, more than double that of its peer group (excluding FireEye, which is currently unprofitable), and in the current year, Check Point's operating margin is forecast to be over 168% higher than its peer group. While it is true that the company's operating margins are set to dip this year, much of the decline is attributable to higher sales & marketing investments, which we view as necessary for Check Point to both maintain its market position and continue growing its next-generation security sales.But the most notable item from the table above is Check Point's ability to generate cash from its operations. Over the last 12 months, the company's operating cash flows equaled over 41% of sales, almost 75% above a peer average of 23.64% (again excluding FireEye). That figure is above even that of Microsoft, which generated operating cash flow equal to 37.12% of sales over the past 12 months. And it is that structural ability to generate cash that has left Check Point's balance sheet bloated with cash. Check Point ended Q2 2014 with over $3.6 billion in cash & investments, and no debt. Based on its current shares outstanding, the company holds $19.18 per share in net cash, equivalent to almost 29% of its current market capitalization, a level that is higher than all but one company in its peer group (Juniper Networks). And while Check Point is actively buying back stock, the company's cash balances are increasing faster than the company can repurchase shares.Over the past 12 months (from Q3 2013 to Q2 2014), Check Point has spent $640.631 million on share repurchases. But, over the same time frame, the company's balance of cash & investments went from $3.571102 billion at the end of Q2 2013 to $3.642784 billion at the end of Q2 2014 (as is the case now, Check Point held no debt at the end of Q2 2013). Check Point's current pace of share repurchases is not sufficient to prevent the company's cash balances from continuing to grow. And Check Point's share repurchases are not a new phenomenon. The company has a long track record of steadily repurchasing shares, as shown below (note: the differential in share prices between the figure in our peer comparison and the figure below is largely caused by the use of average share counts in our computation of outstanding shares, as Check Point does not break down exact shares outstanding on a quarterly basis)CHKP Shares Outstanding data by YChartsSince 2006, Check Point has repurchased over a fifth of its outstanding shares, and the company has even more capital with which to repurchase more stock than it did a year ago. And it is that capital that has the real potential of attracting an activist investor if Check Point's operational performance slips from current levels.Activism in Technology: 2 Routes for ProfitsBroadly speaking, the involvement of activist investors in the technology sector occurs via one of two ""tracks."" While the goal of both tracks is to create shareholder value, they each approach the issue in different ways. An examination of Elliot Management's tactics, which has a history of activist involvement in the technology sector, can serve to explain both tracks. The first track is an operational one, in which an activist investor pushes a company to make structural changes in its operations and/or strategy, as Elliot was the case with Elliot Management and Juniper Networks. Earlier this year, Elliot Management called for a series of steps to be taken to increase value for Juniper's shareholders (among them, Elliot Management). The hedge fund argued that Juniper was in need of material cost cuts, with a bloated R&D budget and headcount that was inconsistent with the company's size and strategy. While the fund did push for larger returns of capital (a financial form of activism), the core of Elliot's push for structural change at Juniper was operational. In contrast, Elliot Management's recent foray into EMC (EMC) is largely financial. Earlier this month, the hedge fund sent a letter to EMC's board of directors, in which it called on the board to spin off VMware (NYSE:VMW), of which EMC owns 80%. The letter was the latest step in a now months-long campaign for EMC to break itself apart, which began in July when Elliot Management amassed a $1 billion stake in EMC. Elliot's push for a spinoff of VMware is largely a financial move; the goal of such a transaction is to convince the market to ascribe more value to EMC's core operations (the value of which has been shrouded by the market value of EMC's stake in VMware), as opposed to convincing EMC's board and management team of carrying out operational changes. And it is this 2nd form of activism that is likely to take place at Check Point, if and when an activist investor does begin to press for change.With Check Point's operating margins already more than twice as high as those of its competitors, the company's cost structure is unlikely to be an effective target for activist investors seeking to enact change at the company. Instead, an activist is likely to call for a sizeable portion of Check Point's balance of cash & investments to be deployed, either via a large return of capital to investors, or a meaningful acquisition (which is likely to have operational effects on Check Point as well). We will explore both tracks, beginning with the financial option.As mentioned above, Check Point currently holds $19.18 per share in net cash & investments, or almost 29% of its current market capitalization, versus a peer average of 14.81%. Let us suppose then, that an activist calls for capital to be deployed until Check Point's cash balances reach the average level of its peers. At that level, Check Point would hold $9.98 per share in net cash, meaning that the company would need to deploy $9.20 per share in cash. The first avenue for deployment is a special dividend, which would provide shareholders with an immediate increase in the value of their holdings, but could carry tax consequences for many investors. Therefore, the company may consider a 2nd alternative: large share repurchases. If Check Point needs to deploy $9.20 per share in cash, that is equivalent to $1,747,670,032 in total capital that needs to be deployed. Let us assume then, that Check Point will use this capital to rapidly repurchase stock, and do so at a premium to the current share price. What will be the impact of this repurchase program? We model the effect below.We start by assuming that Check Point will not grow net income in 2014, even though net income grew by 3.6% in the first half of the year. To err on the side of caution, we will estimate Check Point's 2014 full-year net income at $685.201 million, the same as in 2013. Then, we will assume that Check Point's average fully diluted share count for the year to be 192.213 million. That assumption is based on the following:These assumptions yield a 2014 EPS estimate of $3.56, versus consensus estimates of $3.66, with the difference largely reflecting our assumptions of zero net income growth for the year, as shown below:Check Point Full-Year Estimates (in Thousands of $)If Check Point were to deploy the more than $1.7 billion outlined above on share repurchases, the company could retire over 23.3 million shares at $75 per share, as shown below (we selected $75 as our target price because we believe that it is a level that fairly takes into account any potential rally in shares of Check Point on the back of an announcement of such a meaningful increase in the company's repurchase program)Check Point Share RepurchasesAdjusting Check Point's share count to reflect this reduction in shares would lead to a new share count of 168,910,502, which is equivalent to diluted 2014 EPS of $4.06, based on the above net income assumption. Were EPS to rise to $4.06, it would represent an increase of more than 14% relative to our assumptions, and still leave Check Point with almost $1.9 billion in cash on its balance sheet.However, deployment of capital on dividends and/or buybacks is not the only path available for Check Point. Activist investors could push for a more strategic route to deploy the company's cash, namely the acquisitions of smaller security companies. Check Point's current cash balances, as well as its lack of debt, give the company ammunition with which to acquire other security companies, such as FireEye, which is growing at a far more rapid pace than Check Point. An acquisition of FireEye could help resolve Check Point's issues with top-line growth, while at the same time push FireEye closer to profitability as the company is integrated into Check Point's infrastructure and synergies are realized. Or, perhaps an activist would even push the company to stretch and attempt to acquire Palo Alto Networks. While Palo Alto Networks, with an enterprise value of over $7.2 billion is a difficult target to digest, a combination of debt and equity offerings, combined with Check Point's existing cash, could be enough to finance such a transaction. Or, activists could push the company to acquire several smaller security startups, as opposed to one of its publicly traded competitors.We believe that there are multiple ways for activist investors to leave their mark on Check Point. The combination of the company's pristine balance sheet and current growth trajectory have created a situation that is ripe for activist involvement if Check Point were to stumble. With Q3 results due later this month, investors will soon have a chance to see how Check Point is faring in the current security market landscape, and whether or not the company is in need of a more fundamental restructuring.The question these issues raise is this: what is a fair value for shares of Check Point? In our view, shares of Check Point deserve to trade at a premium to its ""basket"" of competitors on a price-to-cash flow basis, in light of its structurally higher ability to generate operating cash flows from its business. We believe that a price-to-cash flow multiple of 20x is fair for the company, and adequately encapsulates the potential returns of the involvement of activist investors, as opposed to its current multiple of 15.3x. We note that a multiple of 20x represents a premium of less than 18% to its peer average of 16.96x, despite the fact that Check Point generates over 75% more in operating cash flows from sales than its peers. At 20x operating cash flow, our price target for shares of Check Point is $81.70 (when accounting for the company's net cash), representing upside of almost 22% relative to Check Point's October 16, 2014 closing price. However, this particular multiple is contingent on the involvement of activists from a financial perspective (i.e., pushing for large-scale share repurchases). Were activists to push for a set of more strategic changes, such as a large-scale acquisition, we would re-evaluate that multiple, depending on how any strategic changes affect Check Point's cash flows, growth prospects, and addressable markets.In our view, valuing Check Point and its peers based on underlying cash flows, as opposed to EPS, is more appropriate, given that it better reflects each company's ability to generate cash. For Check Point and other companies with a heavy presence in software, deferred revenue plays a major role in how much operating cash flow that company can generate. Furthermore, the presence of deferred revenue can lead to net income being either understated or overstated in relation to underlying cash flows, something that a price-to-cash flow valuation can take into account, given that the impact of deferred revenue is now accounted for. For some investors, however, this raises the question of why not value Check Point and its peers based on free cash flow, given that this ultimately represents the cash available for return to shareholders? The answer to that lies with Check Point's peers. We believe that a free-cash flow based valuation would unfairly raise Check Point's position relative to its competitors, given the fact that its business is not as capital-intensive as those of its competitors. Intel serves as a prime example. Although Intel's operating cash flow is equivalent to over 38% of sales (behind only Check Point itself), free cash flow is equal to less than 18% of sales, due to the capital intensive nature of Intel's business, which requires significant and ongoing investments in foundries and other business assets. In contrast, Check Point's business is less capital-intensive, thereby unfairly elevating its free cash flow ratios in relation to its peers. A price-to-operating cash flow based valuation takes this into account, and allows investors to see the underlying ability of each company's business to generate cash, regardless of its level of capital intensity.Checking for Catalysts: 2 Scenarios for Check PointThe current state of affairs at Check Point has created what we believe to be an asymmetric risk/reward proposition, with either a highly positive outcome for shareholders in an activist scenario, or limited capital losses in the event of no activist involvement. We will begin our discussion with the 2nd outcome.Let us assume that no activist investor emerges to press for change at Check Point. While this would likely lead to a cap on short-term gains, the lack of activist involvement implies that there is little ammunition with which they have to press for changes at Check Point. However, the implication of this is that Check Point continues to perform at its current pace, delivering revenue and EPS growth while continuing to generate significant operating and free cash flows that further strengthen its balance sheet and allow for more share repurchases. If this is the case, we do not foresee meaningful downside for shares of Check Point from present levels if the company continues to meet guidance and maintain its position in the security market. But let us now assume that this is not the case. If Check Point is to begin missing guidance and begins failing to grow revenue and EPS, that will provide activist investors with the ammunition they need to begin pressing for change. After all, if this negative performance is a function of management's current strategy, then the implication is that said strategy should be changed, to one put forth by one or more activist investors. The entry of activist investors into Check Point would be highly likely to limit losses for shareholders in the event of negative results, and given that Check Point does not have a dual-class share structure with which to counter activist investors, they would at a minimum have a clear forum through which to press for change.But what if no activist emerges? If that is the outcome, then we see shares of Check Point as continuing to gradually climb higher (share are up ~13% over the past 12 months, outperforming both the NASDAQ and S&P 500 over the same time frame). Despite its size, Check Point is in the news far less often than its younger competitors, namely Palo Alto Networks and FireEye. Proof of this can be seen right here on Seeking Alpha. Check Point's last news ""alert"" was almost three months ago (as of October 16); in contrast both FireEye and Palo Alto Networks make news with far more regularity; Palo Alto Networks' last news alert was on October 14, and FireEye's on the morning of October 16. For Check Point, the days of triple-digit moves have long since passed. Assuming that the company continues at its current pace of growth and share repurchases, we believe that investors will continue to see long-term share price appreciation, albeit at reduced levels relative to if an activist were to step in and begin exerting pressure on the company. Without the involvement of activists, we see fair value for Check Point at $72.16. At that level, Check Point would be valued at 16.95x operating cash flows (excluding net cash), in-line with its peer average, and equivalent to upside of ~8%.ConclusionsWe do not believe that Check Point's current share price adequately reflects the company's true value. While Check Point may not be posting the torrid growth rates of companies such as FireEye or Palo Alto Networks, the company is growing faster than multiple of Tier 1 technology companies. And Check Point has margins that are higher than that of any competitor (even Microsoft), and generates more cash from its business than any other competitor. With a balance sheet bloated with cash, and positive, but somewhat unexciting growth, the situation at Check Point is ripe for the entry of an activist investor to press for meaningful capital deployments should Check Point stumble. And if not, then investors will own shares in a company that is continuing to steadily grow revenues and profits, all while buying back more and more of its share with each passing year."
2209953,24361,2014-05-12T19:25:19-04:00,"Check Point seems to be past the worst of the trade-downs and recent launches could boost billings growth.
        A willingness to spend more on sales and R&D and consider M&A marks a shift in a plan long focused on margins.
        Check Point's lower sales growth could constrain valuation, but the stock looks like an attractive risk/reward opportunity into the low $70s.","After a tough couple of years in which analysts and investors questioned whether Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP) could maintain its market share against more aggressive up-and-comers like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) and whether the company's prioritization of margin over share was the right strategy, 2013 was a good year for the shares. That momentum has been holding up of late, as although Check Point didn't have a great first quarter, the company has avoided a lot of the negativity that has hit Fortinet, Palo Alto, and FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) recently.As a stock, Check Point is a much different proposition than Palo Alto, FireEye, or Fortinet. This company isn't disrupting the market and isn't likely going to be growing revenue at a frequent annual double-digit rate. On the other hand, it has strong market share and a good margin and free cash flow base. I don't see the same overall upside to Check Point as its smaller rivals, but on a risk-adjusted basis, the return is still good enough to make this a worthwhile stock for less risk-tolerant investors.Q1 Comes In A Little WeakThere have been some high-profile disappointments in the security space, but Check Point's recent quarter was more of the ""good enough"" variety. Revenue rose 6% yoy, with 3% growth in products and 2% growth in software updates/maintenance boosted by 26% growth in software blade subscriptions.The problem is that multiple items were just a little weaker than expected. Product revenue was just a little shy of expectations, as were software blade and software update revenues. Billings growth of below 4% and deferred revenue growth of 12.5% were also a little shy of sell-side hopes.Margins were pretty much on target and continue to be excellent. Gross margin was basically flat with the year-ago at nearly 89%. Operating income rose more than 4%, with operating margin declining a point on higher sales and R&D spending.Moving Parts Still In MotionIt looks like the trading-down effect that was pressuring Check Point in 2013 has largely passed. On the other hand, judging by the relative performance in large deals, it looks as though Fortinet and Palo Alto might be doing better these days on the high end, while Check Point is seeing more success in the mid-market. I would also note that Check Point management's revenue guidance range for the second quarter was slightly wider than normal, perhaps indicating some ongoing uncertainties in the market.Rivals like Fortinet and Palo Alto did see better billings growth acceleration in this quarter, but Check Point could see a boost from here on the back of new product launches. The company has launched the 41000 system, a new data center/telco system with 61000-like architecture in a smaller footprint. Check Point also launched an upgraded Smart-1 appliance family. Last and not at all least is software-defined protection technology. This modular architecture takes a three-layer approach and can reportedly double the performance of the 61000 system.Time To Deal?Check Point management's comments suggest to me that they are considering modifying their business plan in response to the evolving competitive realities of the market. Management has long prioritized margins, but the increased spending in sales and R&D suggests a recognition that sacrificing some margin for growth may be in order now.Check Point still has better technology than it seems to get credit for in the market. Fortinet and Palo Alto have definitely had an impact on Check Point's share, but the company remains strong in high-end markets and the company's layered approach to APT looks at least competitive.Management does appear to be considering M&A as an option for augmenting its internal capabilities. Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS), Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT), and Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV) could make sense from the perspective of addressed markets, but I could also see companies like Bromium or Click Security as targets.Hold Serve, Or Win Back Points?Check Point can probably still take share from Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) in security, but there is also a threat that Cisco ups its game and/or that other companies (like EMC (EMC)) boost their network security presence. Then there is still the matter of competing with companies like Palo Alto, Fortinet, and FireEye that see themselves as disruptive share-gainers.My base case expectation is that Check Point is now a mid-single digit revenue growth story, and I'm looking for long-term annual revenue growth rates around 4% to 5%. That could be a problem for valuation, as tech stock valuation is often very sensitive to top-line growth. I do expect to see some free cash flow margin erosion in the future, but I expect it to remain above 50% and I'm looking for free cash flow growth to lag revenue by only a point or so. Were the company to get more aggressive with spending on a sustained basis I could see the potential for more revenue growth, but at the cost of margins.The Bottom LineI like Check Point, Fortinet, and Palo Alto Networks, but they're different growth/value/risk opportunities. Of them, I have the least worries that Check Point will significantly underperform my expectations, but also the least confidence that it will dramatically outperform. I think Check Point can trade into the high $60's or low $70s in the short term and on a risk/return basis, I think it is a good trade-off for investors looking for a less volatile tech stock with significant security market exposure.Disclosure: I am long EMC.

CEO Gil Shwed expressed his excitement over the quarter by stating, ""we are very pleased with the results of the first quarter.

Despite the large upswing in Check Point Software's valuation over the past few years, it still has room to grow in light of the company's increasing growth potential. Check Point Software's heavy emphasis on innovation and its promising growth path should propel the company moving forward.Here is a look at the company's consolidated income statement.Source: Check PointRelentless Technological InnovationCheck Point Software has been a lead innovator in the cybersecurity industry. Despite Check Point Software's current lofty position as one of the world's premier cybersecurity firms, the company is still innovating at a torrid pace. Many of the company's products/solutions have proven to be extremely effective in the evolving cyber landscape. In fact, the company has come to replace the products/services of many outdated legacy cybersecurity firms, and is continuing to push the frontiers of the cybersecurity industry.While Check Point Software has accelerated its innovation in nearly all of its business segments, the company has put a particular emphasis on its threat prevention and mobility segments. In addition to the acquisitions made to complement these two segments (i.e. Hyperwise and Lacoon Mobile Security), the company has developed and released increasingly sophisticated threat prevention and mobility products/solutions. The company's new Threat Extraction technology, for instance, has been extremely effective at detecting and destroying ATPs (Advanced Persistent Threats). In fact, the company has reported a perfect threat removal rate thus far.In addition, the Lacoon Mobile Security acquisition has significantly augmented the company's mobile security segment. With mobile devices becoming ever more popular, it only makes sense for Check Point Software to put more emphasis on this segment. Lacoon, which has major technology powerhouse customers such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) or Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), will give Check Point Software top-notch threat prevention technology for mobile devices using iOS or Android platforms. Lacoon utilizes static and dynamic defensive measures, which should augment Check Point Software's Capsule Mobile Security Solution for a superior mobile security product.Check Point Software is clearly not taking its leading cybersecurity position for granted, and is continuing to focus heavily on innovation. While breakneck innovation has become a prerequisite for success in the rapidly evolving cybersecurity industry, Check Point Software has proven to be one of the best in this area. The company should continue to beat expectations if it keeps up its performance.Promising Growth PathCheck Point Software's growth does not look to be slowing down anytime soon, which is clearly evident in the company's quarterly results. With cyberattacks gaining in frequency and severity, Check Point Software is one of the few cybersecurity companies able to competently handle such threats. With the increasing obsolescence of legacy cybersecurity products, Check Point Software is in a better position than ever to capitalize on the inevitable surge in cybersecurity business.Check Point Software's rapidly growing business segments clearly demonstrate the company's future potential, with its products and software blades growing 11% YOY. Other business segments, such as its Management Appliances and Software Updates/Maintenance grew at similarly rapid rates. Much of this growth was driven by impressive growth on the international scale, with increasing sales in major markets such as Asia and Europe. The company's performed especially well in Asia, where it grew its sales in the double-digit percentages.While the Americas and Europe still accounted for an overwhelming majority of total sales at 84%, sales in the rest of the world (Asia, Japan, Middle East, etc) are showing more promise. Check Point Software has also seen some of its biggest growth in large business (19% YOY growth in transactions over $1M), which does not come as a surprise given cybercriminals increasingly disproportionate attacks on large entities such as Fortune 500 corporations. Check Point Software is clearly firing on all cylinders in terms of growth, and with the cybersecurity situation becoming more dire than ever, the company should continue to exceed growth expectations in the years to come.ObstaclesDespite Check Point Software's excellent quarterly results and increasing dominance within the cybersecurity industry, the industry is still fraught with risk. The cybersecurity industry is essentially based upon software technologies, which are subject to incredible exponential rates of improvements. As such, maintaining dominance in the cybersecurity industry is notoriously hard given that cybersecurity is a rapidly moving target. The reason why legacy cybersecurity products have been so inadequate in protecting against modern-day cyberthreats is the profound increase in sophistication among cybercriminals, brought about in part by exponential software progress.On top of this, cybercriminals just a few decades back were basically rogue entities, whereas the impactful cybercriminals today are usually complex organizations oftentimes funded by entire governments. Cybercrime will very likely go through similar increases in sophistication moving forward, which means that the risk of obsolescence in this industry is exceedingly high. While Check Point Software has certainly proven itself capable of adapting to the rapidly changing cyberthreat landscape, the company will have to keep up its pace of innovation in order to survive in the long-term.ConclusionCheck Point Software is as well positioned as any in the fast-paced cybersecurity environment. With a 2014 net income of $659.57 and a market capitalization of $15.8B, Check Point Software still has additional upside. While Check Point Software's P/E ratio (""ttm"") is slightly above average at 25, the company is still undervalued given its market positioning, future growth momentum, and the growing promise of the cybersecurity industry. Cyberthreats are only becoming more complex by the day, which means that Check Point Software's leading cybersecurity products/services will be met with growing demand."
2499015,66613,2014-09-16T12:14:39-04:00,Spending on information security should continue growing at a strong consistent pace.Margin expansion has improved Check Point Software's profitability.Check Point Software has significant excess cash and liquid assets.,"Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP) is a recognized leader in providing of hardware and software solutions for network security. This segment should report high-single digit revenue growth for several years. CHKP's bottom line has improved in recent years due to gross margin expansion and a lower cost structure. Finally, CHKP has more than $3 billion in excess cash and marketable securities.Poised for Strong Revenue GrowthCHKP's revenues should benefit from companies increasing their spending on information security. Gartner, Inc. (Gartner) projects spending on information security will increase 8% in both 2015 and 2014. This estimate is consistent with the findings of PwC's 2014 Global State of Information Security Survey®, which solicits information from subscribers of CIO and CSO magazines. Among the survey's respondents, 49% expect spending on information security to increase, and only 11% expect spending to decrease. It should not surprise anyone that CIOs are ramping up the resources their firms devote to protecting information. The media has publicized several large-scale breaches of well-known corporations, such as Target and Home Depot.CHKP, a leading provider of hardware and software solutions for network security, is well-positioned to capitalize on the trend in spending on information security. CHKP focuses on software blades. On CHKP's most recent earnings call, CEO Gil Shwed emphasized that CHKP's products are designed to be expanded and upgraded. He believes this approach aligns well with the longer replacement cycles of information security. The company's website highlights some other advantages of its software blades:Improved MarginsCHKP has reported an increase in its gross margin, and a reduction in sales and general administrative expenses (SG&A) as a percentage of revenue since 2009. This improvement in gross margin reflects a combination of a sharp reduction in amortization expense, and a shift in sales toward more subscription and software. The table below shows amortization expense decreased significantly in 2012. This decrease positively impacted CHKP's gross margin by more than two percentage points.Source: SEC.govAnother source of gross margin improvement is the shift in sales to more subscriptions and software and less hardware. CHKP's gross margin on hardware products has been between 82% to 84% since 2009. Subscriptions and software generates gross margins of 90% or better. The graph below illustrates the correlation between the upward movement in CHKP's gross margins and the shift in its sales by product.Source: SEC.govThe decline in CHKP's SG&A as a percentage of sales reflects several trends. This ratio declined by almost six percentage points between 2009 and 2012 for the two reasons. First, revenue increased at an annual pace of 11%, which enhanced economies of scale. Second, amortization of intangibles decreased sharply from a peak of $22 million in 2010 to $2 million in 2013. SG&A increased in 2013 and 1H14 due to greater stock compensation expense, but it remains well below its 2009 level.Significant Excess CashCHKP has more than $3.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. This amount far exceeds its cash needed for working capital. Importantly, management appears committed to returning the excess cash to shareholders. They stated on CHKP's Q2'14 earnings that it was difficult to identify attractive acquisitions. CHKP significantly increased its share buybacks in 2011.ValuationWhile CHKP's potential for revenue growth, margin improvement and excess cash seem attractive; free cash flow is the crux of any valuation. Below is a simple model for valuing an all-equity firm with a relatively stable growth rate of cash flows.Value of Firm = Next Year's Free Cash Flow / (Cost of Equity - Growth Rate of Free Cash Flows) + Excess CashValue Per Share = Value of Firm / SharesFree cash flow is defined as EBITDA plus taxes on EBITA minus change in working capital minus capital expenditures. Below are CHKP's values for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014.Pre-tax operating income excludes CHKP's finance income, because this model assumes CHKP will return the excess cash, which is the source of the finance income, to shareholders.The capital asset pricing model estimates CHKP's cost of equity as 8.6%, assuming the following:Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Market Risk Premium = 2.6% + 1.0 * 6.0% = 8.6%Growth rates of stable companies can be estimated as the product of return on equity (ROE) and reinvestment rate. CHKP's ROE has been relatively stable - between 18% and 20% for the past five years. CHKP's reinvestment rate has declined to 20% because management has been focused on returning excess cash to investors. Assuming a growth rate of 4% is conservative, because CHKP's ROE since returning cash to shareholders will reduce its equity.CHKP should be able to manage its operations with $300 million in cash. That amount represents more than 15% of the company's revenue. Consequently, CHKP has $3.3 billion of excess cash.Combining the values from above results in a share price estimate of $76.Value of Firm = (512 * (1 + 4.0%)) / (8.6% - 4.0%) + 3,300 = 11,576 + 3,300 = 14,876Value per Share = 14,876 / 194.6 = $76While this amount represents less than 10% upside from today's price of $71, it should be thought of as a floor, because there are two specific factors that make the estimate very conservative. First, the increase in working capital of $109 million contradicts the general trend in working capital. The increase stems from a sharp decline in payables between June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2014. This drop is probably a one-time event; therefore, it seems unlikely that CHKP will need to fund another material increase in working capital. The second source of conservatism is assuming a 4% growth rate for near-term free cash flow. According to Yahoo Finance, analysts expect CHKP's earnings per share to increase 7% in 2015. Using a 7% growth rate for just the first year would add $2 to the valuation.ConclusionCHKP is attractively priced, given its combination of solid fundamentals and plans to return significant cash to investors. The company is a leading provider of information security products, a market segment that is poised for several years of strong growth. CHKP's profitability has improved in recent years due to gross margin expansion and a lower cost structure. Finally, the company has more than $3 billion in excess cash."

Buffett calls this cash flow ""owner earnings,"" which is basically free cash flow. Buffett defines owner earnings as the cash flow a business produces less the capital expenditures a business has for maintaining the business (he excludes growth capex).Free cash flow is the easiest way to approximate Buffett's ""owner earnings"" definition, and in some ways it's more conservative because it typically includes both maintenance and growth capex.CHKP - A Cash MachineFor weeks, I've noticed that Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP) has been at the top of the list in Value Line's weekly ""Biggest Free Flow Cash Generators"" screen. CHKP has generated an astounding 71 times more cash than it has needed to invest back into the business (more than two times the ratio of the next highest stock). That is an incredible cash flow machine.CHKP is a leading provider of software that protects computer networks from malicious attacks. I haven't done any detailed research on the business itself, and it's not extremely cheap, but on an EV/FCF basis, it looks somewhat attractive, especially given the incredible growth the company has experienced. In the last 10 years, the average annual growth rates are as follows:I don't know if the business can continue growing at these rates (most businesses don't grow as fast as they did the previous decade), but I can tell you that based on the basic metrics, this is one of the most consistent decades of performance and one of the cleanest balance sheets that you'll be able to find.Here are some of the key metrics:Free Cash FlowLook at the incredible amount of operating cash flow relative to the capital spending, which of course leads to significant free cash flow. The company is currently priced at around 9 times free cash flow (using EV/FCF), which is excellent in and of itself. But it has grown its free cash flow at an average rate of 16.7% per year over the last 10 years.This FCF has allowed the company to buy back about 20% of its shares over the past decade, a trend that will likely continue. The company pays no dividend, but given the extremely high internal returns it generates, that is actually a positive for shareholders. Better to keep the money in the business to continue compounding.MarginsNotice the incredibly high (and consistent) gross margins. Buffett said a company with consistent 40% gross margins likely has a competitive advantage. I don't know much about the business model yet, but I do know that a company that consistently has gross margins in the 80's and operating margins the 40's is doing something very well.Return on CapitalOne of the easiest and quickest ways to identify the quality of a company is to look at the returns it has generated on its capital. I look at ROE and ROIC, which in this case are identical because the company operates with 100% equity (CHKP has no debt). Like the margins, notice how consistent the returns have been:Balance SheetOne thing I mentioned above is how incredibly clean the balance sheet is. The company has grown steadily and consistently, but operates with no debt, and hasn't used debt in the last 10 years. The company has a market capitalization of $9.0 billion with $1.4 billion in cash and no debt, giving CHKP an enterprise value of about $7.6 billion.To Sum it UpCHKP has a market cap of about $9.0 billion and an enterprise value (EV) of about $7.6 billion at its recent stock price. In the last 12 months, the company has produced $897 million in free cash flow, giving the stock a 11.7% free cash flow yield on an EV basis.This unlevered free cash flow has allowed the company to steadily buy back shares and grow its book value at a rate of 15.0% per year over the past decade. Sales, earnings and free cash flow are all growing at roughly the same rates. The company produces an incredible amount of cash relative to the capital expenditures it needs to maintain and grow the business.The company already has a large market share in the internet security space, but this type of industry is prone to competitive pressures and fast changing technology, so this could certainly change. However, with a balance sheet like it has currently, it should be able to weather any storms that arise, and it will be better equipped to deal with adversity than competitors with inferior balance sheets.I am basing this initial post exclusively on the numbers, so please do your own research.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in CHKP over the next 72 hours.

Check Point offers its customers a portfolio of network security, data security and management solutions.Innovative Security SolutionsCheck Point continues to deliver innovative security solutions to protect both enterprises and consumers. With the recent release of new 600 Appliances, Check Point helps the small businesses to implement comprehensive security to ensure employees and data are protected at all times. Earlier in April, Check Point also launched its new 1100 Appliances to provide enterprise-class security in a compact desktop package, which is perfect for branch and remote offices.Fundamentally, Check Point continues to benefit from the increasing demand to fight cybercrimes. Check Point has higher revenue growth (3 year average) of 13.3 as compared to the industry average of 6.4 for the industry of application software. Check Point has much higher margins as compared to the averages. Check Point also generates solid ROA of 14.0 and ROE of 18.9 as compared to the averages of 8.2 and 15.5. Check Point has a strong cash position with $1.39B total cash and zero total debt. Check Point also generates over $905M of operating cash flow with a levered free cash flow of $660M, ttm. From the valuation perspective, Check Point's P/E of 15.8 is well below the industry average of 57.8. Check Point's Forward P/E of 12.4 is also lower than the S&P 500's average of 14.6.Checking out Check PointA quick comparison will be reviewed for Check Point and its peers in the industry of security software and services, including Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) and Juniper Networks Inc. (NYSE:JNPR). Fortinet provides integrated protection against security threats and addresses the fundamental problems of an increasing bandwidth-intensive network environment and a more sophisticated IT threat landscape. Fortinet, with a market cap of $2.92, continues to enjoy a higher revenue growth as compared to the industry average. On the other hand, Juniper Networks, with a market cap of $8.79B, provides its customers with network infrastructure solutions. Juniper is well positioned to continue its long-term growth by expanding into enterprise switch industry while continues to enjoy its strong presence in the carrier router market. These three companies will be compared for their revenues, quarterly EPS, profit margin, ROE, and P/E ratios.Source: YCharts.comWhile both Check Point and Fortinet's revenue have been growing steadily since early 2009, Juniper Networks' revenue has peaked at the end of 2010.Source: YCharts.comDespite the growing revenue, Fortinet's EPS has peaked at the end of 2010, whereas Juniper Networks' EPS has topped at the end of 2010. On the other hand, Check Point's EPS continues to be on the long-term uptrend since 2009.Source: YCharts.comBoth Fortinet and Juniper Networks' ROE have declined since early 2011. On the other hand, Check Point's ROE remains consistent and currently has the highest ROE of 18.88% among 3 companies.Source: YCharts.comFortinet's profit margin has topped at the end of 2009 while the profit margin has been fluctuating below 20% for Juniper Networks. Check Point's profit margin has increased steadily from mid-2009 to the end of 2012 and remains much higher as compared to Fortinet and Juniper Networks.Source: YCharts.comComparing to Fortinet and Juniper Networks, Check Point's P/E remains relatively lower and fluctuates within a narrower range. Check Point currently has the lowest P/E of 15.84 as compared to Fortinet's 48.09 and Juniper Networks' 34.17.Bottom LineWith continuous revenue and EPS growth, along with high ROE and profit margin, Check Point is much undervalued at current valuation. Supported with a solid balance sheet and zero total debt, Check Point also offers a strong, inexpensive cash flow (P/FCF of 10.68). Backed with its solid fundamentals and steady growth, Check Point remains a safe bet to fight against increasing cybercrimes.Disclaimer: Investors and traders are recommended to do their own due diligence and research before making any trading/investing decisions.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in CHKP over the next 72 hours.

The online dating service eHarmony said Wednesday that some of their users' passwords were stolen and millions appear to have been leaked onto the Internet. If you are from a rogue nation-state secretly developing weapons, you may be familiar with the computer viruses known as Stuxnet and Flame. In case you have not noticed, protecting our enterprise systems and even our home computers from viruses, worms, malware, etc. is big business and an absolute necessity. Additionally, the viability of the nascent ""cloud"" depends entirely upon securing our data.Organized crime rings and other groups continue to launch cyber-attacks, so enterprises large and small need to have up-to-date data and system protection. With new types of threats, spending on network security remains a priority even in the face of tight technology budgets.Symantec (SYMC) is the 800 pound gorilla in the network security subsector with $6,730 million in revenue. The other big player is Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP) with $1,278.8 million in revenues. Other, smaller players include Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV), Proofpoint (NASDAQ:PFPT), Sourcefire (NASDAQ:FIRE), Vasco Data Security (NASDAQ:VDSI-OLD) and Wave Systems (NASDAQ:WAVX).These companies provide software, appliances and services to protect data networks and websites from malicious attacks and security breaches. As the industry shifts from desktop computing to the ""cloud"", Check Point is capitalizing on the trend with security platforms for data centers and networks.The market research firm Gartner estimates that the worldwide market for security software is growing about 14% per year. The growth reflects the increase in cyber-attacks reported each week in the papers and probably many more never reported at all. Gartner sees continued growth for this subsector.In a recent article published by Bloomberg entitled, ""Israel Army's Cyber-Knowhow Aids Firms Hiring Hackers,"" the authors describe how Check Point is hiring the ""best and the brightest"" coming out the Israel defense Force's cyber-defense and intelligence units. The article recounts a McAfee study that states that Israel in one of three countries best prepared to withstand a cyber-attack.Check Point develops markets and supports a range of software, as well as combined hardware and software products and services for information technology (IT) security. The Company offers its customers a portfolio of network and gateway security solutions, data and endpoint security solutions and management solutions. Its solutions operate under unified security architecture. During the year ended December 31, 2011, Check Point introduced software blades, such as Application Control, URL Filtering, and an antibot software blade. The Company derives its revenues mainly from products, licenses, combined hardware and software products, software updates and maintenance and subscriptions. On April 17, 2012, it introduced ThreatCloud and GAiA unified secure operating system. On November 24, 2011, the Company acquired Dynasec Ltd.For the quarter ending 3/12, EPS grew to $0.68 or 19.3% from the year-ago EPS of $0.57. EPS growth for the trailing twelve months was 14.2% as EPS went from $2.23 in 2011 to $2.66 in 2012. In 1Q12, sales were 11.3% higher, $313.1 million versus $281.3 million in 1Q11. Sales growth for the trailing twelve months was 12.8% with sales growing to $1,278.8 million from $1,134.1 million. In FY11, sales were $1,247.0 million and EPS diluted was $2.65. About 40% of the company's sales originate in North America and the remainder primarily from Europe and Asia.Check Point consistently reports very high gross margins. The most recently reported gross margin is 86.4% as compared to the industry median of 59.6%. The five year average gross margin is 86.8%. Operating margins for the past twelve months is 52.7% whereas the industry median is -0.37%. Check Point has a five year average operating margin of 45.2%.The balance sheet is very strong. The company holds no long term debt and carries $1,398.2 million in cash and short term investments on its books. The company neither pays a dividend nor does it buy back many shares.The case for Check Point is that it is a very successful company on the leading edge of a growing segment of the network security industry. The company is very profitable, has superior profitability metrics and is growing. It also has access to some of the best minds in network security which enables it to stay ahead of the criminals and hackers.The negative argument for Check Point is valuation. Looking at the usual relative valuation metrics, Check Point is overvalued. On a PE basis, the company is selling at a premium to the markets trailing PE and its forward PE. Is the premium warranted? The PEG based on estimated FY12 EPS and the estimated growth rate for the next five years is 1.4X. This is not especially high but it is not low either.The trailing PE of 19.6X is above the company's five year average PE of 17.5; the PS ratio, at 8.37X is above the five year average of 6.96X; and, PB is 3.35X as compared to the average of 2.79X. The enterprise value ratios shown above are significantly above the industry medians.Check Point's 52 week trading range is $47.79 to $65.00 and the Wall Street journal reports analyst target prices in the $57 to $78 range with a median TP of $67.00. Reuters has FY12 sales estimates ranging from a low of $1,369.65 million to a high of $1,393.76 million with an average of $1,379.07 million. Revenues for FY13 are estimated to range from $1,458.35 million to $1,542.30 million and average $1,511.15 million. Earnings estimates for FY12 range from $3.14 to $3.28 and for FY13, $3.29 to 3.67.We think that fair market value is $32.44 or 10.3X our estimate of FY12 free cash flow.

686121,20210,2012-06-27T03:02:41-04:00,,"The company isn't in my portfolio, but the fall in its share price to an annual low prompts me to give another check-up to Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq: CHKP), the most successful high-tech company to have arisen in Israel. Last week, there was speculation that the fall in the share price in recent months was attributable to investors' nervousness in the face of the forthcoming IPO by a small competitor, Palo Alto Networks (PLTO), which sounds like nonsense to me. Since when has the IPO of a minor rival been a significant threat to the business of a leading public company?If Palo Alto-- of which one the founders and its CTO is Nir Zuk, who was with Check Point in its early days-- is really such a technological threat to Check Point, then it ought to have hurt Check Point even as a privately-held company, and that hasn't happened. After all, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) dizzying success hit the business of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and others long before its IPO in May this year.In my view, Check Point is falling because it is finding it hard to grow, irrespective of competitors, and it's hard because securing the cyber world has become very complicated, with Check Point's historic and highly profitable Firewall no longer the mainstay it was for so many years. Last week, for example, Check Point announced that it would use Radware Ltd. (Nasdaq: RDWR) technology for preventing hacking.With 40% of Check Point's sales coming from Europe, which is in the midst of a financial crisis, and with the dollar having strengthened substantially against the euro during the quarter, Check Point will apparently struggle to grow at an annual rate of more than 10%. This means that, even though Check Point is a mighty cash generating machine, if its growth rate falls to a single-digit figure, investors will shrink its p/e ratio for the coming year, which currently stands at 14, and its sales multiple, currently 7.In the past, I did hold Check Point in my portfolio, but I said goodbye to it as soon as the shareholders meeting passed a decision in 2003, that seemed scandalous to me at the time, to award two million options to founder, chairman and CEO Gil Shwed, and one million options to Marius Nacht, his deputy and a co-founder. Two million options amount to nearly 1% of the company, and I presume that if ""Mr. Teva"", the late Eli Hurvitz, had received a similar annual bonus for work no less amazing than that of ""Mr. Check Point"", it would have shocked the capital market.It seemed to me then utterly fantastic that at the shareholders meeting that took place in the summer of 2003 to approve the 2002 financials, two managers, Shwed and Nacht, received such fat bonuses for 2002, which was one of the worst years ever for the company. In April 2002, it published a severe profit warning that led to the share price nose-diving. The share ended 2002 at $13, 70% below the price at the beginning of that year. I thought at the time that the bonus would be a one-time thing, but it has kept cropping up, slightly altered, year after year, to this very day. There is therefore no chance that I will come back to the share. When I read the notice of the 2012 shareholders meeting held at the beginning of the month in which Shwed was again awarded 1.6 million options, the penny dropped with me over what had happened in the ten years since the aggressive options program began.Shwed received altogether 16.7 million options, and his partner Marius Nacht received another few million, the result being that they have by now fortified their control of the company, with a critical blocking minority stake of 25%, which they did not have a decade ago. They have also sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shares along the way. The fact that Shwed receives an annual salary of $1 is only a fig leaf for the aggressive options scheme. Steve Jobs, for example, also took $1 a year, but he did not take options during all of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent years of plenty. There's a great deal of talk here about tycoons and haircuts, but, in my view, Shwed and his partner, tycoons in every respect, have carried out a transfer of wealth from investors to their own pockets that is no less scandalous, because it is at the public's expense just as a haircut for bondholders is at the public's expense.Had Shwed and Nacht been more modest in receiving options, as for example Eyal Waldman of Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) and Eli Fruchter of EZchip (EZCH)-- two founders and managers who without doubt are now building the next Check Points-- have been, then Check Point shareholders would have been in a much better position today. The company would have had far fewer shares, making earnings per share higher, and that would have translated into a higher share price on the market.Published by Globes [online], Israel business news - www.globes-online.com - on June 25, 2012 Reprinted on Seeking Alpha with permissionDisclosure: No positions"
1128491,24361,2013-01-24T16:29:28-05:00,,"It's hard to find many companies that post better-looking financials than security specialist Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP). While this company boasts significant market share, impressive financials, and very strong technology, it does come up short in one of the most critical metrics for tech stocks - top-line growth. With Wall Street already expecting little from this company going forward, it may be worth management's time to consider trading some margin or cash on the balance sheet for a better shot at stronger growth numbers.Another Disappointment As Sales Growth Slows Even FurtherCheck Point has given the impression of a business coasting to a stop for a while now, and fourth quarter results aren't going to help. Revenue was up just 3% this quarter - disappointing in its own right and a little shy of sell-side estimates, but also continuing a disturbing trend. This makes seven straight quarters where the year-on-year revenue growth has declined, and while all of 2011 saw quarters with double-digit revenue growth and 2012 started off that way, growth has now slowed in the low-single digits.While revenue continues to disappoint, Check Point management continues to wring impressive profitability out of that revenue. Gross margin improved almost two points from last year, and eased about 50bp from the third quarter level. Operating income (GAAP basis) rose 9% from last year and 15% from the prior quarter, as the company saw modest growth in G&A and expenses and actually spent less on sales and marketing.Is Management Willing To Be Aggressive?Investors craving more growth may be a little disappointed that management didn't seem all that troubled by the company's reported performance. Management cited some issues like strong year-ago results and some sales delays ahead of new product launches, but the reality is that zero volume growth is still problematic.Security is still a growing market, but it's getting harder for the big players to post impressive-looking numbers. Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) growth rate from security in its most recent (non-contemporaneous) quarter was a not-so-impressive 6%, and Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) hasn't been exactly lighting up the scoreboard either. That leaves Check Point and Cisco looking rather feeble next to companies like Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) and Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW) even though the latter's market shares are quite a bit smaller overall and they don't rake in the cash like Check Point and Cisco.The thing is, I think there's still an opportunity here for Check Point to do better. The company's products are strong, and there's legitimate debate about whether Check Point's Application Control blades are just as good as Palo Alto's competing products (the assumption would normally seem to be that Palo Alto is clearly better).Moreover, in talking to resellers it seems that Check Point's reputation for being a high-quality/high-price provider is not necessarily supported by facts - Check Point may be pricey relative to Fortinet (Fortinet has a reputation for competing on price), but Check Point stacks up well against Palo Alto. Talking to resellers also led me to realize that there's a tremendous amount of marketing ""noise"" out there, and Check Point could be well-served by fighting fire with fire and improving/intensifying its marketing efforts - really selling customers on its capabilities and true cost relative to the rivals.Could Check Point Be A Buyer?Throwing money at sales and marketing doesn't necessarily solve Check Point's growth concerns, and I do think the company's R&D spend is appropriate. That could leave an acquisition as another, better, opportunity for incremental growth. I realize investors often look down on growth-by-acquisition stories, but the right deal at the right price can be a force multiplier over the long term.Intrusion prevention (IPS) is the one area of security where Check Point seems to have single-digit market share, and a deal for Sourcefire (NASDAQ:FIRE) could make sense - particularly as both companies usually claim that ""they don't see each other"" in the market, suggesting below-average overlap or cannibalization. It's also worth noting that Check Point management has said in the past that it sees itself as a consolidator in the industry, so it may be time for the company to direct some of that ample cash on the balance sheet towards generating more long-term growth.Little Seems To Be ExpectedI have enough experience with the frustrations of owning low-growth tech stocks that I'm hesitant to jump into Check Point with the company posting such low revenue growth (and issuing 2013 guidance suggesting about 6% revenue growth). That said, cash flow analysis suggests that the market sees Check Point falling off in a significant way.Most market research groups (IDC, et al) believe that the enterprise security market will continue to grow at an average rate in the mid-to-high single digits through 2016. Assuming that Check Point lags that a bit, a long-term revenue CAGR of 5% seems realistic. At the same time, I think slowing sales momentum and increased competition will whittle away some of the company's stellar margins - leading to lower free cash flow margins and long-term free cash flow growth of about 3%. At that growth rate, though, fair value on this stock would still seem to be in the mid-$60s.Flipping the equations around, the market's valuation on Check Point today (assuming a discount rate slightly higher than the market average) would suggest that the company is going to see free cash flow shrink at a rate of about 2% into the future. While it's true that tech companies almost never fade away slowly like that, I think the point is still relevant that the Street basically says Check Point is a run-off operation.The Bottom LineAs I just said, I'm hesitant to buy into Check Point with such low growth - this is a stock that could just languish waiting for the next big buyback announcement, while smaller rivals like Fortinet and Palo Alto continue to post impressive growth and see investors step up to pay premiums for that growth.That said, value is value, and I believe Check Point is underpriced - even if its destiny is to effectively take itself private via long-term share buybacks. What's more, while this year hardly provides strong support for this idea, I do believe this company's appliances and technology are underrated in the market and this company could grow again. This idea will demand some patience, but I think value-oriented tech investors may want to dig deeper into Check Point.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The  quarter’s results increased 18.5% from a year ago. Revenue saw a 15.1%  year-over-year increase, aided by strong performances by the Product  & Licenses as well as Software Updates, Maintenance and Services  segments. However, the overall improvement was mainly aided by the  growing demand for its security products.Check Point has earned a reputation among customers and analysts for  providing simple, all-in-one security solutions that provide the highest  level of protection to small and mid-sized businesses and remote/branch  offices. Hence, we believe new product ramp up will better serve the  growing demand for Check Point’s security products.Management GuidanceCheck Point expects revenue of between $300.0 million and $308.0 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of 67 to 70 cents.For 2011, revenue is forecast at between $1.225 billion and $1.250  billion (raised from the previous guidance range of $1.185 billion and  $1.225 billion). Check Point expects non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.77  to $2.84 (previously $2.65–$2.75).Agreement of AnalystsGiven the company’s broader suite of offerings and its steadily growing  annuity blade content, growing network security spending and continuous  share gains, some analysts believe its projected growth rate should  exceed the guidance. Hence, most of the analysts raised their revenue  estimates for FY11 and FY12 based on the company’s ongoing appliance  upgrade adoption cycle and momentum on the software blade architecture  front.The analysts are also confident about Check Point’s market share gain versus tech giant Cisco Systems Inc.

The analysts are also optimistic about the improved  enterprise information technology spending environment.Out of the 11 and 12 analysts providing estimates for the third quarter  and fiscal 2011, respectively, none revised their estimates upward in  the past 30 days. Also, there was no estimate revision for fiscal 2012.The limited number of changes to estimates point to the fact that there  was no major catalyst during the quarter that could drive results.  Consequently, most of the analysts are sticking to the estimates they  provided post second quarter earnings.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThere was no change to the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the third  quarter and fiscal 2011 over the past 30 days. However, the third  quarter estimate moved up a penny in the past ninety days. Also, the  Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2011 increased 4 cents over the past  ninety days.

High profile data breaches, including at Epsilon and Sony, are keeping enterprise IT spending focused on security software. And, as data continues to be shifted offsite, security software demand will continue higher, which is good news for Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP). Networks are getting increasingly complex and decentralized, increasing the need for real time, high-speed protection. Security and related product industry revenue will increase to $71 billion by 2014 from $55 billion today, with enterprise security spending growing 10.9% annually. In 2010, global security spending reached 14% of client IT budgets, up from 8.2% in 2007. And, according to IDC, 31% of responding firms indicated security spending as a priority this year. One of the fastest sectors for security spending is healthcare, where deeper integration of client information, spurred by the Hitech Act of 2009, is boosting demand for next generation data security for patient health records. In finance, banks and credit services continue to respond to consumer appetite for online and mobile solutions, further pressuring them to invest in software security. And, expanding direct-to-consumer retail sales supports security spending too as shoppers increasingly shift spending online.All this activity boosted Check Point's Q2 revenue by 15%. Earnings per share climbed even more quickly, rising 17%. In 2010, the company's earnings per share of $2.48 was 56% higher than its 2007 pre-recession level. And, next year is expected to improve to $3.13 per share. Given the street has underestimated earnings in each of the past four quarters, its likely analysts will continue to chase earnings higher into 2012. Just this past month, Check Point upped its forecast for this year to $2.84 from $2.75, adding pressure on analysts to do just that.Rising sales and earnings are strengthening the company's balance sheet. Check Point is sitting on $1.15 billion in cash and equivalents, some $5.56 per share with no debt. And this financial strength allows Check Point to actively buy back stock. Last quarter, it repurchased 1.38 million shares. In February, the company's board boosted its buyback authorization to $300 million for this year, a 50% increase from last year's $200 million program.Despite all this, however, Checkpoint is trading nearly 18% off its 52 week high and has traded higher in only three of the past seventeen trading sessions. With the stock sitting on its 200 day moving average for the first time since Q3 2010, investors looking to buy solid balance sheets in growing industries should take advantage of the current sell-off to buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in CHKP over the next 72 hours."

Though the stock is a more compelling buy on a pullback to the low to mid $40’s, a level I expect it will reach if (when?) we retest 1100 on the S&P, the current price still offers a 6.1% free cash flow yield. While much of the tech space is priced to the clouds, Check Point’s growth is available right now at a reasonable price.

The company is a global leader in cyber security software with products deployed in virtually every major global corporation including all Fortune 100 companies and its technology dominates the global market for perimeter defenses such as firewalls and virtual private networks. The company describes itself as:The expansion in the threat posed by IT vulnerabilities has already had a profound effect on the security industry - encouraging growth in IT security spending which has produced a parallel proliferation of niche security technology vendors. This, in turn, has awoken the interest of major vendors who now see security as an essential requirement in their broader IT infrastructure portfolios - a requirement they have met by acquiring IT security specialists, including almost all of Check Point’s significant former competitors.Check Point made the strategic decision to broaden its own portfolio of technologies beyond the perimeter. The company has made several acquisitions to expand their core offerings to include end-point solutions, VPN, firewall, data security and intrusion prevention systems. These acquisitions form a foundation for Check Point to offer single-agent endpoint security covering everything from the network edge to core information assets.On a fundamental basis, Check Point is a well run company. Even with the global recession, in the first quarter of 2009, the company grew revenues by 1.8% to $195 million and grew earnings by 3.4% to $80.9 million (0.38 per share). It has more than $1.0 billion of cash and no long term debt."

(NASDAQ:CHKP)  posted strong third quarter 2010 results, with adjusted earnings per  share of 59 cents surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents.  The adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items, but include  stock-based compensation expense. Check Point witnessed strong network  security product sales across all regions, particularly in the Americas  and Asia/Pacific regions.RevenueCheck Point reported revenue of $273.2 million in the third quarter, up  16.9% from $233.6 million in the year-ago period. The quarter’s revenue  surpassed the guided range of $255.0–$265.0 million and the Zacks  Consensus Estimate of $262.0 million. The improvement could be  attributed to a 22.5% year-over-year growth in Check Point’s Product and  Licenses revenue.The improvement in Product revenue was led by strong product adoption  including the IP series, Power-1, UTM-1 and Smart-1 solutions. Moreover,  Check Point witnessed 13.7% year-over-year growth in its Software  Updates, Maintenance and Services revenue.Check Point delivered strong geographical growth during the quarter.  Contributions to total revenue were 44%, 38% and 18% from the Americas,  Europe and Asia/Pacific (including Japan, Middle East and Africa),  respectively.Operating ResultsGAAP gross margin was 84.6%, slightly down from 84.5% in the year-ago  quarter. Excluding one time items (stock based compensation expenses and  amortization charges), non-GAAP gross margin remained flat year over  year at 87.8%. The growth rate of cost of goods sold was roughly in line  with the revenue growth rate.On a GAAP basis, operating margin was 49.4% in the third quarter  compared to 45.1% in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was  57.4% versus 54.6% in the year-earlier quarter. The improvement in  operating results was driven by strong revenue growth, which outpaced  the 7.8% increase in operating expenses.The quarter’s GAAP net income was $114.5 million or 54 cents per share,  up from $91.5 million or 44 cents per share in the comparable quarter  last year. Excluding the impact of charges related to amortization of  intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and income tax  benefit, non-GAAP net income was $132.6 million or 63 cents a share  compared to $109.5 million or 52 cents a share in the year-earlier  quarter. However, after taking into account the effect of stock-based  compensation expense, adjusted net income per share was 59 cents.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowCheck Point exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and  marketable securities of approximately $954.2 million, down from $983.3  million in the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations was $144.6  million in the quarter, up from $126.1 million in the year-earlier  quarter. Capital expenditure increased to $1.44 million from $1.04  million in the year-earlier quarter. During the quarter, Check Point  repurchased 1.44 million shares for a total consideration of $50  million.GuidanceFor the fourth quarter, Check Point expects revenue to range between  $290.0 million and $312.0 million. Earnings per share are expected to be  in the range of 56 to 61 cents on a GAAP basis and 65–70 cents on a  non-GAAP basis.For fiscal year 2010, Check Point expects revenue to be in the range of  $1.07–$1.09 billion, up from the previously guided range of $1.04–$1.07  billion. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of  $2.02–$2.07 on a GAAP basis (previously $2.00–$2.10) and $2.38–$2.43 on a  non-GAAP basis (previously $2.30–$2.40).Our TakeCheck Point delivered an impressive third quarter, beating the Zacks  numbers both in respect of revenue and earnings per share. The quarter’s  results also surpassed the company’s guidance. We remain encouraged by  the upbeat guidance and believe that steady traction of the Software  Blade architecture (security solution) could add meaningful incremental  revenue going forward.Additionally, we believe new product ramps will better serve the  surging demand for Check Point’s security products. We believe these  factors would drive considerable upside to the shares. We therefore have  a Zacks Rank of #1 on Check Point shares, implying a short-term Strong  Buy rating."

29108,20566,2007-03-09T03:42:14-05:00,,"Sometimes I think that analysts are paid by the word, rather than by the performance of their stock picks. That can be the only reason for the Citi analyst’s report on Checkpoint’s (NASDAQ:CHKP) possible purchase by private equity firms. Gil Schwed is never going to sell Checkpoint to private equity firms. I am so sure of my opinion that I am willing to eat my hat on YouTube if I am wrong. On the surface, there is some plausibility to the analyst’s premise. The new masters of the universe are private equity guys. They are sitting on piles of cash. Banks are throwing money at them at low interest rates. There is nothing that they cannot buy -- except for a Zionist. For certain Chief Executives of public companies, there is an appeal to working in private equity. Public company CEOs endure more public scrutiny than their counterparts in the private sector. Much maligned CEOs like Home Depot’s Robert Nardelli have joined private equity shops and vowed never to work in the public sector again. But billionaire Checkpoint founder Gil Schwed does not have that problem. He is treated like a rock star by his shareholders. If anything, he has the opposite problem. His shareholders do not ask tough enough questions. No one balks at his rich stock option awards. This is probably because he made his initial stockholders millionaires. There is a plus side to all the adoration. It has allowed Gil the luxury of managing his company for the long term and not having to worry about massaging quarterly earnings. To his credit, Schwed refused to be pressured into jumping into an acquisition until he found the right one. He rightly has refused to pay a dividend to his stockholders. He knows that Checkpoint can better use the money that would pay a 2% dividend to make acquisitions with a thirty percent growth rate. He treats his shareholder’s money like it is his own. Guess what? Much of it is his and the other co-founders'. In the aftermath of the blowup of the Sourcefire acquisition by Checkpoint, I had the pleasure of spending time with Eyal Desheh, CFO of Checkpoint. Although they hired the best lawyers and lobbyists, everyone knows that Checkpoint was stymied in their attempt to buy Sourcefire by the Bush Administration. There were many sound business reasons why Checkpoint did go to the mat on the Sourcefire acquisition. Among them, the company was afraid of burning their bridges with the American government for the next acquisition. They also did not want to sustain any more body blows to the company image. There was also a Zionist reason. Eyal confided in me that the company did not want to hurt the position of the government of Israel. When Mr. Desheh said this, I was sitting right across from him and looking him in the eye. There was no question of his sincerity. In this age of worship of the almighty dollar, his Zionism was so touching that it brought a tear to my eyes. How does this relate to the sale of Checkpoint to private equity firm? Gil Schwed and company know the way private equity firms work. They often slash jobs and costs upon their takeover of a company. They do not want to be the reason for headlines in Israeli newspapers like “5000 jobs cut at Checkpoint” or “Checkpoint headquarters moved to New Jersey”. In fact, Schwed has a friendly competition with Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) going. He wants to beat them and be the number one company in Israel. The report troubled me for another reason. Without saying it directly, the analyst is implying that he no longer sees Checkpoint as a growth stock. Private equity guys are not in the venture capital business. They are not looking for growth. They buy businesses that they think that are steady but not spectacular earners. This could mean that Checkpoint and all the network security firms are becoming commoditized like chip stocks. Fittingly, Blackstone Group has recently made a bid for Freescale Semiconductor. Commoditization usually means a collapse in the price earnings ratio. I remember when Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) traded at a forward P/E of 50. It now trades at 14 forward P/E. The same thing could happen to Checkpoint. People have become blasé about network security. That malaise will continue until there is a new virus or a big company’s security is breeched. The street reacted with great excitement on the news of Checkpoint’s acquisition of Protect Data AB. The stock rebounded 30%. That is old news now. As my boss at Merrill Lynch used to say, what are you going to do for me today? At a price of 22, I would hold Checkpoint or use it as source of funds. You could score a double with Checkpoint in your investment portfolio but not a homerun. If Checkpoint makes another stellar acquisition or the son of the Trojan virus attacks, I will have been wrong and Checkpoint stock is going to the races. CHKP 1-yr chart"
22935,20211,2006-12-24T03:05:26-05:00,,"Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) is experiencing a real Chanukah miracle: The higher the stock rises, the more analysts there are rating it “Buy.” Shouldn’t it be the other way around? The number of analysts rating Check Point “Buy” has now risen to six, compared with two last month. Basically, if we siphon off all the fanfare, we will discover that those analysts have one reason for recommending Check Point, and that is the company’s decision to go on a shopping spree. All the other components of the forecasting models remain unchanged. Both Check Point and Teva (NYSE:TEVA) are saddled with the same problem with regard to the incongruity between Wall Street and Main Street. Last Wednesday, Check Point fell after rumors claimed that the deal with the Swedish company Protect Data was not going as well as they had hoped, since less than half the shareholders had given their consent. But then Check Point raised its bid by almost 4% this past Tuesday and announced that it would be acquiring another company for $20 million, following which the investors calmed down. I do not believe the Swedish saga is over yet. Moreover, I believe Check Point was wrong to frame the offer in the manner they did, by saying the deal would go through only with the consent of 90% of Protect Data’s shareholders. Why should they be in any rush if Check Point is upping its bid? If they can get $625 million, why not wait until the offer goes up to $650 million and perhaps even higher? If Gil Shwed backs out of the deal because he can’t get enough support for a bid of even $625 million, Check Point’s stock will nosedive, since the analysts will claim that Check Point can’t make up its mind and Shwed is not committed to growth. Shwed is being tightfisted, they’ll claim, in addition to other derisive comments that no one likes to hear, not least talented managers. Check Point has stated that it is unlikely to raise its bid again, but it looks to me as though someone has advised the Swedes not to back down. The Street.com columnist Priya Ganapati got to the root of the matter in the opening of her column on Tuesday. “A failed acquisition attempt, falling profit and criticisms of complacency and lost market share have finally shaken Check Point out of its slumber,” she said. Susquehanna Financial Group senior research analyst Greg Moskowitz concurred. “They have really answered the call,"" he wrote. “They received a lot of criticism about being too complacent about the direction and corporate strategy. Now, this speaks to a more aggressive Check Point."" If I were Shwed, I would make a new $450 million bid for Sourcefire (the U.S. security intrusion software company that Check Point tried to acquire at the beginning of the year, but was blocked by federal security agencies). That would generate at least another 25 “Buy” ratings from analysts. On the other hand, think what will happen if the Swedish deal falls through. While CIBC World Markets has rated Check Point “Buy”, Oscar Gruss analyst Ehud Eisenstein has reiterated his “Hold” rating with a target price of $20. He is one analyst who does not follow the crowd, and he is usually right. Eisenstein does see Check Point improving but prefers to wait and see how things develop.

24478,20307,2007-01-18T06:59:41-05:00,,"Yesterday, Credit Suisse’s Paul Winslow upgraded Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP) to Outperform from Neutral, and increased his price target to $27, from $22.50.  Winslow says he has been cautious on the stock in recent years over concern about the long-term growth prospects of the company’s core firewall and VPN business, and an apparent lack of strategic plan to recharge growth. But Winslow now says that recent acquisitions of Protect Data and NFR Security “provide Check Point with an improved product set to better grow outside of the firewall/VPN market, which should improve the forward growth profile of the company.” Winslow says buying the two acquired companies “should re-instill growth into the company’s business model and provide new products for Check Point’s channel to sell.” Check Point was up 70 cents yesterday at $24.08.

34160,20211,2007-05-01T17:25:09-04:00,,"Oscar Gruss's talented analyst Ehud Eisenstein has just reiterated his ""Hold"" rating for Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP). The review came out on April 26, when the stock price stood at $24. Eisenstein begins by saying that Check Point has beaten both his own forecast and the consensus estimate. The company's sales for the first quarter totaled $164 million, up 2.4% on the fourth quarter and by 23% on the corresponding quarter of 2006. I remind you that one of the reasons for the fall in the stock last year was the analysts' consensus forecast, which claimed that the company was not growing, and that they could not see any growth engines. Twenty-three percent represents significant growth, but who remembers last year? The net profit fell, if you calculate it according to GAAP, or it rose handsomely if you use non-GAAP. Check Point's management says that year-on-year growth will continue to be just over 23% in the second quarter, and that it will reach 23% for 2007 as a whole. Eisenstein notes that the company's balance sheet is now stronger and that the company's traditional businesses are now back on track. What Eisenstein is saying, in other words, is that the company is now back on track and that we will now have to wait and see how it progresses following the two acquisitions it made during the last twelve months. So if that's the case, why not buy this stock? Supposing the management has been right up to this point, and assuming that Check Point does indeed expand its areas of activity, what logic would there be in me staying in ""Hold""? Eisenstein is apprehensive about the company's performance capacity. Check Point, he explains, recently underwent a restructuring with the aim of increasing sales and stemming the fall in sales of its brand product. The company strengthened its global sales operations, and it has unveiled new products, as it attempts to penetrate the data protection field (through its acquisition of Pointsec Mobile Technologies). Eisenstein says he believes that the key factor that will continue to drive the recent momentum in sales is the ability to execute. The integration of Pointsec and the development of new sales channels still represent a challenge for the company. Eisenstein feels that the dearth in acquisition and merger options on the one hand, and the maturing of its key brand on the other, will continue to put pressure on Check Point's performance level and could limit the management's forecast to 2007. Two more factors that he notes are the company's dependence on several large customers, especially Nokia, and increasing competition. This, more or less, is the opinion of most of the analysts currently covering Check Point. To be honest, I have difficulty understanding why that should be the case. If you read the reviews written by Eisenstein and others, and look at Check Point over last year, you will get a pretty good picture which all the analysts are well aware of too. If that's the case, then this review can be summed up by saying that Eisenstein has doubts about Gil Shwed's guidance. He fears that Shwed will not meet his program for 2007, and reading between the lines, I can even detect a hint of a lack of faith in the company's guidance. For the past year and more, the overwhelming majority of analysts, Eisenstein included, have advised investors not to jump on Shwed's bandwagon. Those people who heeded their advice and steered clear of Check Point, lost out on the extremely high return that the stock ultimately delivered. It looks to me as though the analysts' fears center more around a lack of confidence in the management's ability than on business facts, and what is astounding is that this management has actually met all the goals that the analysts previously hoped it would reach. I still believe that it's very hard to find merchandise like this that is so worth its stock market price.

22537,20211,2006-12-17T05:01:31-05:00,,"Analysts at investment bank CIBC World Markets have just published their round-up of third quarter company results, and have listed their preferred Israeli stocks. Their three favorites are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE:TEVA), Elbit Systems (NASDAQ:ESLT), and NICE Systems (NASDAQ:NICE), followed by Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP). Check Point made the list because of the imminent closure of its acquisition of Swedish company Protect Data AB (OTCPK:PROT), the sole owner of PointSec Mobile Technologies. CIBC analysts feel this acquisition will provide Check Point with the growth it so sorely lacked. What do CIBC analysts Avivit Mannet-Kalil and Shaul Eyal actually say in their analysis of Check Point? That after a number of relatively quiet quarters and with sales growth grinding almost to a standstill, Check Point’s announcement of its offer for Project Data will take it into fields that it never previously engaged in -- palmtop computers, laptops, and cell phones. The Swedish company operates in a market that has a growth rate of more than 30%, compared with 10% in Check Point’s own market. Looking three or four months back to the period before Check Point considered making an offer for Project Data, I find myself reflecting on the relationship between Wall Street and Main Street. What was it that made the analysts change their opinion in this particular instance? The offer for the Swedish company. Note that this acquisition has not yet closed, but Check Point has still gained 30% since the announcement of the offer a month ago. Had we all been a bit smarter, we would have rushed out and bought Check Point shares two months ago. The stock did not fall the way it did because of problems inside the company, or because analysts were annoyed at it for not making the acquisition offer it finally came up with a month ago. Of all those analysts who downgraded their ratings for Check Point, I didn’t notice a single one who claimed that Check Point’s situation is bad. Everyone complained that the problem with Check Point was that it either cannot or will not make an acquisition, and so they did not anticipate a revival of its growth. The development that changed Wall Street’s attitude toward Check Point from what it was several months back (six analysts now rate it “Buy” compared with two a month ago) was the offer for Project Data. “What do you want of us?” asked founder and CEO Gil Shwed and vice chairman Marius Nacht back then. “We’re looking for a company to buy, we believe in the stock and we’re buying it on the market. Our situation is great. So why all the fuss? You can be sure that we will eventually find a suitable company.” I wrote on several occasions back then that if what you see is what you get, then Check Point is the most fairly priced stock around. This prompted a number of readers to email me telling me that I was out of touch. “Check Point is passé,” they insisted, “and so are you.” I attacked Shwed for not distributing a dividend, and for hanging on to cash that wasn’t his, and I eventually began to believe that perhaps Check Point was indeed incapable of making an acquisition. Note that since it became public, the offer has added more than $1.1 billion to Check Point’s value without anything actually happening. This is where Wall Street differs from Main Street. Nobody noticed Check Point’s fall on Main Street, and the company continued business as usual. Over on Wall Street, however, between March 2006 and today, $1.1 billion was taken from the company's value and then returned again without any real reason. Surely the analysts didn’t think that Check Point was impervious to the concerns of its investors? I found the answer to this anomaly in a mid-quarter update for Check Point, also from CIBC. In it, Shaul Eyal and Manish Hemrajani wrote of Check Point that it was “not a one-trick pony but a thoroughbred.” This sentence encapsulates the difference between sustained success and a one-off achievement. I won’t go into details here, but Check Point is an important example that should be used when looking at other stocks as well.

42310,20283,2007-07-25T12:55:29-04:00,,"Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP), which makes information technology security hardware and software, has finally provided investors with some good news. After having the stock basically go nowhere over the last 2.5 years, Tuesday’s earnings report was an welcome change from the past few quarters of slow growth. For the quarter that ended June 30, Check Point reported a net income of $69.5 million, or $0.31 cents per share, compared with $65.7 million, or $0.27 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. Check Point’s revenue for the quarter totaled $176.2 million, compared with $138.9 million in the same quarter, last year. It experienced solid double-digit growth in both network and data security units, as well as doubling services revenue to $32.9 million. This has clearly become a strong growth driver for the company, and I would look for continued growth in this unit. It also announced that it had bought back 2.1 million shares, and raised estimates for the rest of the year. The company is still sitting on lots of cash, and the question remains regarding what it plans to do with it. Is it going to make a purchase, keep buying back stock, pay a dividend, or is it going to be bought? It has been mentioned as a takeover target but my answer to all these questions is that it is going to keep trying to grow the business, probably through acquisition. Gil Schwed believes that he can find the right acquisition, and the return on it will be more than the 1.5% dividend for investors. He’s probably correct. Much of this quarter’s strong growth is a result of previous acquisitions finally coming home to roost. Stockerblog likes Checkpoint as a way to secure your portfolio, and I think he is right on. It appears that the company is back on track producing strong growth, and that should put a smile on investors' faces. Disclosure: The author’s fund is long CHKP as of July 25, 2007.

21006,20307,2006-11-21T04:41:40-05:00,,"Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP) on Monday announced an agreement to buy the Swedish-based enterprise data security company Protect Data, parent of Pointsec Mobile Technologies, for $586 million. So was it a good deal?
Rob Owens, an analyst with Pacific Crest, thinks it is a good fit, but not exactly a bargain. “The price is likely to be viewed as expensive at 5.9x our 2007 revenue estimate,” wrote in a research note today. “In our view, PDs Pointsec encryption solution is highly complementary to Check Point’s endpoint Integrity and SSL/VPN solutions and should provide solid growth upon deal closure.” He expects Protect Data to contributed $100 million in revenue to Check Point in 2007. He notes that the acquisition is also the largest in Check Point’s history; the challenge with be for the company to manage the integration issues.
Robert Breza, of RBC Capital, likewise thinks the deal is not coming cheap. “The acquisition is interesting as we believe Pointsec will see increased competition from Microsoft which is including a hard drive locking technology, known as BitLocker, within Vista Enterprise and Ultimate for consumers,” he observed in a research note. “At first glance we believe CHKP paid a premium for this technology which will likely be dilutive to 2007 earnings (assuming Protect Data’s ~30% OM).”
And FBR’s Daniel Ives also found the price on the high side. “While we applaud the move towards embracing encryption on the endpoint, we believe integration hurdles (on the sales and product fronts) elevate the risk profile on CHKP in the near term,” he wrote in a research note. “Representing roughly 8x 2006 revenues, we also believe the valuation was on the very high end of recent security software acquisitions, a purchase price that may not be well digested by some investors. In sum, CHKP has a lot of cash and must pay up for acquisitions, as the company has no ’silver bullet of growth’ from an organic perspective, in our opinion. We maintain our Market Perform rating and $19 price target.”"

19406,20211,2006-10-27T05:27:54-04:00,,"Check Point (Nasdaq: CHKP) has published its third quarter report and to judge by the analysts’ responses, it managed to beat the consensus estimates. “Not substantially,” said Merrill Lynch analyst Edward Maguire, “but everything depends on future developments.” Over at CIBC World Markets, they said they were pleasantly surprised with the developments, especially considering this is the third quarter which is traditionally weak. Such a surprise does not mark a significant turning point in the company’s life, they said, but rather, a business development caused by the strength of sales in the East, and strong sales of its new UTM product.
CIBC retained its “Hold” rating for Check Point, since like all the other security companies, it has not demonstrated strong growth, despite being the leader in its field. The CIBC review is, actually, fairly similar to that of Merrill Lynch, and in their closing remarks the analysts said that they believe that in times of weakness, the stock is suitable for value investors, in view of its cash assets and relatively low profit multiples.
CIBC expect Check Point to post earnings per share of $1.34 in 2006 and $1.48 in 2007. The current consensus estimate is $1.34-1.44. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Sarah Friar, said that while the company has beaten the estimates, she remained cautious as to the future. Cowen & Company LLC director and senior analyst Walter Pritchard retained his “Hold” rating for Check Point, claiming that despite the improvement, he does not see anything to make him change his mind. While he agreed that the stock is cheap, the company is currently experiencing an extremely stiff period in terms of business cycle, therefore it is correctly priced.
The analysts are apparently beginning to tire of Check Point; they don’t feel there’s enough action there. I noticed that only 26 analysts have been covering it this month compared with 36-38 in the good old days, which tells you something about some of them. One thing that all the analysts whose reviews I saw agree on is that Check Point’s third quarter showed an improvement in its business. So why all the disappointment? After all, most analysts were claiming that Check Point was on a downward slide and that it had shown an improvement in the latest quarter. So what are they disappointed about? That there’s been an improvement?
As mentioned earlier, CIBC advised value investors to seize the moment of weakness and enter the stock. So should value investors enter when the stock is cheap because it won’t do anything, or should they enter when it’s cheap because it might generate more profit in the future? Otherwise, why should a value investor bother entering at all? Because of the cash assets and multiples? The stock has had the same level of cash and multiples for two years. So why enter now? The simple question that everyone of us investors must ask is, what will the future security market look like? - will it look good, will it strengthen, or will it provide buying opportunities? If I think that the market will weaken, then it won’t provide buying opportunities. It's that simple.
I read the reports and everyone, from Gartner to the Yankee Group, believe that the information security market will continue to be strong. So to sum up about Check Point, I would put it like this: if you take the fact that the information security will continue to be a key issue in the foreseeable future, which is a quite reasonable assertion to make considering that we will continue to contend with hackers and Internet wars of all kinds, and add to that the vigor that the company has demonstrated when purchasing its shares on the free market (all the analysts are pleased that the company is doing this at long last), plus the fact that the analysts’ claim that the stock is cheap and that an improvement in Check Point’s business situation is round the corner (even if it’s small), then I find it difficult to fathom out why the analysts are so concerned.
I still hold the view that price-wise, Check Point is still the best stock in town. Could the analysts possibly be suffering from some sort of syndrome when it comes to Check Point? After all, they all pilloried the company, and it now looks like that it is emerging from the crisis that they created, and that it is not willing to be bought or sold as they wanted. Does than not say something about the analysts’ behavior?

20001,20211,2006-11-08T03:19:19-05:00,,"One thing is clear to every first-year economics student, and that is that Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ:CHKP) is in a fantastic situation. But it’s also clear that something is holding the company back. I’ve had a long argument with some analysts about Check Point, whether the long slide in its share and stagnation, despite improved quarterly results, correctly reflect dismal conditions at the company, or whether it has created a buy opportunity. I’ll take this opportunity to talk about company managers, boards of directors and the relationships with shareholders and investors. James Cramer, no great fan of Check Point, says, “I’ve been following the competing security company McAfee (MFE) for a long time, and the results are in. McAfee beat a 52-week peak.” There is no doubt that people owning McAfee shares have benefited much more than people owning Check Point shares. I ask, if everything that Check Point publishes is favorable, why does the share behave as it does? Do investors see something I don’t? I have no idea, but early this week, Globes published a letter by IT-Harvest analyst Richard Stiennon to Check Point founder and CEO Gil Shwed. The letter originally appeared in Network World, the leading U.S. trade journal on networking and information security. Stiennon wrote, “Dear Gil, This letter is meant to be a wake up call. While it points to many missed opportunities and wrong turns that I believe Check Point Software has made I hope you will understand that it is a call to action rather than a criticism of past blunders. ”I have been perplexed by Check Point’s actions, or rather lack of actions, for the last seven years. Do you not see that there are opportunities in network security that surpass the existing size of the market? Do you not understand that your current customers are less well protected from outside threats than they were when they first became your customers? Do you not see the warning signs when you lose your major accounts to competitors? Do you not watch the network security start up activity in Silicon Valley? Have you not noticed that Cisco is pulling off a marketing coup with its mis-begotten Network Admission Control scheme?” This letter brings me to the subject of management-shareholder relations. Shwed is unquestionably one of Israel’s best entrepreneurs and managers. He took a technology idea, applied it, and then became the leader in the emerging sector on Main Street. Few people can do this, and he did it in a way that can hardly be compared. He is definitely a member of the same cadre as Comverse Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:CMVT) founder Kobi Alexander, the Zisapel brothers, and Retalix Ltd. (NASDAQ:RTLX) president and CEO Barry Shaked, men who turned ideas into successful products on Main Street. But what about Wall Street? Wall Street and Main Street live in an odd love-hate/jealousy-comity symbiosis. The moment a company joins Wall Street in order to realize its plans, other people’s money and shareholders take over from the entrepreneur. The only way to avoid this is not to take money and not go public. There are many successful examples of this - Iscar Ltd., for one. The board of directors represents the shareholders, and both managers and shareholders forget this. The fact that Check Point’s share has been a disappointment should not drive long-term investors to switch to McAfee or something like it. Long-term investors, who are the big money and the foundation of value for a company, are prepared to wait a long time, and even invest more if they still believe in a company’s future. Steinnon’s open letter to Shwed unquestionably expresses investors’ mood. They’re basically telling Shwed that something isn't working properly and that they’re losing confidence in him. This confidence has been like a rock for years, but something has happened and the company is losing its primacy. This is what investors are saying, and they’re voting with shares. There was complete confidence in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE:TEVA) until recently, despite the fall in its share price. If I were to ask ten investors if they plan to sell Teva, they’d reply, “Of course not.” The departure of Teva president and CEO Israel Makov slightly undermined this confidence, but I think this will be fleeting, until analysts and investors decide on the character of his replacement, Shlomo Yanai.

17552,20210,2006-09-27T00:38:09-04:00,,"Recently, I have sensed some interesting activity in Check Point's (Nasdaq: CHKP) stock, as seen in the increase in trading volumes, exceptionally brisk trading in Call Options, and in the stock price, which has climbed 17% since the end of July. Last week it crossed the $20 level - the first time it has done so since May. It doesn’t look to me like Check Point is about to be sold in the near future, as analysts and the financial press have been claiming, otherwise the management would not have bothered several days ago to offer employees the substitute four-year incentive program. The plan is designed to replace only those options allocated since January 2004, some of which have a strike price that is much higher than the stock’s current price. Although it has remained untainted by the recent wave of options scandals, Check Point has apparently decided to abandon the options incentive scheme, which as is known, has corrupted a good many companies on Wall Street. It is now offering employees and managers who are not board members the opportunity to exchange the current value of the options they own for shares that will be allocated to them free of charge over a four-year period. The quantity of shares to be allocated will be calculated according to the value of $19.20 per share, the price on the day the decision was approved. 27 million options have been allocated to Check Point managers and employees since January 2004, of which 20 million were distributed among senior management: CEO and chairman Gil Shwed received 10.75 million options, while vice chairman and senior VP Marius Nacht received 4.35 million and vice chairman Jerry Ungerman received 2.65 million. CFO and executive VP Eyal Desheh also received options, but the new program is not meant for board members, thus Desheh, as the only senior manager who is not a board member, may convert his options under the terms of the new plan. Incidentally, the two million options allocated to Shwed on July 31, 2006 already bear a profit on paper of $6 million. The million dollar question that investors will now be asking is whether now is the time to return to Check Point’s stock, which has produced nothing but disappointment in recent years, after the company's growth ground to a halt. I tend to believe that the new options plan has been put into effect now, at a price of $19.20, because the management believes that this is the bottom price, and that it apparently has a plan to generate renewed growth in 2007, at the center of which will be a number of aggressive acquisitions. Having said this, we will not know until next week whether Check Point’s third quarter has gone smoothly. The fog surrounding this quarter is pretty dense at present, since this is the first time that I can recall since Check Point went public, that its managers were absent from all the investor conferences held during September.

13199,20211,2006-07-07T10:10:16-04:00,,"Check Point Software's (NASDAQ:CHKP) main problem is that it is plummeting, despite (1) presenting the best economic value in its history for investors, (2) on the basis of what’s known, being one the most economically worthwhile investments on the market, and (3) the fact that most investors are aware of all this.  I place the blame solely on the company management, which does not know how to sell itself to investors, and what’s worse, is unable to explain its vision to the analysts. Cisco Corporation (Nasdaq: CSCO), Juniper Networks (Nasdaq: JNPR) and EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC) are three mega Internet infrastructure companies that acquired security companies more or less like Check Point. Each of them carried out the acquisition at market values that were much higher than what Check Point currently offers investors. Does the fact that the stock has been going down the way it has, and is traded at a consensus multiple of 12 for 2006 and 11 for 2007, mean that the takeover factor has not been taken into account here? Do you know what the multiples are of the other companies in this field that were recently acquired? At the current price, if the management is not playing us for fools, there is money for the taking here, and the most amusing aspect is that Check Point has even lost the opportunity to acquire a company. Americans think differently from Israelis. They want more shares, and less cash. Can Check Point give out shares that are traded at multiples like these? Anyone who believes that Check Point is falling because of a slowdown in the security software market doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Check Point’s problem vis-à-vis shareholders is beginning to take the form of two arrowheads. One of these is that Check Point’s management is losing the confidence of investors (and, leading on from that, also the confidence of analysts). The other is the emerging structure on Main Street, in which security has become part of a total infrastructure package.

16771,20211,2006-09-13T03:19:31-04:00,,"Oscar Gruss technology analyst Ehud Eisenstein recently met Check Point (Nasdaq: CHKP) founder, chairman and CEO Gil Shwed. As a result of that meeting, Eisenstein retained his “Hold” rating for Check Point with a target price of $20, just 5.5% over its share price at the time of the publication of the rating.
I think that the meeting with Shwed is important mainly because of the fact that the stock has been in the doldrums, for reasons unclear to me. One thing is clear, however, and that is that Check Point is not growing like it used to in the past, and even more worrying, especially for the analysts, is the fact that the company has still not managed to acquire a potential growth engine, at a time when the security market is bustling with mergers and acquisitions. It looks like Check Point is not taking part in this mergers and acquisitions game that analysts are so fond of, and perhaps that is why they are wary of it.
Eisenstein reiterated his “Hold” recommendation for Check Point, even though the stock is trading, so he says, at a multiple that is 31% lower than that of the competitors. If he came away from the meeting with Shwed just as troubled as he was before, this is worrying. It is definitely not a good sign if, after talking to a company chairman, you still believe that after trading at a price of $18.95, at a multiple of 14.2 for 2006, and 13.5 for 2007, the stock won’t rise more than 5.5% in the next 12 months. I have no doubt that Eisenstein came to the meeting hoping to hear about exciting developments that have not been heard from Check Point’s direction for some time, yet he still came away disappointed.
My conclusion, from what I have read, is that Eisenstein did not find the spark he was looking for, but that does not necessarily mean that the revival will not eventually happen. It means that Shwed did not talk bombastically, or brag, or spin a dream. That certainly does not mean that he does not have a dream, but rather that he prefers to keep a low profile for the time being.
I’ll start with Shwed’s attitude to mergers and acquisitions, as reflected in Eisenstein’s comments. Shwed is definitely looking to buy something but he doesn’t have a clear goal at present. However, he is opposed to any possibility of Check Point being acquired by another entity since he believes that a company like Check Point should be totally “free”, and not part of a provider who delivers a package to the customer with security included. Leading on from this, he believes that the fact that all the competitors have been swallowed up will work in his favor, since this means that Check Point will remain on its own and will stand out as the expert in its field.
This approach leads me to conclude that either EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC), which recently acquired RSA Security (Nasdaq: RSAS), or IBM (NYSE: IBM), which recently acquired Internet Security Systems (Nasdaq: ISSX), also approached Check Point, but Shwed turned both offers down. Shwed’s comments reveal that although the Sourcefire deal is now history, Check Point is still interested in IP or WiMAX security technologies. In other words, Check Point still believes that a company that supplies all the security services on its own will fare better than one that is acquired by a big infrastructures provider.
This approach will, obviously, come as a disappointment to any analyst looking to hear news that will give cause for excitement in the investment banking industry. However, the truth is that in the deluge of recent acquisitions, the most recent of which was IBM’s acquisition of Internet Security, it would be difficult to give a clear opinion as to which option would be better for the shareholders. Have the shareholders of RSA and Internet Security benefited at all by the acquisition of their companies by EMC and IBM? The facts do not indicate that this is the case, yet it is still difficult to say.
Where does Check Point’s weakness lie? According to Shwed, the problem lies in sales volume. The fact that the company has hired a global sales manager and is training 30 sales representatives, says, in effect, that Shwed believes that strengthening the company’s sales operations is the preferred course of action at present. Eisenstein feels that Check Point’s Achilles' heel is South East Asia - China, India, and especially Japan. Sales in this region were fairly stagnant in 2005, compared with those in 2004. Check Point is working to increase its sales in China, India, and Japan, and has dispatched a senior sales manager to the region to oversee the effort.
Eisenstein says that Internet security, VPN products and support services is a highly competitive field, and is apparently undergoing a process of consolidation. “A number of Check Point’s current and potential competitors can adapt themselves much quicker to the changes in the market and industry,” Eisenstein writes. “Check Point is likely to experience a fall in its profit margins, a fall that will be caused by a price war and fierce competition. Check Point faces several other risks, such as the reliance on a limited number of distributors (Nokia for example, S.G.), and the successful launch of new products.” So to sum up, Check Point’s problem, as expressed by Eisenstein, is primarily a lack of growth, although together with this lingers a fear that the company won’t even manage to mark time.
This opinion is worth comparing with that of “Forbes” writer Andrew T. Gillies who wrote a long article on Check Point on September 6, in which he interviewed the company’s deputy chairman Jerry Ungerman. In his article, Gillies quotes Friedman Billings Ramsey equity analyst Daniel Ives, who describes Check Point as a “cash generating machine. Their growth has been the issue.” In other words, Eisenstein has voiced the opinion of most analysts.
Ungerman attempted to explain to Gillies that growth was a temporary problem. The failed attempt to acquire US intrusion detection software company Sourcefire was a process that taught Check Point a great deal about the possibilities for acquiring companies in the US. Gillies said that Ungerman hinted that the experience with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States hadn't deterred Check Point from dealmaking in the US, and that his company and Sourcefire remains in contact about deal possibilities. “The timing was unfortunate,” he claimed, adding that the factor that slowed things down was the Congressional tantrum and the Bush administration's embarrassment over the proposed takeover of certain US port operations by Dubai's Dubai Ports World.
Ungerman is quite confident about Check Point’s success, and from his article it would appear Gillies also sees things positively. “In recent months, the company has faced its share of proverbial rockets from Wall Street and Washington alike,” he claims, and that, I feel, is exactly where the problem lies.
I believe that Check Point has simply found itself in a long period - longer than anyone ever imagined - of increasing competition in the market, with mergers and acquisitions the order of the day. From the standpoint of quality, no technological company in this field even comes near Check Point, so we can view its current situation as a temporary period that has lasted too long. The conclusions of Eisenstein and other like-minded analysts (the overwhelming majority in this case) are quite definitely reasonable and acceptable but having said this, the following scenario is also not improbable. Having finally broken down the barriers in the East something that has a chance of happening (at least in the same measure as the chance that it might not happen) Check Point acquires Sourcefire or a similar company, which could happen too, by which time someone may manage to persuade Shwed to be receptive to the idea of a merger. What would happen then?
What I find encouraging at present is the large number of analysts that have changed their ratings from “Buy” to “Sell” and “Hold.” Three months ago, 19 analysts rated the stock “Buy”, 11 rated it “Hold”, and two rated it “Sell.” Today only eight analysts recommend buying Check Point shares, 23 recommend holding it and three recommended selling the stock. The last time that the analysts despaired of Check Point, a year ago, the stock responded by rising more than 25%. I think that the figures speak for themselves, and the stock is therefore cheap. But please consult experts.

8497,20140,2006-04-03T07:20:24-04:00,,"Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP), the Israeli enterprise and personal firewall software company, was downgraded by JPMorgan, HSBC and Cowen last week as its purchase of U.S. network securities provider, Sourcefire, fell apart. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. had decided to take a harder look at the deal.
Investors ran for cover and the stock dropped. But was the deal really that important? Sourcefire is used on some government computer systems, and granted, it has a good business. The deal was set for $225 million and some estimates had put Sourcefire revenue at $25 million. Check Point said that it would pursue a relationship with Sourcefire via partnerships instead of M&A.
All this sound and fury obscures what a good business Check Point has, merger or no merger. The company's revenue has risen from $433 million in 2003 to $515 million in 2004 to $579 million in 2005. Operating income in 2005 rose 29% to $332 million. Most companies would die for operating income margins like that. The company also has an excellent balance sheet.
Every indication is that Check Point is staying ahead of the curve with new product introductions. The information and security press still give the company's software and solutions high grades.
Sourcefire's intelligent network defense systems, revenue base, and customers would have been assets to Check Point. But, firms like McKinsey & Co. and KPMG bad-mouth mergers as a route to growth on a fairly regular basis. One McKinsey report noted that of 160 acquisitions by public companies, it could only find 12% that had ""dramatic revenue acceleration over the next three years"".
At $20, Check Point is trading about 20% below where it was last October. Funny, their numbers look better now, and they don't have the execution risk of a deal that looked good on paper, by may or may not have worked.

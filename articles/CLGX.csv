4344284,105417,2020-05-07T15:20:57-04:00,"There were strong 1Q results, driven both by mortgage and data businesses.
        Capital return remains safe, both for buybacks and the recently adopted dividend .
        EBITDA growth is on track, albeit below 30% target.","Since we published our last update on CoreLogic (CLGX) on April 6, the stock rallied ~27%, in contrast to S&P's 7% increase. While we recognize that stay-at-home policies of March-April (and possibly the rest of the second quarter) are likely to inhibit new home purchases, we also remember that the stock market is forward-looking, and the low interest rate environment at this point is the major tailwind for the industry. Below, we provide an update based on recently released 1Q20 earnings.Revenue growth above the usual run rate: With the company delivering 6% Y/Y top-line growth during the quarter, this was approximately 100-150 bps above the average CLGX achieves during its ""slower"" quarters. Core mortgage, insurance, and spatial drove the upside. This was a solid and balanced quarter, in our opinion, when both data and originations businesses were solid contributors to the company's revenues.Mortgage activity fairly safe: We believe that during 1Q new purchases and origination activity did not yet feel the full effects of coronavirus, since only the last two-three weeks of the quarter incorporated the full impact. However, even more importantly, we don't believe that the benefits of three rate cuts of 2019 (a total of 75 bps), and emergency rate cuts from March 2020, are in the consumer behavior just yet. The $275 MM run rate from the origination-heavy UWS business, therefore, could easily transition into a $350-$400 quarterly run rate toward the second half of the year (mostly 3Q, since 4Q is a slow quarter, from the seasonal standpoint). We don't anticipate a major slowdown, since refinances can be easily done remotely (in fact, many homeowners prefer it that way), while new home property viewings can be delayed for a few weeks until stay-at-home policies are lifted around the country. EBITDA margin expansion on track, albeit below 30% target: We are a bit ambivalent about EBITDA margin, however. While margin expanded by ~600 bps from 23% in 1Q19 to ~29% in 1Q20, it still came in below the 30% target. We recognize that this is a long term goal and we are mindful of the fact that 2020 is not the year to meet this target. At the same time, as we have stated before, the question is not about reaching 30% EBITDA margin during one particular quarter but, rather, about making it sustainable from one quarter to the next.Free cash flow conversion sees bright start, but we expect it to go down: At ~60%, EBITDA to FCF conversion is having the best year in three years so far, beating 2018 and 2019 by about 400-500 bps (on an annualized basis, of course). However, we believe that 2Q can skew things downward: we are actually predicting about 40%-42% during the quarter. Even if volumes come back in the second half of the year, it would take a 65%-70% conversion to get the average back to 60%, which is not realistic. This is not a variable that is a deal breaker for investors, but one that needs to be monitored nonetheless.Buybacks remain intact: Recall that the company has been one of the most generous purchasers of its own stock over the years. Capital return exceeded $1 billion every year since 2017. We expect as much as 1%-2% in share repurchases for 2020 as a whole, though possibly more, and we don't expect any scaling back due to political pressures. Dividend is safe though timing is hardly favorable: The company has contemplated a dividend for a long time and finally chose to institute it in December 2019. This is hardly the time to add extra burden to capital return, yet our advice for the company is to navigate in baby steps, starting small in 2020 and upping the dividend gradually.Overall, strategic plan is on track: We see CLGX remaining committed to the following: 1) establishing strong client partnerships through unique data solutions; 2) driving operating leverage in core mortgage operations; 3) deriving 50%+ of total revenues from non-U.S. solutions sensitive to mortgages; 4) delivering 30%+ (adjusted) EBITDA margins; 5) making sure capital return remains robust in the form of share repurchases.Commentary on Mortgage Bankers Association data: We reiterate that while MBA data are ordinarily reliable, these numbers, alas, are not as helpful at present, since they have been all over the place in recent weeks. We have temporarily stopped relying on these data points, but hope to resume using them once markets stabilize.The good news is that CLGX has reached our price target and we are comfortable taking it higher. We apply the P/E multiple of 17.5x to our 2020 EPS estimate of $2.80, which results in the target price of $49 (up from $43).We see the following risks as potentially creating a negative impact on the company's top and bottom line:Competitive risks: While CoreLogic has significant market share positions across its business segments, there are several other key players in the industry that have the potential of capturing some of CoreLogic's clients.Operational risks: Potential systems interruptions may hinder timely delivery of CoreLogic's services and, potentially, result in client and revenue losses.Regulatory risks: CoreLogic faces regulatory scrutiny from federal, state, and foreign agencies. For example, CFPB has authority to affect credit reporting agencies, in addition to examining the role of services providers to large financial institutions.Indebtedness risk: CoreLogic's level of indebtedness may potentially affect the company's ability to comply with existing covenants and obligations."
4336164,105417,2020-04-06T09:31:07-04:00,"We are taking down our target price from $56 to $43 and believe that solid data and mortgage businesses should support the BUY thesis.
        We are modeling EBITDA margin at 29.9% for 2020, approximately 30 bps contraction than before coronavirus.
        Buybacks remain safe in the foreseeable future.","The very last Article we published in 2019 (on December 31st) was on CoreLogic (CLGX), a provider of property information and analytics in the United States and Australia, with data and mortgage origination technology representing the company's core businesses. The company is a leading residential property information provider, as it aggregates proprietary information on the vast majority of residential properties, providing vital data to lenders, insurers, and banks.It was only fitting to end the year with CoreLogic, since the year 2019 was marked by three interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve (a total of 75 bps), which foreshadowed a lot of new purchase and origination activity ahead of 2020. However, with the Federal Reserve taking bold rate-cutting action in March 2020, our thesis completely changed. The Federal Reserve, in two separate off-meeting steps, took the rates down another 150 bps, effectively to zero, which was to have twice the impact of the rate-cutting activity in 2019.We believe that CoreLogic's solid Data & Analytics growth and improvements in the mortgage originations, complemented by tailwinds from the recent acquisitions, support the multiple at the upper end of the spectrum for financial outsourcing companies. We, therefore, apply a EV/sales multiple of ~4.75x (down from 6.15x) on a revenue base of approximately $1.8 billion, which results in the target price of $43 (down from $56).We see the following catalysts driving CoreLogic's story, particularly as we anticipate the company to report 1Q earnings and update 2020 guidance:Mortgage volumes remain strong... for now: In terms of seasonality, first and especially fourth (holiday) quarters are inferior in volumes to the second and third quarter activity in new purchases and originations. Therefore, ordinarily we would not expect the volumes to be particularly strong during the first quarter. However, this was not an ordinary January-March period. January and February, in our opinion, fully benefited from the three rate cuts of 2019 (a total of 75 bps), particularly on the originations side. Then March came along, with the Federal Reserve taking the funds rate essentially to zero, thus prompting customers to accelerate the volume activity. Furthermore, we believe that when by early-mid March it became clear that as a result of coronavirus mobility may be hampered, some savvy prospective or current homeowners have accelerated new purchases or refinancing even further. That's why we see the company delivering a top-line of at least $70-90 MM in 1Q.PIRM revenues to stay modest: During the first quarter, we believe PIRM generated approximately $198 MM in revenue, driven mainly by the insurance solutions. Any FX impact should be flat. Australia remains a solid market for PIRM, with low double digit revenue growth rate, which (we cautiously estimate) should not meaningfully change in the 2020 post-coronavirus world.Modeling EBITDA margin at 29.9% for 2020: CoreLogic has increasingly become a bottom line story in recent quarters, with the 30% EBITDA margin target now accomplished. Coronavirus should only marginally reduce the bottom line for the company in 2020, resulting in about 12 cents impact, or about 30 bps in adjusted EBITDA margin (our previous estimate was 30.2%). While the second and third quarters will prove to be the toughest for the US economy, we should see some offsetting volumes due to historically low interest rates, not seen since 2008-2009. We also note that much of the second quarter activity will be based on the properties seen during the first quarter; hence, the true (and likely temporary) negative impact shall be evident mainly during the third quarter. Update on Mortgage Bankers Association data: Ordinarily a reliable metric to use for predicting origination volumes, these numbers, alas, are no longer useful, since they have arguably been all over the place in recent weeks. We have temporarily suspended using mortgage applications data for our model, but hope to resume using them once markets stabilize. Buybacks remain safe: We doubt that the company will be under pressure to withdraw buybacks since we don’t anticipate CLGX seeking bailout help. We expect as much as 1%-2% in share repurchases for 2020 as a whole. Buybacks are arguable one of the main support points for CLGX shares.Expect an update on the strategic plan: Despite being relatively unharmed by the coronavirus, we believe that CoreLogic may shift the dates around its strategic plan. Recall that core deliverables are: 1) establishing strong client partnerships through unique data solutions; 2) driving operating leverage in core mortgage operations; 3) deriving 50%+ of total revenues from non-U.S. mortgage-driven sensitive solutions; 4) delivering 30%+ (adjusted) EBITDA margins; 5) making sure capital return remains robust in the form of share repurchases. We note that some deliverables are well under way and some may be coming at a later date, but we strongly doubt that the company will hold itself accountable to specific dates as long as coronavirus pressures unfold. It does not have to and investors do not have such expectations. We see the following risks as potentially creating a negative impact on the company's top and bottom line:"

We wanted, however, to reaffirm our Buy thesis for CoreLogic and indicate that these weekly fluctuations should not detract us from the larger CLGX story.CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX) is a provider of property information and analytics in the United States and Australia, with data and mortgage origination technology representing the company's core businesses.

We, therefore, apply a EV/sales multiple of ~6.15x on a revenue base of approximately $1.8 billion, which results in the target price of $56.We see the following catalysts driving CoreLogic's story for the fourth quarter earnings:Origination volumes to drive UWS business: The fourth quarter is the only quarter of 2019, which mostly operated under 3 rate cuts (since mid-October). As a result, we expect volumes for new purchases and originations to be strong during the quarter, with our estimate at $262 MM. We see an approximately $20 MM decline from 3Q due to seasonality (customers buy fewer homes during the holiday quarter). We are closely monitoring the Mortgage Bankers Association weekly data for refis and new purchases: while data fluctuate from one week to another, the overall trend has been on the upside.Modeling EBITDA margin at 30.2%: CoreLogic has increasingly become a bottom line story, with the 30% EBITDA margin target now accomplished. We believe that the proper balance of cost efficiencies and SG&A allows the company to maintain the 30% target longer term, albeit we recognize that 50-100 bps deviations are possible from quarter to quarter. For 4Q, we are actually expecting a 20-30 bps expansion on a Q/Q basis due to stronger revenue from UWS.PIRM revenues to stay modest: We estimate approximately $185 MM in revenue during the quarter (nearly flat on a Q/Q basis), as real estate and insurance solutions remain tepid. Furthermore, we are projecting some Fx headwinds, which may translate into as much as $8-10 MM. We believe Australia should trend well, but then again - not enough to generate meaningful traction in PIRM as a whole.Share buybacks to continue: We are modeling approximately 300K shares in repurchases during 4Q, albeit we recognize the number may be as high as 700K, matching the amount from the third quarter. Overall, we see the company delivering about 1-2% of capital return on an annual basis.Overall, we see key deliverables of the strategic plan on track: Among them are: 1) establishing strong client partnerships through unique data solutions; 2) driving operating leverage in core mortgage operations; 3) deriving 50%+ of total revenues from non-U.S. mortgage-driven sensitive solutions; 4) delivering 30%+ (adjusted) EBITDA margins; 5) making sure capital return remains robust in the form of share repurchases.We see the following risks as potentially creating a negative impact on the company's top and bottom line:"

We therefore apply a EV/sales multiple of ~6.1x on a revenue base of approximately $1.8 billion, which results in the target price of $56.We see the following four catalysts driving the CoreLogic Story:Data business to benefit from strong demand and pricing tailwinds: We expect the data business to achieve mid-high single digit organic growth in the short-medium run, as the business benefits from strong demand across its segments, in addition to seeing pockets of pricing increases. Given CoreLogic’s strong market position across many competencies, the company is well positioned to implement gradual pricing hikes, in our view. Further, we believe that the subscriptions to the company’s comprehensive data sets are largely sticky, allowing CoreLogic to benefit from a significant base of recurring revenue.Pickup in Mortgage Origination Activity to Boost TPS Business: With the Federal Reserve pursuing a rate-lowering course, we see at least 4-5% pickup in refi and origination activity throughout 2019. We are closely monitoring the Mortgage Bankers Association data, which has already been on the rebound in the recent weeks. We note that CoreLogic’s revenue is agnostic between refis or new purchases; we expect the refi activity to be strong in the ratio of ~60-40%.Strong Free Cash Flow Generation and Buyback Activity: The company generates at least 50% of free cash flow as percentage of the EBITDA, which makes capital return an important component of its growth story. CoreLogic remains committed to a solid buyback strategy, returning more than half of FCF back to shareholders. For the last three years, CoreLogic pursued a generous buyback policy, with about 20 MM shares repurchased. For 2019, we expect at least 3 MM shares bought back, though it is possible that the company eventually repurchases closer to 4 MM. We see the solid buyback strategy as helpful to CoreLogic’s bottom line management, particularly given ongoing pressures from the soft origination activity.Strategic Acquisitions Support Core Businesses: Historically, CoreLogic has acquired companies that provided a meaningful boost to its data businesses, such as MSB, DataQuick, CDS Mapping, and RP Data. At the same time, CLGX remained committed to growing its organic revenue, with mid-single digit growth a usual target. In our view, at some point in 2020-21, there may be a transformational acquisition on the horizon, at least $500 MM in size, which should add at least $2-3 to our target price. The acquisition should most certainly come from the data business, since there are virtually no solid targets in the mortgage origination segment.We see the following risks as potentially creating a negative impact to the company’s top and bottom line:"

See Chart 1 below and you'll see what I'm talking about.So let's take a walk down memory lane and review the history behind the technology most real estate agents use today. You should see afterwards some very clear patterns that explain how we got to where we are today.1907-1970s: The paper MLS eraPractically all North American realtors today are members of at least one multiple listing service (MLS). In the U.S., the concept of real estate agents sharing listings via a centralized source dates back to the 1880s. As part of pooling agreements, it became accepted practice for the listing agent to split the sales commission with the agent who brought in the buyer. This type of information clearing house was first formalized as an MLS in 1907.MLS services were set up in different real estate markets across the country until the end of the 1920s, with most run by local real estate boards. Each week, agents would go to the office of the local real estate board or whichever organization ran the MLS to receive the latest listings in paper form, usually a book.Before these MLS were created, the only way real estate agents could get listing information from properties they didn't personally list (i.e. pocket listings) was:● As an agent for a larger area brokerage where the listing agent worked.● By negotiating directly with other agents to pool leads.MLS were designed to address a major pain point among real estate agents. During the first half of the 20th century, the most popular type of listing contract for homeowners was an ""open listing."" This allowed sellers to sign contracts with multiple brokers and whichever broker closed the sale received the commission. The other brokers got nothing. Sellers liked this arrangement because it helped their property receive as much exposure as possible, increasing the likelihood of a sale and competing buyer offers. Real estate agents hated this arrangement since it often led to agents working without pay.MLS solved this problem by addressing both the needs of property owners and real estate agents. Under MLS rules, property owners have to sign exclusive right-to-sell contracts with listing agents for their properties to appear in the MLS listings book. Exclusive right-to-sell contracts mean that agents get paid if the property is sold during the period covered by their contract, regardless of who sells it. This was crucial for the MLS systems, since it meant competing brokers couldn't use the information provided by the listing broker to steal the sale.Property owners gradually bought into the need for MLS listings as they saw that pooled listings ensured a larger number of buyer-side agents would bring potential buyers to the property. In fact, a Federal Trade Commission report on the U.S. real estate industry in the 1970s found that property listed for sale on MLS sold twice as fast on average as property that wasn't. The added value MLS listings provided was so clear that brokers in some markets actually added 1 percentage point to commissions for clients that wanted a MLS listing.However, despite most MLS being formed around the 1920s, this innovative tool only became standard for most real estate agents over 30 years later, during the post-war period. Even as late as 1950, the majority of real estate listings in the U.S. weren't available via MLS. Peak adoptions rates for paper-based MLS took even longer, somewhere between 40 and 50 years.In 1971, the National Association of Realtors' MLS Policy Committee chairman told the association's members that over the past 25 years ""MLS has in most areas of the country become a way of life for both the homeowner and the broker."" By 1977, 93 percent of real estate brokers in the U.S. were MLS members and 92 percent of broker-listed homes sold in 1978 had an MLS listing, according to the FTC.Although, MLS didn't solve all problems. Several issues that remained for real estate agents included:● Updated MLS listings were distributed no more than once a week, so realtors often had out of date information when talking to clients.● MLS listing books had to be commercially printed and physically distributed to brokers and agents, which took significant time and money both for the real estate boards and the brokers.● Leads still came in largely by word of mouth and traditional (e.g. newspaper) advertising. Most agents still had to be active, long-time members in their local communities to be effective in drumming up business.It's no surprise then that large regional brokerages or real estate franchises were rare to non-existent during the era of paper listings. The large degree of local knowledge and connections needed to cultivate a steady stream of leads also meant that real estate agents were better off working for a small brokerage than working for a large company based outside the region.1960s-1980s: ComputerizationUntil the late 1960s, nearly all MLS listings were distributed as a book on a weekly basis. The computerization of MLS listings began in 1966 with the founding of a company called Realtron Corporation, although it's quite difficult to pinpoint which MLS was the first to implement their solution. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) itself launched its first computerized system for MLS in 1975.However, most of the more than 800 MLS in the U.S. and their broker members adapted very slowly to computer technology. By 1978, only 27 percent of MLS provided listings to brokers through computer terminals. Most (78 percent) still distributed listings through a listing book published weekly and paper-based MLS listings continued to exist well into the new millenium.Computerized MLS improved the ability of skilled brokers to expand their business by saving a tremendous amount of time that was previously spent getting listings information. Computers increased the upfront capital needed to start and run a brokerage but also greatly increased efficiency. A broker had to invest some money into purchasing a computer terminal and hire or train staff members capable of using it to search through, enter and print out listings information. Computer use ensured real estate agents could keep a large, up to date portfolio of properties ready to show to prospective clients.But computerization didn't just help brokers share listing information, it also helped them grow the quantity of leads they could bring in and track. Computers dramatically improved the targeting and tracking of direct mail campaigns as well as cutting mail production costs. This led to a boom in direct mail campaigns among real estate brokers, as well as other industries.According to a study conducted by the U.S. Postal Service, the volume of direct mail advertising grew 9.8 percent per year between 1980 and 1988 - triple the rate of economic growth! Just like in other industries, direct mail campaigns enabled major brokers to develop a pipeline of leads sufficient to sustain a brand with offices full of agents.It's no accident that many of the well-known realtor chains and franchises today began to expand outside their home markets only after computers were introduced to both sides of the real estate transaction.However, computerization still didn't address several pain points for brokers and agents:● No way to speed up or improve lead qualification.● Lack of a nationwide database for property listings.These pain points were partially addressed by the next major technological change in real estate: The rise of online real estate listings through third party portals and IDX feeds.Online Real Estate ListingsFew statistics are available from the early days of the Internet, but by 2005 - slightly over a decade after the broader U.S. public became aware of the world wide web - half of real estate agents had their own website. Importantly, real estate agents' adoption of the Internet to buy and sell homes trailed that of the general public. In 2003, 71 percent of homebuyers already used the Internet to search for homes.It was the thin years of the Great Recession that really culled the old-school holdouts and made a web presence a necessity for successful real estate agents. By 2013, 72 percent of real estate agents had their own website and 82 percent had a company website. Meanwhile, 92 percent of recent homebuyers in 2013 used the Internet to search for homes.Third Party PortalsIn 1994, the NAR created a subscription-based online listing service called Realtors Information Network (RIN). The original project floundered for a bit before becoming Realtor.com, which started out by featuring listings from the San Diego MLS, Sandicor. A variety of other sites attempted to bring listings online, like Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Home Advisor, which launched in 1998. However, nearly all the real estate sites from the '90s besides Realtor.com failed to gain critical mass or implement a sustainable business model.Aside from Realtor.com, the other major online listing portals today, Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and Trulia, were actually founded in the Web 2.0 era. Trulia launched in 2004, while Zillow got off the ground in 2006. Moreover, the ZTR (Zillow, Trulia and Realtor.com) triumvirate that reigns in the industry today, really only solidified its dominance in the years following the 2008 financial crisis - more than 15 years after the initial innovation reached the market. As of 2013, 70 percent of realtors display their listings on major third party portals, like Zillow and Realtor.com according to NAR's latest Technology Survey.ZTR and the entire concept of a third party portal helped the industry by enabling homebuyers everywhere in the U.S. to visit a single website to find and research homes. This addressed a major need of the Web 2.0 era, when more than 88 percent of homebuyers like to conduct their own online research before visiting homes. Some 43 percent of home buyers search for properties online as the first step in the buying process.The key to the portals' success is that they understood something very important: because the portals bring the buyers, most brokers have to use these sites whether they like them or not. To ensure that they also keep this critical mass of buyers, ZTR all offer to provide listings for free or Zillow even pays MLS to supply their listings directly to the portal.Besides free property listings, the real estate portal also provide value-added services to agents:● Advertising agents' profiles alongside listings.● Supplying leads that showed interest in area listings.These added value services address agents' need to generate a steady volume of leads to keep closing, but does so with poor quality leads. A 2015 survey by Inman found that more than 50 percent of agents buy leads from third-party online listing portals, but 53 percent of these respondents to the survey said the quality of these paid leads was ""poor."" The reasons why a majority of the real estate agents using the portals' lead gen services are dissatisfied with them are easy to find wherever real estate agents vent online or offline.The leads offered by the portals usually only give agents whatever information was generated by the website's lead capture activities, and leads' actual intent to buy is measured simply by someone clicking on a listing and/or filling out a very short lead form. Many of these leads haven't been qualified like any good sales lead. They lack information on:● The prospect's budget, i.e. ability to buy.● Verification that the contact information the prospect provided is actually accurate.● Multiple ways to contact the lead. For example, social media along with email.This means agents end up paying top dollar for a large number of junk and unqualified leads that either cannot be sold or require additional pre-sale work.Portals like Zillow and Trulia also created a new pain point for agents. These sites allow any agent willing to pay enough to have their photo and details placed at the top of every listing in a chosen zip code. This means agents who don't know a property or even the neighborhood well can take potential clients away from agents who are much more likely to serve them well and close the sale. It also leads to situations where agents with other listings in the target zip code hijack potential buyers for a specific listing and re-direct them to listings where their broker office will get a full commission.This has led to a growing trend of established brokers abandoning the third party portals since at least 2012. With the post-recession recovery in many U.S. real estate markets, it has also led to a growing share of pocket listings. A pocket listing is one that is not entered into a MLS or third party portal, which get most of their listings from MLS, but is sold by the broker via word of mouth and other means that are expected to attract interested buyers but aren't accessible to the broader public. In some markets, pocket listings are now approaching 20 percent of the homes sold, a point reiterated in a Wall Street Journal article last year with the headline ""Real Estate Pocket Listings Go Mainstream.""Internet Data Exchange (IDX)Internet Data Exchange is another method of sharing real estate listings online, and one favored by most brokers who invest significantly in technology. On January 1, 2002, all MLS and real estate associations affiliated with NAR were required to enable their members to display aggregated MLS listings data on their public-facing websites. This decision formally made the use of IDX feeds technically feasible for realtors across the entire U.S.IDX feeds help brokers increase their volume of inbound leads and provide interested homebuyers with a much wider stock of homes to choose from.However, it still took years for most real estate agents to incorporate listings from IDX feeds into their own website. In 2001, the adoption rate for IDX among brokers was less than 10 percent according to a NAR survey. By 2013, 56 percent of agents displayed their listings on IDX sites. Not coincidentally, this was nearly identical with the percentage (57 percent) that displayed listings on their own website.However, some pain points unaddressed by IDX feeds include:● Unlike the third party portals, most buyers probably won't automatically think to check a specific broker's website. IDX feeds alone don't guarantee a significant volume of leads.● Brokers need to spend time and money finding ways to pull in web traffic to get the listing information in front of buyers (SEO, PPC advertising, etc.).● Information provided by lead forms may contain incomplete or inaccurate information.● Website leads may come without qualifying information, such as a potential buyer's budget.Again, online listings may provide agents with a larger, steadier volume of leads but they also require agents to spend a significant amount of time pre-sale qualifying and sorting through junk leads.Which brings us to the current technological moment.Big Data: 2006 to PresentSince the web took off in the 1990s, most forms of communication have become electronic and online. Major hardware advances have also reduced the cost of computing power and memory storage and along with the development of cloud computing have enabled the accumulation and processing of massive amounts of data online. Advanced search and data mining techniques developed since the turn of the millennium have turned this data into new, useful Big Data products. One of these Big Data inventions was PIPL - where I work - which developed what soon became the first people-oriented search engine after it was founded in 2006.Online people search took a massive leap forward at the start of this decade when the programming interface (API) economy took off. APIs allow developers to quickly and easily connect different software or databases. This allowed companies to provide up to date contact information on people to businesses in real-time. Soon enough, several companies formed to do just that.PIPL created an API for this purpose as well but used its search engine roots to utilize an algorithm that can search billions of records and identify records belonging to a single, unique person. This means that with PIPL's People Data API, users can automatically send partial information from new leads entered into their CRMs and receive missing details within seconds.For several years now, sales and marketing professionals have been using the handful of APIs on the market that provide information on people to businesses to:● Automatically verify the accuracy of lead information.● Rapidly qualify leads based on job title and age.● Automatically find missing and alternative lead contact information.A number of industries outside of real estate have adapted to this technology in a short time. For example, all major U.S. background report providers already integrate API-based data solutions from information providers to create their reports.Real estate brokers have started to use these Big Data solutions as data providers have begun simplifying the technology further by launching purpose-built apps. Now, real estate agents - as well as all sorts of salespeople and marketers - can simply upload lead lists to websites instead of hiring developers to integrate an API into their database via code.While real estate brokers have just started to adopt Big Data, the third party portals have decided to actively ignore the issues faced by agents related to lead quality. But if real estate history is any guide, that should change by the start of the next decade as tech savvy brokers start outperforming their competitors in the market.Where to invest?For retail investors to profit from this technological change, they must find data-rich companies that are publicly traded and serve the real estate market. In real estate, there are really two groups of data companies that will benefit from the transition to API technology.People data dead-endThe first group are companies that specialize in people data, meaning they provide contact and job information that helps real estate agents and investors qualify home-seller and home-buyer leads. There are a handful of companies that serve this niche. Unfortunately, most of the companies with the highest exposure like PIPL and FullContact are privately held and not open to investment from retail investors.The major exception is Lexis Nexis, a large subsidiary of RELX Group (NYSE:RELX), formerly known as Reed Elsevier. However, Lexis Nexis' services are generally not priced competitively enough for most users in the real estate market, and the company's revenues are heavily oriented toward other markets and non-API users. Moreover, the company is just one subsidiary of the larger RELX Group, meaning RELX stock certainly isn't even close to being a real estate data play.Property data shows promiseThat leaves the second data niche, which is property record data. Close to a half dozen companies gather this data from tax records, property title and court record databases. Here are two publicly-traded companies worth looking at: CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX) and Black Knight Financial Services (NYSE:BKFS).Both companies provide information and analytics to mortgage servicers, real estate companies, real estate lawyers and title insurance providers regarding properties and lead lists based on property owner information. Both companies can transmit and do transmit data via API.CoreLogic: Diamond in the rough?CoreLogic is the larger of the two, with its FY 2105 revenue roughly 65% larger than that of Black Knight, i.e. $1.5 billion vs. $931 million. In 2015, CoreLogic's revenues grew 9 percent year over year as show by Chart 2 above, fueled by 11% growth in its Property Intelligence division. A significant portion of this growth has been fueled by CoreLogic's acquisition strategy. In the second half of 2015 alone, CoreLogic bought 3 companies, LandSafe Appraisal Services, RELS and Australia's Cordell Information - for a total $236.1 million - as it seeks to firmly cement its dominance in this growing market.As you can see in Chart 3 above, CoreLogic's Property Intelligence division (PI), which is responsible for its property valuation and lead data products has grown significantly over the past 5 quarters. While this growth has been acquisition heavy, Core Intelligence still has managed to grow its level of profits during this process. Importantly, this has changed the fundamental nature of CoreLogic's business from providing mortgage processing technology platforms to data. For the year-to-date, the PI division is actually responsible for more than half of the company's revenue for the first time in its history.More detailed analysis of CoreLogic's fundamentals and business plans are certainly warranted, as this company shows promise. It may very well be a winner in the real estate data space.BKFS: Not ready for prime-timeThe largest competitor to CoreLogic when it comes to property data is Black Knight Financial Services. Black Knight in its current form was created by the merger and reorganization of several independent business units. The core of the company was the Technology, Data and Analytics division of mortgage processor Lender Processing Services (NYSE:LPS), Fidelity National Commerce Velocity and Property Insight, two subsidiaries formerly owned by Black Knight's largest shareholder, Fidelity National Financial (NYSE:FNF). Minority shareholder Thomas H. Lee Partners (THL) also owns a significant stake in the company.Black Knight was a publicly traded corporation less than two years, completing an IPO on the NYSE on May 26, 2015. The initial offering stock price was $24.50 per share. Since then, the share price has risen 55% to $38 per share as of Friday, December 16, 2016.BKFS revenues, similar to CoreLogic, grew 9% last year (see Chart 4 above). Also like CoreLogic, its property data division - Data & Analytics- saw its revenue grow 11 percent in 2015 to $174 million.There are two key differences though between BKFS and CoreLogic. For starters, data is still a secondary business line for BKFS, never exceeding 20 percent of total revenue over the past 10 quarters (see Chart 5 below). This means that the company is still primarily dependent on providing technology services to mortgage processors and is not really a data play. Almost as important, the growth in the company's Data & Analytics division has stalled over the past three quarters. This suggests BKFS is starting to experience problems with organic growth in its data business products.Both key differences mean that BKFS currently does not make sense as an investment choice for investors looking to benefit from the shift to data-as-a-service via API technology in real estate. However, investors interested in the space should keep an eye on any announcements from BKFS management regarding potential acquisitions or changes in organic growth strategy with regard to the D&A division. This would signal management realizes the prevailing trends in the real estate market by management and could be a catalyst for significant medium-term growth in revenues and the stock price.Next steps for serious investorsI will leave further analysis of the investment proposition posed by CoreLogic based on both company fundamentals and technical analysis to other writers or possibly a further article of my own.But the macro-trends in the real estate market suggest that long-term passive investors should be looking for companies that are leveraging the shift to API technology and Big Data. Lastly, at a bare minimum, investors interested in the space should conduct further company specific research into CoreLogic. This company may turn out to be an investment gem."

The firm is expected to benefit from the positive outlook for the big data analytics market and further bolt-on acquisitions. A combination of sustainable competitive advantages, cost-savings initiatives and a scalable business model will allow CoreLogic to further expand its profit margins. Due to the nature of the company's business model, customer concentration is unlikely to be a problem. As the company has significant foreign operations, FX headwinds will persist going forward.Bright prospects for the big data analytics market, further bolt-on acquisitions expectedAccording to research, the global big data market is estimated to hit $46b by 2018, growing at a CAGR of 25% throughout the 2013-2018 period. This growth is driven primarily by corporations finding ways to utilize the raw data that they have in order to make business and financial decisions. As CoreLogic provides data analytics solutions to the global real estate market, the company will no doubt benefit from the aforementioned secular tailwinds.In addition, the company has recently made several bolt-on acquisitions to further cement its position as market leader. The company acquired MSB and DataQuick. Both companies complement CoreLogic's existing product offerings and thus not only allow the company to enhance its value proposition to prospective and existing clients, but also opens up cross-selling opportunities between the acquirer and the aforementioned targets. Going forward, I expect the company to continue making such sensible acquisitions which will no doubt be accretive to the top and bottom line. Financing said future acquisitions should not be a problem given that the company's debt levels are managable (most of its debt have maturities longer than five years), and it continues to generate stable cash flow (cash from operations has hovered around $300m in recent years).Combination of sustainable competitive advantages, cost-savings initiatives and scalability will allow further margin expansionDue to the nature of CoreLogic's business model, the company is able to derive sustainable competitive advantages over its peers. The company's solutions are primarily data-driven. In short, the more data the company collects, the more valuable its solutions are to users. Thus, the company benefits from a virtuous cycle - its solutions are created from data supplied by its customers which will no doubt continue to supply CoreLogic with more data as time goes on. Given the above, it is crystal clear that such a business model allows the market leader (which is CoreLogic, at least within the real estate market) to derive a sustainable competitive advantage over its rivals. It would be extremely tough for its rivals to compete with CoreLogic simply because they have less data compared to CoreLogic, and is thus less valuable to potential and existing users. With such an enticing value proposition, CoreLogic is able to derive considerable pricing power, which will lead to further margin expansion.Furthermore, the company has announced further initiatives that are centered on cost savings. Those who are familiar with management will know their healthy obsession with streamlining operations as best they can. Project 30 (one such initiative) resulted in the reduction of $100m in costs throughout 2011-2013. In late 2013, another cost initiative was planned, which surpassed the company's expectations, delivering $30m in savings compared to the estimated $25m. Phase 1 of TTI, which was launched in 2012, is still ongoing and is expected to result in cost-efficiencies totaling $10m within this fiscal year. By examining the company's track record, one can deduce that management is extremely apt at ensuring that the company remains lean. Going into fiscal 2015, I expect the aforementioned ongoing initiatives to be a success, contributing to further expansion in profit margins.In addition, the company's business model is one that's highly scalable. In earlier paragraphs, I emphasized the point that the company's product offerings are data-driven. Due to this, CoreLogic's business is very likely to yield increasing returns to scale. After all, collecting data does not really cost much. As such a business model is one that's capital-light, adding new customers would be certainly not be a tall order. Hence, due to the scalability of the company's business model, I expect its profit margins to continue expanding going forward.Customer concentration is unlikely to be a problemFrequent readers of my work would know that I am of the belief that customer concentration is one aspect of a business that I feel deserves more focus. This is because some companies are highly dependent on a small number of customers, often with no real way to ensuring that customers are retained year after year. Due to their high reliance on so few customers, when a large customer deserts them for a competitor, the company's revenues, profits and cash flows get crushed. Fortunately, due to the nature of the company's business model, I am of the opinion that CoreLogic would have no problem retaining its customers and hence customer concentration would not be a problem. As I alluded to in earlier paragraphs, once CoreLogic acquires a customer, it is highly unlikely that said customer would leave - due to the self-fulfilling cycle of data exchange between the provider and client resulting in a high degree of customer stickiness. Thus, I expect CoreLogic's revenues, profits and cash flows to continue to be stable going forward.FX headwinds are expected to persist, though will be limitedDue to the recent strengthening of the dollar vis-à-vis other major currencies, many U.S. corporations have been adversely affected. The appreciation can be attributed to the diverging monetary policy stance taken by the U.S. Federal Reserve compared to other central banks around the world. Although the recent FOMC meeting has stalled the strengthening of the DCI, the fact remains that the index continues to trade at elevated levels compared to the previous year, according to CNBC data. CoreLogic is no different from the majority of U.S. corporations. The company has a material foreign presence - approximately 11% of the company's fiscal 2014 revenues came from non-U.S. locations. Thus, expect FX fluctuations to be a drag on operating results, though such adverse effects should be limited. After all, almost 90% of the company's revenue came from the U.S.ValuationAs seen in the above DCF model, company revenues are expected to grow at growth rates of 7% to 4% throughout the five-year projection period. This growth is not only supported by secular tailwinds such as the bright prospects of the big data analytics market but also the company's guidance. Management has said that they expect the top-line to come in at $1.47-$1.5b. I opted for a 7% FY15 growth rate which is at the top-end of the company's guidance. Although some readers may think this is too aggressive, I beg to differ. This guidance range assumes that mortgage activity remains at levels comparable to fiscal 2014. I am of the belief that this is extremely unlikely due to favorable macro factors such as low interest rates and improving unemployment. Obviously, FX headwinds will offset this growth, but not by much.EBITDA margins are expected to continue expanding throughout the projection period, increasing to 25% by FY19. This expansion in EBITDA margins is supported by three factors which were discussed in detail in the earlier part of the article - sustainable competitive advantage, cost-savings initiatives and the highly scalable nature of CoreLogic's business model. The company currently trades at 15x LTM EBITDA. Using this figure, along with a 10% discount rate (due to the stability of the company's cash flows stemming from a high degree of customer stickiness) the model produces a fair value of $46 for CoreLogic, indicating that the company is undervalued by approximately 30%. My outlook on the company is hence bullish - investors are advised to initiate a long position at current levels."
4296757,105417,2019-10-16T08:21:31-04:00,"Falling rates are driving both Data and Origination Businesses, which will likely lead to an upward guidance revision for 2019.We see moderate revenue growth acceleration for Data business in 3Q.Despite the company's overall generous capital return activity, we do not see much buyback activity in either 3Q or 4Q.","CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX) is a provider of property information and analytics in the United States and Australia, with data and mortgage origination technology representing the company's core businesses. The company is a leading residential property information provider, as it aggregates proprietary information on the vast majority of residential properties, providing vital data to lenders, insurers, and banks.We believe that CoreLogic's solid D&A growth and improvements in the mortgage originations, complemented by tailwinds from the recent acquisitions, support the multiple at the upper end of the spectrum for financial outsourcing companies. We, therefore, apply a EV/sales multiple of ~6.15x on a revenue base of approximately $1.8 billion, which results in the target price of $56.We see the following catalysts driving CoreLogic's story for the third quarter earnings:Data business revenue growth to accelerate by 20 bps on a Q/Q basis: We estimate data growth at around 2.3% for 3Q, which is approximately a 20 bps acceleration from the previous quarter and about 10 bps above consensus. Recall that most data-related engagements at CoreLogic are sticky, which makes it fairly straightforward to model, assuming there are no major pricing shifts. While international business makes up about 15% of total revenue, its low teens growth is a meaningful boost to the overall segment, helping offset any temporary setbacks, mainly related to the originations business.Positive impact of lower rates should already be felt in 3Q: While the first rate cut was delivered in July, i.e., the very beginning of the third quarter, we have to remember that dovish activity was telegraphed in 1Q, while CME watch predicted a rate cut as early as May. Under this timeline, we expect at least 4-5% pickup in refi and origination activity throughout 2019, with 3-4% coming for the third quarter. We are closely monitoring the Mortgage Bankers Association weekly data for refis and new purchases, noting that while data fluctuate from one week to another, the overall trend has been on the upside. We are already seeing concrete correlation between the rebound in mortgage volumes and the daily interest rate activity.Moderate Guidance Raise: With rates coming down, we expect CLGX to raise its 2019 top-line outlook by $30-50 MM, which will translate into $8-10 MM raise in adjusted EBITDA and 2-3 cents in adjusted EPS raise.No expectations for buybacks: Given the heavy share repurchase activity in recent quarters, our estimates for the buyback activity in 3Q are conservative: we are modeling none. Unless there is specific guidance from the company, the same applies to the fourth quarter as well. By 2020, we expect CLGX to resume its generous capital return, usually approximating 2.5-3%.No impact from FX: We do not expect any FX impact for the quarter, which is a welcome change from some FX fluctuations we have seen last quarter.Revenue breakdown needed by sub-segments: We reiterate that the company would be better served, had it reported its revenue by sub-segments, such as CDS Mapping, RP Data, etc.We see the following risks as potentially creating a negative impact on the company's top and bottom line:"

Emphasis is on company fundamentals and financial data rather than commentary.The Processing Systems & Products industry is a very small, rather miscellaneous collection of companies offering varied technology-based products and services. There are only 6 publicly traded companies categorized into the grouping, the largest two of which, and only billion dollar market caps, are:• CoreLogic, Inc. (NYSE: CLGX), headquartered in Irvine, California, provides property, financial and consumer information, analytics, and services, including tax monitoring, flood zone certification and monitoring, credit services, mortgage loan administration and production services, lending solutions, and mortgage-related business process outsourcing. The company also owns or licenses data assets, such as loan information, criminal and eviction records, employment verification, property characteristic information, and information on mortgage-backed securities, providing analytical products for risk management, collateral assessment, loan quality reviews, and fraud assessment, as well as geospatial proprietary software and databases with geographic mapping and data, in addition to consumer screening and risk management for the multifamily housing and under-banked credit services industries. Its primary clients include mortgage originators, financial institutions, investment banks, fixed-income investors, title insurance companies, commercial banks, government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, property and casualty insurers, credit unions, real estate agents, and other real estate professionals.• Plantronics, Inc. (NYSE: PLT), headquartered in Santa Cruz, California, designs, manufactures, and markets lightweight communications headsets, telephone headset systems, other communication endpoints, and accessories for businesses and consumers, which products include specialty telephones, corded and cordless communication headsets, audio processors, telephone systems, Bluetooth and corded products, personal computer and gaming headsets, speakerphones, amplified captioned phones, amplified corded phones, personal listeners, and alarm clocks for the hearing impaired. The company's primary markets are enterprise and home offices, contact centers, the mobile phone and smartphone segments, and the computer gaming segment.Knowing the rather specialized markets of our two contestants explains their stocks' performance during the almost 6-year long economic recovery. Where CoreLogic is more of a business services provider, Plantronics is more of a consumer discretionary-technology products producer and marketer. Given the huge run in the consumer discretionary sector during the course of the recovery, we can understand that we are not going to get the same capital appreciation from both companies, as graphed below.Since the recovery began in early March of 2009, where the broader market S&P 500 index [black] has gained 209%, the SPDR Technology Sector ETF (NYSE: XLK) [blue] which sector (not fund) both of our contenders belong to has gained 220%, our business services provider CoreLogic [beige] has underperformed both benchmarks, rising only 187%, while our consumer discretionary-focused Plantronics [purple] has not only beaten the broader market and technology sector it belongs to, but has also dramatically beaten even the consumer discretionary sector, rising 570% as compared to the SPDR Consumer Discretionary ETF (NYSE: XLY) [orange] which has risen only 345%.On an annualized basis, where the S&P has averaged 36.35%, the XLK has averaged 38.26%, and the XLY has averaged 60.00%, CoreLogic has averaged the least of them all at 32.52% where Plantronics has averaged the most of them all at 99.13% per year!This gives us a clearer idea of what to expect from the two companies' stocks going forward, with consumer discretionaries continuing to have the advantage as the economic recovery puts more money in consumers' pockets. Consumers are a force to contend with; or better yet, to harness.Source: BigCharts.comLooking at future earnings growth, the Processing Systems & Products industry as a whole looks poised to outperform the broader market's average growth rate quite comfortably, as tabled below where green indicates outperformance while yellow denotes underperformance.Over the current and next quarters, the industry's earnings are expected to outgrow the S&P's growth at some 1.22 to 1.85 times its rate, averaging some 1.62 times throughout 2015, and improving to 2.02 times annually over the next five years.Zooming-in a little closer, the two largest Processing Systems & Products companies are expected to deviate from their norms over the near term, as tabled below.Over the next two quarters, where discretionary-focused Plantronics is set to under-grow the broader market significantly at less than half its rate, CoreLogic is expected to grow its earnings at some 1.75 to 6.23 times the market's average. 2015 looks a little better for Plantronics, though it still only barely outperforms the market at 1.06 times, while CoreLogic continues to grow strong at 3.33 times.But over the longer term, Plantronics is once again expected to outperform both the market and CoreLogic, growing at some 1.63 times the market annually over the next five years compared to CoreLogic's 1.34 times growth rate.Yet there is more than earnings growth to consider when sizing up a company as a potential investment. How do the two compare against one another in other metrics, and which makes the best investment?Let's answer that by comparing their company fundamentals using the following format: a) financial comparisons, b) estimates and analyst recommendations, and c) rankings with accompanying data table. As we compare each metric, the best performing company will be shaded green while the worst performing will be shaded yellow, which will later be tallied for the final ranking.A) Financial Comparisons• Market Capitalization: While company size does not necessarily imply an advantage and is thus not ranked, it is important as a denominator against which other financial data will be compared for ranking.• Growth: Since revenues and expenses can vary greatly from one season to another, growth is measured on a year-over-year quarterly basis, where Q1 of this year is compared to Q1 of the previous year, for example.In the most recently reported quarter, Plantronics generated the greater revenue and earnings growth year-over-year by a large degree, while CoreLogic generated the least.• Profitability: A company's margins are important in determining how much profit the company generates from its sales. Operating margin indicates the percentage earned after operating costs, such as labor, materials, and overhead. Profit margin indicates the profit left over after operating costs plus all other costs, including debt, interest, taxes and depreciation.Of our two contestants, Plantronics operated with the wider profit and operating margins, while CoreLogic contended with the narrower.• Management Effectiveness: Shareholders are keenly interested in management's ability to do more with what has been given to it. Management's effectiveness is measured by the returns generated from the assets under its control, and from the equity invested into the company by shareholders.For their managerial performance, Plantronics' management team delivered the greater returns on assets and equity, while CoreLogic's team delivered the lesser.• Earnings Per Share: Of all the metrics measuring a company's income, earnings per share is probably the most meaningful to shareholders, as this represents the value that the company is adding to each share outstanding. Since the number of shares outstanding varies from company to company, I prefer to convert EPS into a percentage of the current stock price to better determine where an investment could gain the most value.Of the two companies here compared, Plantronics provides common stock holders with the greater diluted earnings per share gain as a percentage of its current share price, while CoreLogic's DEPS over current stock price is lower.• Share Price Value: Even if a company outperforms its peers on all the above metrics, however, investors may still shy away from its stock if its price is already trading too high. This is where the stock price relative to forward earnings and company book value come under scrutiny, as well as the stock price relative to earnings relative to earnings growth, known as the PEG ratio. Lower ratios indicate the stock price is currently trading at a cheaper price than its peers, and might thus be a bargain.Among our two combatants, Plantronics' stock is cheaper relative to forward earnings and 5-year PEG, where CoreLogic's represents the better value relative to company book.B) Estimates and Analyst RecommendationsOf course, no matter how skilled we perceive ourselves to be at gauging a stock's prospects as an investment, we'd be wise to at least consider what professional analysts and the companies themselves are projecting - including estimated future earnings per share and the growth rate of those earnings, stock price targets, and buy/sell recommendations.• Earnings Estimates: To properly compare estimated future earnings per share across multiple companies, we would need to convert them into a percentage of their stocks' current prices.Of our two specimens, Plantronics offers the higher percentages of earnings over current stock price for all time periods, where CoreLogic offers the lower percentages.• Earnings Growth: For long-term investors this metric is one of the most important to consider, as it denotes the percentage by which earnings are expected to grow or shrink as compared to earnings from corresponding periods a year prior.For earnings growth, CoreLogic offers the greater earnings growth over the near term and in 2015 by a substantial degree, where Plantronics offers it over the next five years.• Price Targets: Like earnings estimates above, a company's stock price targets must also be converted into a percentage of its current price to properly compare multiple companies.For their high, mean and low price targets over the coming 12 months, analysts believe CoreLogic's stock offers the greater upside potential and lesser downside risk, where Plantronics' stock offers the lesser upside and greater downside.• Buy/Sell Recommendations: After all is said and done, perhaps the one gauge that sums it all up are analyst recommendations. These have been converted into the percentage of analysts recommending each level. However, I factor only the strong buy and buy recommendations into the ranking. Hold, underperform and sell recommendations are not ranked since they are determined after determining the winners of the strong buy and buy categories, and would only be negating those winners of their duly earned titles.Of our two contenders, Plantronics is better recommended with 1 strong buy and 5 buy ratings representing 75% of its 8 analysts, while CoreLogic garners 5 strong buy and 2 buy ratings representing 70% of its 10 analysts.C) RankingsHaving crunched all the numbers and compared all the projections, the time has come to tally up the wins and losses and rank our three competitors against one another.In the table below you will find all of the data considered above plus a few others not reviewed. Here is where using a company's market cap as a denominator comes into play, as much of the data in the table has been converted into a percentage of market cap for a fair comparison.The first and last placed companies are shaded. We then add together each company's finishes to determine its overall ranking, with first place finishes counting as merits while last place finishes count as demerits.And the winner is… Plantronics by the sound of things, outperforming in 20 metrics and underperforming in 11 for a net score of +9, leaving CoreLogic with little logic in its core fundamentals, outperforming in 11 metrics and underperforming in 20 for a net score of -9.Where the Processing Systems & Products industry is expected to outperform the S&P broader market significantly this and next quarters, meaningfully in 2015, and significantly beyond, the two largest companies in the space are expected to reverse-perform over the near term (at least in earnings growth) with CoreLogic growing the most, before reverting back to their normal positioning with Plantronics outgrowing over the longer term.After taking all company fundamentals into account, Plantronics connects together the superior financial figures, given its lower stock price to forward earnings and 5-year PEG, higher cash and lower debt over market cap, higher current ratio, higher trailing revenue and earnings growth, wider profit and operating margins, higher returns on assets and equity, higher diluted earnings over current stock price, higher future earnings over current stock price throughout, higher future earnings growth over the longer term, higher dividend ratio, and more analyst buy recommendations - clearly winning the Processing Systems & Products industry competition."
1055831,27671,2012-12-10T17:10:47-05:00,,"CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX) is a financial information and analytics firm that supplies U.S. real estate, mortgage, consumer and specialized business data to its clients. Clients include commercial banks, mortgage lenders and brokers, investment banks, fixed-income investors, real estate agents, property and casualty insurance companies, and title insurance firms. CoreLogic organizes its business lines into three segments: Mortgage Origination Services (MOS), Data and Analytics (D&A), and Default Services (NYSE:DS). MOS revenues and revenue growth are the highest of the three segments.Shares of CoreLogic had traded up steadily for over a year before stumbling recently. After hitting bottom at $8 in August 2011, CLGX hit $28 in September of this year. Not surprisingly, several insiders had begun to take profits in the stock last summer as they traded above $23. Insiders selling into strength is expected, however, and therefore unremarkable.What is remarkable was the sudden buying cluster that emerged after CLGX plunged back down to $23 on October 25th - the day after Q3 financials were released. Four executives immediately bought a total of $502,378 of CGLX at an average price of $22.84. Granted, the percentage increase in holdings of the purchases was only significant for Director Douglas Curling, who boosted his stake by over 67% with his $227k buy. The other three only increased their holdings by 1.2% to 3.6%.But the fact that four insiders would all agree that buying a stock that - despite the near-term dip - was still up over 100% in the past year is not expected, and therefore more significant. This averaging up the price of one's holdings shows confidence from the buyer that new highs are likely.Housing foundation requiredCoreLogic's fundamentals seem to concur. Revenues in Q3 increased 17.6%, to $409.8 million. Mortgage Origination Services revenues increased 35.6%, to $175.1 million ""as a result of increased demand for credit and tax services and flood certifications."" Adjusted EPS of 45 cents beat expectations by 8 cents.This was the third straight quarter of strong top-line increases, which seems to confirm management's assertion that there is ""an improving outlook for the housing market."" That sentiment meshes with an update I heard last August on the Q2 earnings call for Two Harbors (NYSE:TWO), as well as generally positive housing stats as of late. Considering the nature of CoreLogic's business, a belief in a recovering housing market is important to support a bullish opinion on CLGX.CoreLogic's management felt confident enough about the housing market and its operations to have raised full-year guidance significantly after Q3 results. The midpoint of 2012 revenue guidance increased 4.4%, to $1.53 billion. EBITDA expectations rose 14%, to $440 million, and EPS guidance increased 25%, to a range of $1.45 to $1.50.CLGX now trades for a not-too-pricey 18 times this year's EPS expectations after already showing life again after its late October fall. But the forward PE on CLGX right now is not the primary factor as far as I'm concerned. In the end, whether insiders - and now me - are proven correct to have bought into CLGX's pullback will come down to housing activity next year.If the grudging improvement in household formation continues to be positive, estimates and valuations for CLGX should both increase. The opposite is true as well, of course. And, unfortunately, the action (or non action) of a U.S. Congress that is still not functionally proven could play a large part in deciding the fate of economic activity in 2013. That's a variable that neither analysts nor insiders can predict.I like the odds of the grudging recovery in the U.S. continuing, however, and view the downside of betting on a more optimistic outcome for next year's economic (and housing) activity worthwhile. Technically, CLGX has also just broken back above its 50-day moving average, and appears to be attempting another uptrend.Not so surprisingly, two insiders have already taken some profits again as their stock trades back up near old highs. But again, that's expected, and therefore less significant. The buying cluster into recent weakness remains the most important takeaway from the executive suite. That cadre didn't likely bother buying into their stock last month expecting a mere few bucks upside. I certainly didn't.Disclosure: I am long CLGX, TWO.

1540512,25120,2013-07-09T13:29:05-04:00,,"Investors in CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX) are applauding the set of acquisitions which the company made at the start of the month.The combination of a solid valuation, the strategic transformation and increased repurchase activity all bode well for shareholders in the coming period.The DealOn July the 1, CoreLogic announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Marshall & Swift/Boeckh and DataQuick Information Systems.CoreLogic will pay $661 million in total for the two companies. The acquisition of Marshall & Swift adds residential and commercial property valuation solutions for the property and casualty insurance industry. DataQuick supplies a range of analytical solutions including credit reporting, flood zone determination services, fraud monitoring and property valuation services, among others.With the acquisitions, CoreLogic will double its property and casualty insurance revenues. CEO Anand Nallathambi commented on the rationale behind the two deals:The $661 million purchase price is somewhat inflated. CoreLogic expects to realize cash tax benefits with an estimated present value of around $115 million. Adjusted for this, the deals are valued at $546 million. The deal is expected to be accretive to 2013's results excluding the one-time reduction in deferred revenue.The activities generated $111 million in annual revenues in 2012, valuing the assets at 4.9 times annual revenues. The deal is valued at 9.6 times 2013's expected EBITDA including $7 million in annual synergies and adjusted for the value of tax benefits. These estimates exclude the possibility for additional cost and revenue synergies.The deals are expected to close in the third quarter of 2013, and are subject to normal closing conditions including regulatory approval.ValuationCoreLogic ended its first quarter with $125.6 million in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $788.2 million in total debt, for a net debt position of around $663 million. Yet the company has access to plenty of liquidity given its $500 million capacity within its current revolving credit facility.CoreLogic generated full-year revenues of $1.57 billion for 2012, up 17.1% on the year before. The company reported a $112.3 million net profit compared to a sizable loss the year before.Trading around $25 per share, the market values CoreLogic at $2.4 billion. This values the firm's assets at around 1.5 times annual revenues and 21-22 times annual earnings.CoreLogic does not pay a dividend at the moment, instead it returns cash to its shareholders by means of share repurchases.Some Historical PerspectiveWhile the housing market has rebounded in recent times, shareholders in CoreLogic still have a long way to go. Shares rose from $25 in 2004 to a peak of $55 in 2007. Shares fell to lows of $8 in 2011, but have tripled from that point in time to exchange hands around $25 at the moment.Between 2009 and 2012, CoreLogic has increased its revenues by a cumulative 18% to $1.57 billion. Net income fell by more than 40% to $112.3 million.Investment ThesisCoreLogic is benefiting from a number of beneficial events. A solid rebound in the housing market, strategic acquisitions and increased share repurchase activity, all boost shareholder value.First-quarter revenues rose by 10.9% to $397.2 million, putting the company on track to generate annual revenues around $1.75 billion. Net income rose by 18.1% to $34.2 million, as the company is on track to report net earnings of $130 million. Factoring in impact of the acquisitions, revenues could approach $1.9 billion in 2013 on which CoreLogic could earn $150 million.The deal is furthermore in accordance with CoreLogic's strategic plan, boosting the share of revenues of the data and analytics unit to more than 50%. At the same time, CoreLogic also raised the share repurchase target to 8 million shares for the year, up from merely 3-5 million shares before, allowing the company to retire some 8% of its current share base.While the transaction occurs at premium valuation multiples to CoreLogic's own valuation, investors applaud management with the deal. Shares rose 8% following the announcement of the deal, boosting the valuation of the company by almost $200 million. Investors like the strong brands, the subscription-based business models and very high renewal rates of annual contracts. Marshall & Swift has renewal rates of around 95%, which is really attractive coupled with very low variable costs.Trading around 1.25 times 2013's expected annual revenues and 16 times annual earnings, shares are fairly valued. The appeal of the deal is the more predictable nature of CoreLogic's cash flows, making the company less vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the industry.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

306280,23502,2011-11-08T14:39:31-05:00,,"By Brett Horn CoreLogic's (NYSE:CLGX)  undervalued shares offer two different routes to investor gain, in our  opinion--through a buyout, or through market recognition of the  company's value.CoreLogic provides data, analytical tools, and processing services  for the mortgage industry. While we knew 2011 would be a tough year for  the firm as the tailwind from the refinancing boom recedes and mortgage  origination remains weak, it has been even tougher than we  expected--even the company's default business is struggling. The  company's origination and default businesses typically work against each  other, but government interference has caused the firm's default  business to decline before origination volume could pick up.In August, when CoreLogic substantially lowered its outlook for the  year, the stock imploded. While the third quarter was much more positive  and the stock has risen materially, we still think the shares are  undervalued. Investors looking at the shares today have two ways to win,  in our view: either through a sale of the company or a long-term  convergence to fair value. While we're skeptical that the company could  achieve our fair value estimate of $21 per share in a buyout, this route  would result in a quick out for investors. If the buyout discussions  come to nothing, then long-term investors can wait for the market to  recognize CoreLogic's fair value.In the Long TermCoreLogic is a solid business from a long-term perspective, in our opinion. While smaller than peer Lender Processing Services (NYSE:LPS),  CoreLogic is a leader in certain areas and a solid number two overall.  We think it has sufficient size to leverage its fixed costs and produce  excess returns. As the company sells noncore businesses, it will become  more centered on the fundamentally attractive and moaty data business.While 2011 has been weaker than expected, we think the default  business won't necessarily follow a straight path down, and the weakness  in 2011 is a deferral of revenue, not a loss. While new foreclosures  are likely to remain low until the banks and the state attorneys general  work out a deal, and the timing of that deal is difficult to predict,  this does nothing to change the condition of seriously delinquent but  not-yet-foreclosed-upon borrowers. Therefore, we think it is likely that  we will see a spurt of foreclosure activity once the legal issues are  worked out.Still, the long-term trend for the default business is definitely  down, as the volume of distressed mortgages remains well above normal.  While we believe that the robo-signing controversy has temporarily  accelerated what otherwise might have been a smooth glide down for the  default business, in the long term, this business must ultimately fall  off materially.Mortgage originations remain weak, and the possibility of a  substantial near-term improvement is low, but long-term volume should  start to normalize. Home sales have been depressed since the housing  bubble burst and have shown no sign of improvement since, absent some  temporary spikes due to government programs designed to spur sales.  While we don't expect a quick recovery, house sales are below levels  reached even before the housing bubble and should ultimately improve.Even if industry conditions don't improve, the company's  restructuring efforts should boost profitability. In addition to selling  the bulk of its nonmortgage businesses, the company has undertaken cost  restructuring efforts. It initiated a head count reduction this year,  which management estimates will save $30 million annually (with only $20  million of those savings appearing in 2011). Additionally, CoreLogic  believes it can substantially lower its IT costs by closing redundant  data centers and rationalizing end-user testing. Management estimates it  can save $50 million annually through these efforts, with those savings  developing over a two-year period. With the release of its  third-quarter results, the company raised its target for cost savings  through these actions to $80 million-$100 million. Therefore, we think  it's likely that the company can achieve substantial bottom-line  improvement before the mortgage market normalizes.In the Short TermShortly  after releasing second-quarter results, CoreLogic announced it was  exploring strategic alternatives because of pressure from a large  shareholder. Then in late August, the company announced that it had  retained investment bank Greenhill (NYSE:GHL)  to look at ways to enhance shareholder value. We think the only new  option placed on the table then was a potential sale of the company.CEO Anand Nallathambi says he and the board agree that the current  market price dramatically undervalues the business, and that this view  is the driver behind the board's willingness to look at strategic  alternatives. So far, management has been excluded from the buyout  discussions. We think management is not a willing seller at this point,  as it doesn't believe it can achieve a fair value in this environment.  We don't see any obvious strategic buyers, but we could see management  accepting an offer below our fair value estimate if an opportunistic  buyer appeared.Still, CoreLogic is not a forced seller, and a look at comparable  market valuations suggests a reasonable buyout price could be at a  premium to the current stock price, even after the recent rise.  CoreLogic is still profitable, holds a substantial cash balance, and is  not in imminent danger of violating its covenants. As a result, we don't  think it is under pressure to sell at a price the board would find less  than adequate. There has been speculation that several potential buyers  are looking at CoreLogic, with most being private equity firms. If this  is true, then it would lend some support to the idea that CoreLogic  could realize a price above the current market price.What Could Go WrongThe  main risks are more negative surprises in the near term, legal risks,  or a sale at a distressed price. Given the state of the mortgage market,  further bad news cannot be ruled out, and the default business could  continue to fall off more quickly than the origination business can  improve. Additionally, the company does face some legal uncertainty. The  FDIC recently filed a lawsuit against CoreLogic and Lender Processing  Services over appraisals done for Washington Mutual. While we think  CoreLogic has reasonable defenses and this lawsuit itself is not a major  threat (the damages claimed only equal a little more than $1 per  share), it could lead to problems if the lawsuit were successful and  encouraged others to file similar claims. On the other hand, the fact  that no bank has brought charges on its own behalf argues against this  being a widespread issue. Finally, we're skeptical that the company can  realize a fair value for its business in this environment. A sale for  all or parts of the business below fair value cannot be ruled out,  although new investors shouldn't be too concerned on this front, as even  a sale below fair value would probably result in a quick return."
296203,22145,2011-09-27T12:57:20-04:00,,"By Justin DoveBack on August 30, data and analytics company CoreLogic (NYSE: CLGX) announced that it hired investment bank Greenhill & Co.to help advise a potential sale.Friday, rumors were picking up steam as analysts predicted the  company’s stock could fetch a premium of between 30 and 50 percent. By  Friday afternoon, CoreLogic options activity was up 382 percent more  than normal, signaling optimism at a possible sale.Its stock was trading around $11.50 on Friday – 47 percent above its  low in late August, but 43 percent less than its 52-week high.Reuters reported that TPG Capital paid “about 11 times EBITDA” in  buying CoreLogic-competitor MDA DataQuick last year. That means someone  could pay up to $18 per share for CoreLogic – a 56-percent increase over  Friday’s price.CoreLogic Wooed By Up to Seven SuitorsReuters also reported that “at least two strategic buyers and five private equity firms have shown interest in the company.”Companies listed as showing interest are:The more suitors there are for an acquisition, the higher the  probability of a bidding war. If these rumors prove true, CoreLogic and  its shareholders may stand to benefit.CoreLogic’s Core Data and Analytics ProductsCoreLogic is a data and analytics company spun off from First American Financial Corp. (NYSE: FAF) last year. The company operated at a profit the last two quarters, but failed to deliver for investors since its spin-off.CoreLogic’s core data and analytics products provide things from risk  and fraud analysis to risk management and specialty financial data.But considering its bread and butter is mortgage data and analytics, the company is struggling along with the housing market. Some analysts also believe that a complicated business plan is also holding back the newly independent company.“They have a bunch of things going on at the same time,” an analyst told HousingWire.com. “It’s a complicated business model which makes it tougher for investors.”CoreLogic: Just Parts of a Whole?This assumption makes some wonder if CoreLogic will be sold as a  whole, or whether it will just sell pieces of its company to lighten the  load.CoreLogic certainly could just be optimizing its operations, but  analysts, such as Morningstar’s Brett Horn, believe the company is most  valuable as a whole.“I think their complete business is more valuable than in pieces,”  Horn told Reuters. “Just selling these pieces separately to different  buyers is probably not going to be the most effective way to realize  their value.”CoreLogic’s Struggling Bottom LineCoreLogic, although profitable, is struggling. There’s also the  potential that it will only sell pieces of its business. But if the  whole company is sold to a strategic buyer or investment firm, investors  could make a quick profit on the premium.A potential sale is somewhat priced into the stock, as shown by its  40-percent gain since the announcement. But the stock is likely  undervalued due to a slumping overall market and a poor housing  industry, but should still garner a further premium from a potential  buyer.Considering the 52-week high is above $20 per share, there’s reason  to think a possible a buyer could pay close to that amount. It also  bodes well that there are up to seven suitors. A bidding war could drive  up the premium.It may be wise to stay tuned to see if CoreLogic does in fact get  bought out as a whole and how much companies are willing to fork out.Disclosure: Investment U expressly forbids  its writers from having a financial interest in any security they  recommend to our subscribers.

For example, pretax earnings have benefited by $10.4 million in the first half 2011 as the company has significantly reduced its allowance for doubtful accounts. If I rule out a possible sale of the company, what other options are left? If I break down the options that the company highlighted in the press release, very few appear to create value for shareholders: My adjusted EBITDA valuation suggests the company is worth $3.27 per share plus an additional $1.75 for the joint venture investments (8x aftertax run rate earnings before adjusting the figure for the RP Data acquisition--so likely conservative). This suggests a $5.00 fair value stock price, or greater than 50% downside from current levels."
3242096,63483,2015-06-08T06:23:30-04:00,"Strong Q1 performance is likely to continue.Despite a dip in mortgage activity, rates remain low, which should propel future activity.Currency headwinds will continue to be a slight drag going forward.Moderate upside potential from current levels, further upside potential depends on cost-savings initiatives.","Earnings ReviewCoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX) reported strong first quarter FY15 results. This performance is likely to continue. Despite a recent dip in mortgage activity, mortgage rates remain low. With such a favorable backdrop, mortgage activity should recover going forward. Currency headwinds were a slight issue, and should continue to act as a slight drag going forward, though FX impact will be much lesser than before. The company shows moderate upside potential from current levels, while further upside potential depends on the execution of CLGX's cost savings initiatives.Strong Q1 performance is likely to continueCLGX posted healthy double-digit growth in its top-line, which grew to $365m (+12% Y/Y), while its bottom-line began posting profits of $0.32 on a diluted GAAP EPS basis, compared to a net loss in the prior period. In terms of analyst estimates, the company crushed expectations, posting diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 versus projections of $0.31, surprising 49% to the upside. Top- and bottom-line performance aside, the company achieved moderate growth in both of its segments; D&A jumped 19% Y/Y, while TPS increased 6% over the same period.I posit that this strong performance is likely to continue. Mortgage volumes have been down for six weeks straight, or nearly half a quarter, and yet the company continued to post its aforementioned strong performance. This highlights the resilience of the company's revenue base; even during a tough period, the company is able to command a great deal of customer stickiness, evident from its growing sales. Hence, I wager that even if CLGX sees a tougher environment down the road (say, a recession), the company would continue to be able to generate stable recurring cash flows, largely due to the fact that its solutions are embedded within its customers' workflow. Going forward, CLGX is sure to perform well in most economic environments.Despite a dip in mortgage activity, rates remain low, which should propel future activityIn an earlier paragraph, I mentioned that mortgage volumes have been falling for six straight weeks. Despite this trend, I am confident that mortgage activity should begin to stabilize in the near-term, as mortgage rates continue to remain extremely depressed due to the aftermath of the Fed's QE program. Construction spending has also strengthened, which could signal that the housing market is beginning to recover from its recent weakness. CLGX has already proven its ability to operate in an environment where its customers are struggling, and if mortgage volumes rebound as I expect, CLGX should be a huge beneficiary of this turnaround; the company's top-line might see a slight acceleration.Currency headwinds will continue to be a slight drag going forwardIn a previous piece on CLGX, I highlighted the issue of FX headwinds, which stem primarily from the recent strengthening of the dollar. I postulated that CLGX would suffer slightly from fluctuations within the forex market, due to its small international presence. Indeed, management mentioned that growth within both operating segments more than offset the slight FX impact that the company experienced. Keep in mind that for most of the quarter, the dollar currency index (""DCI"") was hovering around 100. As of the time of writing, the DCI is at 96.31 (according to CNBC data). The index appears to be trending down, likely due to poor trade data and the recent slight GDP decline. If this trend continues, expect FX to act as a mere tickle to CLGX going into the second quarter.Moderate upside potential from current levels, further upside potential dependent on cost-savings initiativesAs seen in the above model, my assumptions regarding the company's future performance remains unchanged from that of my previous article, largely due to the fact that the company's performance was more or less In-line with my expectations. My model implies approximately 20% upside potential (price target of $46.50) from current levels, and the company may have further upside if its cost-savings initiatives are executed successfully. Management has cited potential savings of $50m-$60m, but I remain skeptical of their ability to realize these savings. Despite my reservations, investors should keep an eye on management's future comments regarding this initiative, as it could boost upside potential in excess of 40%+. Regardless, I reiterate my bullish stance on CLGX."

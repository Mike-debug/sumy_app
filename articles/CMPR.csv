(CMPR) currently trades at just over $83 a share. Analysts who follow this stock have an $87 share price earmarked for this stock. The share price went on a multi-year bull run before it topped out in March 2018 at well over $170 a share. Since then, shares have been in a sustained downtrend.If we look at the chart below, we can see that we have a big down-gap in January that has yet to be filled. The down-gap took place on high selling volume. Therefore, since shares, as mentioned, have been in a sustained downtrend, this gap is most likely a measuring gap or an exhaustion gap. We need to do some investigating to find out which gap it is as both bring different ramifications to the table.With respect to the measuring gap, this gap usually occurs around the mid-point of the move. Therefore, considering how Cimpress has been trading over the past 13 months, this would be a bearish set-up for this stock.If we have an exhaustion gap in play, this would mean Cimpress' multi-month downtrend would be close to a bottom (bullish). We can also see from the chart that price printed lower lows in March. This can happen sometimes with exhaustion gaps as sellers slowly begin to exit their positions.What we like to do is look at possible divergences and patterns to see if this gap is giving us a bullish or bearish setup. As we can see from the chart below, the RSI momentum oscillator has not given us any divergence when compared to price action. This means the selling momentum is still very much in play. Furthermore (when we have exhaustion gaps in play), the price usually turns over quickly and fills the gap it recently formed. Again, it is closing in on three months now and price is still nowhere near the bottom end of that gap.With respect to the technical patterns that are currently in play, we can see that price has been undergoing continuous broadening formations which is a bearish pattern. In fact, it was this pattern that led to the down-gap back in January. Furthermore, since then, price seems to be undergoing another broadening formation. It will be interesting to see whether price can nullify this formation by convincingly breaking above the upper trend-line (blue line).From the technicals, we would be swaying towards a bearish set-up here. Let's see if the financials can offer some bullish perspectives.We have consistently stated that earnings drive stock prices forward. Therefore, if Cimpress, for example, was undergoing a bottoming formation, we should be seeing healthy earnings trends. On the contrary, earnings expectations for this fiscal year, for example, are down $0.52 over the past 3 months. The following year, we have a worse decline of $1.55 per share over the same time-frame. Suffice it to say, these trends do not offer much encouragement for share price gains in the months to come.In saying this, we like to research companies when their forward-looking expectations are dire. A profitable company with an interesting valuation always merits more research. However, Cimpress trades with an earnings multiple of almost 60 and a book multiple of 20 approximately. These numbers are well outside ""value"" range. The high price to book ratio, in particular, demonstrates that sustained earnings growth may be difficult long term due to the clear lack of assets on the balance sheet at present.Another metric that can impede earnings growth is the company's debt. In the company's December quarter, we can see that long-term debt increased to over $1 billion which was a sizable jump from $824 million in the September quarter. Cimpress now has $1.84 billion of liabilities on its balance sheet against a mere $128 million of equity. Higher debt has resulted in the firm's interest coverage ratio dropping to 2.22 which means a sizable chunk (almost half over the past 4 quarters) of the firm's operating profit has to service the company's debt.Therefore, we believe it looks highly likely the gap in January is a measuring gap. Now, as mentioned, these gaps usually take place around the mid-point of the established long-term trend. This means we should see lower prices here in the near term."
4103300,101543,2017-08-31T09:24:04-04:00,Cimpress NV capital allocation is very strategic.They've been able to make acquisitions at private market multiples creating shareholder value.CEO Robert Keane has much to do with the success of Cimpress.,"Cimpress NV (CMPR) released their investor letter written by CEO Robert Keane a month ago which you can find here. I think that, for anybody that is interested in investing and understanding how a CEO should think, these letters are a must read. The majority of the letters normally discusses a lot about capital allocation.A key job skill a good CEO needs is a strong understanding of capital allocation. If a CEO is more interested in just creating growth for the sake of growth, this can be value destructive to shareholders. Determining hurdle rates for acquisitions - tracking investments and seeing if average returns are above the weighted average cost of capital for the firm - are all important attributes to understanding when considering an investment.The two main business segments Cimpress focuses on are Vistaprint and their Upload & Print segments. The company has a significant structural advantages over competition with there scale. Vistaprints' main focus has been on small businesses, roughly 10 employees or less, providing business cards, banners, other small marketing materials. Vistaprint has dominated this market by driving costs down using large R&D investments and fixed capital outlays. A good portion of the print business is fixed, so sales grow as the company becomes more efficient. Growth has slowed down in this niche segment and that why the upload and print segment was born.The Upload and Print business concentrates on higher value customers willing to spend more money on a per customer basis than Vistaprint's customer base. These customers want to go beyond just standard templates and create custom designs. Furthermore, they want large customization capabilities and the Upload and Print segment has expanded to adhere to these requests through acquisitions. In FY 2017 alone the company added 4,019 SKUs when in 2014 they only offered 600 SKUs.Since than, the company has used a roll up strategy on their acquisitions. A public market to private market arbitrage has allowed them to purchase quality companies at a margin of safety.Exhibit 1: Acquisition AnalysisSource: Company's Press ReleasesWhen considering EV/EBITDA average purchase multiples of 8x (see exhibit 1) and adjusting for cost synergies being merged into a much larger platform, the average effective EBITDA multiple is approximately 6-7x. By using the company's 15x multiple to make acquisitions at much lower multiples, returns can be very attractive and compound capital above normal returns.Its simple math, if everything is constant the three purchases, with the known EBITDA earnings generated 32.6 million euros at an average effective 7x multiple, equal 228 million. Now when the assets are transferred over and re-rated, total enterprise value equals 489 million. A 261 million difference is considered value creation without the company having done anything. That is the beauty of roll-ups. Now this isn't managements main strategy, but many acquisitions have been from private markets, and probably will continue to be so going forward, allowing this arbitrage to continue in a fragmented industry. There are risks to this strategy, especially on the implementation side, but management has shown the ability to drive value out of these acquisitions.Investors are too short-term in their thinking today, and having a long-term time horizon is an edge one can take advantage of. I believe that's why the market price for Cimpress has gone nowhere over the past year. Vistaprint and the Upload & Prints segments both reported 9% and 13% revenue growth on a organic constant currency basis. Profitability on a GAAP basis does not look attractive due to large internal investments and acquisitions. Management does though report a steady state cash flow projection. This allows investors to understand what the company's cash flows would look like without large investments being made for growth purposes.Exhibit 2: Steady State Free Cash Flow 2017Source: 2017 Investor LetterFor 2017 management believes the company's steady state free cash flow was between $290 and $340 million contingent on capex requirements to maintain operations. If we use the low end of the estimate, that provides us with a 10% FCF yield. This cash flow yield looks quite attractive when also considering management beliefs that revenue growth will continue in the low double digits for the foreseeable future. I am happy to own a company with a 10% FCF yield and the optionality of continued double digit growth well above GDP growth.The company will continue to bring scale to a fragmented industry, allowing more customized products at lower quantity purchases, at lower price points. CEO Robert Keane owns roughly 6% shares outstanding and is the founder of the company. This is something I do like to see, especially when they have a track record of already growing the business above normal returns. I get the sense he is a very methodical thinker who is always learning to maximize the intrinsic value per share of Cimpress. If management can grow the Upload & Print segment similarly as they did Vistaprint, capital will be compounded at high rates of return in the foreseeable future.To read more research on stock spin-offs, micro-mid cap companies, and special situations, please consider following me (by clicking the ""Follow"" button at the top of this article next to my name) to receive notification when I publish research next."
4030194,102328,2016-12-13T11:54:03-05:00,"It is not easy to find an outstanding management with excellent capital allocation skills running a great business with plenty of opportunities to reinvest internally-generated cash.Cimpress is relentlessly focused on mass customization which is all about producing small, individual orders with reliability, quality, and affordability of mass productions.The competitive advantage of Cimpress is based largely on its status as the scale producer in a very fragmented industry.","It is not easy to find an outstanding management with excellent capital allocation skills running a great business with plenty of opportunities to reinvest internally-generated cash. I have found some of those qualities in analyzing Cimpress (NASDAQ:CMPR). In short, Cimpress makes customized print, signage, apparel, gifts, identity merchandise, packaging and other products. The history of Cimpress dates back to 1994 when founder Robert Keane wanted to give small business owners access to the same high-quality, custom-printed products that bigger companies enjoyed. Today, Cimpress is a remarkable story that has gone from startup to over $1.8bn in sales.Cimpress is relentlessly focused on mass customization, which is all about producing small, individual orders with reliability, quality, and affordability of mass productions. Mass customization is a business model that allows companies to deliver major improvements to customer value across a wide variety of printed product categories. The company that masters mass customization is able to produce small individual orders with the reliability, quality, and affordability of mass production.The concept of mass customization is very important for the understanding of Cimpress's business model. The below-mentioned chart describes that concept:Traditionally, the only way to manufacture at a low unit cost was to produce a large volume of that product (right-hand corner of the chart). On the other side, custom-made products usually incurred very high unit costs (left-hand side of the chart). Mass customization enables low volume and low-cost production of individually unique products. This concept creates value in many ways, not just lower cost, for instance, faster production, greater personal relevance, elimination of obsolete stock, better design, flexible shipping options, more product choice, and higher quality.Cimpress tries to build a mass customization platform (MCP) and a related ecosystem of owned and third-party merchants and fulfillers. Put it in the simple form, as a middleman, Cimpress wants to direct any customer's order to the physical printing asset (owned or third-party) that can most efficiently fulfill requirements for cost, quality, and delivery speed. By no means is this an ambitious vision, but given the industry fragmentation, there is a high probability of success.Large scale in small quantitiesThe competitive advantage of Cimpress is based largely on its status as the scale producer in a very fragmented industry. This is further magnified by the high fixed costs of the printing industry since higher capacity utilization of fixed assets drives down the overall cost per unit of output. Large scale is an important driver of Cimpress's competitive advantage because increasingly larger volumes of orders allow them to sort and then produce those orders in increasingly focused processes. In 2016, Cimpress processed over 46m uniquely customized items.Risks to business modelGenerally, barriers to entry are not so high. That means new players already have entered the mass customization space that is enabled by asset-light models, software-driven print-fulfillment platforms, and innovation in production technology. In the long run, leaders in mass customization will be companies that bring significant scale-based advantages to drive value to customers.Some of the factors that could cause Cimpress's business strategy to fail: (i) growth of online companies, many of which provide products and services similar to those which Cimpress produce, (ii) failure to develop the mass customization platform or the failure of the platform to drive the efficiencies and competitive advantage, (iii) failure to manage the growth, complexity, and pace of change of business and expansion of operations, and (iv) inability to enhance its competitive advantage, and scale operations.History of Cimpress's financial development and what can we expect?During the last 10 years, sales have compounded organically and through M&A at an average rate of 28%. Cash flow from operations grew by 22% and free cash flow by 36%.Investors/analysts rely heavily on past performance in part because it is the most salient piece of data we have from the company. Once again, past performance is not indicative of future results, but it shows us that Cimpress's long-term growth strategy was successful.What we should do is to take past performance as a starting point for our analysis. Without any doubt, we have a great company which is built on 3 pillars:1) Vistaprint business segment (in 2016 +10% YoY on an organic basis). Despite some of the headwinds in 2017, management is confident in its ability to consistently grow this business unit at low double-digit rates in the future.2) Upload and Print segment (in 2016 +27% on an organic basis). The management team does not expect growth of this segment to stay at 2016 levels but they remain confident of continued double-digit growth for these business units for the foreseeable future.3) Other businesses segment growth rates are expected to be suppressed in the near term as significant partner contracts ended in 2016. In the long run, management has a positive view on growth in this segment.ValuationLooking at the standard measures like relative multiples, Cimpress is not cheap. On the other side, it is difficult to find high-quality companies trading at an attractive valuation. So, if we know that Cimpress produces FCF of something around USD 150m and market cap is around USD 3bn, it is not highly attractive on an absolute basis. However, if we know that Cimpress grew FCF by the rate of 36% in the last 10 years, the purchase makes sense. All things considered, if I needed to deploy my capital in this environment, Cimpress would be on my list, but I would wait for a better entry point.ConclusionJohn Templeton once said: ""It is impossible to produce superior performance unless you do something different."" In my view, this quote describes Cimpress in many ways. Cimpress is a disrupter offering more comfortable solutions. It has management with a great understanding of capital allocation. Basically, management needs to do two things well to be successful: 1) run their operations efficiently and 2) deploy cash generated by those operations.Most executives focus on managing operations, but in Cimpress's case, Robert Keane (CEO, founder, and a significant shareholder), spends a major amount of his time on activities related to capital allocation and considers it as a critical responsibility.Furthermore, there is a similarity between Jeff Bezos and Robert Keane. For instance, Robert Keane believes that innovation and risk-taking are critical to value creation so they do not seek to avoid investment risk. If you read Jeff Bezos's annual shareholder letters, you will notice the same approach towards failures.When we sum up this article about Cimpress, we can see many traits of a great business and management. I don't know if it is going to be a 10-bagger, but I know that if I run the business, I would do similar things as they do."
4077106,102273,2017-05-29T03:03:18-04:00,More acquisitions may be needed to drive scale and reduce competition.Significant cost to acquire new customers via advertising spend.E-commerce growth coupled with strength of consumer spending key for revenue growth.,"Cimpress (NASDAQ:CMPR) is focused on becoming a giant in the mass-customization industry. Its ultimate success will depend on its ability to drive speedy delivery of print orders at the lowest cost. That can be achieved by automating the various individual tasks in its workflow and by reducing the set-up time for various tasks.Traditionally, customized printing work, such as printing business cards, brochures, and other marketing materials was the exclusive domain of small and local print shops. These print shops have been used by small and medium sized businesses to meet their print needs. The local shops would work closely with their customers in designing their final products and then be setting up and printing the final products. The whole process involved a lot of manual work and face time before the printing could even begin. Cimpress is leveraging the internet and latest printing equipment to increase productivity and lower cost while providing customers with a wide array of options.Small Job Shops Still Dominate the Printing Industry(Source: Company Filings)Customized printing is a very large opportunity in both North America and Europe and very little of that market is processed online. According to Cimpress, out of the $100 billion total addressable market, just 20% or $20 billion in print orders are processed online in North America and Europe.Print Market in North America and Europe is Vast and E-Commerce is Still a Small Piece(Source:Company Filings)If it can keep its costs low and put together a great marketing campaign to drive orders, it could substantially grow its online business. The one big challenge it faces is the cost of shipping. So, Cimpress may not only have to consolidate and route its online orders to its large printing facilities, but it would also have to strategically position its facilities close to its customers. Small and medium businesses are very sensitive to cost and so if the cost of shipping as a percentage of total order is high, they might abandon their order. They would rather place their order with a local print shop. The need to reduce shipping costs may be the reason why Cimpress opened its first manufacturing operation in the U.S. in Reno, Nevada. This facility would help serve the markets in the highly populous western states and reduce shipping costs by being closer to their customers.Cimpress is also hoping that the small job shops would be driven out of business due to a combination of higher costs and lower volumes and thus it can establish itself as the sole printing provider in many markets.Number of Print Establishments Are Declining and E-Commerce is On the Rise(Source: Company Filings)The number of print shops has been in slow decline for many years and that decline may continue due to lower demand for printing due to increased use of digital marketing and the rise of economies of scale driven by both the internet and automation in the print workflow that has made many job shops very uncompetitive. Cimpress has also acquired some of the larger players in the print industry to add to its scale and capabilities. For example, it acquired WIRmachenDRUCK to expand its e-commerce business, increase its scale in the mass customization platform and gain more small and medium businesses. It had acquired National Pen to increase its scale in writing instruments. National Pen had 10 times more scale than Cimpress in the pen segment and that helps it increase its market share in promotional products, apparel and gifts.Cimpress has good growth in revenues over the years. That revenue growth has been driven by both acquisitions and organic growth. In the first quarter of 2017, overall revenue growth was 18%. But, excluding acquisitions, revenue growth was 6%. In the second and third quarter of the fiscal year 2017, revenue growth excluding acquisitions was 8% and 11% respectively. These numbers are good given that they operate in a slow growth industry, but when acquisitions are included the growth was 18% and 28% on a constant currency basis.Acquisitions Has Allowed Revenue To Grow At a Fast, Double-Digit Clip(Source: Company Filings)Cimpress will continue to acquire companies that could either add to its scale or help with its strategy of driving capabilities for its mass customization platform. I will have to continue investing heavily on advertising to garner new customers to justify its increased investment in scale. For the third quarter of 2017, advertising spend was 23% of the revenue for its Vistaprint business unit. In the future, when Cimpress has achieved substantial scale and printing market has consolidated into fewer players, it could reduce its advertising spend. But, for now Cimpress may have to continue to significant customer acquisition costs even though 75% of its bookings in the trailing twelve months (TTM) was from repeat orders.The increase in e-commerce order can drive further revenue growth for Cimpress. Also, Brazil, Japan, India and China accounted for a negligible portion of total revenues and those economies offer vast growth opportunities.Brazil, Japan, India and China Still Account for Very Little Revenue(Source: Company Filings)Cimpress is inherently dependent on strong consumer spending to drive growth. If consumer confidence and spending slips, demand for small business services will drop, that would have a negative impact on its revenue and increase its costs. The continued rise of digitization of marketing activities might lower the demand for print products. It may have to continue investing significant portion of its revenue in advertising to both gain new customers and that could help drive local job shops out of business. It will have further drive acquisitions to increase scale.Cimpress has laser sharp focus on the mass customization market but may face ongoing large investments in advertising, technology, and acquisitions to drive brand awareness, cost efficiencies, and scale. The next recession may be the real test of its strategy."
4085036,101543,2017-06-30T07:04:32-04:00,"The company, along with CEO Robert Keane, reminds me of the book The Outsiders.Large amounts of capital have been reinvested in the business to build out what management calls the mass customization platform.From a peer valuation, the company looks to have a margin of safety.","Cimpress N.V. (NASDAQ:CMPR) and CEO Robert Keane remind me somewhat of the book The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success. The book discusses how eight different CEOs produce extreme outsized returns over their tenure with prudent capital allocation. There are traits stated in the book that I believe Cimpress has.Exhibit 1: ChecklistSource: The Outsiders Book & Author's WorkYou can see pretty much all these attributes in the company's annual shareholder letter, which you can find here for 2016.Vistaprint has been the company's lifeblood and produces attractive economics. The segment has a growing loyal customer base with a dominant market position established by its sheer scale advantage and technology investments. For example, when an order is received for 250 business cards, Cimpress software automatically routes the order to the optimal location for pre-press, printing, cutting and packaging, and all this happens within 14 seconds. These capabilities have only been created through a decade of process improvements and over $1 billion of investments. I give Vistaprint a wide moat rating that will continue to grow organically and produce large amounts of free cash flow.The Upload and Print (U&P) segment is a different story, and still hasn't been fully told yet. Since 2014, management had this vision of a mass customization platform that services a larger spectrum of businesses for customized marketing and products. The company has spent well over $500 million for seven acquisitions to focus on this strategy in the last three years. I do concern these large capital investments won't produce management's adequate rate of return, when capital could have been used elsewhere, like share buybacks, which I like. This flurry of capital spending has also increased the company's debt load, creating less flexibility from a balance sheet perspective. Total debt now sits at $890 million. Management does seem to have a laser focus on ROIC, and these next two years will tell if it was right on such large capital outlays.Exhibit 2: Historical Operating ResultsSource: Company ReportsThe U&P segment has started to show meaningful revenue growth, but profitability is still being subdued by the capital spending. On a trailing 12-month basis for the U&P segment, revenue grew 32.5%. As scale and processes are optimally established, profitability should start to show along with reduced capital spending. Management has discussed this and believes this will be an ongoing process for the next few years.ValuationCimpress's primary competitors tend to be privately held, making a valuation comparison difficult. While maybe not the best comparison, I do think Shutterfly (NASDAQ:SFLY) is a good potential comp, which trades at 17x free cash flow.While applying a slight discount of a 15x multiple to 2017 TTM adjusted free cash flow estimates between $175 million and $225 million yields a $90-109 per share price (See Exhibit 3).Exhibit 3: 2017 Estimated Valuation Based on Adjusted Free Cash Flow ($ Millions)Source: Company Reports & Authors ResearchAs low-double-digit revenue growth continues and free cash flow margins begin to expand, I see these estimates as being low, providing a margin of safety.Running a leveraged buyout (LBO) model is a good way to test the soundness of the estimated 33% upside showed from the 17x free cash flow comp. The LBO model assumes the buyer provides 30% of the acquisition price and using debt for the rest of the funding yielding 6% (See Exhibit 4). Within the model, revenue grows at 10% and EBITDA margins stay stable at 16.5%. After deducting interest, taxes, and Capex, all of the free cash flow leftover is used to reduce debt and create equity. The exit multiple used was 15x EBITDA. With everything constant, a 17x EBITDA multiple provides a 31% IRR, and a 23x multiple supports a 15% IRR.Exhibit 4: LBO ModelSource: Company Reports & Author's WorkConclusionIt's been a tale of two businesses these past three years, but the company still has been providing great cash-generating economics. If the mass customization platform does meet management's hurdle rates, I believe shareholders will do extremely well. Cimpress has taken a highly fragmented industry and brought scale along with business process and technology advancements to such a simple business. With a LBO model supporting a peer comp valuation, I believe there's a margin of safety.To read more research on stock spin-offs, micro-mid cap companies, and special situations please consider following me (by clicking the ""Follow"" button at the top of this article next to my name) to receive notification when I publish research next."
4017553,52382,2016-11-01T11:28:12-04:00,"The expectation that the business can deliver a consistent, double-digit-type growth is facing the bitter reality.Besides poor organic growth trends at all three segments, deteriorating profitability and softening EBITDA trends add to the concerns.Valuation rich and out of sync with the business that seems to be fueled and driven by acquisitions.","Fundamental performance of Cimpress N.V. (NASDAQ:CMPR), the printing company behind Vistaprint and other brands, continues to deteriorate, and the trend suggests that the long argument for the business, including the oft-cited potential of creating long-term value for shareholders, may only get difficult to maintain. The business, which is largely fueled and driven by acquisitions, may find it increasingly challenging to live up to the high investor expectations, as reflected by the 28-29 times forward earnings and more than 12 times EV/trailing adjusted EBITDA, and justify the long-term sustainability of the business model itself.The doubts ignoredAs covered in my previous note, markets have been far more liberal in scrutinizing Cimpress compared to any other printing business, especially a ""roll-up"". Ignoring past controversies and competitive threats from Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) going their own way with the acquisition of PNI Digital Media, the market was excited about the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) deal, even though there is hardly any significant impact on the fundamentals. Rather than looking at the weakness in the VBU business, the largest segment, the market was excited about the promise of acquisitions and the company's ability to build on top of those investments. Even when the company was providing customer level granularity, the customer count number was showing softness, like the bookings data. The poor performance of previous acquisitions like Albumprinter due to retail partnerships was not deterring the Bulls either.But the problems keep cropping upLate last week, the company disappointed again on the profitability front, but rather than shrugging off the issues as somewhat of the mismatch between Street expectations in the absence of any guidance provided by the management and investor focus on short-term results, investors might be well-served by treating the results as another wake-up call.Source: Cimpress ResultsThe stock reaction suggests the market is just starting to recognize the top-line growth falling off compared to trend and expectations, and how big the challenge of delivering a consistent double-digit growth is for this type of business. During the latest quarter, Vistaprint business, which is almost 65% of the consolidated revenue, saw a 4% organic growth headwind due to what the company calls discrete items like the loss of partner relationships, shipping price reductions and flooding at a facility. The Upload & Print business also slowed down due to the addition of slower growing acquisitions while the All Other Business segment suffered due to the loss of revenues from a partner. One can have different opinions about whether the current problems are temporary or not, but all will agree that the comeback plan towards double-digit growth from here looks hazy, at best.Source: CimpressThe developments on the profitability front look equally dismal. As the chart above shows, adjusted NOPAT on an organic basis deteriorated for all the businesses. Profitability for Vistaprint deteriorated due to shipping price reductions and advertising spend increases, Upload & Print business suffered from increased investments in group oversight, technology and marketing, most of which is expected to continue during the current fiscal 2017, and All Other Business segment faced pressure from reduced profits of a partner and increased investments in Corporate Solutions.Even the argument that the business can continue to roll up and consolidate the space while creating long-term value for the shareholders seems ready for a closer scrutiny. After all, ROIC is coming down, adjusted EBITDA for the latest quarter was the lowest in the last two years, and FCF/sales have declined from 37% to 30% over two years, while the debt has increased sequentially."
3971117,101689,2016-05-05T09:36:20-04:00,"Cimpress has narrow, but expanding moat.New opportunities in the ""upload and print"" market could radically grow the business.Management has evidenced a talent for optimization and capital allocation.","Price at Publication: $87.7152wk high: $99.9552wk low: $63.15EPS: $(-1.06)Div Rate: N/AYield: N/AMarket Cap: $2.81bVolume: 59,286Cimpress N.V. (NASDAQ:CMPR) provides online customized marketing products and services. It offers business cards, brochures, holiday cards, calendars, direct mail services, promotional gifts, signage, website design and hosting services, and email marketing services. Cimpress's largest business is Vistaprint, which currently accounts for roughly 70% of the company's sales. The company by no means confines itself to those services and views itself as a classic Clayton Christensen-style disruptive innovator in the mass customization space.Intrigued by the ownership interests of Brave Warrior and Arlington Value, I began researching Cimpress in early 2015 and started accumulating a position in August following the company's precipitous drop in price. The more I research the company, the more I'm confident that Cimpress's powerful competitive advantages, attractive underlying economics, and long runway will produce significant returns and shareholder value.Here's why.Widening MoatIt is clear, at the time of this writing, that Cimpress has developed a narrow, but widening supply-side economic moat. The theory behind supply-side economies of scale is that the most efficient level of production in an industry is at the point in which the average total costs are at a minimum. The company's original fundamental insight was to leverage technology to bridge the large disparity in price between large print orders and small ones, which it viewed as an arbitrage opportunity (specifically, business cards). It accomplished this by allowing the customer to design their own products using company-designed templates and then aggregating customer orders in large print orders. This allowed the company to serve customers that had never been served by traditional print industries, who traditionally made their own print material.Over time, the company began to refine its core competencies of software development, print expertise, and direct marketing while expanding its product mix up the value chain. Cimpress and others have already devastated the traditional brick-and-mortar print industry with headcounts declining precipitously over the last decade because their cost structure is simply too high and the vast majority of operators will no longer be competitive if they are unable to adapt to the changing environment.Despite Cimpress's continued success, the print industry market remains highly fragmented, and the company has not required massive market share to attain this level of efficiency (less than 5 percent). The company's traditional model, therefore, continues to have a long runway, and the virtuous cycle of growth and optimization should remain intact for at least the next several years, though growth at Vistaprint has moderated and will moderate over the coming years.Brand IdentityMoving forward, the company is determined to not rest on its laurels. CMPR frequently cites Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a source of inspiration. One of the insights it's gleaned from Jeff Bezos and Amazon was the importance of brand loyalty and trust in any e-commerce transaction. Over the last several years, Cimpress has invested significant resources to improve its brand loyalty and customer experience. Initially, the old Vistaprint relied heavily on promotional discounting and its direct marketing efforts to bring in new business. More recently, the company has begun to take steps to improve the lifetime Net Present Value of individual customers and, consequently, has focused like a laser on improving its customers' repeat purchase rate and order values. These investments now appear to be bearing fruit. Cimpress is starting to capture more of its customers' mindshare. This is evidenced by the key metrics improving across the board; particularly customer loyalty, average order value, and net promoter score have all meaningfully improved.New Opportunity: Upload and PrintTaking another page out of Amazon's playbook, in August, the management spelled out its plan to create a Mass Customization Platform built upon its network of businesses and third-party affiliates. Should the company succeed, it will radically transform the business. Management has recently ramped up investments in the platform space, acquiring a number of companies.So far, the company's success has almost entirely been comprised of what's called ""designing/yourself online"" market, which is only a small fraction of the overall print business. The core of the print business is comprised of customers and businesses that have already created their content and need a printer to manufacture it. This market caters to the more lucrative, higher-expectation customers. Traditionally, this process involved a customer sending a file for manufacturing, followed by a back and forth proofing process, where printers would perform a pre-press, go through a proofing cycle, and provide an estimate. Cimpress has identified this process as highly inefficient and believes the process can be significantly improved. Cimpress calls this opportunity the ""upload and print"" market.Jennifer Matt, managing editor of WhatTheyThink's Print Software, describes it as such:The goal is to leverage Cimpress's strengths to create an unmatched value proposition serving the print marketing needs of small businesses worldwide. The company is essentially offering a truce to printers who have erstwhile been made vulnerable by Cimpress's disruptive position in the market. It is asking printers to work with it on its platform and become ""lean, creative, demand generators"". It is now offering printers the opportunity to simply ""plug it into its platform"" and almost instantaneously build a global business without having to make a single capital investment.Thus, the Cimpress strategy to expose a lot more demand to a common operation and technological back end. It analogizes this process to how Volkswagen (VLKAY) uses the same production facilities and supply chain to produce many different brands like Audi, Porsche, SEAT, Skoda. Should the company succeed, it would create a far deeper and broader economies of scale, enhancing its scale and cost advantages and further entrenching it as the dominant player in the industry.Owner-Oriented ManagementCimpress possess several other qualities often discussed in value investing circles, but seldom seen in real life. Success did not come easy in the early days of Vistaprint. The company flirted with bankruptcy for nearly five years (despite regular infusions of venture capital). Following the dotcom crash, the company was forced to lay off 70% of its staff and has since developed a resolve to maintain a lean, entrepreneurial culture. Readers of the excellent book, ""The Outsiders"" by William Thorndike, will see many parallels to Tom Murphy and John Malone.Founder and CEO Robert Keane and his team operate as legitimate owners and long-term thinkers focused on reinvesting capital to expand the moat and grow the per-share intrinsic value. The company evidences what Tom Russo has termed ""capacity to suffer."" The importance of this cannot be understated. Cimpress simply does not sacrifice its long-term opportunities to appease analysts, which is critical in this fast-developing landscape. It does not appear to ""manage"" earnings and has even ceased providing guidance that does not reflect its internal dialogue. Because Mr. Keane's position at CMPR is safe, he does not fear market volatility like other publicly-traded companies, and the company has used such swings as opportunities to purchase stock. The company has compiled a very respectable record of capital allocation, usually providing a transparent window into allocation decisions. It has repurchased shares only when the company believed that they are selling at a discount to intrinsic value, and it usually does not overpay for acquisitions (and usually admit it when it's made a mistake).Recently, the company's proposed compensation plan further reflects its genuine long-term orientation. The performance measure is the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the three-year moving average of the stock price six to 10 years after a grant. Moreover, the number of shares issued upon the satisfaction of both service-based vesting and performance criteria is variable in function of that 3YMA CAGR. These kinds of compensation policies further ensure alignment between management and shareholders, particularly in a culture as entrepreneurial as Cimpress's.ValuationA traditional DCF does not paint a full picture of what is occurring at Cimpress. The company appears to require little maintenance CAPEX evidenced by the very low depreciation and amortization charges (though the precise number is difficult to estimate). Cimpress has nonetheless invested heavily in growth. Impressively, despite very aggressive spending, Cimpress still sports healthy margins and attractive returns on capital that still likely drastically understate the owner earnings.Currently, Wall Street estimates the company is worth approximately $100, however, the secular growth rate in e-commerce is over 11 %. Even assuming that the Cimpress grows at the industry average, an 11% growth rate implies revenues of approximately $2,320,000,000 by 2019.Assuming no operating leverage and no reduction in CAPEX, that would yield over $200 million a year in free cash flow by 2019. A doubling of current levels. More likely, operating leverage will mean that Cimpress's operating costs increase at a lower rate, say a CAGR of roughly 6%. This implies an after-tax free cash flow of roughly $525 million or $16 FCF per share by 2019, again assuming no reduction in CAPEX and no reduction in share count. This implies a reasonable FV of $160-192.ConclusionIn conclusion, Cimpress is a growing, dominant, and durable business run by an extraordinary smart owner-oriented management which is opportunistic and focused on growing intrinsic value per share. It remains to be seen how far the company can take its ambitious agenda, but it appears very likely that in any event the company will continue to gradually expand its moat, long-term shareholders will be rewarded for it. This is not a company that comes around very often."
3712906,52382,2015-11-26T08:07:00-05:00,"Acquisitions have helped growth, but headwinds getting stronger.Operationally weak and risks from margin compression and weak cash flows rising.Risk to stock from trading multiple compression and declining earnings estimates.","Cimpress N.V. (NASDAQ:CMPR) is up more than 30% over the past year to trade near a decade high. The well-known online business card printing business, formerly Vistaprint, is flying high as a topline growth and an earnings expansion story. The business is being presented as this huge value creator, which the senior management presents as a strict focus on 'intrinsic value', while proudly prodding investors to focus on share buybacks and acquisitions, and discouraging any attempt to focus on the customer-level granularity, but this thesis seems somewhat of a misnomer in light of the fast-changing fundamentals.Source: Cimpress Analyst DayThe street is in no mood to dwell on either the past controversies, involving aggressive affiliates, partners charging credit cards without the customers' knowledge (well cited on Wiki) or the revenue recognition policies, or the rich valuation, with the stock trading around 20-25 times next year's earnings and 15-20 times EV/expected EBITDA, which may be incomparable with any other old school businesses, including printing. Looking at the indifference shown towards the rising wall of issues related to the strategic and competitive positioning of the business suggests that the market is keen to stay focused on the numbers.As for numbers, the story so far, at least for the bull-side thesis, has been that of a consistent single-digit growth on an organic basis, the recent focus towards a mass customization model that may allow a significantly larger market than business card printing, an aggressive expansion via acquisitions and a consistent reduction in the share count. All of which is leading to decent earnings growth.But this earnings expansion involves very high risk for the public shareholders, seems to be hitting a dead end now and the impact on the stock may be significant amid high expectations. With the Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) deal ending this year (own admission), the acquisition of PNI Digital Media by Staples last year and the contribution from new Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) business deal still immaterial, the headwinds are just starting to pick up pace. The quality of numbers is getting poor, be it the weakening balance sheet, rising debt or the eroding shareholders' equity, all of which when a new CFO is just taking over the reins. The acquisitions done over the past few years, e.g. Albumprinter, have also started to lose steam.Although the behavioral changes that pose risk to the overall business card industry have been well covered, the other challenges from digitalization, with more than 95% of the revenue for the company coming from physical printed products and the rest from digital products & services, are only rising.The excitement ignoring the red flags is worrisomeWhen any company spends $75-80 million on capital expenditure and almost $200 million on technology and development expenses to drive less than $200 million of additional revenue, as in the case of Cimpress, one can only wonder not just about the quality of both of those spends, but also the sustainability of revenue growth.Source: Earnings presentation CimpressIt is easy to get excited about the headline growth numbers, but without acquisitions, growth is hardly impressive, especially when one digs deeper into the amount of investment going into the business to drive this flat - low single-digit type of growth rate or high single digit on a constant-currency basis.Going forward, the company is expected to lose the prestigious Staples business this year, while the new Amazon deal is not having any material impact on the finances and expecting anything other than that may be a mistake, since the relationship is limited to just one product, i.e. business cards, right now.Sequentially, VBU business, the largest, is already showing weakness with declining revenues and since the growth in Upload and Print business was due to the inclusion of Pixartprinting and Printi businesses, the growth rate may start reflecting the same. The number of customers had been already weak, even before the company stopped providing the same, along with the bookings data. On the acquisition front too, not just the availability of potential targets is getting tighter, but the acquisitions done earlier, like Albumprinter, are already flailing due to retail partnerships.Margin pressure + tight cash flow + high debt = dead endFrom a timing standpoint, to understand why this acquisition-driven growth story may stop now, one just needs to see what was financially driving it in the first place, i.e. financial leverage.From a margin standpoint, there is hardly any operating leverage visible in the model, except the benefits derived from sales and marketing expenses in the recent times.Even looking at the segment results, there is not just a recent deceleration, but also the allocation of corporate and global functions expense, which are growing consistently, to the segments may put further pressure on the operating margins of individual segments. Another thing that may put pressure is a relatively high growth and low margins of the Upload and Print business.Part of this margin pressure is due to deteriorating productivity metrics.Cash flowsOn the first impression, the cash flows may look fine, except maybe the current fiscal year, which one can say is just beginning.Bulls may even believe since management tends to vouch for the DCF model and intrinsic value of each investment, that this is just a case of an aggressive investment stance, but if one looks closer, the picture turns ugly with the acquisitions.DebtThis 'aggression' is clearly deteriorating the financial health of the business, as the sheet below shows, and the same may hinder the next time the company tries to use the stock as a currency for its acquisition.Not just the book value, but rising interest expense may soon start raising questions about the financial safety net as well, as the sheet below shows.How low is too low?Most low-growth businesses that have single-digit operating margins and weak balance sheets are trading near 6-8 times EBITDA and there are hardly any convincing reasons that Cimpress should get any premium over those names.But even if we ignore the risk from the trading multiple compression, looking at the Street estimates up close, the optimism is not difficult to see. Indeed, the operating margin in the most-recent quarter works out to be close to 5%, even excluding the stock-based compensation and a back-of-the-envelope calculation is all you need to check the high risk to earnings from any major revenue or margin swing.Note: Detailed proprietary model is not attached in this note for the sake of easy readability, but happy to help and provide more details to readers interested in understanding the calculations used in this note."

Cimpress's low cost, flexible scale, deep-pocketed marketing budget, and economies of scale will all contribute to its rapid ascent in dominating its competitors. The company continues to reinvest back into the business, which is currently clouding the potential profitability of the business. I believe that once these investments are scaled back, investors would surely realize how profitable CMPR could be. Management recently estimated in its 2015 shareholder letter that the steady-state free cash flow ranges from $210 million to $385 million. The goal of the management going forward is to also more precisely indicate to investors what they believe the steady-state cash flow to be.Investors betting on CMPR are making an implicit bet that the company's strategy of utilizing a brick-and-mortar-less internet-based print and design business model would win in the long run. The odds are favored in the investors' favor through the moat CMPR has already built through years of relentless marketing campaigns and aggressive promotions. The odds are further in investors' favor via management's high ownership interest in the company and the shareholder-friendly capital allocation plans.I believe that if the management can execute on reasonably conservative assumptions, CMPR could be worth $150 per share by 2019.What is the market missing?It is always important to ask just what the market is missing in this investment thesis.CMPR's profitability has been volatile:Free cash flow has fluctuated tremendously over the last 5 years, leaving investors wondering about the reason for the volatility in results. CMPR has continuously reinvested back into the company through acquisitions.Looking at the results comparison for 2009-2011 versus 2012-2015, CMPR has made ~$660 million in acquisitions versus ~$6 million.The market continues to feel a bit wary with that kind of capital investment, but the company has taken the opportunity in the meantime to repurchase shares (~$415 million worth). All of the repurchases were done through free cash flow, but the additional M&A was done through debt financing. The markets are quite wary now given the disastrous results at Platform Specialty Products (NYSE:PAH) and Valeant (VRX), which saw both of these roll-ups use substantial amount of debt to pursue M&A opportunities. Debt-financed acquisitions could work out marvelously, but when they go haywire, all hell breaks loose.Shrinking TAM:The market believes CMPR is just a melting ice cube, an internet-based print and design company. The prevailing view is that TAM is decreasing, and so will CMPR. At first glance, it's not hard to argue with the rapid ascent of smartphones. Who gives out business cards anymore?On the contrary, ecommerce print shipment forecast has grown at a CAGR of 11.3% at the expense of physical print service providers.As of Q2 2016, CMPR derived approximately 44% of revenue from the U.S. FY 2016 estimates for revenue should come in at ~$1.6 billion. This still shows the company as relatively small compared to the total ecommerce print market, with a market share of 5.38%. There are still a lot more room left in terms of growing the business.The increase in market share for CMPR in the future will come from a combination of taking additional market share away from competitors and physical print shops.Business AnalysisCMPR's business is easy and straightforward to understand. Unlike traditional physical print and design shops, it allows users to go online, design their own cards, and have it shipped right to their home or office. The value proposition is that company can offer users the cheapest pricing because of its scale and lack of physical presence, which cuts down costs. The advantage of CMPR is that as it scales, the economics of each additional print product it delivers reduces the overall cost structure of the firm. The company builds out big printing presses in different countries, receives the orders online, and proceeds to execute on the orders. The more orders it receives, the marginal cost of each product decreases and the profitability scales up.As you can see here in this chart, COGS increased as a percentage of revenue due to acquisitions that had higher COGS but lower marketing and selling expenses.Vistaprint, which is the bulk of CMPR's business, increased revenue by about ~$50 million from 2015 to 2014, while COGS only increased ~$4 million.Revenue growth for the company has come in strong, growing at 9% on a constant currency basis. With the strengthening of the US dollar, CMPR was adversely affected. If looking at it on a constant currency basis, Vistaprint would've grown revenue at ~$102 million versus the COGS increase of ~$4 million. This is true economies of scale.Much of CMPR's growth has come from the other business units. Organic growth in these units clocked in at 16%, while acquisitions boosted revenue by ~$153 million. The other business units have not lived up to their fair share of the bargain yet, as Vistaprint still accounts for 84.19% of the company's net operating profit.Due to Vistaprint still growing its economic moat, marketing and selling expenses have increased by $49.4 million, with payroll increasing at $13.9 million. Vistaprint continues to invest in its marketing budget in the U.S. and the U.K. and its other acquired operations.I believe much of the costs going into CMPR's business at the moment is to help strengthening the brand offering and the economic moat surrounding its business. The company can afford to shell out a higher total dollar amount on its marketing budget, thanks to the economies of scale it's gaining on the operational side. This is a reinvestment back into the business that most of its competitors aren't capable of doing. Due to this increased expense, a lot of volatility has created whippy earnings, which has caused investors to be skittish. I believe over time all of this will abate, and CMPR's true operating margin will reveal itself.I believe CMPR's long-run free cash flow margin to be ~20%. The company will need to continuously invest in its business to maintain and build the economic moat, but I believe it has taken a long-term stance on capital investments and will reap rewards in the long run.ValuationCMPR currently trades at 16x P/FCF. I believe that in 2019, the company could earn $15 free cash flow per share. If I apply a 10x FCF multiple on it, CMPR would be worth $150 per share.Here's how I get to $15 FCF per share.EPS in this case has correlated very closely to free cash flow, given the very little depreciation and amortization charges. Excluding any major acquisitions and the very low maintenance capex to run the business, EPS here serves as a good proxy for FCF per share.I assume that Vistaprint continues to growth at 8% CAGR into 2019 on a constant currency basis. As the company continues to execute on its strategy, economies of scale demonstrates itself, with COGS and marketing and selling expenses staying relatively flat.For the other businesses, I assume a similar growth trajectory in both revenue and COGS, as the other businesses' scale advantages probably won't be achieved in full.CMPR has guided for 20% cash taxes.I also assume the company will continue to reduce share count at 5% per year, using mostly free cash flow to fund it.RisksLumpy earnings will continue due to expansion of the different business lines.My projection above is to give a glance at what the business's normalized non-acquisition pro forma could look like due to scale advantages and economies of scale kicking in. CMPR will likely continue to reinvest back into the business, causing lumpy earnings and free cash flow. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of big acquisitions, it's impossible to model out exactly how earnings would look like down the road. This gives Wall Street uncertainty, which usually reduces the multiples paid.Another note is that the 2nd quarter of a fiscal year, ending December 31st, presents a bulk of the operating income. Historically, it has represented 62% of 2015's, 61% of 2014's, and 72% of 2013's operating income. The reason for this seasonality of due to the major holiday shopping season and sales for consumer-oriented products, such as holiday cards, calendars, photo books, and personalized gifts.Major acquisition failure.CMPR has grown substantially since 2012, and it spent a bulk of its capital in acquisitions. Any failed acquisitions could impair the company's value.Not completely immune to future competition.CMPR needs to continuously invest in its businesses to grow its economic moat. Because of its current scale advantage over small competitors, the virtuous cycle of having additional marketing dollars to spend will increase its presence and mind share amongst consumers. This should lead to a sustainable economic moat. However, if a big competitor wanted into the space and invested heavily into marketing, CMPR's moat isn't immune to future competition.ConclusionCMPR is a Buy given the business's economies of scale, economic moat, and competitive advantage over other competitors. As the company continues to execute on its game plan, Vistaprint's margins will increase manifesting itself into more dollars to invest back into the business to build its economic moat. This virtuous cycle will allow CMPR to further increase market share from physical print shops and solidify itself as the ecommerce print shipment market leader. I believe that using conservative estimates, CMPR can earn $15 free cash flow per share in 2019. My price target is $150.Source for the images above:Cimpress PresentationExcel file"

Investors should patiently wait as Cimpress drives forward with its growth plans.","IntroductionCimpress N.V. (NASDAQ: CMPR) recently announced its first-quarter earnings for the fiscal year 2016. Shareholders expect to see that the company is poised to create value for them and needless to say, the management team did project their long-term outlook with that exact goal in mind. While shares dipped slightly after the report, it has largely recovered and hopefully, it will continue to its upward trajectory over the long-term.Let's take a look at how the business agree during the quarter and what shareholders can expect going forward.Business OverviewHere is a quick review of the numbers for the quarter.Revenue for the quarter fell slightly short of expectations for $376.9 million while adjusted net income of $0.49 per share surpassed expectations for $0.47 per share. The one key factor that held back the company's growth was, as usual, foreign exchange headwinds. Revenue would have rose by as much as 21% on a constant-currency basis. Revenue grew by a modest 11% year-over-year after accounting for foreign exchange headwinds and other acquisitions.Cash flow from operations was cut in half from Q1 2014 as it came in at $25.7 million, which is down from $52.6 million. The sore spot is aggravated further when the business generate a negative free cash flow of $1.9 million compared to positive free cash flow of $32.3 million in the same year-ago period. One thing to note here is that the company has invested heavily in multiple areas such as Cimpress' mass customization platform, product expansion, acquisition integration, Vistaprint business unit advertising and supporting the fast-growing ""Most of World"" business segment. Hence, while net income and fee cash flow came in negative, it wasn't become the company's business plans were failing; it reinvested to laid down the path for future growth.Sales from the Vistaprint business-unit increased by 2% to $265.2 million but rose by 8% after accounting for foreign exchange headwinds. Sales from the company's upload and print business-unit soared by a whopping 98% to $76.5 million (118% at constant currency) while revenue from ""Other"" business-unit dipped by only 3% to $34 million (13% increase at constant currency).Now, let's take a look at where the business is heading and what the growth opportunities are.Looking ForwardThe management seemed to be pleased with how the first quarter of its fiscal year has turned out. The business has seen improvements in retention trends in the Vistaprint business unit and the performance of the recently acquired businesses.As the company rolls out palms to optimize intrinsic value per share, it chose to no longer provide specific rev eh and earnings guidance. Instead, they will offer updates on the company's general view of potential organic growth rates. While this may seem to raise a few eyebrows, I think the management is capable of increasing shareholder value over the long-term. One key component for investors to track would be the way the company allocates its capital. As mentioned earlier, the company deliberately incurred losses during the quarter as it is reinvesting into other components of the business. Going forward, investors would need to see that those segments are growing at a pace which will enable the company to recoup its initial capital outlay. I think that the company made a risky move to incur a loss to ensure that future growth is laid out. For now, there are no changes to Cimpress' overall outlook. But it did offer select updates on its aforementioned business units.Firstly, the Vistaprint segment is expected to grow at a single-digit constant-currency rate in the short-term with the potential to accelerate above 10%. Secondly, the upload and print segment should be able to see double-digit constant-currency growth which will very likely outpace Vistaprint's growth. Finally, business from the other segments is on track to meet its single-digit constant-currency expectations after the company shuts down its revenue streams from Albumprinter and Corporate Solutions. Over time, as Most of World gains scale, the ""other"" line could accelerate to double-digit growth.Once again, investors are reminded that the company are not putting any timeline in place to measure whether these goals are achieved. This could be quite alarming as it seems that the management is trying to slip out from having to answer tough questions about growth and the future prospects of the company. Another way to look at it is that investors are now forced to focus on the long-term outlook rather than a 90-day period. After all, a business isn't build or destroy over a 90-day time frame. For investors who have the conviction that Cimpress will continue to deliver growth, hang on to that thesis and wait patiently."
4153125,21815,2018-03-05T04:19:18-05:00,"Cimpress is managing to extract value for shareholders in what's normally a fairly low growth business.It does this through an acquisition strategy that buys cheap and extracts value, resulting in large cash flows.These are used to bring back leverage quickly and buying back shares, the number of which is on a considerable downward path.This is a well-managed company, in our view.","Cimpress NV (CMPR) is a company with several semi-independently run divisions (like Vistaprint, Upload and Print and National Pen), mostly in the printing business. Some of these divisions (like Upload and Print) consist of a number of businesses.This restructuring is also saving cost as it has removed a lot of vertical chimney, creating a more holistic, entrepreneurial company in which each business manager has a cross-functional team directly reporting to them.It's a well-managed company that extracts value from a smart acquisition strategy, focusing on public and private companies with lower multiples. It has decentralized the organization in the past year to give these businesses more freedom and improve the internal visibility of the financial performance.Here are the two most important metrics for the quarterAnd profitability has also been increasing:However, much of this is due to the acquisition of National Pen (although this is partly offset by the divestiture of Albumprinter). The combined effect of this produced an additional $11.8M in operating profits.On top of that, about $10M of production inefficiencies that occurred in Q2 2017 were eliminated, further improving results. Restructuring charges increased by $10.4M but these were more than offset by restructuring savings of about $16M.Vistaprint is benefiting from restructuring and new products and services, although the latter will take time to scale up to a cash generating business and might pressure current period profitability. Management expects increased customer loyalty and attracting higher-value customers as a result.The Vistaprint restructuring is complete, producing a headcount reduction of approximately 180 positions and a related restructuring charge of $11.5M in Q2 2018 (50% of which have already been paid out on a cash basis). No further charges are expected.Management does expect a fiscal year 2018 reduction in operating expenses in the order of $20M-$22M, or $8M-$10M net of restructuring charges. Management believes it improves the steady-state cash generation materially, even if some of the savings are reinvested in the business.The January 2017 decision to decentralize the company is having positive effects not only on Vistaprint, but also its other segment Upload and Print (which is a collection of 8 businesses). From the letter to investors:The recently acquired and highly seasonal National Pen business is also performing pretty well with pro-forma revenues up 28% for the quarter but that's a bit of an outlier due to favorable comps.Management expects high single-digit constant currency revenue growth for fiscal year 2018 for National Penn and sees cross selling opportunities and integration benefits with the rest of the company. Management has also pulled marketing campaigns, which didn't provide sufficient ROI and reworked these.High-single digits are nevertheless an upgrade in the guidance, which used to be low-to-mid single digits, and quite an achievement as Q1 (pro forma, as it wasn't yet part of the company) growth here was minus 7%.There was a decent recovery in gross margins in Q2 from restructuring (decentralization and eliminating inefficiencies at Vistaprint), while acquiring National Pen was conducive to higher margins as well. On the other hand, with Upload and Print becoming bigger that's a minor headwind for margins, as they tend to have lower ones.However, there is more to come in the third quarter. When asked about the effects of the restructuring, this is what management had to say (from the Q2CC):On a cash flow basis, the restructuring was neutral but that's including the one-off restructuring charges of $7M. The company has already achieved $5M of savings (y/y) from Vistaprint only and there is about $15M-$17M left in savings to be achieved for the full fiscal year.The company generates a considerable degree of cash flow:Operating cash flow was $160.4M (up from $105.1M a year ago) and free cash flow was $132.7M (up from $77.3M a year ago). From the Investment Letter (Pdf):One should also appreciate further underlying improvements (Q3CC):This is actually an analyst talking, but management argued the math is correct. Here is management a little later:One of the things the company does with the cash flow is reducing debt:Leverage has been substantially reduced to below 3, which was their target for the whole fiscal year, so they have achieved this early (Q2CC):But cash flow generation is such that apart from reducing leverage, the company is also buying back a significant amount of shares, $50M in Q2 and already another $40M since the end of Q2.And as you can see, they have been doing this for years with the result of a steady decline in the number of outstanding shares.These figures are backward=looking. Analysts expect quite an EPS jump from $2.1 in fiscal year 2018 to $3.41 in fiscal year 2019. Despite the 62% EPS growth, all analyst are putting the shares as a hold.This is probably the result of the significant appreciation of the share price already:As you can see, the Q2 figures were very well received, as they should be.Cimpress is a very well-managed business. In a fairly low growth part of the economy, management has nevertheless found an elixir to thrive. One part is their roll-up acquisition strategy where they buy cheap and extract value, resulting in large cash flows with which they can rapidly bring back leverage and buy back shares.The other is the sensible organizational reforms, which give their businesses entrepreneurial freedoms.While we do think that at present the shares are fairly fully valued, we think there is much to be admired in the company and shareholders will do well picking up some shares on dips."

VPRT is in an out of favor industry that is frequently threatened by the development of digital replacements, yet these never seem to take over the place of the classic business card2. VPRT is run by a highly motivated owner operator in Keane, who also looks to be a skilled capital allocator. Over the past nine years he managed to average a 20% annual return on equity at Vistaprint. He also owns 10.2% of the shares meaning his interests are well aligned with minority investors. In addition the superstar investor Allan Mecham (nickname: the 400% man) running Arlington Value put 11% of his fund in the company. Glenn Greenberg's Brave Warrior Advisors also has a sizeable allocation to the name, he is even asking questions on the most recent earnings call.3. VPRT has the scale advantage over its competitor. This makes it the lowest cost producer in what is essentially a commodity business.4. When reviewing various scenarios for future growth by relying on a range of DCF calculations the stock is clearly attractively valued.5. When considering International, there is a lot of room for the company to grow. The business card is an international phenomenon and I frequently encounter Vistaprint products when I meet other small business owners and collect a few business cards.6. Because of its economies of scale the company enjoys margins that are far better than those of its competitors. The company can leverage this advantage either to increase market share and further cement its advantage or sit back and enjoy fat profits.7. So far management leans towards building out the competitive advantages it has and establishing a presence in International markets to repeat the same feat it has pulled in the U.S. If and when it decides to take the foot of the pedal because investments no longer show the same ROI profile for example, FCF could improve by a significant amount.In 2012, management switched from the discount model designed to grab market share and build scale, think Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to an increased focus on LTV (Life Time Value) of customers. Churn under customers is quite high although this can in part be explained by the often short lived existence of businesses under 10 people. After the strategy change an increase in retained customers is visible.Over the past year the company grew active unique customers by 8% but also acquired 8% less new customers compared to the year prior. Overall this resulted in 2% less customers but increased revenue because spend by retained customers is 2x that of new customers.The strategy change also hurt margins and slowed total customers growth. This came as a shock to the growth/momentum investor community and they abandoned the stock.Meanwhile value investors haven't become particularly interested yet. At a cursory examination Vistaprint is not cheap enough. Many a value investor would balk at the 1.4x sales or 40 times earnings numbers it trades at. However, the company is, recent strategy change nonetheless, growing at a rather rapid pace both organically and by acquisitions.With its highly motivated owner operator its likely to continue to push to build out its strong competitive advantage it holds over its competitors in the fragmented market of printed marketing materials for small businesses. Meanwhile I'd say that the company benefits from a secular tailwind with countries within the European Union moving towards reform of the labour market propelling the number of companies with fewer than 10 employees (the company's target market) upwards.The company achieved tremendous growth straight through the crisis on revenue, EPS, net income and FCF. As the low cost producer in the industry the company holds all the cards. Management can opt to continue to grow at the expense of competitors, by heavily investing in marketing and keeping prices cutting edge, or chose to forgo growth but enjoy profit margins that its smaller competitors can only dream of and return money to shareholders by the barrel. Vistaprint has its competitors by the balls.Ernst J. Teunissen (NASDAQ:CFO) expects the core Vistaprint business to grow at the mid to high-single digit in revenue next year. However, the company made several acquisitions that are growing much faster (in the 20% - 30% range) and will provide the nitro for the Vistaprint engine. The acquisitions are expected to depress earnings over the next 12 months with $5 million in integration costs but should fall off afterwards.Let's take a look at the cold hard numbers:First I calculated a normalized FCF per share based on historic values and relying on guidance by management on 2015 numbers. Then I presented five DCF calculations based on different growth rates going forward. I selected these growth rates by taking into consideration the company's historical (10 year) EPS growth rate (45% annualized), the slowdown in its growth rate, the law of diminishing returns and the fact that the company has a solid competitive advantage. If you give each of these scenarios an equal weighting the stock is currently 18% undervalued.Risk:1. Like any investment, it comes accompanied by risks. The most important threat remains technological innovations changing customer habits and causing a decline in VPRT's business. Especially the business card's seem susceptible to this risk (about 30% of the company's business)Print marketing is a declining industry and I don't see that turning. Perhaps it's precisely in that environment a company like Vistaprint can thrive by putting its competitors out of business and rapidly acquiring a large share of the market that is left. This can still be highly profitable, think tobacco or coffee.Sources: Morningstar Data, Latest 10-K and SA Earnings Call Transcripts and the Proxy statement."

For more information on these managers, visit our Schedule of Manager Reviews for an up-to-date list of the managers we have assessed so far.I. IntroductionThis is part of a series of quarterly reviews that analyze the performance and portfolio characteristics of interesting equity managers running public (mutual funds) or private pooled investment vehicles (hedge funds) that are not accessible by mainstream investors. Our aim is to provide readers:All analysis is based on a clone portfolio of the manager's top 10 disclosed holdings, which allows readers to replicate the portfolio with ease if desired. It may not be an accurate reflection of the manager's actual investment performance.That said, it is possible for some clone portfolios to outperform the manager's actual portfolio over time due to the following factors:II. Manager BriefA relatively unknown investor, Allan Mecham has caught the attention of Wall Street in recent years with his stellar long-term returns. Since inception in 1999, his fund has compounded capital at 22% annually for the 15 year period ending in 2014, outpacing the S&P 500 which returned 4%.Mecham is a Buffett disciple. He looks for franchise businesses, and researches them thoroughly. He maintains a list of these companies, and then waits for an opportunity to invest in them. His portfolio is concentrated with low levels of turnover. For more information on his background and approach, see the following articles:Increased publicity for Mecham in recent years also saw its assets balloon in size. Its AUM has quadrupled from $192m in 2012 to $796m in 2015. The firm's assets under management was sub-$100m for much of the past 10 years when it delivered strong returns.III. Performance AnalysisOur clone portfolio returned an annualized +12.1% over the past 3 years, versus +15.1% for the S&P 500. In 2013 and 2014, the returns were well below the figures reported in the public domain. The discrepancy was most likely due to position sizing differences, as our analysis equal-weights all positions which neutralizes this effect.IV. Holdings AnalysisPortfolio CharacteristicsThis is a mid-cap portfolio with a mixture of growth and value names, although overall, the portfolio has a lower P/E and P/B ratio relative to the S&P 500. Some of the names are particularly far down the market cap spectrum, such as Outerwall (NASDAQ:OUTR) and The Chef's Warehouse (NASDAQ:CHEF), both of which have market caps of about $500m.Individual NamesOf the current top 10 holdings, 8 have been in the portfolio over the past year. This is how they have performed:2015 was a mix bag for the portfolio's investments. The biggest decliners were Outerwall and Now Inc (NYSE:DNOW).Recent ActivityThe manager increased its stakes in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) and Leucadia National Co (NYSE:LUK-OLD) during the fourth quarter, as these names declined. Of note, Berkshire Hathaway underperformed the S&P 500 by -13.45% in 2015, the widest since 2008.V. Focus Holdings: Cimpress NV (CMPR)CMPR has featured in Arlington's portfolio as a top holding for a number of years. Its share price has performed well, although it is very volatile. This is an internet-based printing company that focuses on mass customization. It appears to occupy a dominant position in a niche market based on its scale and proprietary process:The company has increased its revenues very consistently for an extended period of time:However, margins are volatile with decreasing ROIC and increasing leverage:In a major move designed to focus on long-term shareholder value, CMPR decided in 2015 not to publish specific forward guidance and instead offer annual updates on the company's ""general view of potential organic growth rates,"" ""how we think about value creation,"" and discretionary growth spending plans for each upcoming fiscal year. It also embarked on a plan to deploy significant capital and resources across a broad group of long-term investments that it believes will help it further its long-term growth objective.In a letter to investors, Cimpress CEO Robert Keane elaborated on his ultimate financial objective of maximizing intrinsic value per share:This change in reporting caused a stir and sent its shares diving, before recovering sharply in 2016. For the full letter, please see here.For now, CMPR's valuations does not appear to be attractive judging by traditional valuation metrics:VI. Summary ThoughtsWe Liked:We Didn't Like:Bottom Line:This is an interesting manager running a differentiated portfolio. However, the last few years appears to be a transitory phase for the manager with significant capital inflows and increased public interest. History tells us that investors usually jump onto the bandwagon at the wrong time. We will wait and see how Arlington fares in the coming quarters.Disclaimer: Returns represent a hypothetical 10 holding, equally-weighted clone portfolio calculated by FundGuru using public filings made with the SEC by the investment manager.

2131153,24361,2014-04-09T10:48:52-04:00,"Vistaprint's decision to focus on less price-sensitive customers is improving margins, but at the cost of volume and new customers.Vistaprint continues to build an attractive printing-based business, but its other offerings and efforts seem more haphazard and less competitive.Sentiment can swing widely on these shares, making it attractive to traders but more problematic for investors.","Bullish sell-side analysts have long pushed Vistaprint N.V. (VPRT) as a way to play growth in small businesses and the advantages of online/web-based disintermediation in bringing more sophisticated marketing tools to the SMB sector. It all sounds good (it always has), but Vistaprint seems stuck in this yo-yo business model where sustainable, balanced growth seems elusive.Growth Or Margins, Or How About Both?One of the ongoing challenges for Vistaprint is breaking out of a cycle where order volume depends upon promotions with heavy discounts. The customers who turn to Vistaprint when it runs its deeply discounted promo offers don't tend to stick around or reorder much at higher prices, and they also don't tend to make use of other marketing products or the company's digital services. On the other hand, it's one of the company's best tools for introducing itself and recruiting new customers, so there is a tug-of-war at work here.In recent quarters Vistaprint has pulled back on its discounting and advertising. The results have been fairly predictable - average order values have increased yoy by double digits and margins are much stronger, but volume is declining - down 1% the fiscal first quarter and down 7% in the most recent (fiscal second) quarter. With that, new customer growth has slipped into the red again.My concern here is that eventually the company is going to feel pressure to improve/re-accelerate the revenue growth rate. At that point, there is the real risk of increased promotional spending and discounting driving margins back down again.Will The Real Vistaprint Stand Up?Vistaprint covers a lot of real estate with its offerings, and that's okay - a lot of the services that Vistaprint offers have relatively low fixed costs, so it doesn't hurt the company to offer them. On the other hand, I'm not exactly sure there is a clear business plan here, or at least one that corroborates what a lot of analysts and investors seem to think the company is.For instance, Vistaprint recently acquired the Dutch printing company People & Print Group and the Italian web-to-print company Pixartprinting. Both are growing well, but I have some concerns that these acquisitions take Vistaprint further down the road in commercial printing businesses. There could certainly be a worthwhile opportunity in consolidating SMB-focused commercial printing operations both in Europe and the U.S., but I don't see the stock supporting a double-digit EBITDA multiple if that's the direction management goes.Along similar lines, I wonder about the overall strategy of the company. I get a sense of ""do a bit of everything"" here, and I'm not sure the company is positioned to do it particularly well. Some of these operations strike me more as ""Shutterfly (NASDAQ:SFLY), for businesses"" and I don't see barriers to entry much past marketing and promotional spending to establish name recognition with potential clients. Likewise on the web side, where it seems that Vistaprint rubs up against the operations of companies like Go Daddy, Constant Contact (NASDAQ:CTCT), and Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) Demandforce.What it ultimately comes down to for me, then, is this. I worry that the business where Vistaprint is actually pretty good is the printing business - a business where Vistaprint can be a consolidator and where it has technology to differentiate itself (software and processes that allow the company to combine over 100 separate jobs into a single print file/run). I likewise worry that Vistaprint is more of a ""dabbler"" with its other offerings and will ultimately get left behind by more focused rivals like Shutterfly, Constant Contact, and Intuit. With that, I worry that the more investors perceive Vistaprint as a printing company, the worse it will be for the multiple.Where's The European Recovery?If the European economic recovery is actually happening, and many corporate managers have said they see it, it does make Vistaprint's recent performance seem a little shakier. Revenue from Europe was down 2% in constant currency in the fiscal second quarter. The thing to remember here, though, is that Vistaprint is still turning this operation around - senior management relocated to Paris (ostensibly to ""expand"" the European business) and the company has been realigning operations to focus on a smaller number of key countries (making those recent acquisitions a little more curious). If and when Europe's economy clearly is in recovery, it should show up in Vistaprint's results later this year.Growth Opportunities, But Execution Is KeyVistaprint has leaned heavily on acquisitions to help stimulate growth, but there are some valid ongoing doubts about the company's ability to create a model that can drive sustainable growth. Focusing more on clients that are motivated by the value Vistaprint offers instead of cut-rate prices makes sense to a point, but Vistaprint has to show that it can both cross-sell additional services to these more valuable customers and continue to bring new customers in through the door.I'm still willing to model 8% to 9% long-term growth for Vistaprint, as the company does address a very large and under-served market. My base-case model sees the company's FCF margins moving into the low double-digits over the next five years, fueling 18% to 19% FCF growth, but there is that lingering question as to whether management can sustain better margins and revenue growth simultaneously.The Bottom LineDiscounting those cash flows back to present day, I arrive at a discounted fair value of $51.50, which isn't enough to get me all that excited about the stock. I do believe that the shares could generate annual double-digit returns, but the risk side of the equation (they can do it, but will they?) has me on the sidelines.I am also still concerned about perception here - while I acknowledge a lot of profit potential in Vistaprint's addressed market, many analysts create comp groups that include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), and Yelp (NYSE:YELP) when setting a ""fair"" multiple for Vistaprint. With erratic performance and uncertain economic moats, I just can't get all that positive on these shares, though the history here is one of major swings that more active investors could profitably exploit as sentiment swings back and forth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1748742,24361,2013-10-16T13:06:10-04:00,,"If you're a nimble trader, you might like Vistaprint (VPRT). These shares have spent most of the last four years chopping between $30 and $60, as the company's inability to perform on a consistent basis has created sharp sell-offs and subsequent rallies. Now the shares are up again on investor's confidence (or hope) that the company's turnaround/self-improvement efforts will lend stability and consistency to the business, and possibly also on confidence that conditions in Europe have bottomed.I have a hard time sharing this enthusiasm. Although I believe the company has a leveragable edge in its printing operations, I'm not sure that's a dependable long-term growth driver. Likewise, I'm not confident that Vistaprint will emerge as a strong presence in digital marketing for small businesses. Last and not least, serving the small business community is inherently volatile - a large percentage of businesses fail and the constant ""flow"" of new and failing businesses won't help the company establish a lasting market presence.Marketing Won't Ever Go AwayOne of the few eternal truths of business is that marketing is a cornerstone activity. Vistaprint has about 3% share of a market in North America and Europe that its management believes totals about $30 billion a year. For Vistaprint, most of this consists of printed materials like business cards, brochures, stationary, and signage where the company can offer both online graphics design services and low-cost printing.I do believe there are some moat-like characteristics to Vistaprint's printing service business. Through its proprietary software and manufacturing process, the company can combine multiple jobs/orders into a single print run - significantly reducing its costs and allowing it to compete quite effectively with other print service companies.Online competitors will keep the pressure on to keep costs low and a company like FedEx (NYSE:FDX) (currently a partner of Vistaprint) could theoretically become a rival in the future. Frankly, though, I could see print obsolescence as a bigger threat. While the idea of the ""paperless office"" has certainly been oversold, I expect that core products like business cards will ultimately be replaced (at least in part) by mobile apps. That's likely going to be a slow process, but in the near term the bigger challenge for Vistaprint will be in identifying and securing customers that can provide profitable long-term relationships as opposed to just ordering products when incentivized with steep discounts.Can Vistaprint Become A Real Player Online?Digital marketing is another significant part of the long-term story for Vistaprint. Helped in part by the acquisition of Webs, Vistaprint offers a range of website design/hosting and digital (email) marketing services. Thus far, it doesn't appear that these services have really resonated with the target market in a big way, as only a small percentage of the company's active customers use them. Given that Vistaprint paid a pretty steep price for Webs, that's not particularly encouraging.Worse still, I think the digital marketing space is exceptionally competitive and I don't know that Vistraprint really has the means of standing out from the crowd. Web.com (WWWW) and Go Daddy are targeting many of the same customers, and while I believe companies like Constant Contact (NASDAQ:CTCT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) are aiming for much larger customers than Vistaprint's core market, the SaaS model they use could allow them to market down-market without much incremental inconvenience. I also believe that companies like Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) and Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) may ultimately enter the space somewhere down the line as well; Intuit has recently recommitted to its core legacy operations, but both companies are likely going to want to find ways to grow their share of wallet with existing customers.Non-Business Operations - Real Opportunity, Or Distraction?Vistaprint is also looking to generate profitable growth from personal/family printing services. Rival Shutterfly (NASDAQ:SFLY) has characterized this as a $35 billion market opportunity, and Vistaprint did acquire Albumprinter (a European photo services company). The challenge here is not unlike the challenge in its larger business services operation - both establishing a real brand identify/value and creating a lasting value proposition for customers that can underpin a real business.Will This New Plan Meet Investor Expectations?Realizing that operating performance was not good enough, the company launched a fairly comprehensive plan to reorient the basis. As of the last month or two, management believes that it has implemented about 40% of the changes it wants in North America, though Europe is much further behind.This plan makes sense in many respects. The company has reinvested in manufacturing, product quality, and customer service, and has made a deliberate effort to move away from disloyal price-shopping customers and focus instead on those customers that can generate better long-term value through higher retention and a greater appetite for Vistaprint's services - in other words, buying more than just business cards when offered significant discounts.Europe is likely to take more work. I'm troubled at some of the problems that have set back the company, including serious localization issues (focusing on North American styles/sizes instead of the European norms), particularly given that senior management is based in Paris. Likewise, while the company's decision to retrench around its top three European markets makes sense from the perspective of better leveraging marketing spending (and improving margins), I do wonder about the long-term growth impact.Although Vistaprint's superior printing operations allow it to post gross margins about double the norm, I'm still troubled by the inconsistency of results here. Management has already pulled back from some of its long-term goals, including $2 billion in organic revenue in FY2016. So while I am willing to model nearly 9% revenue growth and 18% free cash flow growth, I have to acknowledge that there are some definite downside risks to those numbers (particularly the margin numbers, in my opinion).The Bottom LineI happen to believe that 18% free cash flow growth is a pretty robust target, even if recent results are depressed and below-trend. So given that such a projection still only leads to a price target in the high $40's, I'm not terribly excited about the stock today. Moreover, given the company's demonstrated volatility (and the recent run), I would be nervous that a quarterly earnings miss would send the shares down sharply. I don't think that's a good risk/reward tradeoff, and I'm content to stand on the sidelines, even if that means missing out on the upside to the company's restructuring efforts and a European business recovery.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1539292,41921,2013-07-09T06:31:07-04:00,,"A few months back, I wrote a lengthy article about Vistaprint (VPRT) and how the company was significantly overvalued and would soon be resetting the bar on its growth outlook during the summer of 2013 at its next analyst day. Since the time of that article, the stock has run almost 25% higher on absolutely zero news or catalysts:VPRT data by YChartsThis latest run has left the stock in absolute nosebleed territory. The company previously guided for GAAP EPS for the current fiscal year (period ended 6/30/13) of $.60 - $.80. I previously noted the absurdity of the fact that the company had 3/4 of the year in the bag yet had such a wide range for its earnings guidance as evidence of the volatility surrounding the outlook for the business. It would appear that my previous call was a bit early, but the foundation of the analysis is just as relevant today as it was then. Vistaprint is trading at nosebleed valuations and is going to have to significantly lower its long term outlook when it gives its 2014 guidance either during the July earnings call or at the investor day shortly thereafter. The market has continued to treat Vistaprint as a growth stock, and if the company lowers expectations as it appears will be the case, this house of cards could quickly come tumbling down. Vistaprint easily could have over 30% downside from the level at which it currently trades.ValuationVistaprint is a big fan of reporting adjusted GAAP earnings, most likely because its actual GAAP earnings are materially lower than the adjusted numbers the company wants investors to focus on. To humor the company, let's forget about EPS for a minute and consider the valuation metrics looking at FCF, EBIDTA, and EV/EBDITA. From a FCF perspective, you can see from the Q3 2013 earnings report shown below that FCF has plummeted through the first 9 months compared to the PY:The company saw FCF plummet from ~$84M to ~$31M on a YoY basis as seen above. A portion of this decrease can be pawned off as investments in future growth by way of capital expenditures, but the balance is directly tied to decreased cash provided by operations which speaks directly to the current state of the business. The company generated a total of ~$88M of FCF in FY2012. Even if you assume that the company is able to return to that level in FY 2014, which would assume that the company almost doubles its FCF level from FY2013, the valuation from a FCF yield standpoint is outrageous. With a market capitalization of ~$1.6B, assuming ~$88M in FCF for FY 2014 (equivalent to what the company delivered in FY 2012), the equivalent FCF yield is equal to 5.5%, which is entirely unattractive for a supposed growth company.Turning to EBIDTA, the following two tables from the Q3 2013 earnings report show the necessary operating metrics required to calculate EBIDTA:Income StatementStatement of Cash FlowsThrough 9 months, the company generated $43M in income from operations (down ~14% from the prior year) and incurred $47M in depreciation and amortization costs. During the Q3 2013 earnings call, the company CEO indicated that the GAAP EPS guidance for Q4 implied a net loss for the company at all but the highest point of the guidance range:Given this guidance, it is probable that operating income will be negative in Q4. Giving the company the benefit of the doubt and assuming that operating income actually comes in at break even, and annualizing the depreciation and amortization expense, EBIDTA for FY 2013 would be ~$106M ($43M in operating income + $47M YTD Depr/Amort + $15.6M Q4 Depr/Amort). With estimated operating income just north of $100M for the current fiscal year, Vistaprint is trading at almost 16x EBIDTA.Lastly, turning to a EV/EBIDTA valuation, the valuation picture is just as bleak. The table below shows the Vistaprint balance sheet as of Q3 2013:As noted in my previous article about the company, Vistaprint has recently chosen to deploy the majority of its cash on share repurchases and acquisitions. In doing so, it has also taken on over $230M in debt over the last 2 years. The Enterprise Value of Vistaprint currently can be calculated as follows:On an EV/EBIDTA metric, as the company has levered up for what has so far proven to be nothing more than an exercise in propping up EPS, the valuation metric looks even worse than it does when simply valuing the company off its Price to EBIDTA ratio. The EV/EBITDA ratio for Vistaprint currently stands at ~17x.Every valuation metric shown above shows how overvalued Vistaprint is today. Even if the company were to manage to continue growing revenue and expand its EBDITA margin at a material rate each year, shares would be materially overvalued using a DCF analysis. For example, the adjusted EBIDTA % for FY 2012 was 13.2% (adjusted to also exclude stock based compensation). If you assume that this metric expands to over 18% by 2017, assume flat revenues over the next 10 years and terminal growth rate of 3%, and a discount rate of 12%, a DCF analysis would derive a current fair value of close to $32 per share which is 30% below where the stock currently trades.Investment OutlookOne lever that the company has hinted at that it can pull to drive earnings, or EBIDTA, is to cut back on advertising spending where the company is not realizing a favorable return on its investment. Robert Keane, Vistaprint CEO, had the following to say when asked about advertising spending on the Q3 2013 earnings call:The problem for Vistaprint is that its revenue is highly correlated to the amount of advertising its spends, as its retention rate or % of business from returning customers is very low. In other words, the company is dependent on consistently drumming up new business to keep feeding the machine as customers do not often stick around. The table below shows the implied retention rate of customers at Vistaprint on a trailing twelve month basis:The company has seen its implied retention rate fall from 44% at the end of Q4 2012 to 41% at the end fo Q3 2013. Notwithstanding the fact that a declining retention rate is a negative sign in and of itself, this chart shows how dependent Vistaprint is on constantly drumming up new business. Said another way, if the company were to shut off the advertising machine, it is very likely that it's highly correlated revenue would decline in line with lower advertising spending.The counterpoint to shorting Vistaprint would be that the company offers the best in class manufacturing process which leads to gross margins well above 60%. If the company were able to continue to leverage this level of gross margin, and somehow begin to retain more customers, it is feasible that operating margins could rise. However, as noted above in the DCF valuation provided, Vistaprint could see it's adjusted EBITDA margin grow by over 35% from the level seen in 2012 over the next 5 years and shares would still be overvalued by 30% today. Vistaprint has seen its trading volume plummet by 50% over the past 60 days and its short interest fall by almost 13% as shown below:I strongly believe that the recent move higher in shares of Vistaprint is nothing more than a light volume rally driven by short covering, and the stock is sitting on a ledge ready to fall hard no matter what management says when it provides 2014 guidance and an updated long term outlook at the investor day in August.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

What you may not realize is that Vistaprint is a publicly traded company generating over $1B a year in annual revenue as of 2012. The company markets itself as the premier service provider for small businesses in the printing and promotional marketplace. This is also a company from an investment standpoint that has seen violent swings in its stock price over the last few years. The company has a history of making big projections for future growth, and subsequently having to walk those projections back. The stock chart below shows some of the wild swings that have accompanied those projections and then subsequent reductions to guidance over the last five years:VPRT data by YChartsThe company just released its latest quarterly earnings, which on a non-GAAP basis exceeded analyst expectations. The Q3 2013 non-GAAP earnings were $.48 per share. However, GAAP earnings were only $.17 per share. The company also guided for GAAP earnings of $.60 to $.80 per share. This guidance in and of itself is concerning, considering the company only has one quarter remaining in its fiscal year. That the company has to provide a 30% range for annual earnings with one quarter remaining, speaks volumes about the uncertainty of the business. As the article will explore in further detail, Vistaprint is a company that is fooling the market with its non-GAAP earnings, which serves to mask a significant disconnect between slowing revenue growth and outright falling GAAP earnings. After reading, you will hopefully see the investment case that I see, which is to short this company for a multitude of reasons.Background On VistaprintVistaprint was founded by its current CEO, Robert Keane, in 1994. The original business plan is very telling about what role this company believes it can serve in the marketplace. A passage from the business plan read as follows:This is relevant to the short case because this business plan is still representative of what the mission of the company is today. Vistaprint caters almost exclusively to small and ""micro"" businesses that in its opinion, would not otherwise have access to cost effective printing and promotional materials.According to the company website, the dot-com crash nearly claimed Vistaprint as a victim. The company fought, selling off pieces of the company and cutting its workforce by 2/3, and ultimately survived the dot-com crash. In 2005, the company went public with an IPO and now trades on the Nasdaq.The company is headquartered in the Netherlands and has over 4,100 employees today, with 13 satellite offices located around the world, in addition to its corporate headquarters.Recent Company Performance And OutlookIn July of 2011, the stock of Vistaprint was at about $42 a share and the company had a market cap north of $1.3B. The company had just reported a record year with GAAP EPS climbing 23% YoY to $1.86 per share. Yet the stock cratered the day earnings were released, falling almost 40%. The reason for the stock decline had to do with the company providing an update on its long-range projections. The reason for the drop was that the company noted that earnings would see a material decline in FY 2012 and FY 2013 as the company invested for future growth. Whenever an investor listens to a company explain that earnings will fall, in search of future growth, a giant red flag should be sent up.The future growth that the company predicted was nothing short of eye popping. Vistaprint projected that, by 2016, organic revenue would top $2B and GAAP EPS would be over $5 per share. Both of those metrics represented a 20% compounded growth rate based off of the 2011 actual results. Forget for a minute, that it is now 2013 and the company is guiding to a range of $.60 to $.80 in GAAP EPS this year. Understand that the company trades today, at over $40 per share, roughly the same price it traded in 2011 before falling 40% when the company provided its business update. The rest of this article will be dedicated to delving into the financial profile of the company and showing why the company deserves to trade as a mature company with a minimal growth outlook. The opposite is implied by the 50 PE multiple based on current GAAP earnings that the company trades at today.Income Statement ReviewAs previously discussed, the company is a big fan of having its non-GAAP EPS be the headline of any earnings release. The reason is due to the graph below which shows increasing revenue and declining GAAP EPS over the last few years:VPRT EPS Diluted TTM data by YChartsThe correlation between revenue growth and declining earnings is not one typically found with healthy companies. Further, the actual earnings per share would look even worse if not for significant share repurchases over the last two years. As seen below, the company has reduced its outstanding shares from 44M to 33M over the last two years. The approximately 25% decrease in shares outstanding serves to make the underlying fundamentals in earnings for Vistaprint appear even weaker:VPRT Shares Outstanding data by YChartsWithout the benefit of the reduction in shares outstanding, the EPS range for 2013 would be only $.45 - $.60 compared to the $.60 to $.80 range the company is currently forecasting.Essentially the company has three years to grow its EPS from the high end of its forecasted range for 2013, $.80, to the targeted goal of $5 per share in 2016. This is the equivalent of over an 80% compounded growth rate over the next three years. This will not possibly happen, and the company is set up to lower its long-range guidance at its Analyst Day this summer.Balance Sheet ReviewIt is always prudent to start a balance sheet review by understanding a company's cash and debt balances. Cash-rich companies have the ability to make acquisitions, invest in organic growth, and drive earnings per share through stock repurchases. Those companies burdened by debt have fixed interest payments, the specter of repaying or refinancing that debt at some point in the future, and in general less flexibility to capitalize on unique opportunities that may arise being that the company is already levered with debt. Vistaprint receives poor marks for both its cash and debt balances:VPRT Cash and ST Investments data by YChartsIn keeping with the common trend for this company, you see the financial position materially weaken over the past few years. The cash balance has plummeted, and the debt balance has exploded. Vistaprint has made a few acquisitions that have contributed to the dynamics seen on the balance sheet today. They have also used cash to prop up their earnings through share repurchases. The acquisitions themselves are in line with the philosophy the company laid out in 2011, when discussing the plan to reach $2B in revenue and $5 per share in EPS by 2016. The problem with the acquisitions is that they were extremely expensive. Vistaprint paid over $100M to acquire Webs, a do-it-yourself ""DIY"" website builder company. At the time of the acquisition in 2011, Vistaprint noted that Webs had about $9M of revenue in the year prior to being acquired. Vistaprint paid over $100M, or more than 10x revenue, for this company, which is hardly a bargain. The second large acquisition was of a company called Albumprinter. This acquisition cost Vistaprint over $80M for a company that was a leading provider of photo books in Europe. Both acquisitions have two things in common. They were incredibly expensive, highlighting the fact that organic growth at Vistaprint was not going to be nearly enough to reach its future revenue and earnings target. The second item both companies had in common was the lack of any barriers-to-entry in the markets they serve. DIY website companies are a dime a dozen. There is nothing special about the technology offered by Webs that sets them apart from any competitor. The same can be said of Albumprinter. No patents or secret sauce exists that prevents another company from creating a website where users can upload photos and create a photo book. Yet both of these acquisitions took a toll on the financial position for Vistaprint, leaving the company with a diminished cash balance and a mountain of debt.Investment Thesis And SummaryVistaprint continues to stand by the target for revenue and earnings of over $2B and $5 per share respectively, by 2016. The company does, however, acknowledge that these targets will be harder to reach in light of its recent performance. That being said, with almost 100% certainty investors can assume that at some point in the near future that long-range guidance will be significantly reduced. That is one event risk that is looming on the horizon and will probably manifest itself during the August 2013 investor day. As noted above, it will take an 80% compounded growth rate from the high end of the 2013 EPS estimate given by the company, to reach the 2016 EPS target on a GAAP basis.Another item briefly touched on above, but worth exploring more, is the company's apparent lack of clarity surrounding its business in the short term. It was noted above that the company, as part of its Q3 2013 earnings presentation, provided full-year GAAP EPS guidance of $.60 to $.80 per share. Consider that through 3 quarters in 2013, the company already has earned $.78 per share. It is stunning actually that the company is acknowledging that not only will it most likely lose money in Q4, but the range of that loss is as large as the company has estimated it to be. It is hard to place faith in the long-range goals of a company that has this much uncertainty about an earnings period ending in less than 90 days.Finally, the company has noted it will no longer give quarterly guidance. The standard commentary about not managing the business for quarterly results was part of the reason given as to why this guidance would no longer be given. Any time a company is no longer willing to give guidance, or gives less guidance than it previously gave, this is a red flag. Vistaprint operates in a business that has insignificant barriers-to-entry. A large portion of its business is European-based and thus feeling the effects of the recession gripping that continent. Additionally, the company serves the small business client, the same client that may not be experiencing the same recovery that those on Wall St or Fortune 500 companies are experiencing today.After releasing its Q3 2013 earnings, the stock initially ran up to over $43 a share. I entered a short position at around $42 a share after the stock could not hold the post earnings gains. I believe that a large sell-off will materialize when the company officially lowers its long range guidance. I see no catalysts on the horizon that would validate why Vistaprint should trade for over 50x GAAP earnings. Regardless of when the company reduces its long-range guidance, I also believe that the business model provides zero barrier-to-entry and that the 65% gross margins that the company currently experiences will fall precipitously as competition accelerates.Disclosure: I am short VPRT.

And that's just what Wall Street analysts did as a group on Thursday, uniformly cutting their rating on marketing firm Vistaprint (Nasdaq: VPRT) to ""hold"" or ""neutral"". Analysts thought the stock was a ""hold"" at Wednesday's closing price of $50, but shares fell to $32 on Thursday and are only now trading modestly higher.   Which leads to the question: Are the shares still a ""hold"" at that far lower level? Or is there a bargain to be had?  As a large-scale print marketing firm targeting small businesses across the globe, it should come as no surprise that quarterly results would be hurt by a slow economy. To be sure, it was hard to justify sticking with a ""buy"" rating after the second straight disappointing quarter. Shares might not deserve to trade at $50 right now, but they certainly didn't deserve the drubbing they received. A closer look reveals a solid long-term grower that is wrestling with some real, but temporary challenges in 2010.  Vistaprint missed fiscal fourth quarter sales estimates by about 3% and profits were roughly in line with forecasts. But beyond the numbers things get a little noisy. For example, Vistaprint's investments in new markets such as Singapore, Australia and Portugal, along with other infrastructure investments, mean that costs are rising at an accelerated pace this year. Management notes that the weak economy in the United States and Europe will likely lead to slower sales growth in the current fiscal year than had previously been thought. It doesn't help that Vistaprint has a high degree of exposure to the weak euro.  Beyond the macro view, investors grew concerned on the conference call when management noted that recent marketing changes were ill-advised, and would likely be revamped again. That's led to an impression that management has lost its way. Sales had risen at least +28% in each of the past five fiscal years, and Thursday's sell-off implies that growth has quickly dried up. Instead, view this as a sales slowdown before the economy rebounds.  Admittedly, many investors fled the stock because the next few quarters won't yet show signs of a turnaround. Year-over-year quarterly sales gains, which had already been decelerating in recent quarters, will likely only be +10% to +15% in each of the next two quarters. (Many companies would love to post those growth rates in these challenging economic times.)   More importantly, the company's international expansion should yield fruit in the second half of fiscal 2011 (the first half of calendar 2011). After that, the U.S. and European economies should start to power back to life, perhaps in 2011, perhaps in 2012. That should enable Vistaprint to start to grow at a +15% to +20% clip again, as the markets it serves are fairly unsaturated.   Of course that growth rate is a far cry from historical levels. After boosting sales from $90 million in fiscal 2005 to $670 million in fiscal 2010, investors should have assumed that such a large sales base makes continued +30% to +40% growth unsustainable. So Thursday's sell-off is about re-setting expectations. But those expectations have been re-set far too bearishly.  Smith Barney seemed to echo the sentiment of many analysts by noting: ""Key to our new Hold -- not Sell -- call is that we don't see structural or competitive issues at play here,"" adding that short-term factors such as weak spending among small and medium-sized businesses will remain in place in the very near-term. The firm lowered its price target from $62 to $45, but that lower price is still about +35% higher than where shares were trading Tuesday. And it sounds like that price target change would be reversed once these issues abate -- shares trade for half of Smith Barney's once and possible future price target. Thanks to the recent internal sales execution and foreign exchange issues, Vistaprint was only able to boost earnings per share by +13% in the year just ended. Per share profits may only grow around +10% in fiscal 2011 to around $2.20. On a calendar-year basis, profits should be closer to $2.50 in 2011.   Shares now trade for just 12 times that forecast. Once Vistaprint gets past these near-term hurdles, investors are likely to anoint a more robust multiple for the stock, perhaps closer to 20 times projected profits. Shares may have fallen from $50 to $32, but they should move their way back toward the $50 mark once these near-term clouds recede."
224009,22521,2010-09-06T08:58:34-04:00,,"Vistaprint's (VPRT) shares collapsed after the company reported fiscal 4Q earnings and forward guidance that reflected accelerated spending, internal execution issues, currency impacts, and economic pressures on small businesses.Management placed emphasis on the internal execution and operational issues as the culprit for the missed expectations. Specifically, rapid hiring, with those hires left untrained, and marketing initiatives that had unintended negative consequences, led the company to issue guidance below the Street. Several analysts downgraded the shares following the report, wrongly in our view.This is the second time in VPRT's history as a public company that it has faced operational issues that negatively impacted the stock. The first time was due to transition of U.S. based employees to the international headquarters in Europe. Back then the shares recovered sharply after those issues were resolved.We are likely to see the same happen this go around. This is why we believe that the shares are attractive and the analysts who downgraded the shares were wrong.In the past we have always viewed internal operational issues at any company, and their respective depressed stock prices, as buying opportunities.Fundamentals of the company continue to remain strong. Citing numbers from Jeffries and Co analyst Youssef Squali - web sessions up 25% y/y, orders up 21% y/y, average order value up 4% y/y, improved conversion rate to 6.2% from 5.9%, 67% repeat customers generating 67% of orders consistent with past trends, and q/q declining customer acquisition costs, ex the TV ad campaign.It is a challenge for us to find a company growing their metrics at this pace.That brings us to the latest chatter about VPRT as an acquisition candidate given the recent Tech acquisition spree. The chatter centered around companies such as Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS), Xerox (NYSE:XRX), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), and UPS. These are all logical except that Xerox's new CEO is currently digesting a huge acquisition and is unlikely to make any others at this time.Staples is the more logical one in our view as it would give them an entrenched foothold with the small mom and pop business or businesses with fewer than 10 employees, for which Vistaprint believes there are 50 million in the U.S., Europe, and Canada. There would be immense cross selling opportunities that Staples could pursue.We also see the same rational for FedEx and UPS to more deeply penetrate those business.Acquisition or not, VPRT continues to remain an attractive company to us at a single digit EBITDA multiple and mid-teens P/E, with a PEG of less than 1 that screams to us an undervalued growth stock. The shares should be trading in the low $50 range.Disclosure: No position at this time."

Before you realize it, the days    have passed, and our working lives have come to an end.For    quite some time we have tried to supply investors, not the investors of    Wall Street, but the blue collar investors of Main Street, with    reasonably considered ideas that could be factored in to their    retirement thinking.This week's company, Vistaprint N.V., (Nasadq: VPRT) is no exception. Well, almost no exception.The idea actually came from the Motley Fool's 11 O'Clock Stock    feature, where every business day for the next 50 days, one of the    Motley Fool analysts will present their stock idea for investor   consideration.BasisFinancial information related to Vistaprint N.V. contained in this report is based on the company's most recent SEC Form 10-K filing    for fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, as filed with the Securities  and   Exchange Commission on August 31, 2009, with updates from the   company's most recent SEC Form 10-Q filing, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 30, 2010.What They DoThe company is an on-line provider of customized marketing products and services to small businesses world wide.They    offer a broad range of complementary products and services ranging   from  printed business cards, brochures and post cards, to apparel,    invitations, announcements, holiday cards, calendars, creative design    services, copywrite services, direct mail services, promotional gifts,    signage, website design, website hosting services, and e-mail marketing    services.Short-Term InvestmentThe    stock closed recently at $32.64, with resistance at $46.60, a 43%    increase from its recent close, and support at $30.33, a 7% decline from    its recent close, creating a tempting proposition for short-term    investors.However, a recent announcement by the company that fourth quarter sales were below expectations sent the stock price into a downtrend, falling from a recent high of around $51 to its recent close, which is well off its March 2010 high of almost $62.While    we happen to think the recent announcement is much ado about nothing,    we are reminded of the old adage that the trend is you friend.So   while we are aware of the trend, we think that with fairly tight stops   under a trade, now would actually be a very good time to take a   short-term position.Long-Term (5 Year Hold) Investment  For   a company with a market cap of just under $1.5 billion, we think  the   financials are in very good order, with low debt to equity ratios.Additionally,    the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio, are all within our    investment quality ranges, as are the days receivables outstanding, and    the days payables outstanding, allowing the company to turn its    inventory almost 32 times per year.The  one major downside, at   least to us, was the free cash flow the company  generated during FY10,   $0.36 per share. Granted, growing annual year  over year revenues at   almost 30% has a tendency to eat up free cash  flow.So  while we   were pleased to see that year over year net income increased  19%, we   think long-term investors should pay close attention, and not  become  so  enamored with income growth that they lose track of the  company's   ability to grow free cash flow.ValuationsBased    on our review of the company's financial information, with emphasis  on   the company's FY10 data, we think a reasonable value estimate for  the   stock is in the $34 to $38 range.The stock is currently  trading  at a 35% discount to its March 2010 highs, signaling a buying   opportunity for many investors. But current price levels are placing the   stock at 4 times tangible book value, which we think makes the stock a   touch pricey.Final ThoughtsWe all come to a place in our lives when we realize that the years have  simply passed.Hopefully   as they did pass, we have taken the time to  have some fun, to enjoy   whatever the work is we do, and equally  important, to have wisely   invested the few dollars we  have managed to save.So  while   thoughts of days long past may make us smile, thoughts of days  yet to   come, surrounded by those we have spent a lifetime caring  for, should   make us smile even more.Knowing  as lovers, as parents, as  grandparents, and as  investors, we have taken the time to  consider  what is truly important  in life, and planned accordingly.WorksheetTo download the Vistaprint N.V.

150168,20335,2009-07-21T12:09:53-04:00,,"What is Vistaprint going to do if 44% of its net income disappears?For the past few years, Vistaprint (VPRT) has been a controversial name amongst investors. On one hand you have a printing servicing company that provides printed products to small business at an affordable price. But on the other hand, you have a company which derives a large portion of its income from “referral fees” – from web loyalty shopping clubs, or in layman terms, those $14.95 a month charges on your credit card bill that leave you scratching your head.For years short sellers have criticized this business model, but love it or hate it the money kept coming in… well, all that is about to change. This past quarter Senator John D Rockefeller IV has decided to make these web loyalty programs the target of a Senate Commerce Committee formal inquiry. Here is some more reading on Rockefeller and his mission. Should have seen this comingThe company has been giving tells that the relationship with their referral provider Vertrue was having troubles. As stated in their last 10-K:It is the opinion of Citron that neither Vistaprint nor their web loyalty partner saw this Congressional probe coming. The aforementioned 'expectations' probably related to the seven class action lawsuits that were filed against Vistaprint and Vertrue (see here). This isn't too surprising, considering the  volume of complaints that exist online about Vistaprint for 'unauthorized' credit card charges (see here and here). So what happens if the referral business goes away?Here is where the devil lies in the details.  To be current, we will examine the last 2 quarters.Vistaprint’s cheerleaders will have you believe referral is not a problem because even if it goes away, it only represents a bit more than 5% of revenue last quarter. What they don’t tell you is that with the margin it carries, the referral business, which according to the company’s own disclosures is generated with zero operational costs, represents close to 44% of Vistaprint’s net income.  If you compare the past two quarters you will see that the company is becoming increasingly dependent on that income.  Vistaprint’s already aggressive 36.5 PE balloons to an unsupportable 64.75 for its non-referral business.How will Vistaprint ever be able to grow their business and fill a void left by this free boost to earnings which they've been enjoying for years? We guess the old adage holds true, “if it seems too good to be true, it probably is” When you generate such a significant part of your income from a non- core business that has generated so much scrutiny, it will eventually come to an end.TaxesAdditionally, Vistaprint has yet to project the effects on its earnings of tightening tax rules on its foreign domestication (currently Bermuda). Its current tax rate is 8.6%, compared to typical 35% - 40% for typical US companies.The current administration has made it clear that these types of tax dodges are clearly in its sights. Even though the company has changed their domicile to the Netherlands, this should still be of concern to shareholders.ConclusionMany times, critics of a company are way too early in predicting when a business model will start to unravel. Commonly enough, as in Vistaprint’s case, a steady stream of insider selling provides a reliable hint to cautious investors.With the current class action lawsuits combined with the Senate finally paying attention to these unscrupulous business practices, Vistaprint had better quickly define a “plan B” to replace 45% of its net in income in its future.Cautious investing to all.Disclosure: Short VPTR"

The trade, known as a diagonal spread, cost a net debit of $1.35.VPRT fell 0.07 percent to $58.61 yesterday and is down 4 percent in the last month. The provider of items such as business cards and signs had more than doubled in the preceding year amid bullish options activity, strong earnings and short covering.However, the shares fell sharply on March 29 and are now consolidating below the same $59 level that had briefly provided support. Some chart watchers may interpret the price action as evidence of a reversal lower.The diagonal spread takes advantage of the higher premiums on the July options to earn extra premium, delivering greater leverage on a push to the downside. The trade will earn a maximum profit of 640 percent if VPRT closes at $45 on May expiration and holds that level.The risk to the investor is that the shares will continue falling after that point, leaving them exposed to losses on the July contracts. Given that danger, the trade may have been implemented by a shareholder who's looking to implement a hedge and is willing to be assigned more shares at $45.The trade pushed overall options volume in VPRT to six times greater than average, with puts accounting for a bearish 92 percent of the activity.(Chart courtesy of tradeMONSTER)"

The company is VistaPrint (VPRT).VistaPrint caters to the needs of small businesses and individuals by offering an array of services from printing business cards to designing web sites. Our problem is in the nature of its business. If you run a Google search on VistaPrint, you will pull up hundreds of other smaller companies offering the same service. This company does not have a moat! It’s just a matter of time before we will see a price war leading to the compression of margins.The company claims it has over 75,000 satisfied customers to cross sell other services. However, run a search on Google for ""VistaPrint Scam"" and you will pull up scores of complaints from supposedly past customers who were charged by affiliates when they had not ordered its services. The company's ordering process somehow gets a less alert customer to sign up for its third party membership discount ""deals."" And in good time the customer finds purportedly ""unauthorized"" or ""unknown"" charges on his or her credit card. Some complaints talk of months before these charges are discovered. Many had to have their cards cancelled because there were just too many VistaPrint affiliates who had their card number. Of course there is no way for us to verify the authenticity of these complaints but they are too numerous to ignore.Here is what the recent 10-Q says:While we do not have a case against VistaPrint for its reasonable valuation, we are surely not for its business model, which is being replicated by many. The second and greater area of concern is the innumerable complaints by customers which may not indicate willful fraud but surely indicates a bad business model. The revenue generated by the third party merchant transaction referrals is around 5% and we don't expect this to continue for long if the class action lawsuits prevail against Vistaprint. While the 5% may not be a big number in terms of revenue, it could impact earnings because the margin for such referrals business is very high. An economy in tailspin is surely no help.While this is not a recommendation to short VistaPrint, it may throw some color on the huge short  position."
116483,22064,2009-01-26T10:35:07-05:00,,"Vista Print (VPRT) is scheduled to report their fiscal second quarter 2009 results after the market closes on Tuesday, January 27. Based on our analysis, we at EarningsPreview.com are expecting VPRT to report better than expected results that beat Wall Street's expectations. Analyst ExpectationsWe are forecasting revenues of $129.1 million and EPS of $.40. This would represent a 23% increase in revenues from last year's $105.0 million in the same period. The current analyst consensus calls for revenues of $127.8 million and $.39 EPS. On the last earnings call, the company gave quarterly guidance for revenues of $122 – 134 million and EPS of $.36 - .41. We are expecting Vista Print to report solid quarterly results after management commented in December that results were performing well against their guidance estimates. This would indicate impressive results in the face of extremely difficult economic conditions and falling consumer demand. More importantly than the fiscal second quarter results will be if the company can maintain full year guidance or not. Our guess is that they will reduce fiscal year 2009 guidance in anticipation of further weakness in the economic environment along with the appreciating U.S. dollar. Share PerformanceVista Print's shares have fallen 12% since the beginning of the year. And in 2008, the shares fell an incredible 57% badly underperforming the Dow Jones index's 34% decline.  ValuationShares are now trading at 10x consensus FY2010 EPS estimates. This is a discount to the relative valuations of their peer group. If the company is able to maintain their full year guidance, then the shares should get a boost since they are already trading at very attractive levels.     Recommendation: Buy with a $20 price target.Disclosure: no positions"

(VPRT),  one of the leading online providers of professional marketing products  and services to micro businesses, is slated to release its second  quarter 2011 results on January 27, after the market closes. The current  Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is 65 cents per share,  representing an annualized growth of 9.98%. The Zacks Consensus sales  estimate is $224.0 million.With respect to earnings surprises, over the trailing four quarters,  Vistaprint has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The average  earnings surprise was a positive 17.19%. This implies that the company  has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate by the same magnitude over the  last four quarters.Previous Quarter RecapThe Netherlands-based company posted first quarter 2011 adjusted  earnings per share of 36 cents, which declined 12% year over year but  surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. Earnings were at the  high end of the guidance range of 27–32 cents per share. The  better-than-expected results were driven by effective cost-control  initiatives.The company registered an 18% year-over-year growth in revenues to  $170.5 million, including the impact of currency exchange rate  fluctuations. Revenues were above management’s guidance range of $159  million to $164 million and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $163  million.In the first quarter, gross margin declined 50 basis points (bps) from  the year-ago quarter to 63.1% and operating margin contracted 270 basis  points from the prior-year quarter to 7.2%. Key operating metrics also  remained strong.OutlookFor the second quarter of 2011, Vistaprint expects earnings per share  (NYSEARCA:EPS) to range within 69–80 cents, excluding expected share-based  compensation expense and its related tax effect. On a GAAP basis, the  company expects EPS in the range of 58 cents to 69 cents, based on  revenues in the range of $210 million to $230 million.For full-year 2011, the company reiterated its earnings outlook. The  company continues to expect adjusted EPS in a range of $2.09 to $2.24  per share. On a GAAP basis, EPS is projected to range within  $1.65–$1.80. The company has raised its revenue guidance range to  $755–$790 million from $750–$780 million.Estimates Revisions TrendEstimates have not moved up significantly in the last 30 days, implying  that the analysts are maintaining their view on the stock. The current  Zacks Consensus Estimate is $1.74 for 2011 (reflecting a year-over-year  growth of 17.00%) and $2.17 for 2012 (reflecting a year-over-year growth  of 24.64%). The Zacks Consensus sales estimates for 2011 and 2012 are  $785 million and $919 million, respectively.Agreement of Estimate RevisionsThere has been no movement in estimates of the analysts over the last 7  days due to the lack of any meaningful catalyst to drive estimates  upward or downward. Additionally, the estimates have also not budged for  the quarter in the last 30 days.However, in the last 30 days, 1 analyst out of 9 has raised the  estimates for 2011 and 2012, but none of the analysts reduced the same.  Thus, the analysts have slightly drifted toward the positive side.The upward movement by one analyst over the last 30 days in based on  Vistaprint’s focus on small business markets, which provide it with  ample opportunities for growth. Vistaprint is also strengthening its  geographical footprint, which will further accelerate its growth. The  analyst also expects margin expansion based on company’s cost-control  initiatives.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsOver the last 60 days, there has been no change in the earnings  estimate of 65 cents per share for the second quarter of 2011.  Therefore, the analysts expect the company to report in line. In the  last 60 days, estimates for 2011 and 2012 have jumped by a penny each to  $1.74 and $2.17, respectively.Our TakeWe expect Vistaprint’s second quarter results to be in line with estimates, in the absence of any near-term catalyst.Vistaprint primarily targets the small business market, particularly  businesses or organizations with less than 10 employees, and often with  less than 5 employees. This focus presents Vistaprint with substantial  market opportunity, as the company estimates a presence of approximately  50 million such small businesses throughout the United States, Canada  and the European Union.Moreover, the scale of Vistaprint’s operation gives small business  customers access to quality products and printing services that would  otherwise have been out of their reach. Additionally, Vistaprint’s  business is scalable, and increased top-line revenue will likely result  in margin expansion in the long run.Furthermore, Vistaprint has a strong international presence in Europe  and Continental Europe and is poised to tap the immense growth  opportunity in the Asian Market.However, we believe that the ongoing economic uncertainty coupled with  substantial competition resulting in slowing growth of new customer  additions will restrict significant improvements in its top as well as  bottom lines. Moreover, substantial exposure to international markets  also makes the company vulnerable to currency fluctuation risks.Accordingly, we keep our conservative view on Vistaprint’s shares and  have a Zacks #2 Rank (short-term Buy recommendation). Our long-term  recommendation for the stock remains Neutral.One of Vistaprint’s competitors, Sykes Enterprises Inc (NASDAQ:SYKE), is slated to release its fourth quarter results on February 28, 2011."

On July 28, the company gave 3rd quarter guidance for revenue of $112 – 116 million and EPS of $.25 - .28.While we believe that VPRT will deliver a decent quarter, it’s expected that they will join the long list of companies that have reduced their guidance forecasts.

10542,20122,2005-12-17T05:32:35-05:00,,"Story: VistaPrint (VPRT) is a leading online printer, with a worldwide presence, and 5.5M customers. They are targeting the small business market with small print runs, using advanced computerized presses that allow grouping of small print jobs together, thereby offering cheap prices for small runs. They offer design service as well. They have a pretty good targeted advertising campaign (offers through business credit cards, inserts with electronic purchases, etc.) so awareness will probably increase. This can be an underserved market, and a fragmented market.
Company: From the Q3 2005 report of 9 Nov 2005, assets have increased by $62.868M to $128.8M Q/Q, almost all of that from their IPO, so they are not hemorrhaging in any other respect. Liabilities are flat at about $16M, or 12.5% of assets. Solid balance sheet. Revenue growth 61% Y/Y ($28.898M/$17.861M).Operating income went from ($20.3M) to $3.4M Y/Y. The 2004 loss was due to a contract termination. Without that one-tine event, quarterly operating income went from $0.767M to $3.4M Y/Y, a 4.4x increase, but from a very small base. Continuing operating expenses went from $17.094M to $25.503M an increase of 49% Y/Y, so revenue is growing faster than operating expenses - just the sort of thing we look for. In fact, operating margins increased from 4.2% ($0.767M/$17.861M) to 11.7% ($3.395M/$28.898M) a 7.5% expansion, which is great. They are fully funded from operations, and the IPO proceeds are a bonus - just the type of business plan that deserves to come public. Solid.
We'll do a typical linear projection. At current growth rates, revenue for Q3 2006 will be $46.5M (1.61x28.898M), operating expenses will be $38.0M (1.49x$25.503M), giving quarterly operating earnings of $8.5M and an operating margin of 18.3%, a further 6.5% expansion. This same model would give annual revenue of $150.8M($28.898M*(1+1.203+1.406+1.61)), annual operating expenses of $127.0M ($25.503*(1+1.163+1.327+1.49)), and annual operating earnings of $23.8M ($150.8M-$127.0M).
Diluted shares outstanding have gone from 11.358M to 14.317M Y/Y, a 26% increase. Assuming the same share dilution gives 18.05M (14.317Mx1.26) shares probable in Q3 2006. Using the projected annualized operating earnings and shares outstanding gives a projected operating EPS of $1.32 ($23.8M/18.05M).
Stock: VPRT came public at the end of October at $12, opened around $15, and could have been had easily for around $14. Since then it has rallied to around $22. At their current price, and using our projected operating earnings, and including the projected share dilution, that gives an operating P/E of 16.6($22/$1.32), which is right in line with the market multiple. Arrggh. VistaPrint seems to have been a good solid purchase at $14, but at $22 seems fully valued. I missed this one, and it doesn't seem too compelling at current prices."

Let me explain.I am more of a macro investor, so seldom do I look at stocks in out-of-favor sectors (i.e. non-discretionary retail). However, something recently appeared on my investment-radar that piqued my interest. I'll go as far as to say that I believe a fantastic opportunity has developed to purchase a quality company with solid cash flow on the cheap.The company to which I am referring is Vistaprint (VPRT). They’re the premier online supplier of high quality printing products. Since going public in late 2005, Vistaprint has had a strong track record of growth. In fact, Standard and Poor’s forecasts a 50% rise in revenue growth in FY08. Earnings are growing right alongside revenue, with a forecasted three-year CAGR of 34%. Assuming a conservative PEG multiple of 1.0%, VPRT should be trading around $40 within 12 months.Analysts are starting to take notice. Vistaprint was recently added to Goldman Sachs' “Conviction Buy List” by analyst Jennifer Watson. She expects at least a 30% upside to her $42 price target. And if that wasn’t enough, Standard and Poor’s recently upgraded the stock to “Buy” based on its valuation.Last quarter Vistaprint met analyst expectations for both revenue and EPS and also issued Q4 guidance in line with analysts' expectations. Vistaprint reaffirmed this guidance on May 14th. The only quip is that a few analysts weren’t too enthused by VPRT’s “slowing” revenue growth and narrowing gross margins. However, when taking into consideration Vistaprint’s broad international exposure, I expect the company to meet, if not beat earnings in Q4.So why would the stock price of such a company be nothing short of execrable?click to enlargeI think Vistaprint has seen its share price beaten down (with the rest of the market) for no “good” reason. I’m not one for trying to pick bottoms (after all bottom pickers tend to have stinky fingers), but I think this is too much of a bargain to pass by without at least doing your due diligence.I scooped up some shares at ~$26 and plan to add to my position on weakness, assuming, of course, that the stock isn’t defenestrated for some unforeseen reason.Let's hope savvy investors begin to take notice and the stock price starts to trade better than Microsoft's operating system performs.Disclosure: Long"

4382618,104171,2020-10-29T13:00:24-04:00,"Capital One Q3 results showed a lower provision for losses, a lower charge-off & delinquency rate, and downtrend in the customer assistance program.This has reduced the loss to common shareholder to -$0.20 for the year so far.With things trending up for the bank, and a price-to-tangible book value of 0.88x, I am buying.","Capital One Financial (COF) has had a rough year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first two quarters, the bank saw large bottom line deficits mostly attributable to higher provision for credit losses. But over these quarters, Capital One still was able to post quality credit metrics. In Q3, the bank finally posted some solid financial results. With the reserve built up in the first two quarters for expected poor results attributable to the pandemic, Capital One only posted a fraction of provision for losses in the third quarter. Again the bank showed quality metrics in Q3, and while a price-to-tangible book value of 0.88x, I am still adding to my long-term hold position. For the third quarter, Capital One posted net interest income of $5.555 billion, which was a decline of 3.17% compared to the prior year. This is due to the net interest margin contracting to 5.68% from 6.73% in Q3 of 2019. The net interest margin decreased in tandem with all other interest rates due to the pandemic and resulting monetary policy. On the other hand, total net revenue increased by 6.06% during the quarter to $7.381 billion. But, the big story for Capital One in Q3 was the provision for credit losses and net income. In Q1 and Q2, the provision for losses was massive and was the reason the bank posted losses. This was expected as Capital One was building the loss reserve, but it seems the bank either overestimated the downturn in business, handled it better than expected, or has revised the projections. In Q3, the provision for losses was only $331 million, a decrease of 92% from the Q2 level of $4.24 billion. This lower provision for credit losses resulted in a third-quarter net income of $2.406 billion, an 80.5% increase from last year. Overall, this quarter shows that the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on financials seems to be winding down.Credit MetricsLooking at the net charge-off rate and 30+ day delinquency rate for the Q3 shows the same steady trend as seen in prior months. The net-charge off rate over the last quarter was 1.72%. This is surprisingly down from 2.38% and 2.72% in Q2 and Q1. For Q3, the 30+ day delinquency rate was 2.22%, down from 2.30% in Q2 and 3.16% in Q1.Source: Capital One Q3 Earnings Call PresentationFor the total nine months that have passed this year, Capital One has seen a consistent top-line and a troubled bottom-line. Net interest income for the year so far is $17.04 billion, which is only a decrease of 1.35%. Again, much of this is due to interest rate declines that have lowered decreased net interest margin to 6.06%. Total net revenue has been flat at $21.186 billion, while provision for credit losses increased by 126% to $10 billion. As can be seen in the above graphic, the large provision for losses posted over the past nine months has bolstered the allowance coverage ratios to very protective levels. But the downside is this has resulted in very low net income, at just $148 million. After the preferred dividends are paid, the common shareholder receives -$0.20 for 2020 so far.Credit MetricsFor the total nine months, the net charge-off rate was 2.28%, and the 30+ day delinquency rate was 2.22%. Again, this is down from last year's numbers. In the first nine months of 2019, the net charge-off rate was 2.50%, and the 30+ day delinquency rate was 3.51%. But, as I have mentioned before, we have to look into the pandemic assistance program Capital One has been running to see if there is potential for poorer credit metrics in the future. COVID-19 Assistance ProgramSource: Capital One Q3 Earnings Call PresentationLooking at the two graphs above shows the most important COVID-19 customer assistance programs. In the Domestic Card segment, weekly enrollments have been relatively flat since Q2. 91% of customers have been current upon a first-time enrollment, which shows a relatively healthy customer. The cumulative Domestic Card enrollments have seen a steady downward trend, and just 0.3% of accounts are currently enrolled. The Auto segment has seen the same general trends as Domestic Card. Weekly enrollments have been steady, with re-enrollments being the reason why. Only 74% of customers in Auto were current when first enrolling in the customer assistance program. Cumulative enrollments in the Auto segment have also trended downward, and just 2.6% of accounts are enrolled today, down from over 6% in April. Overall, the trend is clear, when the nation shutdown Capital One experienced a very high enrollment rate in the customer assistance program, which has tapered off as the economy has opened. What I like most about this is that the high rate of enrollments in March through May hasn't pushed the following month's charge-off or delinquency rates up. This gives me confidence that the bank can manage this current economic environment.Financial StabilityStarting with operational metrics, the bank had a decrease in the efficiency ratio from 53.49% last year to 52.14% this year. This shows that capital one is operating more efficiently than in 2019 when looking just at underlying costs. The financial strength of Capital One is still prominent. As of the most recent quarter, the bank had a liquidity coverage ratio of 147%, a tier 1 capital rate of 14.8%, and a CET1 rate of 13%. Altogether, these metrics show just how financially stable the bank is and can handle a large downturn in the economy or business. As of writing, Capital One is trading around a price of $74 per share. As of the most recent quarter, the book value and tangible book value per share have been $116.08 and $83.67. Therefore, the bank is trading at 0.64x P/BV and 0.88x P/TBV. I have been buying Capital One as a long-term hold position, and I do believe over the next few years that the bank can return to around the average past five year EPS of $8.06. If that is the case, then Capital One would be trading at 9.18x P/E during a normal period. Capital One has posted poor financial performance this year due to high provision for losses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past nine months, this provision for losses has totaled $10 billion and has resulted in a diluted EPS of -$0.20 for the common shareholder. But things are looking up, with the release of the Q3 results and a downward trend in the customer assistance program. In Q3, Capital One only had $331 million in provision for losses, which resulted in net income of $2.406 billion. On top of this, net-charge off and 30+ day delinquency rates have decreased this quarter and over the nine months when compared to 2019. The decrease in these rates is in part due to the customer assistance program, but enrollments in this program have peaked and are trending downward. This is a great sign, as credit metrics have remained stable. Overall, Capital One has not had the greatest year, but the bank is seeing headwinds subside, still has solid financial health, and is trading at a low valuation. As a long-term hold position, I am buying Capital One at $80 or under."
4377037,24361,2020-09-30T14:18:41-04:00,"Investors are concerned about the possibility of another cut to Capital One's dividend, but a pause in the dividend is likely to be fairly brief given healthy capital and reserving.Capital One has used a fairly conservative set of underlying assumptions for its reserving, and its reserve levels for cards look good relative to past loss experiences.Recent credit card and auto loan data has been better than expected, as government stimulus efforts are blunting the negative impact of COVID-19 on consumer credit.Capital One is not a typical bank and the value proposition is likewise a little different; priced between more conservatively-run (and better-loved) banks and riskier names, Capital One's return potential looks good, but not extraordinary.","If you doubt the impact of stimulus on the economy, at least in the short term, take a look at Capital One Financial’s (COF) August card data, wherein charge-offs and delinquencies for both credit cards and auto loans were lower than in the year-ago period… when there was no COVID-19 and the unemployment rate was around 3.7% (instead of the 8.4% in August). While the COVID-19 recession is by no means over, and there are still plenty of questions as to what future stimulus, if any, will look like, I would argue the odds are improving that these efforts will help “tide the consumer over” until the economy recovers, leading to lower overall loan loss rates than previously expected.Capital One remains an odd sort of bank, and really more of a bank-consumer finance hybrid. While it does make commercial and consumer loans, cards dominate the business. Likewise, while the bank does have a deposit-gathering franchise, including both branch-based banking and online operations, the overall cost of funds is still relatively high. Appreciated for what it is, I do believe that Capital One is undervalued today, but that’s the rule and not the exception these days in the banking sector, and I can see some near-term volatility risk from credit risk and capital returns.The short-term payouts from banks seem to have become something of an obsession for investors. Although Capital One’s capital position looks okay to me at this point, the Fed’s policy of basing dividend payouts on a running total of the prior four quarters’ net income could possibly lead to another cut and the risk of zero dividends in Q4 ’20 and Q1 ’21. To be clear this is not my base-case scenario, and with unemployment and credit trends tracking better than expected over the last quarter-and-a-half, I think it’s increasingly less likely, but it is still a risk that is in place for the next couple of quarters.A lot of what I say about Capital One’s near-term credit and capital position is going to carry the caveat of “for now”, as the business model is pretty sensitive to relatively small changes in assumptions. Along those lines, a lot of large industrial companies have been warning that the on-the-ground recovery isn’t looking as strong as the Street seems to be pricing in to stocks. So, if the economy is actually wobblier than believed, and particularly if there’s no additional stimulus, there could be some increased pressure in the near-term.That’s particularly true in consideration of the fact we’re still early in this credit cycle – in the past, it has taken anywhere from five to nine quarters after the start of a recession for bank credit losses to peak, so I don’t think we really know yet whether any bank’s reserves are truly adequate.What’s In the Cards?Specific to Capital One, the bank exited the second quarter with a 6.7% reserve position (reserves to loans), which is good for about 48% of the Fed’s severely-adverse loss estimate. Cards are reserved to 11.3%, with 13.5% in the Capital One-branded portfolios (private label business is protected in part by loss-sharing arrangements). That card reserve is at 53% of the Fed’s severely-adverse estimate, but also higher than the 9.15% charge-off ratio Capital One saw in 2009 (the highest one-year ratio) and the 10.3% ratio seen in the first quarter of 2010 (the highest single quarter).Looking at other card players, Capital One’s reserving looks appropriate. JPMorgan (JPM) has reserved a little more aggressively for card losses (12.6%), while Citigroup (C) is similar to COF at 11.5%. American Express’s (AXP) lower reserves (8.3%) make sense in the context of a lower-risk portfolio, though the lower reserving for Discover (DFS) (9.3%) is a little more puzzling to me. Among smaller players in cards, PNC (PNC) has been predictably conservative (15.3%), while U.S. Bancorp (USB) has not (10.1%).As I referenced in the open, recent trends have actually been pretty good as far as credit goes, with consumers supported in part by stimulus efforts. Card charge-offs in the month of August were 3.74% - down from 4.18% the year-ago and below the 4.5% average of the last 10 years and the 4.4% average of the last five years. Compared to peers, Capital One’s charge-offs are a little higher than Discover, but better than Synchrony (SYF) and this is pretty typical. Delinquencies, too, are holding up, with August down more than a point year over year to 2.23%.Corporate Still Has Some IssuesOutside of cards, commercial criticized loans have started to increase, with criticized C&I balances rising 75% qoq and CRE up 175%, for an overall increase of more than 91% qoq. At over 8% of loan balances, Capital One skews to the high side of criticized commercial loan balances, though Wells Fargo (WFC) and M&T (MTB) are higher still and the NPL/loan ratio is lower than average.Capital One has reserved about 2.7% of its commercial loans, which is a bit light relative to the Fed’s severely adverse scenario, but not troublingly so. As has been the case for many banks, Capital One’s exposure to oil/gas lending (around 4% of the portfolio) has driven elevated levels of criticized loans, non-performing loans, and loan reserves.Auto And A Little PerspectiveI think it’s also worth noting that auto loan trends have been pretty favorable too. Charge-offs fell to just 0.2% in the month of August (down 130bp year over year), while delinquencies fell almost three points to 3.6%. At the same time, loan balances rose 10% year over year, as Capital One remains a very willing lender in this category (including subprime auto) at a time when many have exited the market.I also want to talk briefly about Capital One’s underlying reserving assumptions. With economic assumptions that include 11.5% unemployment at year-end 2020 and 8.1% at year-end 2021, as well as no further government stimulus, I believe that Capital One’s underlying economic assumptions are among the most conservative/bearish on the Street. If readers are wondering about the other side of the coin, Citi and Regions (RF) are among the most bullish. In any case, with healthy reserves relative to past cycle losses and recent economic trends that look better than the underlying assumptions Capital One has based its reserves on, I’d say the bank is in good shape on credit.While Capital One runs an unconventional strategy for a bank, it works for them. Capital One has to pay more for its funds, right now it has among the highest-yielding 36-month CDs, along with offerings from Synchrony, Discover, and Signature (SBNY), but it also generates very large loan yields (9.15% in Q2) and net interest spreads (5.8% in Q2) on the back of its card and auto lending.Some analysts and investors are worried that management will look to accelerate marketing spending once it hits its “42 in 21” target (a 42% efficiency ratio in 2021), but I don’t believe management is suddenly going to lose spending discipline. I also find the concerns about increased tech spending to be misplaced – online services are a growth driver from Capital One (it has one of the top-rated apps) and I believe it’s more cost/capital-effective to invest in tech to drive growth than in physical branches.As I said, I do see some risk to the Capital One story, and I can’t/won’t ignore the risk of another cut to the divided, though if that should happen, I believe it would be restored by mid-2021. A lot now rides on how the economy develops; I believe Capital One has been prudent, if not conservative, in its decision-making but you don’t know if you’re assumptions are adequate until they’re tested in the real world… and we’re going to see that over the next three to six quarters, I believe.I expect Capital One to rebound after an ugly 2020, but I believe it will take four to five years to regain 2019 levels of profitability. I do believe Capital One can regain a low double-digit ROE over time, but certainly not in an environment of zero (or near-zero) rates. As is, I’m expecting a long-term core earnings growth rate of around 2%, with a high single-digit ROTCE next year and a double-digit number in 2022.Between discounted core earnings and ROTCE-driven P/TBV, I believe Capital One is undervalued. At the same time, though, almost all banks look undervalued, and Capital One slots in between higher-quality/lower-risk names like JPMorgan and PNC and higher-risk/higher-return ideas like Citi. If you’re relatively bullish on the economy, I think Capital One has more leverage to outperformance, but if you’re bearish, this may not be the name for you given the risk of higher loan losses and more pressure on pre-provision profits in 2021 and 2022."
4381426,92586,2020-10-26T15:25:31-04:00,"Capital One blew expectations out of the water in the third quarter. However, I remain concerned about the space in general.Key revenue drivers deteriorated YOY, particularly in credit card. But there was enough good news to trigger post-earnings bullishness.I would not dare approach the financial services sector unless I do it with top credit quality and business model diversification in mind.","Capital One (COF) has handily topped expectations in the third quarter. While analysts expected revenues to drop 3.5% YOY, the consumer bank delivered the widest top-line beat of the past five years, at least. Driven by higher revenues, especially on the non-interest side and a release of credit reserves, non-GAAP EPS of $5.05 also caught Wall Street by surprise.But the headline numbers, as good as they were, do not give me the necessary confidence to bet heavily on the consumer banking space. In my view, the combination of (1) lower spending and consumer leveraging, (2) a potential deterioration in credit driven by the COVID-19 crisis and lack of further government stimulus, and (3) unfavorable interest rate environment conspire against Capital One and its direct peers in the foreseeable future.Credit: Capital OneRegarding the top line and compared to the rest of the space, Capital One did very well in the third quarter. Sure, the key revenue drivers deteriorated YOY, particularly in the credit card segment (58% of total revenues). But what matters most, in this case, are the actual results delivered compared to de-risked expectations, which may explain why investors seemed pleased with the company's performance - as suggested by a stock that spiked 3% between the release of the earnings report and Friday's opening bell.Take credit card balances as an example. Capital One's 9% decline in ending loans did not look great on the surface and reflected the consumers' defensive stance in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty. However, the deterioration was less pronounced compared to the Big 4's comparable numbers (see graph below). Also, when it comes to purchase volume, Capital One's 1% decline was very modest when contrasted against American Express' (AXP) overall billed business decline of 20%.Source: DM Martins Research, data from multiple reportsCapital One also saw decent results further down the P&L. Lower marketing expenses justified by COVID-19 conservativeness, a very different approach to American Express' ""investment for the long term"", pushed non-interest expenses down sharply YOY. Capital One's tightening underwriting standards also helped to lower credit costs.These factors, coupled with two large unusual items associated with equity investment and asset disposition, helped to push Capital One's EPS to the highest levels that I have seen in years.Third quarter results aside, I continue to be highly concerned about the consumer banking space. The COVID-19 crisis is far from being resolved, and cases have been rising in the northern hemisphere. Rather than providing the fiscal stimulus needed to help offset the economic headwinds, the branches of the US government have reached an impasse. I expect the consequences to be a combination of deleveraging and rising delinquency, leading to lower loan balances and possibly higher credit costs.To be fair, Capital One seems to be navigating the choppy waters well. But, at the same time, the company is one of the most exposed to the consumer vertical at the lower end of the credit quality spectrum (see chart below). Should the industry fundamentals deteriorate, I expect Capital One to feel the pinch before any of its key competitors might.Source: DM Martins Research, data from Seeking AlphaCOF is a fairly cheap stock that trades at 9.3x next year's projected EPS and 6.9x the following year's earnings estimate. However, in the current environment, I would not dare approach the financial services sector unless I do it with top credit quality and business model diversification in mind. For this reason, I remain bullish AXP for the long run (despite short-term pain expectations) and bearish COF."
4371025,78115,2020-08-27T04:04:54-04:00,"Capital One reported losses for the second consecutive quarter, and cut dividends by 75%.COF's heavy credit card and auto tilt in loan book is a problem.Though trading below book, time is not ripe to buy COF yet.","Capital One Financial (COF) reported losses higher than USD 1bn for the second consecutive quarter, as it continues to build reserves. Given that more than 80% of revenues come from net interest income, of which 60% comes from the card business, the top line was hit really hard. Capital looks okay, but don’t hope for a dividend reinstatement in 2020-22.Let me drill down.Net interest income (NII) fell 9% QoQ (-5% YoY) as margins narrowed. COF’s net interest margin (NIM) contraction was the worst among large peers. Margins nosedived 100bps QoQ to 5.78% - the lowest in the past decade. But I believe that there is some upside to NIM from yield improvement as well as declines in deposit costs.More than 40% of COF’s loan book is in the credit card business, which was hit really hard in terms of growth rates, as consumers curtailed spending. Overall, loan book declined 4% QoQ.There is no hope of a significant near-term rebound in loan book. Customers have been paying down more of their credit card outstanding, while staying away from spending.Deposits continued rising, this time jumping 13% QoQ or USD 35bn:Capital One’s deposit franchise is weak, as denoted by the low proportion of noninterest-bearing deposits. Sure, such deposits bear no value in a zero-rate environment. But, in a rising rate environment (that won’t come until after 2022), they are valuable, and COF’s funding costs will rise more than peers in such a scenario.Unlike other banks, COF brings in only less than a fifth of its revenues in non-interest income.Non-interest income in 2Q fell 10% QoQ, led by interchange fees:Costs rose 1% QoQ (flat YoY) despite cutbacks in the credit card segment.Taken together, I’m not expecting positive operating leverage in 2020-21.COF had guided for achieving 42% “operating efficiency ratio” by 2021 (this probably means an unadjusted efficiency ratio of around 50%). While the management reiterated its commitment to save costs, it did not re-commit to the 2021 timeline to achieve the target ratio. The bank is on course to exit its use of data centers and complete its migration to the cloud this year, which is expected to bring in a lot of savings.Asset quality metrics are artificially low, thanks to government and Fed stimulus, as well as banks’ forbearance programs. Customers are deferring auto payments, but paying down their credit cards which is the main line of business at COF.Capital One’s CET1 ratio is quite strong at 12.4% - much higher than the internal target of 11% and the regulatory minimum of 10.1% (effective Oct’20). However, on an adjusted basis, I estimate that the ratio is around 11.1% - after removing the CECL transition benefits and exemptions from considering part of the 1Q reserve build.Given the new Fed rules on dividend payouts, COF reduced quarterly dividends to USD 0.10 per share from USD 0.40 earlier. It is highly likely that this dividend level will continue in the short term, as I expect the CET1 ratio to slide below the management target of 11% in 2022. So, 2023 might be a good time to expect a reinstatement of previous DPS levels.COF trades at 0.85x my estimate of one-year forward tangible book value per share (TBVPS). That’s two standard deviations below the historical average of 1.3x implying a 50% upside.I demand at least 12% returns from large diversified US banks. So, I use an even higher cost of equity (COE) to discount Capital One’s numbers, due to the increased riskiness and concentration of the loan portfolio, apart from a less-diversified revenue stream. Medium-term sustainable return on tangible equity (ROTE) might be closer to the COE and so I do not expect the stock to trade at a premium to TBVPS.At the current price of around USD 67, I don’t expect more than 5-10% annual return over the next 3-5 years. Don’t buy COF yet.My neutral view on COF can change if we start seeing hints of economic revival sooner, encouraging customers to step up their card usage and auto purchases. Together, these two constitute two-thirds of the loan book and three-fourths of the credit costs.Wells Fargo (WFC) is my top pick, followed by Bank of America (BAC).This article first appeared on TheBankingAnalyst.com"
4372869,104171,2020-09-07T06:11:58-04:00,Capital One has increased provision for credit losses by 219% which has resulted in net losses each quarter.The bank has very solid financial strength shown by good capital ratios and liquidity coverage.The stock is trading below book and tangible book values.,"In April, I wrote Capitalize On Capital One Financial, which showed that the bank has very solid past profitability and strong financial strength. In the article I stated that because Capital One (COF) was trading almost 50% off of 2019 book value of $127.05 I was starting a position. Two full quarters later, I am checking up on the business to see just where it stands. The past two quarters have been tough but the concern of forbearance to me is not a huge long-term concern. Therefore, with Capital One trading below tangible book value I will keep adding to my position.Q1 for Capital One starts in January and ends in March, therefore it only received some exposure from the pandemic. Net revenue in Q1 was $7.249 Billion, up 2% compared to Q1 2019. But net income was not pretty with a loss of $1.34 Billion which is down a whopping 194.9% from Q1 2019 net income of $1.412 Billion. What was the reason for this decline? Well, due to COVID-19 Capital One increased the provision for credit losses by 220% from prior year to a total of $5.423 Billion. Just for comparison sake in 2019, Q1 provisions were just $1.693 Billion. This is what is expected though from such an uncertain event like a pandemic, as banks try to estimate the expected losses. The net interest margin for the quarter one stayed rather flat at 6.78%, only decreasing by 8 basis points from Q1 2019.Q2 was much worse as it is from April to June and consisted of much of the lockdown period and layoffs. Net revenue was down -8% in Q2 coming in at $6.556 Billion from $7.124 Billion in Q2 2019. Provision for credit losses was a bit lower than last quarter at $4.246 Billion but still increased 216% from prior year. This resulted in another loss of $0.918 Billion. The net interest margin was 5.78%, falling 1.02% due to lower rates in general and a shift in asset mix from less credit card to more consumer & commercial banking.Overall, the six months when put together were bad but could have been worse. Net revenue was $13.805 Billion, down 3% from $14.207 Billion. Again, as expected the provision for losses was the main negative factor increasing 219% for the six months and totaling $9.669 Billion. The provisions created a net loss of $2.258 Billion.Charge-Off & ForbearanceSource: Seeking Alpha NewsThe main topic of discussion within the investment community regarding Capital One has been charge-off rates and the forbearance banks have extended to customers. Above are the reported monthly charge-off and delinquency rates. What can be seen is that since March these rates have been decreasing. In fact, for Q1 the net charge of rate and 30+ day delinquency rate was 2.72% and 3.16%, while in Q2 it was 2.38% and 2.30%. This looks great at first sight, but everyone knows that banks have offered forbearance on many accounts that would skew or delay bad metrics.Source: Capital One Q2 Earnings Call PresentationLuckily, Capital One has provided some color on the forbearance and customer assistance front. In the Q1 earnings call, CEO Richard Fairbank stated that as of April 17th forbearance in domestic credit was 2% of total loan balances and 1% of active accounts. For auto, it was stated at 11% of total loan balance and 9% of all customers. In Q2, the company provided us with the graphics above which show the domestic card and auto forbearance enrollments since March.What can be seen is that from April 17th, the situation got marginally worse and then exponentially better. With the trend of no longer enrolled increasing over the months only 0.6% of domestic card and 3.4% of auto accounts have forbearance. This is a much better picture than in April, but it is to be noted that customers can/may re-enroll, therefore keeping an eye on what information Capital One puts out is vital.Source: Federal Reserve 2020 Stress TestWhat is also important to look at is the financial standing of the bank. Capital One posted an efficiency ratio in Q1 of 51.44% and 57.5% in Q2. Over the six months, the bank became less efficient with a ratio of 54.32%, an increase of 2% from 2019. The Tier 1 capital rate and CET1 rate for the most recent quarter was 14.2% and 12.4%. Above are the most recent stress test results from the Federal Reserve showing that Capital One has very solid capitalization. On top of this, the bank currently has a 146% liquidity coverage ratio.Currently, Capital One is trading at around $74 per share. Obviously, the bank is not posting much if anything for earnings this year. But because I am a long-term investor, I plan on trying to take advantage of this possible decade lows. Therefore, looking at the average 10-year EPS of $7.36, we have a P/E of 10.05x. On top of this, Capital One has a current book value per share of $122.61 and a tangible book value of $78.82 meaning that the bank is trading at 0.60x and 0.94x each.Overall, I think that although current financial results are not pretty but they are also not as bad as they could be. While there has been much talk of the forbearance effect on charge-off rates the information the bank has provided shows the trend is positive. Capital One is also very well-capitalized with solid capital rates and a good liquidity coverage ratio. On top of all this is the fact the next 5-10 years will more than likely be normal. Therefore, at the current price I am definitely going to keep adding to my position as the valuation is below tangible book and total book values."

It was a global nightmare, complete with a pandemic and mass lockdowns, in addition to exceptionally large civil unrest. As an investor, one must take a longer-term perspective and grasp the opportunity to buy attractive businesses at large discounts to intrinsic value. Such an opportunity exists with the common stock of Capital One Financial (COF). The bank is well-capitalized and boasts enormous earnings power. Loan loss reserves are conservative, and the worst is now behind them. Investors looking out 2-3 years could see 40-50% total return gains from here.COF has a large amount of credit exposure in some of the hardest hit areas of this recession such as energy, credit cards, and auto loans. The actual credit performance though has been good, bolstered by government stimulus and deferment measures. The progression between stimulus and government assistance, to jobs and economic growth will be critical, but COF is now reserved for an immensely draconian scenario. CECL accounting front-loads the loan losses, setting up the stage for earnings growth to gain momentum soon.Source: COF 2Q Investor PresentationOn July 21st, COF reported a net loss for the 2nd quarter of $918MM, or $2.21 per diluted common share. Adjusted losses were $1.61 per share. Pre-provision earnings decreased 21% to $2.8 billion, while the provision for credit losses was a hefty $4.2 billion. Net interest margin decreased 100 basis points QoQ and 102bps YoY, respectively, due to higher average cash balances and lower average loans, partially offset by lower interest rate paid on deposits. This quarter should represent the trough on net interest income and NIM should improve as well, as the company reduces its cash holdings into higher yielding loans and investments.All of Capital One’s business divisions were unprofitable on the quarter, mostly due to reserve builds. In Credit Card, ending loans were down 4% YoY, or $4.8 billion, while purchase volume was down 16%. Revenue was down 8% YoY, or $355M, while non-interest expense was down $284MM, or 13% YoY. The provision for credit losses was up $1.8 billion or 169% YoY. The net charge-off rate was 4.46%. Like most banks, COF has a large customer assistance program. 92% of customers that enrolled were current at the time of enrollment. 2% of active accounts, representing 3% of loans outstanding enrolled. Of the 2%, 1.4% (70%) of the total are no longer enrolled meaning they made a payment. 40 bps of the customer base are enrolled and skipped their payment as permitted. 20 bps of the customer base are still enrolled and are eligible to skip their next payment.In Consumer Banking, ending loans were up $6.4 billion, or 11% YoY. Ending deposits were up $41.6 billion, or 20% YoY. For auto loans, 75% of customers were current at first enrollment. 14% of accounts, representing 16% of loans outstanding requested assistance. 10.7% are no longer enrolled, meaning they are making payments. 2.2% were enrolled last month and skipped their payment as permitted. 1.2% are enrolled and are eligible to skip their next payment. In Commercial Banking, ending loans were up $5.5 billion, or 8% YoY. Ending deposits were up $4.9 billion, or 16% YoY. Criticized performing loan rate was 7.7%, up from 3.6% in Q1. The criticized nonperforming loan rate ended at .9%, up from .6% after Q1. COF has $5.718 billion of exposure to Commercial Oil and Gas, but has a 9.3% allowance for credit losses, or $530MM. Energy prices have recovered a bit and much of this exposure is secured, so it is tough to imagine losses greatly exceeding its loan loss reserves.The company ended the quarter with a common Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.4%, up from 12% at the end of Q1, so the bank has a nice cushion to its 10.1% capital requirement. Period-end loans held for investment decreased $11.5 billion to $251.5 billion, while period-end total deposits increased $34.5 billion to $304.2 billion. Tangible book value per share ended the quarter at $78.82, down from $80.68 at the end of Q1. COF reduced its dividend of $.4 per quarter to $.1 per quarter and has 456.7MM shares outstanding. Capital One’s economic forecast includes unemployment in 2nd quarter of 16.9%, falling to 11.5% at the end of 2020, and gradually improving throughout 2021 to 8.1%. That is one of the more conservative outlooks I have seen.After the massive reserve build, COF looks well prepared to deal with future loan losses. Credit cards reserve of $12.091 billion are 11.27% of total credit card loans. Consumer banking and Commercial banking have a 4.25% and 2.46%, allowance coverage, respectively. The bank has 6.69% of allowance coverage ratio for total loans, which is up from 2.71% at December 31, 2019. CECL accounting requires banks to reserve for the life of the loans, so if the economy performs a bit better than expected, COF could be in a position to release loan loss reserves in the future, but it seems likely loan loss reserves have peaked. COF has $149.146 billion in Total Liquidity Reserves, for an LCR of 146%.At a recent price of $64, COF has a market capitalization of just over $29 billion. This is remarkably cheap for a company that could earn between $4-6 billion per annum in a more normal environment. At 81% of tangible book value, we get a fantastic franchise with extremely conservative loan loss reserves, and a massive earnings power. This is the type of investment that we like, and we should not have to wait too long to start seeing profits again and book value per share growth. We believe COF is worth at least $90 per share, giving us roughly 40-50% upside potential."

Analysts don't seem too concerned about lack of top-line firepower, as consensus revenue decline currently sits at a mere 4%. EPS is projected to dig deep into negative territory, but the final number will depend greatly on the size of the credit reserve build-up that is expected to hit the P&L.Credit: Upgraded PointsFrom top to bottom, it is hard to find many reasons to be optimistic about Capital One's 2Q financial performance.Big Bank earnings week already suggested that Consumer has been the softest segment among top diversified financial services companies, with Corporate Banking and Trading saving the space from an ugly wipeout during the period. As a reminder, Capital One is very much a ""pure play"" consumer bank that will not have the crutch of institutional clients to break its fall.Starting from the top line, I expect to see a combination of bearish forces acting on the two main drivers of revenues: loan balances and interest margin. The former should be impacted by lower levels of consumer spending coupled with a defensive stance that has been leading to a decrease in household debt recently. On the margin side, a yield curve that is flatter and closer to zero will probably not help much. Just for reference, Bank of America's (BAC) net interest yield ex-global markets dropped by an eye-catching 71 bps sequentially in the second quarter.Source: D.M. Martins Research, using data from multiple reportsWhen it comes to credit expenses, I would not dare guess what the added provision for losses might look like, but I expect it to be sizable. Not a single of the banks that I have followed during this earnings season seemed optimistic about the macroeconomic landscape going forward. I fear for Capital One the most, since it tends to have the lowest credit quality customer base - precisely the demographic group that I expect to bear the brunt of the COVID-19 crisis. See graph below on delinquencies and charge-offs between March and May.In my view, any upside to bottom-line expectations would have to come from non-interest expense management. Here, Capital One has a chance to support margins a bit through its digital transformation efforts. Failure to manage the P&L and cash flow tightly could cause fears over a dividend cut to resurface.Source: D.M. Martins Research, data from Seeking AlphaIn exchange for such meaningful headwinds, COF is now a very cheap stock. Shares still trade 43% off peak levels reached in early January 2020 (see chart below), which could encourage bargain hunters to pay closer attention to this name. But in my view, the lower price tag is merely a reflection of the risks associated with investing in COF specifically, and consumer finance generally, amid a period of economic uncertainty.Were I to invest in the financial services sector today, I would probably approach it from a place of quality and business model diversification. That said, I would consider JPMorgan (JPM) first. As a plan B, I would likely favor strong institutional banks like Goldman Sachs (GS) or Morgan Stanley (MS), which have been relative winners so far in 2020.In my opinion, COF is too risky a value approach that I would rather stay away from ahead of earnings.Data by YCharts"
4355049,105052,2020-06-22T15:35:51-04:00,A less than favourable macroeconomic picture.Far from sufficient funds to cope with credit losses.The recent pullback from lows offers remaining investors the opportunity to exit their positions.,"As we all know, banks make handsome profits when everything is rosy in the garden with the economy. However, when times are tough, the situation can turn sour very quickly. Take Capital One Financial (COF), the impact COVID-19 had on the first quarter results was substantial, even though COVID-19 only affected business in the last two weeks of March. For context, let us not forget, that the first recorded COVID-19 related death in New York occurred in March and only 32 states had imposed lockdown by the end of the month. How much worse will Capital One’s second quarterly results be is the question investors ought to ask, given that the bank will have had to deal with a full three months of COVID-19 related issues. Bad, very very bad is my opinion.Let’s take a look at a selection of economic indicators and how they relate to Capital One Financial. To begin with, we have the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, commonly known as CAPE or Shiller P/E, which is a valuation tool commonly applied to the US S&P 500 equity market. It is chiefly used to gauge probable future returns from stocks over longer timescales, with higher than average CAPE values suggesting lower than average long-term annual average returns. From the chart below, as you may note, the CAPE indicates the current figure as 29.16x, by comparison, the mean over the period shown is 16.72x. In essence, this implies the stocks that comprise the S&P 500 are, on average, overvalued, and so the pressure of a large further move up in stock prices is low.Chart courtesy mutipl.comAnother commonly used ratio to determine value is attributed to perhaps the most renowned investor of our age, Warren Buffett. The stock market cap to GDP ratio has become known as the Buffett Indicator and is a form of Price/Sales valuation multiple for an entire country. It is a widely used method of determining whether the country’s stock market is fully valued or undervalued, compared to a historical mean.Chart courtesy longertermtrendsIt is immediately apparent from the chart above that the ratio suggests that the market is at present a tad overvalued. Could this be the reason for Berkshire Hathaway’s $137 billion cash pile? Or has Mr Buffett lost his touch, as some pundits have suggested? I would put forward the idea that Warren Buffett is taking his own advice, after all, he believes the ratio that bears his name is “probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.”While the Buffett Indicator is a marvellous high-level measure, it is not without its drawbacks. For instance, it doesn’t take into consideration the profitability of businesses, only their basic revenue figure, which can be deceiving. Also, as you may note from the chart, the ratio has been trending higher for quite some time and thus, many market commentators question its validity.Despite the drawbacks of this ratio, the main message highlighted by the chart adds weight to the previous assertion that stocks are, by many measures, a fraction overpriced and that there is now little reason for stock prices to advance much further.In the interests of fairness, I will mention that there are opposing views to the notion that stocks are overvalued. One such metric is the Brock Value, which in short, takes heed of both GDP and the prevailing interest rates. Currently, the Brock Value maintains that the S & P should be around 4,100, considerably above today’s number. I would also add that stock buyers may not be cognizant of the various measures theorizing a lower stock price and push prices even higher.Ultimately, stock holders are interested in earnings and improved shareholder value. Some of the more recent headlines indicate that there will be a regrettable decline in both earnings and value for Capital One Financial.As is common knowledge, the unemployment rate in the US and the rest of the world is extremely high, as the table below shows.Table courtesy Trading EconomicsIt takes no great leap of imagination to realize that companies in the business of consumer finance will be hit hard as a result of this high unemployment rate. On top of this, small business owners are struggling to pay their various fixed costs.Numerous portents of gloomy times ahead for Capital One have appeared in the news. US citizens are deferring auto loan, credit card payments and other forms of debt at a staggering rate. Needles to say, this situation is a catastrophe for both earnings and value creation for Capital One investors. Simon Property Group (SPG) has also been in the news for all the wrong reasons. Recent media reports have noted that the company has begun suing tenants for non-payment of rent. Clearly, these types of action will have the effect of reducing still further the ability of small businesses to repay bank loans.Prior to delving into some of the pertinent details given in the quarterly report, it may be useful to review Capital One’s business.Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries provide a broad selection of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients. There are three major business segments: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking.. • Credit Card: Consists of domestic consumer and small business card lending, and international card businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom.• Consumer Banking: Consists of deposit accounts and lending activities for consumers and small businesses, and national auto lending.• Commercial Banking: Consists of lending, business accounts, capital markets and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. The commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $20 million and $2 billion.On the 23rd April, capital One announced a quarterly loss for the first quarter of 2020 of $1.3 billion, or $3.10 per diluted common share, compared with net income of $1.2 billion, or $2.25 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2019. From the table, it can be clearly seen that the reason for the slump in EPS was the provision for credit losses. Bear in mind that at this stage, the US was only two weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic and was not in complete lockdown. Since these results, there has been a worsening of business conditions, to put it mildly.Table courtesy Capital One FinancialOn the Q1 conference call, Richard Fairbank, Chairman and CEO, lauded the bank’s readiness to combat the inevitable credit losses resulting from the chaos brought about by the lockdown. Evidence for this assertion was provided in the form of the 2019 Annual Stress Test. Upon reading the document and listening the conference call a number of flaws in the methodology for the test were exposed. Firstly, one of the adverse variables was an unemployment rate of 9.9%, right now, as you may see in the previous table, it’s 13.3%. The other three variables were; the home price index, the commercial real estate index and interest rates at 0.5%. Conspicuous by its absence was any mention of business failures or the inability of businesses to repay loans!As you may have surmised, my expectation is for a truly awful second quarter report in July for the reasons I have outlined. As far as I can judge, there will be further enormous provisions for credit losses, thus destroying shareholder value.Without doubt the outlook for Capital One is far from positive due to the macroeconomic situation brought about by the pandemic. Whilst I accept that the bank has amongst the strongest balance sheet of any bank, I fear that the money made available will be far from adequate.Given the very poor outlook for Capital One, I have shorted the stock. This was quite inexpensive as my broker charges a mere 0.25% annually plus normal commissions. I have also bought August $70 put options at $7.05. Of course, dear reader, we must all make our own decisions."
4359766,92586,2020-07-21T19:57:04-04:00,"Capital One delivered ugly top- and bottom-line results that fell short of what I believed to be fairly aggressive analyst expectations.The bank was not immune to any of the sector-wide headwinds: lower debt balances, squeezed interest margins, and higher credit risks.The time is more appropriate for cautious, calculated, and better diversified bets on the highest quality banking stocks - not COF.","This is how I started my recently-published earnings preview. Not much of a surprise to me, the consumer bank delivered ugly top- and bottom-line results that fell short of analysts' expectations. As a result, the stock sold off in after-hours trading, dipping below the $60/share mark once again.Credit: pymnts.comIt was hard to think of one scenario in which Capital One would deliver encouraging second quarter results. Enough had been shared by large banks in the current earnings season to suggest that consumer finance has undergone perhaps the toughest quarter since the Great Recession at least. Among the bearish developments in the sector were lower debt balances, squeezed interest margins, and higher-than-expected credit risks.Lo and behold, Capital One was not immune to any of these headwinds. In the largest credit card business, ending loans were down 4% YOY on the back of substantially lower card spending, as consumers take a defensive stance towards the current crisis. Although personal banking looked much better due to healthy activity in auto, the sharp 100-bp drop in net interest margin ensured lack of top-line traction.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from multiple reportsSee graph above. As I suggested in my preview, analysts seemed a bit too complacent about their revenue projections ahead of earnings, after having already seen terrible consumer numbers come out of the likes of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). In the end, Capital One's YOY revenue decrease of nearly 8% was about twice as bad as the Street had forecasted, and fell between JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) and Citigroup's (NYSE:C) comparable consumer banking metrics for the quarter.Further down the P&L, the $2.7 billion in additional credit loss reserve (on top of the $3.6 billion booked in the first quarter) was the headline-making number. But, to me, most discouraging was the adjusted operating efficiency ratio of 49% that was substantially worse, both sequentially and YOY. While I hoped that tight opex management could have provided some bottom-line support in 2Q20, I am afraid that a good chunk of the sizable 57-cent miss to EPS consensus may have come from Capital One's failure to do a better job on this front.The good news for most banks is that 2Q20 could mark the rock bottom in P&L results for financial services companies. But, in the case of Capital One, I still have some doubts that this might be the case.First, the company is a pure-play consumer bank that could be exposed to further declines in consumer activity driven by the COVID-19 crisis and/or ensuing economic downturn. Second, the bank caters to a lower-credit quality consumer segment that I believe to be most sensible to economic instability. The graph below illustrates my point from the perspective of charge offs and delinquencies.Source: D.M. Martins Research, data from Seeking AlphaEven though COF is one of the cheapest stocks within the global banking sector, I don't think that it is a good idea to invest in the space today with a bargain-hunting attitude. I believe that the time is more appropriate for cautious, calculated, and better diversified bets on the highest quality stocks, a group that likely includes JPM and a couple others."
4339168,104171,2020-04-22T14:05:11-04:00,Capital One is one of the largest banks in the nation.The company has some very strong capital ratios and a history of good returns.The company is priced at 50% of book value.,"Capital One Financial (COF) is a diversified bank holding company that provides many various services. The company operates in three segments; Credit Card, Consumer Banking, & Commercial Banking. Many believe virus woes will increase charge offs and delinquencies within these segments, but I am buying due to the strong financial health and steady growth of the bank.Source: CNBCCapital One Financial has shown solid profitability and growth over the past decade. Revenue has grown at a CAGR of 5.86% a year and net income at 7.36% over the past 10 years. Capital One also has an average 10 year net interest margin and return on assets of 6.844% and 1.275% respectively. The banks efficiency ratio as of 2019 was 54.15% and the 10 year average is 53.83%. Capital One is close to that optimal 50% level and the bank has been very consistent at maintaining the efficiency ratio at around 53% all decade. Ideally, I would like to see the ratio be consistently trending downward but there is no problem with the level the bank is at now and the stability in this metric.Capital One has exceptional capital ratios with a tier 1 capital rate of 13.7% and a CET1 rate of 12.2% as of 2019. According to the Basel III Capital rules for a bank to be considered well capitalized it must have a tier 1 capital ratio above 8% and CET1 of 6.5%. Therefore, Capital One is easily considered well capitalized and has a solid cushion to cover exposures. Also to note by the table below is that Capital One has almost double the ratio than what is the minimum for a severely adverse economic event according to Federal Reserve stress testing. This coverage and financial strength should bode well to hold over the institution through COVID-19.Source: Federal ReserveThe nonperforming asset ratio is another metric I like to look at and for Capital One it has always been very low with a 10 year average of 0.649% of the total loan book. For fiscal year 2019 the nonperforming ratio was lower than the average at 0.39%.Source: My Bank Tracker The big fear I keep hearing during this COVID-19 event is that Capital One may be seeing strong increases in delinquencies and charge offs over the next few months. The average 10 year charge off rate for the bank is 2.541% a year. As for delinquencies the 10 year average rate for all periods is 3.447%.The real concern here is that Capital One has already been seeing rising charge off and delinquency rates in 2020 and COVID-19 will not be helping that issue. There is some solace in the fact that the process of charging off an account is not an overnight process. For example, credit cards are charged off after 180 days, auto and small business loans after 120 days, and commercial loans are charged off as the bank sees fit. The quickest amount of time an account will be charged off is due to bankruptcy which is 30-60 days after. I think it is fair to say that there is a concern here, but it will not come extremely quick. Therefore the real factor in if these rates come up is how long the COVID-19 shutdown lasts, and as of writing this article we could see stay at home orders lifted as early as May. This all being said in 2019 alone the net charge off rate was 2.53% and the delinquency rate was 3.74%. What's not great news is the last monthly report shows a charge off rate at 4.68% for February and a past 3 month total at 4.51%. On this same report the delinquency rate for February was 3.88% and for 3 months was 3.97%. As can be seen the past monthly report shows that these numbers have increased but the thing is that the first numbers are yearly totals so keeping an eye on these reports is crucial. Again, the long term effect that higher charge off and delinquencies could have on Capital One are all depend on how long COVID-19 shutdowns last.Capital One has seen a huge decrease in valuation due to the COVID-19 fears with a close to 50% decline in price from its 52 week high of $107.59. Therefore, the P/E ratio has also dropped considerably and stands at around 4.9x 2019 EPS of $11.05. Using the 10 year average EPS of $7.36 the P/E at $54 a share is 7.34x. The price to book value is also very low at 0.43x using the book value per share of $127.05. Although COVID-19 has added so much uncertainty I believe these are solid valuations to buy at for an investor who is looking to hold long term. Overall Capital One has produced strong results over the past decade. Revenue and profits have seen steady growth and consistent efficiency. The bank has very solid financial health sporting a well capitalized balance sheet that should hold during this time. The main concern is the charge off rate and delinquencies that have been higher than average the past few months and could get worse from COVID-19. The thing is that it will take time for this to materialize due to the process of becoming delinquent and charged off. I believe this is something to keep an eye on but does not disqualify a long term investment. To put it in perspective only in 2008 did Capital One post a negative EPS during the financial crisis and had a ROA of 0.05% that year. The highest yearly net charge off rate came in 2010 at 5.18%. I believe this offers a glimpse of the strength of this financial institution. With Capital One's strong history and at almost 50% off of the book value I am going to be buying shares of this company."
4339885,92586,2020-04-24T15:38:05-04:00,"The first quarter was far from a walk in the park for Capital One, although much of the headwinds is probably yet to come.Balances increased and net margin dropped, both as expected, while credit metrics have not shown signs of trouble yet.Pushing me away from COF is lack of diversification outside consumer finance and a loan book whose credit quality seems inferior.","Forget the headline numbers: Capital One's (COF) $4.22 adjusted EPS  miss in 1Q20 was an eyesore, primarily driven by a necessary increase in credit reserves that was clearly not properly factored into consensus estimates. Still, the quarter was far from a walk in the park for the McLean, Virginia-based consumer bank.There was not much to celebrate about a start to 2020 that was deeply scarred by the COVID-19 crisis and the shutdown of the global economy, in March. Revenues climbed minimally YOY, with the underlying top-line drivers following some of the same trends observed across the financial services space.Image creditLoan balances were up strongly, particularly in domestic credit card, the largest of Capital One's segments. The trend seems aligned with the theme of consumers seeking liquidity ahead of the expected deceleration in economic activity and pickup in unemployment across the country. Interestingly, however, ending low balance growth was lower than average balance increase, possibly suggesting deceleration in balance sheet expansion at the end of the quarter as transaction volumes probably began to drop sharply.Not a surprise, the current interest rate environment (lower across the board, flatter along the curve) did not help Capital One or any of its peers much. Net interest margin of 6.78% dropped noticeably quarter-over-quarter, and by about 8 bps year-over-year. Capital One's Walmart (WMT) portfolio likely played a role by changing the asset mix unfavorably.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from Seeking AlphaRegarding credit metrics, delinquency rates dropped sequentially and YOY, most noticeably on the riskier auto loan side. Net charge off improved, although the metric could be skewed by asset acquisition.It is important, however, to keep a finger on the pulse of Capital One's credit quality, as I believe the brunt of the deterioration will be felt in the second quarter and possibly beyond, depending on the extent of the economic crisis. Keep in mind, as the graph above suggests, that the bank's loan book has one of the lowest-quality profiles in the sector.In terms of investment strategy, I am a big proponent of diversification across sectors regardless of the macroeconomic environment. Therefore, while a strong argument could be made against investing in the financial services space ahead of what will likely be a deep recession, I see value in placing calculated bets in this sector today.However, in line with my stock picking approach for turbulent times, I find it most important now to buy shares of the highest-quality companies that have the most diverse business models. That said, I can't seem to find a good-enough reason to own COF at current levels, even if the stock has already dropped nearly 50% from the 2020 peak (see graph below).Data by YChartsMy reservations towards COF that I shared last earnings season remain largely the same: lack of diversification outside consumer finance and a loan book whose credit quality seems inferior compared to most peers. While valuations are no longer much of a concern, after they climbed relentlessly in 2019, I rank ""bargain-hunting"" much lower on my list of factors to consider when buying pro-cyclical stocks in periods of distress.In the financial services space, I continue to favor JPMorgan (JPM) for its well-balanced exposure to the consumer and institutional verticals, and American Express (AXP) for the network-dependent, fee-based business model."
4326554,78115,2020-02-24T04:40:41-05:00,"While Capital One's revenue trends are encouraging, cost base inflation continues to offset this, leading to pre-provision profit stagnation. Credit costs also keep rising.Management prefers share repurchases over dividends. With 12% CET1, the bank can buy back $2.5B per year over 2020-21E. Quarterly dividends might remain unchanged at $0.40 per share.Valuation looks fair given the riskier loan book and lower return of equity dynamics.","Capital One (COF) marginally lagged Street expectations, reporting an 11% YoY drop in fourth quarter profits. While the card & auto-heavy lender reported healthy rise in pre-provision operating profits (PPOP), credit costs dampened this with an 11% jump, half of it due to the Walmart (NYSE:WMT) card portfolio acquisition. Higher effective tax rate compared to a year ago also added to the profit decline.COF has solid CET1 levels, much above the long-term target of 11%. While it is quite feasible to hike the quarterly dividends, which have been unchanged at $0.40 per share for the past several years, the management has always preferred share repurchases over dividends. The bank can easily buy back $2.5B per year over 2020-21E. On the valuation side, COF stock looks to be fairly valued, despite being cheaper than most peers.At a time when its peers are reporting net interest margin (NIM) decline, COF’s margins expanded 14bps QoQ (excluding the PPI impact from UK operations). This was primarily driven by the on-boarding of the Walmart portfolio. While this book is higher-yield, keep in mind that it is also a higher-loss one – thus, we will need to wait for a few more quarters to have a more holistic view.Source: Company presentationThe bank is relatively neutral in terms of near-term interest rate movements, likely due to the fact that its book is dominated by credit cards and auto loans, which are not as interest-sensitive in the short term. Thus, COF is likely to show more revenue resilience than peers in 2020. However, once the rates start to rise, the bank will lag.Loan growth was encouraging, as it rose 6.6% QoQ (+8.1% YoY). Due to the seasonality of the fourth quarter, specifically in the cards segment, it is better to look at the loan growth on a YoY basis. Out of the $20B change, $9B was contributed by the integration of Walmart's book. Organic growth - that is, excluding the WMT portfolio acquisition - loans were up 4.4% YoY, driven by commercial (+6.5% YoY), and auto (+7.1% YoY), while card (+2.1% YoY) was a bit of laggard.Non-interest income was solid, rising 11.4% QoQ (+14.1% YoY). Fees grew 7.5% QoQ (+5.3% YoY).Cost control has been an area where COF has been quite weak. Fourth quarter opex changes were mixed – employee costs rose 23% YoY, while occupancy (-7.4%), marketing (-14.6%), and professional services (-25.4%) spending tempered. Overall, the cost base was flattish. However, over the past few years, the bank has been exhibiting rather looser cost control, with opex rising 4-5% over 2017-19, and efficiency ratio deteriorating a full 200bps. While the revenue trends are likely to be stable to falling in the near term, a quicker rise in costs is a threat to pre-provision growth, and ultimately to net profits, given the pace at which provisions are increasing. PPOP hardly grew during 2017-19.COF reported a solid CET1 ratio of 12.2%, much above its long-term target of 11%. After considering the 30bps impact of AOCI opt-out and 16bps hit from CECL, our calculations show an excess capital of about $2.3B as of 2019-end. The bank slowed its share repurchases to $1.6B in 2019 calendar year from $2.3B in 2018. During the current CCAR cycle, it bought back around $1.5B of stock, leaving about $700M for 1H20.Source: Company presentationThe bank has not hiked its quarterly dividends after Q2 2015, and it is clear that it prefers to distribute excess capital via share repurchases, rather than as dividends. We believe that there is definitely room for dividends to rise sustainably, but the management seems to favour repurchases.Coming back to buybacks, even if COF is to maintain the CET1 ratio similar to current levels at 12%, the bank can easily pay out $2.5B every year over 2020-21E. If the bank is willing to go down to 11%, it can do $4B per year over the same period, which is not our base case.COF trades at 1.1x price to tangible book value, which looks fair based on our return on tangible equity (ROTE) based approach, as well as historical averages post-crisis. The current P/E ratio of slightly below 9x is also in line with historical averages. While these multiples look cheaper compared to peers in the US banking space, we believe that a combination of lower ROTEs and riskier loan book justify the relatively lower valuation."

In this article, we want to shed light on the newest Preferred Stock issued by the company and even though the product may not be of interest to us and our financial objectives, it definitely is worth taking a look at.Before we submerge into our brief analysis, here is a link to the 424B2 Filing by Capital One Financial Corporation - the prospectus.Source: SEC.govFor a total of 50 million shares issued, the total gross proceeds to the company are $1.25B. You can find some relevant information about the new preferred stock in the table below:Source: Author's spreadsheetCapital One Financial Corporation 4.80% Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series J (NYSE: COF-J) pays a qualified fixed dividend at a rate of 4.80%. The new preferred stock has a Standard & Poor's rating of ""BB"" and is callable as of 06/01/2025. Currently, the new issue trades a little below its par value at a price of $24.86 and has a 4.83% Current Yield and YTC of 5.11%Here is how the stock's YTC curve looks like right now:Source: Author's spreadsheetCapital One Financial Corporation is a diversified financial services holding company. The Company, along with its subsidiaries, offers a range of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the Internet and other distribution channels.Below, you can see a price chart of the common stock, COF: Source: TradingView.comSince 2015 the common stock distribution is constant and is currently a $1.60 yearly dividend. With a market price of $102.03, the current yield of COF is at 1.57%. As an absolute value, this means it pays $752.5M in dividends yearly. For comparison, the yearly dividend expense for all outstanding preferred stocks (with the newly issued Series J preferred stock) of the company is around $335M.In addition, with a market capitalization of around $47.25M, COF is the fifth-largest company in the ""Credit Services"" sector (according to Finviz.com).Below you can see a snapshot of Capital One Financial Corporation's capital structure as of its Quarterly Report in June 2019. You can also see how the capital structure evolved historically. Source: Morningstar.com | Company's Balance SheetAs of Q3 2019, COF had a total debt of $49.69B ranking senior to the newly issued preferred stock. The new Series J preferred stock rank is junior to all outstanding debt and equal to the other preferred stocks of the company that total $5.97B.Our purpose today is not to make an investment decision regarding the common stock of COF but to find out if its new preferred stock has the need quality to be part of our portfolio. Here is the moment where I want to remind you of two important aspects of the preferred stocks compared to the common stocks:Based on our research and experience, these are the most important metrics we use when comparing preferred stocks:The company has 6 more outstanding preferred stocks, 5 of which are listed on the NYSE:Source: Author's databaseOne of the rest of the preferred stocks issued by the company, COF-P, is called for redemption with the proceeds of the new issue, saving the company an annual rate of 1.20%. Another one is also reaching its call date at the end of the year, COF-F. With its nominal yield of 6.20%, it can be considered with a significant probability as a redemption on its call date. Two of the other three issues become callable in 2 years and the last one, the most recently issued COF-I , becomes callable after 5 years.Source: Author's databaseWith its Yield-to-Worst of 4.83% (equal to its Current Yield), COF-J gives a very close YTW as the previously issued, COF-I, except that ""I's"" Yield-to-Worst is its Yield-to-Call. The new IPO is the only one that is trading at a slight discount, having the highest Yield-to-Call, unlike its relatives that are trading at a premium over PAR. On a comparative basis, I would prefer COF-G, it has a 0.20% higher current yield, its YTW is 3.33% (1.5% lower than COF-J) but I find this 0.40% spread in the nominal yields insufficient for ""G"" to be in danger of being redeemed.In addition, in the following chart, you can see a comparison between COF's preferred stocks and the fixed-income securities benchmark, the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF). The preferred stocks and the ETF shared a very close correlation at the end of 2018 and during the sharp rally in the first quarter in 2019 thereafter. It is no surprise after all of Capital One's issues are part of the benchmark's holdings. However, COF-G seems to be the best performer and the only one to outperform PFF. On the opposite side, the next probable redemptions, COF-P and COF-F are the worst performers, trading almost flat during 2019. As for COF-I, due to the short history of the preferred stock, any meaningful conclusions can hardly be made. Source: TradingView.comFurthermore, there are plenty of corporate bonds issued by the holding: Source: FINRAFor comparison, I choose the bond that matures closest to the call date of the newly issued Series I Preferred Stock, the 04/30/2025 Corporate Bond. Source: FINRA | COF4627793COF4627793, as it is the FINRA ticker, is rated a ""BBB,"" has a maturity date of 04/30/2025 and has a Yield-to-Maturity of 2.204%. This should be compared to the 5.11% Yield-to-Call of COF-J, but when making that comparison, do remember that COF-J's YTC is the maximum you could realize if you hold the preferred stock until 2025. This translates into a yield spread of 2.9% between the two securities.This section contains all $25 par value preferred stocks, issued by a ""Credit Services"" company (according to Finviz.com) regardless of their type of dividend rate. Since almost all are trading above PAR, except for COJ-F, I will try to make the most meaningful comparison by looking at their Years-to-Call and Yield-to-Call, excluding the issues with a negative YTC:Source: Author's databaseThe higher the YTC, the better the security, which is also their Yield-to-Worst. In this case, it is the recently issued 8.00% preferred stock MBNKP. However, it is very far from the quality of the rest of the securities in the group. When looking at the rest of the sector, the three preferred stocks that compete with COF-J are SYF-A, CIT-B, and COF-I, as the three are having a YTW of around 4.75% with close call dates. However, COF-J's nominal yield of 4.80% that is the lowest one makes it too sensitive to interest rate changes.The full list:Source: Author's databaseThe last charts contain all preferred stocks that pay a fixed dividend rate, have a par value of $25, a positive Yield-to-Call and a Standard & Poor's rating of ""BB.""Source: Author's databaseTo see how the real yield curve of these securities looks like, we'll have to include some filters: the preferred stocks don't have to be callable and have to trade above par value. Thus the next chart presents the BB preferred stocks by their Years-to-Call and Yield-to-Call:Source: Author's databaseSource: 424B2 Filing by Capital One Financial CorporationWith the current market capitalization of the new issue of around $1.25B, COF-J is a possible addition to the ICE Exchange-Listed Preferred & Hybrid Securities Index during some of the next rebalancings. If so, it will also be included in the holdings of the main benchmark, the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF, which is the ETF that seeks to track the investment results of this index, and which is important to us due to its influence on the behavior of all fixed-income securities.The newly issued preferred stock is the security with one of the lowest nominal yield from all the preferred stocks and is also one of the three with a rate of ""below-5%"" from the below-investment ones (except for the EIX's 70-year old preferred stocks). In terms of returns, COF-J has very close Yield-to-Call and Current Yield to the previously issued COF-I and also a close Current Yield to COF-G. Currently, a 5% return from quality preferred stocks is hard to be found, which makes the new IPO more attractive. But keep in mind that the lower the nominal yield it gives, the more vulnerable it is, and after 5 years, you may find yourself holding a preferred with a high duration in terms of rising interest rates."
4311497,59101,2019-12-09T15:47:04-05:00,Capital One boasts an exemplary management team.The company now ranks among the top ten US banks.The firm's deposit base and revenue sources have grown markedly in the last decade.,"Capital One (COF) has diversified its revenue stream over the years and boasts a strong financial foundation. The company also possesses a narrow moat and a stellar management team. Unfortunately, the shares of this company will likely drop dramatically in the event of a recession. I provide pros and cons of a prospective investment below.Is Capital One Misunderstood?To accurately appraise Capital One as an investment, one must have insight into the manner in which banking institutions are valued by the investment community. Larger banks are awarded higher valuation multiples due to the more diverse nature of their businesses. Furthermore, a large bank boasts a stable, low cost source of funding through a large deposit base.This applies particularly to the top four institutions, JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C), and Bank of America (BAC). Each of these monsters wields deposits in excess of a trillion dollars. A large deposit base translates into a degree of safety for investors. Note these four companies currently trade at PEs of roughly 13, 11.5, 9 and 12, respectively.Lesser financial institutions generally rely on one source for the majority of their revenue stream and have much smaller deposit bases. Consequently, firms with this profile tend to trade at a PE below nine.Capital One is classified with the second group of financial firms: the company currently trades at a PE of 8.3. This likely stems from the company's origins as an issuer of credit cards. The problem with that scenario is that COF has a much more diverse revenue stream than in the past. COF now provides auto loans, a variety of banking services and savings accounts, and it is now supported by a relatively large base of depositors. Capital One is now the second largest provider of auto loans in the US. The company's commercial and consumer banking segments both contribute low double-digit revenue streams.From the time the 2007-08 financial crisis hit through 2018, Capital One grew funding from deposits from 61% to 80%.Compare U.S. Bancorp (USB), the fifth-largest commercial bank by assets, to COF.US Bancorp Capital OneAssets: $373.19 billion Assets: $475.78 billionDeposits: $348.09 billion Deposits: $255.11 billionCurrent PE 13.6 Current PE 8.82Capital One can no longer be pigeonholed as a credit card provider alone.COF is now a top ten lender in the US, with nearly $250 billion in loans outstanding and tens of millions of cardholders. The company also has more than 750 bank branches, mostly on the east coast. Capital One also has a portfolio of roughly $80 billion in liquid securities on its balance sheet.The firm currently trades at a 13% discount to its own history and a 31% discount to other banks.Capital One Has a Sustainable, Narrow MoatCapital One is recognized as a leader in the industry in terms of the company's highly advanced IT infrastructure and data capabilities. These assets generally rank above those of rivals and provide the company with resources and degree of flexibility others lack.Buttressed by those assets, COF's narrow moat stems from cost advantages and a nationwide consumer base. With 45 million credit card holders, Capital One's credit cards are assured of a wide range of acceptance. The company has a variety of card offerings across multiple FICO scores, thereby appealing to a large, diversified consumer base. Smaller competitors are less likely to attract COF's cardholders with offerings that are limited to a narrow geographic location and/or a limited number of retailers.Capital One's scale provides the company with leverage when engaging in national advertising campaigns. In turn, this results in branding that smaller rivals cannot match.ManagementCapital One has excellent stewardship. One example of management's expertise is the manner in which the company weathered the 2007-08 financial crisis. While Citigroup's management team was receiving $476.2 billion in aid from the federal government, slashing the quarterly dividend from 16 cents a share to a penny, and presiding over a massive loss of shareholder value, Capital One suffered a one-year revenue loss of 21 cents a share.The company's ability to diversify income streams, exemplified in part by COF's standing as the second largest auto lender, and the firm's recent coup resulting in the firm prying the Walmart (WMT) account from Synchrony (SYF) are additional testimony to the strength of the management team.COF's management team is decidedly shareholder friendly. The manner in which executives are compensated practically requires them to work toward objectives that benefit investors.Headwinds And ConcernsCOF has a large exposure to riskier borrowers than many rivals. For example, Capital One's charge-off rate of 4.1% and 30-day delinquency rate of 3.7% are significantly higher than that of rivals American Express (AXP) and Discover (DFS).There is the possibility that credit card lenders could engage in a race to the bottom by offering ever increasing reward incentives that cut into profits.New payment technologies and models could result in significant future headwinds for traditional credit card companies.FAIR VALUEAs I compose this article, COF trades for $100.57 a share.Morningstar has a FV for the company at $136, CFRA values the shares at $133.72, Argus has a target price of $106 and Credit Suisse gives a target price of $116.My rating system provides a Valuation Score of 73 and an Overall Score of 69. My system considers the company as trading near fair value, although the rating agencies listed above clearly disagree.(For an overview of my rating system, see the section near the end of the article.)DIVIDEND METRICSCOF has a very safe dividend. With a payout ratio of roughly 14% and a dividend coverage ratio of nearly 700%, investors can anticipate continued growth in the dividend for the foreseeable future. The current yield hovers around 1.6%.However, the company's record of dividend growth is spotty, as the company cut the dividend markedly in 2010.The three, five, and ten year dividend growth rates stand at 2.2%, 11.0% and 0.6% respectively.(All dividend metrics gleaned from Schwab)Editor's Note, December 11: The author has corrected the metrics related to the buyback data presented below.FINANCIAL STRENGTHMorningstar and Argus rate the company's financial health as Strong and High, respectively. Those ratings are the best possible.The Federal Reserve approved up to $2.2 billion in share repurchases from 3Q19 through 2Q20 (an increase from $1.2 billion a year earlier). In 3Q19, COF bought back 5.3 million common shares. (All share repurchase data per Argus)MY PERSPECTIVEI do not hold COF shares; however, I am contemplating selling puts in hopes I might gain the shares after a nominal drop in the stock. Considering the valuations provided by the rating agencies listed above, there very well may be a margin of safety present at the current price. At the very least, I will place COF on a closely monitored watch list, as I prize companies with the moat, management and strong financial foundation exhibited by Capital One. When considering COF as a prospective investment, one should be aware that the shares will likely suffer a dramatic fall in the event of a recession.Concerning My Rating SystemMy rating system provides a Valuation Score of 73 and an Overall Score of 69. The first number represents the FV of the company and measures six valuation metrics. The highest FV score possible is 100.The second number represents the overall score of the company. This weighs the moat, management, past and projected growth rates, financial strength, historic ROIC, and valuation of the company. The highest score possible is a 100.The rating system is far from foolproof; however, my initial testing (it has been in use for a year) indicates a Valuation Score of 83 or higher combined with an Overall Score of 63 or higher provides investment targets that often outperform the market. The overwhelming majority of companies have Valuation Scores far below 83 and Overall Scores below 63.The Valuation Score of 73 indicates COF trades near fair value, while the Overall Score of 69 ranks COF above most companiesOne Last WordI hope to continue providing articles without cost to SA readers.

4336830,25941,2020-04-09T09:34:53-04:00,"Banks have been beat down recently, and we believe that the market is overly pessimistic on the entire banking sector.With the impact of mortgage forbearance on lenders and servicers not fully known, we prefer Capital One as the bank has less exposure to real estate.We believe that charge-offs will likely not be as bad as other downturns due homeowner's ability to suspend mortgage payments for up to twelve months.Further, Capital One has less leverage than other larger banks due to the nature of its balance sheet, which we like in the case of an economic downturn.","Yes, short-term rates are zero. Yes, the yield curve is flat. Yes, a recession appears imminent and some have already declared we are in one. However, banks have simply gotten too cheap to ignore. Many bank's shares are trading at or below tangible book value. While we believe that most banks are undervalued, Capital One (COF) is at the top of the list.Data by YChartsWe view the risk/reward to be one of the most attractive out of the banks we follow, due to its balance sheet. Capital One's loan book is primarily comprised of credit card loans (roughly 50% are credit cards, the other 50% is roughly an even split between other consumer lending and commercial lending). Given the uncertainty around mortgages caused by forbearance, we believe that credit card focused lenders, like Capital One, are the safer play.Data by YChartsThe government granted homeowners that are experiencing a financial hardship due to COVID-19 a right to forbearance. Some lenders are simply delaying payments until the end of the forbearance period, others are modifying the loan to tack on the extra payments at the end of the loan. Regardless, forbearance has put major strain on lenders and servicers, particularly servicers, as they are still on the hook to deliver the monthly payments. The government has not addressed the issue, and there's no guarantee that they will. As a result, we view banks that have meaningful exposure to real estate servicing as a riskier play than those that don't.When a bank prices loans, they price them based on risk. For example, let's say that a 30-year fixed mortgage has a rate of 4%. Included in that 4% yield is a cost in the form of interest rate risk (let's just say 1.00%), credit risk (let's say 0.25%), options risk (let's say 0.50%), and liquidity risk (let's say 0.05%). After all of these risks are accounted for, the bank is earning 2.20% on a risk-adjusted basis.Credit card yields, on the other hand, are much higher. As of the end of 2019, Capital One's effective rate was 12.5%. Included in that yield is again interest rate risk (let's say 0.50%), credit risk (let's say 3.50%), and liquidity risk (let's say 0.50%). After these risks are accounted for, the bank is earning 8.00% on a risk-adjusted basis.All this to say, is that the risk of not receiving monthly payments due to forbearance is not fully priced into the mortgage. Additionally, although realized credit costs are not likely to trend higher due to forbearance, many consumers will still be left to pay the lump sum at the end of the period. This will likely be an issue for many, especially if they didn't have the savings to cover one or two months of their mortgage.Credit cards will likely see an uptick in charge-offs. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, charge-offs on credit cards for the top 100 banks reached as high as 10.6% during the fourth quarter of 2009. If we do continue down this recessionary path, defaults on credit cards are an almost certainty. There is still exposure to credit card holders that do not own a home, and therefore cannot take advantage of mortgage forbearance.However, we don't see charge-offs on credit cards reaching financial crisis levels, primarily due to mortgage forbearance. If homeowners don't have to pay their mortgage, this prioritizes the servicing of their other debt. Additionally, some lenders are approving forbearance with no questions asked. Some consumers may not have necessarily lost their job directly to Covid-19, however, they may take this as an opportunity to focus on their debt that cannot be pushed out into the future.We wrote about this in our last article, but credit cards loans require more capital to be held against the loan than a mortgage due to higher unexpected losses. Back to the risk-adjusted return comparison between mortgages and credit cards: the 8.00% is way better than the 2.20%, but that is before leverage. Unexpected losses are generally much higher than credit cards, so credit cards require a larger capital buffer. As a result, banks that have a larger concentration in credit card loans and other unsecured debt are less leveraged than mortgage-focused banks. This allows banks to generate comparable returns on equity.Data by YChartsLeverage is great when times are good. This becomes a problem once unexpected losses begin to accumulate.Let us just say that we don't view this as a repeat of the financial crisis. Banks are much more prepared than they were ten years ago. They are more capitalized, have access to ample liquidity from the Fed, and are generally much healthier than compared to pre-crisis levels. However, as we stare a recession in the face, we tend to gravitate towards banks with less leverage.Once again, we view banks in general to be undervalued. Given the valuation that most banks are receiving, the market is expecting significant losses. Our opinion is that many investors are looking to the financial crisis as guidance. We don't view this to be a similar event. But given the uncertainty of the situation, we prefer credit card oriented banks like Capital One over other mortgage-heavy banks.Mortgage forbearance will likely lead to credit card charge-offs performing better than past recessions. Further, Capital One has less leverage than other large banks due to their balance sheet, which will likely be an advantage in the near-term future. With Capital One's shares trading at roughly half to tangible book, we view this to be a great buying opportunity."
4309118,105381,2019-11-26T03:30:27-05:00,"Low interest rates and a slow-growing U.S. economy, make banking and finance stocks seem unattractive to some investors.However, Capital One is unique as its main focus is credit cards and with increasing consumer debt, this will favor companies such as Capital One.Capital One seems to be trading 10% below my valuation.","Investing in banks and finance companies is increasingly becoming a tricky task, especially with the declining interest rate environment. The Federal Open Market Committee decided to cut the Fed Funds rate 3 times this year in a bid to provide a boost to the slowing U.S. economy. Low rates could turn out to be an obstacle for banks and finance companies to improve their net interest margins, which is the reason behind many investors staying on the sidelines without investing in bank stocks.Capital One Financial (COF) is a unique financial services company with a focus on credit cards and shares have risen 14% in the last 12 months. However, the bulk of this gain came in the last 30 days since releasing its third-quarter earnings results.Shares are trading at a discount to my intrinsic value estimate and the long history of dividend distributions makes Capital One an attractive investment for income investors.Capital One is a diversified financial services company serving retail consumers, small and medium enterprises and other large-scale commercial clients. The company operates under four business segments: Credit Card, Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking and Other. Capital One provides various products and services under each of these segments.Source: Company filingsThe credit card segment is the leading contributor to company revenue and earnings.The management, throughout the last few earnings conference calls, went on to highlight the need to evolve as a tech-friendly financial institution. This is to tackle the increasing demand for online financial services. The growth of concepts such as Fintech will fuel the demand for such services in the future, and the management wants to position Capital One as a leader in this space.Inorganic growth has also been at the center of the company throughout its past. Capital One has executed a few deals to add more revenue streams to the company, to penetrate into new regions and product categories, and to improve the technological capabilities of the company.Source: CrunchbaseThe company has executed 55 deals since 2010. The acquisition of HSBC’s U.S. credit card business in 2011 and ING Direct in the same year stand out as the most noteworthy transactions, and these two deals are continuing to create value for Capital One shareholders.The management is looking for value-accretive opportunities on a continuous basis. In the future, the company might build on its acquisition spree to scale up and earn higher revenue and profits.The 3 rate cuts so far this year have painted a negative picture of the prospects of major banks and financial institutes. However, analysts believe that this pressure might turn out to be short term in nature, based on the belief that economic growth will resume its upward momentum once trade war-related fears subside.Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. LouisThe dot plot released by the Fed in September points to rising rates in the future, which is in line with the expectations of policymakers for the revival of economic growth in the country. If rates do rise in the future, as expected by FOMC participants, Capital One and other leading financial institutes would be in a good position to expand their net interest margins.Source: CNBCConsumer spending in the U.S., on the other hand, has risen to new highs in 2019. Higher than expected GDP growth in the country, over the last few years, is mainly responsible for this development.Source: Trading EconomicsIf spending remains elevated, this would be a good thing for credit card issuers like Capital One.Overall, the industry outlook for Capital One is challenging in the short term but would be supportive of growth in the long term.The total revenue of the company has increased in each of the last 4 years, and the company is now much bigger than it was prior to the financial crisis in 2008. As highlighted in an earlier segment, timely, value accretive acquisitions have been at the center of this growth over the last decade.Source: TIKR.comContinuing its streak of earnings beats, Capital One reported an earnings surprise in the third quarter of 2019 as well, which boosted the share price. The company reported improving numbers for its deposits and advances as well; some of which are highlighted below.However, as feared by many investors, net interest income and net interest margin have both entered a declining trend, which is evident from the below graph. It’s unlikely that this trend will reverse in the future, given the dovish stance of the Fed.Source: Third-quarter earnings presentationThe loan portfolio of Capital One is of high quality, which is evident from the flat net charge-offs rate. In the third-quarter earnings conference call, the management commented that the robust loan portfolio will likely survive the headwinds in an economic downturn as well.Source: Third-quarter earnings presentationCapital One has sufficient liquidity as well, which is evident from the improving Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio, which has consistently been higher than the 4.5% recommended by the Basel III Accord.Source: Third-quarter earnings conference callThe loan portfolio of the company is of high quality and Capital One has sufficient liquidity as well. In this challenging macro-economic environment, the company will likely grow at low single-digit rates. There are growth opportunities for the credit card business segment, and the company is pursuing these opportunities aggressively.Improving technological capabilities is at the center of the company’s growth strategy and the company has correctly identified the importance of addressing digital banking requirements of existing and potential clients. The demand for online banking solutions is on the rise and internet-based concepts such as Fintech and the Internet of Things (IoT) are fueling the demand for these products.In addition, as per the comments made by the company CEO in the third-quarter earnings call, these investments have boosted the ability of the company to measure and forecast consumer credit quality trends and customer behavior, resulting in better credit performance and lower customer acquisition costs.The capital laid out by the company today will, however, provide returns in the long term. Therefore, in the short term, the company would have to avoid increasing the dividend payout to ensure sufficient liquidity to support these investments. Income investors should not be discouraged by this effort by the management as this would eventually secure the sustainability of the company’s earnings in the future, which would, in turn, translate to dividend growth.Capital One has competitive advantages stemming from its massive cardholder base that is spread across the country. According to company filings, there were 45 million cardholders in the U.S. at the end of the second quarter. According to the Nilson Report, Capital One was the 5th largest credit card issuer in the U.S. by purchase volume in 2018.Source: The Nilson ReportThe wide reach and acceptance of Capital One cards will help the company retain its customer base for an extended period, which adds a degree of stability to the company’s revenue and earnings. The company will capitalize on these advantages over its peers to generate high single-digit to double-digit return on equity.Source: TIKR.comConsumer spending in the U.S., as highlighted in a previous segment, is still rising. This is a good sign for Capital One, but the possibility of a slowdown in economic growth paints a pessimistic view from this front. This would be the biggest risk for Capital One in the next 5 years.Overall, the company will likely grow at a slow but steady pace in the next 5 years. Such growth would be sufficient to maintain or increase the dividend per share in this period, which would be a nice compensation for investors until shares reach their intrinsic value.Capital One’s dividend policy dates back to 1996 and the company has consistently delivered on its promise to distribute wealth to shareholders. Since 2016, dividend per share has not grown but remained steady.Source: GuruFocusThe company was forced to cut its dividend during the financial crisis, which is something investors need to be wary of. If the U.S. economy enters a recession and consumer spending declines drastically, there would be literally no choice for Capital One but to cut the dividend to save cash.The positive news for investors is that the company is covering its dividend distributions with free cash flow. Even though dividend per share has not grown in the last 3 years, the company has improved its ability to earn free cash flow, which has now left room for future dividend growth.Source: Company filingsThe company is pursuing growth opportunities as well, which adds another layer of safety to the dividend at present. There are no warning signs for investors and the improving cash flow position provides the necessary safety for an income investor.A stable dividend growth model was used to determine the intrinsic value of Capital One's shares. However, in building the model, I incorporated buybacks into consideration as well to provide a more conservative view from a valuation perspective.According to data from Seeking Alpha, for the 12 months ended on September 30, Capital One earned $5.312 billion in adjusted net income and paid out $758 million as dividends. This implies a retained ratio of 85.7%. However, during the same period, the company spent $1.174 billion to repurchase common stock. The adjusted distributions figure results in a retained ratio of 63.6%.It is assumed that the company needs to retain at least 13% of its earnings, which results in excess retained per share of $5.77.Source: Author’s calculationsThe other major assumptions used in this model are listed below.These assumptions lead to an intrinsic value estimate of $106.41 per share, which is 10% higher than the current market price of $98.10 on Monday.Wall Street analysts have a median target price estimate of $106 at present, which is in line with the intrinsic value I calculated using a dividend discount model.Source: TIKR.comCapital One is a unique financial institution in that it generates the bulk of its earnings from the credit card segment. This makes consumer spending in the country one of the most important determinants of company profits. Despite the challenges from a macro-economic perspective, the company is positioning itself to deliver long-term value to its investors.During the crisis period from 2006 to 2010, Capital One successfully earned profits in each fiscal year except for 2008, which is indicative of the prudent management of the company. This adds another layer of safety for investors. Shares are trading below my intrinsic value estimate and the dividend per share will grow in the future, as capital expenditures decline with the successful implementation of advanced technologies to support the demand for online banking requirements. Low single-digit revenue growth will also support dividend growth in the future. Capital One is a buy."

The performance was supported by a benign macroeconomic environment, which in 4Q19 included robust consumer spending and slowly decreasing interest rates.Revenue growth of 6% was modestly better than expectations, while stable net interest margin and accelerated share repurchase ensured a respectable, albeit not record-breaking, adjusted EPS beat of 14 cents. Credit: ProPublicaCompared to the expectations laid out in my recent earnings preview, Capital One outperformed by a narrow margin.On the credit card side (nearly two-thirds of total revenues in 4Q19), ending loan balances increased by 10% as I had projected. However, the great majority of the increase was driven inorganically by the Walmart (WMT) portfolio that has now been fully integrated. Preventing Capital One from growing its ex-Walmart assets beyond about one percentage point was the bank's own decision to end certain partnerships in the quarter.The consumer banking segment (accounting for nearly one-fourth of revenues) was down 2%, but mostly due to one-off items associated with interest rate movements and legacy revenues earned in 2018. Assets within the business grew at a solid mid single-digit pace, while the highly anticipated increase in deposit rates served as headwinds to net interest income.Source: earnings slidesOn the margin front, I was a pleasantly surprised to see a NIM of 6.95% remain very much stable YoY, despite my fears that the Walmart integration could skew the revenue mix towards the lower-margin end of the spectrum. Equally surprising was the modest improvement in credit metrics. More specifically, 30-day delinquency dropped about 10 bps YoY, despite the negative impact of the newly acquired Walmart assets.To reemphasize, Capital One delivered a solid 4Q19 that, in some aspects, exceeded my expectations. However, I don't believe that the results were strong enough to turn me from neutral to bullish on the stock.Data by YChartsAt the core of my skepticism towards COF are a few factors that include (1) lack of diversification outside consumer finance, (2) a balance sheet whose credit quality seems inferior compared to peers like JPMorgan (JPM) and Discover (DFS), and (3) valuations that, while not rich, don't seem to present much upside opportunity, after P/E rose rather sharply over the past 12 months (see graph above).For these reasons, I commend Capital One's management team for a decent fourth quarter, but remain more inclined towards an investment in JPM or even Citigroup (C) in the financial services sector."
4317953,92586,2020-01-20T19:00:41-05:00,"Capital One will share its fourth quarter performance amid a macroeconomic environment that seems highly favorable.The acquisition of Walmart assets will probably have a noticeable impact on results, but the underlying business is likely to have performed well.However, I remain on the sidelines and believe that JPMorgan and even Discover may be better buys in the financial services sector.","The early days of the current earnings season suggest that 4Q19 was, indeed, a great quarter to be a bank. Most of the major U.S.-based financial institutions, including JPMorgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), have reported outstanding results so far. On the consumer banking side, the combination of robust spending and improvement in the overall macroeconomic landscape has led to increased asset balances, stable interest margins, and credit metrics that don't appear to be overly concerning.Against this backdrop, Capital One (COF) will share its holiday quarter performance on January 21, after the closing bell. Revenues are expected to rise a bit more than 4% YOY, keeping up with the pace of the past few quarters. Adjusted EPS of $2.35, if achieved, will be a bit lower compared to year-ago levels. Credit: CBCIn 4Q19, Capital One's results should be noticeably impacted by the integration of Walmart (WMT) assets, more specifically on the domestic credit card side (which represented 60% of total revenues last quarter). Therefore, I expect domestic credit card balances to be higher by approximately 10% in 4Q19, with the acquired portfolio accounting for eight to nine percentage points of the loan growth.The Walmart portfolio should not only have an impact on asset size but also on the bank's margin and credit profile. Regarding the former, Capital One is likely to suffer a bit from the lower-margin asset mix, which I believe will be the main force pressuring the bottom line in the fourth quarter - along with increased operating costs due to portfolio integration.On the latter, the management team had anticipated that Walmart would create 25 bps worth of headwinds to delinquency in the credit card business. However, as the charts below suggest, the 30-day metric has in fact improved YOY in the first two months of the fourth quarter. It will be interesting to look a bit closer at the puts of takes behind the drop in 4Q19 delinquency, should it be confirmed once December data is incorporated.Source: DM Martins Research, using company's reportsLastly, I expect the consumer banking division (27% of total revenues in 3Q19) to experience low-single digit increase in revenues on the back of growth in Capital One 360 products and balances. Pressuring the top line a bit will likely be a compression in deposit margin, which has been recently reported by peers JPMorgan and Citigroup. Not only have the competitive pressures been increasing, Capital One 360 products also tend to carry higher deposit rates.Judging from what I have seen so far in the earnings cycle, it is hard to imagine Capital One reporting a mediocre fourth quarter.Consumer activity seems to have been healthy to say the least. JPMorgan, for example, partially credited its robust asset growth to a successful holiday shopping season. Despite the effects of the Walmart integration and one-off charges associated with last year's data breach, Capital One's underlying business is likely to have had a strong 4Q19, as the bank rides the macroeconomic tailwinds.Data by YChartsHowever, I continue to think that an investment in JPM or even in direct peer Discover (DFS) might make more sense at current levels. Against the former, Capital One's business model is highly concentrated in the consumer business, and the bank would likely have a hard time balancing an eventual deterioration in consumer spending without a presence in asset management, investment banking, or sales and trading. Compared to the latter, Capital One's assets feature a less enticing credit profile, while Discover stock's valuation has pulled back enough since my most recent article to unveil what could be a more compelling value play.For the reasons above, I will remain on the sidelines and watch Capital One report its fourth quarter results from a distance."
4292389,97936,2019-09-18T23:15:14-04:00,"Overview of Capital One Financial Corp.'s new preferred stock, COF-I.A brief look at the company.Where in the context of all securities, issued by the company, does COF-I stand?Comparison with the sector.A comparison with all other ""BB.""","Our goal is to present to you our IPO analysis for every new fixed-income security that enters the market and to find out if there is any trading potential. In this article, we want to shed light on the newest Preferred Stock issued by Capital One Financial Corporation (COF). Even though the product may not be of interest to us and our financial objectives, it definitely is worth taking a look at.Before we submerge into our brief analysis, here is a link to the 424B2 Filing by Capital One Financial Corporation - the prospectus.For a total of 60 million shares issued, the total gross proceeds to the company are $1.5 billion. You can find some relevant information about the new preferred stock in the table below:Source: Author's spreadsheetCapital One Financial Corporation Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series I (NYSE: COF-I) pays a qualified fixed dividend at a rate of 5.00%. The new preferred stock has a Standard & Poor's rating of ""BB"" and is callable as of 12/01/2024. Currently, the new issue trades a little below its par value at a price of $24.65 and has a 5.07% Current Yield and YTC of 5.39%Here is how the stock's YTC curve looks like right now:Source: Author's spreadsheetBelow, you can see a price chart of the common stock, COF:Source: TradingView.comFor 2018, the common stock has paid а $1.60 yearly dividend. With a market price of $88.05, the current yield of COF is at 1.81%. As an absolute value, this means it pays $752.5 million in dividends yearly. For comparison, the yearly dividend expenses for all outstanding preferred stocks (with the newly issued Series I preferred stock) of the company is around $340 million.In addition, with a market capitalization of around $41.35 billion, COF is the fifth-largest company in the ""Credit Services"" sector (according to Finviz.com).Below you can see a snapshot of Capital One Financial Corporation's capital structure as of its Quarterly Report in June 2019. You can also see how the capital structure evolved historically.Source: Morningstar.com | Company's Balance SheetAs of Q2 2019, COF had a total debt of $48.87 billion ranking senior to the newly issued preferred stock. The new Series I preferred stock rank is junior to all outstanding debt and equal to the other preferred stocks of the company that total $4.48 billion.Our purpose today is not to make an investment decision regarding the common stock of COF but to find out if its new preferred stock has the need quality to be part of our portfolio. Here is the moment where I want to remind you of two important aspects of the preferred stocks compared to the common stocks:Based on our research and experience, these are the most important metrics we use when comparing preferred stocks:The company has 7 more outstanding preferred stocks, 6 of which are listed on the NYSE:Source: Author's databaseTwo of the rest of the preferred stocks issued by the company are anytime callable - COF-C and COF-P - and ""C"" is very likely to be redeemed, saving the company an annual rate of 1.25%. Another one is also reaching its call date in 3 months, COF-D. With its nominal yield of 6.70%, it can be considered with a high probability as a redemption on its call date. The other three issues become callable in 1 and 2 years, and the best Yield-to-Worst you can get is 4.68% from COF-G.Source: Author's databaseWith its 5.07% Current yield, COF-I rewards a 0.40% more than the maximum you could realize if you choose second-highest YTW in the group, COF-G. It seems that the new Series I Preferred Stock has an advantage as regards this metric, but it is the issue with the lowest nominal yield. Also, it is the one that is trading at a discount, unlike its relatives that are trading at a premium over PAR and their Yield-to-Call is the most probable return one can get. So, on a comparative basis, I would prefer COF-G instead - it has a higher nominal yield, its YTW is close to the new IPO's, and with this tiny spread of 0.20%, it is less likely than ""I"" to be redeemed. Although, we are entering a low rate environment, and a good yield can hardly be found without taking higher credit risk.In addition, in the following chart, you can see a comparison between COF's preferred stocks and the fixed-income securities benchmark, the iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF (PFF). COF-G and COF-H seem to be the only two that outperform PFF, as an interesting fact is the ""G"" losing 16% of its capitalization during the recession in the late of the last year, when PFF has lost around 12% of its value. Against the background, the other preferreds managed to lose no more than 6.50%. The ""C"" and ""D"" are the two that underperform the ETF, but this may be explained mostly by the high expectations to be called by the company.Source: TradingView.comFurthermore, there are plenty of corporate bonds issued by the holding:Source: FINRAFor comparison, I choose the bond that matures closest to the call date of the newly issued Series I Preferred Stock, the 2024 Corporate Bond (COF4559130). Source: FINRA | COF4559130 COF4559130, as it is the FINRA ticker, is rated a ""BBB,"" has a maturity date of 10/30/2024 and has a Yield-to-Maturity of 2.502%. This should be compared to the 5.39% Yield-to-Call of COF-I, but when making that comparison, do remember that COF-I's YTC is the maximum you could realize if you hold the preferred stock until 2024 that translates into a yield spread of 2.9% between the two securities.This section contains all preferred stocks, issued by a ""Credit Services"" company (according to Finviz.com) regardless of their type of dividend rate:Source: Author's databaseExcept for the preferred stocks, issued by AGM, the other preferred stock in this group is the floating rate SLMBP. I will try to make the most meaningful comparison by looking at their Years-to-Call and Yield-to-Call:Source: Author's databaseThe higher the YTC, the better the security, which is also their Yield-to-Worst. The only one preferred stock that competes with COF-I is AGM-D with its YTC of 5.04% for a little less than 5 years to its call date. However, its nominal yield of 5.00%, and the fact that it's the lowest one makes it too sensitive to interest rate changes. And again, COF-I is the only to trade below its PAR, so actually its 5.07% is its YTW.The last charts contain all preferred stocks that pay a fixed dividend rate, have a par value of $25, a positive Yield-to-Call and a Standard & Poor's rating of ""BB.""Source: Author's databaseTo see how the real yield curve of these securities looks like, we'll have to include some filters: the preferred stocks don't have to be callable and have to trade above par value. Realizing the drawback that COF-I is actually trading below $25, the next chart presents the BB preferred stocks by their Years-to-Call and Yield-to-Call:Source: Author's databaseWith the current market capitalization of the new issue of around $1.5 billion, COF-I is a possible addition to the S&P US Preferred Stock iShares Index during some of the next rebalancings. If so, it will also be included in the holdings of the main benchmark, PFF, which is the ETF that seeks to track the investment results of this index, and which is important to us due to its influence on the behavior of all fixed-income securities. I'll just remind you about last year's rally in fixed-income borne from the redemption of the two ""giants"" HSEA and HSEB and the released cash of over $600 million used from PFF to buy more of the rest of its holdings.As fixed-income traders, we follow every preferred stock or baby bond which is listed on the stock exchange. As such, COF-I is no exception, and the homework we always do we share it with the public. It is not necessary for the IPO to be an arbitrage and a bargain, but in many cases, the new security happens to be better than the ones already trading on the market.The new IPO has quite an advantage over its closest ""brothers"" from the company, and despite the fact that it has the lowest nominal yield, it has 0.40% higher Yield-to-Worst. It can be also supported by the historical price chart between the rest of COF's preferred stocks against the fixed-income benchmark, and except for COF-G, the preferred stocks managed to go through with less concussion in the last fixed-income turmoil last year. COF-I also has the highest YTW in the sector, and it is also the best security when compared to the rest of the ""BB"" rated fixed-rate preferred stocks. Currently, a 5% return from quality preferred stocks is hard to be found, which makes the new IPO more attractive. But keep in mind that the lower the nominal yield it gives, the more vulnerable it is, and after 5 years, you may find yourself holding a preferred with a high duration in terms of rising interest rates."
4293572,92586,2019-09-25T17:13:22-04:00,"The third quarter has been very eventful for financial institutions, given the trade war, yield curve inversion, and monetary easing.When Capital One reports its financial results, I will be paying close attention to net interest margin and credit metrics.In the financial services sector, I would likely favor a bet on a more diversified, robust name like JPMorgan.","Buckle up for an exciting earnings season in the financial services space.As I have mentioned recently, the third quarter of the year was marked by a confluence of events that, by themselves, would have been enough to shake things up in the banking sector: (1) the Fed's decision to cut rates for the first time in over a decade, (2) the designation of China as a currency manipulator, (3) the yield curve inversion that took place for the first time in over 10 years, (4) the escalation of the U.S.-China trade war, (5) the lingering Brexit drama, and (5) oil price volatility caused by geopolitical tensions on the Arabian peninsula.It is against this backdrop that Capital One (COF) will report its 3Q19 results on October 24, after the closing bell.Credit: The VergeIf the external factors were not enough to make this a unique earnings season for banks in general, Capital One is undergoing an internal transformation reflected in the disposition of certain assets (e.g. mortgage business earlier in 2018 and the exit of other small partnerships) and acquisition of others (e.g. the Walmart portfolio). Net-net, I still expect to see domestic card loan balances increase, but probably by a timid 1.5%, while I project that auto should grow by a more aggressive 3%.Next is the question of NIM or net interest margins. Last quarter, Capital One managed to expand its margins by 14 bps YOY to 6.8%, but in great part as a result of a few discrete events that will likely not repeat this time. In 3Q19, the so-called ""twos and tens"" (i.e. the yields on the two-year and ten-year treasury notes) converged further and then crisscrossed for the first time in many years, suggesting that banks might have a harder time borrowing at low and lending at high rates. The impact of the third quarter yield inversion on near-term interest income and margin trends will be a topic worth paying close attention to.Source: D.M. Martins Research, using data from U.S. Dept. of the TreasuryAnother area of concern for me, although one that is more likely to have a mid-to-long term impact on Capital One's financial performance is credit quality. At a sector level, delinquencies have been increasing in the past few years, even if at a moderated pace. As the chart below depicts, 30-day delinquencies have climbed to highs not seen since 2013 and stayed at those elevated levels. Those who subscribe to the idea of the debt cycle driving economic expansion and contraction should remain very attentive to the banks' credit metrics.In what pertains to Capital One specifically, the company tends to hold a riskier book of consumer loans as measured by delinquencies and charge-offs vs. peers like Discover (DFS) and, certainly, mega banks like Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC). Therefore, any sign of credit quality distress in the sector could impact Capital One first. In July and August, delinquency and charge offs increased substantially in Capital One's auto business, while the same metrics on the credit card side remained largely unchanged.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from the Federal ReserveI have traditionally been neutral on the idea of investing in COF. While the company has reported hits and misses lately, I remain cautious about the overall macroeconomic landscape and bank's ability to thrive in an environment of decreased consumer spending, over-leverage, and credit deterioration. It does not help that Capital One's business model is highly concentrated in the consumer business, and the company cannot easily offset the eventual headwinds with strength in areas like asset management, investment banking, or sales and trading.Data by YChartsThe good news is that COF trades at a current-year P/E of 8.0x and tangible book value of just about 1.0x that seem de-risked. Still, in the financial services sector, I would likely favor a bet on a more diversified, robust name like JPMorgan (JPM) instead."
4332480,25941,2020-03-17T11:09:17-04:00,"Capital One is a well-run bank that has differentiated itself from the majority of other commercial banks.
        A focus on credit card lending and technology has created a strategy that is difficult to replicate and positioned the bank well to continue in the future.
        Recession fears have knocked ~30% off it's market value in the past month, and could offer solid returns in the future if the fear subsides.","Historically low rates, a flat/inverted yield curve, and ever increasing recession fears are not great for banks to put it mildly. The Fed cut rates 50 bps in early March and the market is pricing in a ~67% probability of 75 bps cut this week. The 10 year is hovering under 1%. Banks are struggling in their search for yield. However, Capital One (COF) is unique from most regional and national banks.Since bottoming in early 2015, net interest margins for U.S. banks rebounded through 2019 but compressed at the end of the year. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the average NIM for all U.S. banks was 3.31% at the end of 2019. Capital One, on the other hand, has some of the strongest margins of any U.S. bank. At the end of 2019, the bank had a NIM of a little under 7%. This is a result of the structure of their balance sheet. Whereas the majority of banks have a heavy concentration in commercial and mortgage loans, half of Capital One's loan book is credit cards. Credit cards loans are higher yielding than the vast majority of other bank assets, which is reflected in Capital One's margin. For example, a conventional 30 year fixed mortgage is ~3.25-3.50%. Meanwhile, the stated rate on credit cards is typically in the 15-20% range. Taking into account transacting/revolving balances, the average yield on Capital One's credit card portfolio in 2019Q4 was ~12.5%. In addition to higher yields, credit card rates are also much stickier than mortgage rates. Mortgage rates are heavily tied to the 10-year Treasury, whereas credit card rates are far less dependent on market rates. This places Capital One in a better spot than most banks in a declining/low rate environment. As rates fall, roughly half of the yields on the bank's assets are unaffected. On the deposit side, they get to take advantage of lower rates by offering individuals like myself 20 bps for checking deposits.Despite much wider margins, Capital One's return on equity as of 2019Q4 was 8%, lower than the average for all U.S. banks. Once again, this is due to the structure of their balance sheet. Credit cards have much more credit risk than mortgages, which requires Capital One to maintain higher capital levels to account for expected/unexpected losses. As a result, they are not as leveraged as other commercial banks. Less leverage doesn't earn higher returns on capital when times are good. However, if we are entering a recession and charge offs being to tick up, less leverage is the position that you want to be in. This is one of the reasons why during the crisis, the company fared much better than other commercial banks (charge-offs peaked at 6% of total loans, compared to 8%+ charge-offs posted at similar institutions). This is one reason why a consumer-led recession is not extremely concerning. Further, Capital One has proven capable to take advantage of bear markets and motivated sellers in order to acquire assets and investments at favorable prices. If a recession were to happen, management would likely use it as an opportunity.Capital One has a high-quality, seasoned loan book of credit card holders. The bank excels at weeding out weaker borrowers through attrition over several years and does a great job of targeting high spending/low balance consumers that tend to gradually increase their balance. This compounds over time and eventually leads to substantial interest income with low charge-offs. As a result, the bank has built a high-quality loan book in a business where other banks or issuers cannot instantly jump into and expect the same type of returns. The bank's focus on IT and data/analytics has been a main driver in building its high-quality loan books. Because of its ability to reach a national scale, the bank has a diversified customer base that includes a wide array of demographics. This has allowed Capital One to be a leader in measuring and forecasting consumer credit quality and customer behavior. As a result, the bank is able to increase/maintain its stellar credit performance and decrease its acquisition costs.It's no coincidence that the bank strategy is targeted heavily at credit cards and investment in technology. According to Richard Fairbank, the CEO, credit cardsCapital One is a well-run bank that has differentiated itself from the majority of other commercial banks. A focus on credit card lending and technology has created a strategy that is difficult to replicate and positioned the bank well to continue in the future. The bank has been trading at an average of 0.84x P/B over the past five years. Currently, the stock is trading at a multiple of 0.57x. An 0.84x multiple would put the stock around the same levels as mid-February.Now, if your view is that we are entering a recession then the historical valuations are not important. The bank's stock has fallen ~30% in the past month from these exact fears. Comparing this move to the broad financial sector move of a ~25% drop over the same time period, and it's clear that Capital One has been hit harder. If your view is that we're not entering a recession (as mine is) and the economy will rebound quickly, then these levels offer an attractive buying opportunity even after last Friday's giant rally."
4288927,105197,2019-08-30T11:50:59-04:00,"In July 2019, Capital One reported that a data breach had led to unauthorized access to data of over 100 million customers.Capital One had employed Amazon as its cloud hosting provider and the hacker was identified as an ex-Amazon employee.The contours of the data breach were similar to what had been suggested by Oracle, last year.Additionally,it appears that the breach was due to a structural weakness that had been known for a while.In the aftermath of this breach, we evaluate if Oracle’s architectural approach can emerge on top.","The Capital One Financial (NYSE: COF) data breach has brought to limelight the issues that technology can cause. Since Capital One had hosted its data on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services (AWS), questions about the security of AWS and Capital One’s procedures have also been raised. We try to look through what happened and how it actually could alter the perception around Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) Gen 2 Cloud (OGC).Source: Press ReleasePaige A. Thompson, an ex-AWS employee was charged and arrested for the data breach. Interestingly, Ms Thompson had been quite vocal on Twitter about her finding a lot of data that was supposed to be kept safe on AWS instances across 30 companies. The breach, also called a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack, involved specialized knowledge of AWS workings and the hacker exploited a particular vulnerability in the web application firewall configuration. It is also becoming increasingly clear that Ms Thompson did not intend to benefit through the sale of Capital One’s (and possibly data from many other organizations), but was using the intrusions to mine cryptocurrencies. While Amazon has defended itself vigorously, stating that the breach did not occur due to infrastructure, industry experts differ.Evan Johnson, a security engineer at Cloudflare (NET) states:Source: Evan Johnson's Blog PostOne may wonder if Evan Johnson has the right set of credentials to question AWS, it may not be possible to question some of the more high-profile AWS customers who have been working to thwart such incidents. The security personnel at Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), an AWS customer, had developed a methodology to detect instances of credential compromises on AWS, as far back as August last year. Per the post by Netflix,Despite having devised a methodology to detect credential compromise in AWS, Netflix still cautions, its just one layer!The nature of this vulnerability and the knowledge of its existence for such a long time begets the question: Why has no-one tried to talk about cloud security in a loud enough voice? One of the reasons could be the awe of Amazon – healthcare to retail conglomerate, which has been able to sell excess capacity from the ebbs and flows of its underlying business into the world’s leading public cloud company! Make no mistake, AWS is and has been the leader in the public cloud space for a while.Rewinding to October 2018, a gentleman did try to voice his concerns about the security vulnerabilities in the traditional/erstwhile cloud architectures. While many may not agree with Larry Ellison on a host of issues, his prescience of the situation is worth pondering over.Source: Oracle Investor Day 2018Ellison had stated that while he and some others were far ahead of the cloud race in the applications market, Oracle was late to the infrastructure party. He acknowledged that AWS was the pioneer and when Oracle tried to ape AWS (similar to what most of the market was doing), they faced many issues ranging from cost to security.For simple applications such as streaming etc, the security concerns may not be as important as in the case of transaction-based businesses. To Ellison, this has been one of the key reasons why the Gen 1 architecture clouds had taken off so well. They were chasing low hanging fruit and that seems to be getting exhausted, which is evident in the slowing growth across cloud majors.Ellison raised another important point, of trust. The man had a valid point – anyone paying with a credit card gets access to the Gen1 or traditional cloud, implying that should a bad actor gain access to the Gen 1 cloud provider’s computer they could theoretically damage other customers’ data as well as the public cloud provider’s control code (which is also stored in the same set of machines).Similarly, all employees have access (at least theoretically) to customer data. This theory did morph into a reality in the case of Capital One.Then there is the issue of once a vulnerability/breach is discovered, how to fix it. Most attacks or breaches are done through sophisticated code. In the case of Capital One’s SSRF attack, the Capital One server was tricked into running commands that shouldn’t have been permitted. There have been 30 more entities who were subject to this data breach and it took a while to discover and pin down the attacker. Part of the reason was that the investigation was led through human effort – the obviousness of the speed mismatch will cost millions (billions?) of dollars. Oracle’s Gen2 appears to be addressing all of these issues.Source: Oracle Investor Day 2018Owing to the intelligent bots that OGC employs, Oracle claims that not only can its systems eliminate threats locally but also can deploy patches to its databases on the fly.In addition to Gen 1 public clouds sharing space to store multiple customers’ code, even the cloud provider’s code it on the same set of machines.Source: Oracle Investor Day 2018Oracle’s Gen 2 appears to be more secure from a structural standpoint – Oracle’s cloud control code is off limits. Due to the isolated nature of a customer's machine (for folks opting to not share), in case a customer machine does get infected, it doesn’t spread to all.One of the reasons for the rise of hybrid computing has been the unwillingness of customers to move mission-critical workloads the public cloud for the reasons of security. The data breach in case of Capital One could lead to such customers thinking twice before considering the public cloud.With the isolation that Oracle can provide to customers, Oracle can replicate on-premise like security for customers. Of course, for Oracle, such enterprises could be the right set of audience to be educated about the difference between Gen 1 and Gen 2 architectures making the alliance with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) for cloud interoperability the right move for Oracle. In June 2019, Oracle and Microsoft had announced that their clouds will become interoperable or customers will be able to migrate and run their workloads across Microsoft’s Azure and Oracle’s Gen 2 cloud. Considering that Ellison’s warnings on security have almost come true and per Ellison Azure also has a similar architecture to AWS, the partnership with Microsoft may tilt the balance of benefits in favor of Oracle.Prestige and perceptionFurthermore, while AWS is the only public cloud vendor cleared to host confidential government data, earlier this month AWS’ claim to the prestigious Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) program also took a hit. (JEDI is a government contract that can be worth up to $10 billion).Although the Pentagon had shortlisted Amazon and Microsoft as JEDI finalists, on Oracle’s complaint regarding Amazon offering jobs to Pentagon employees working on the JEDI contract, the Pentagon Inspector General has reportedly opened an inquiry into potential misconduct.Source: Seeking AlphaWhile the Pentagon will be assessing procedural lapses in the award of the contract, should the Capital One data breach surface more damning evidence about how the data was treated for the other impacted 30 corporations, AWS reputation as the de-facto choice for public cloud could be seriously dented.The company’s troubles could further increase due to it getting named as a defendant in the lawsuit against Capital One.Source: GeekwireMaybe not. What can potentially crash the party for Oracle are its internal issues. In addition to Oracle’s questionable selling tactics, Oracle’s directors have recently asked shareholders to go ahead with a multi-billion-dollar suit against the company because Larry Ellison had a conflict of interest when Oracle had bought NetSuite since Ellison was a major shareholder of NetSuite.ConclusionWe think that in the battle between technological superiority with corporate governance issues, the former is likely to emerge as the winner. Even if the Oracle lawsuit does go through against Ellison (which by the way has a lot of legal hurdles to cross, to happen), it will be a finite cost. In the case of the technical issues discussed, the combined cost to all the affected parties and the cost in other similar attacks would easily dwarf what Ellison would need to pay. Additionally, the risks posed due to technological oversight could cause significant damage to public cloud players still operating around the Gen 1 architecture.Should Ellison be found guilty of siphoning off money (that’s what an expensive purchase of NetSuite would have led to), no doubt Oracle’s reputation would take a hit. However, an act of financial misappropriation versus willful avoidance of fixing technological issues (akin to selling damaged goods) is much more serious. Thus, we maintain our thesis on Oracle.Author’s note: Ideas similar to the ones discussed in this article take a lot of time to develop.

4272537,92586,2019-06-27T16:01:22-04:00,"Capital One's second-quarter earnings should be an interesting one to follow, given recent macroeconomic developments.I expect loan and deposit growth to remain healthy, while the net impact of lower yields on margin will likely be a key topic of discussion.In the consumer banking space, I would likely favor an investment in the highest quality possible through stocks like AXP.","With macro-level fundamentals shifting (e.g. mixed economic signals and trade tensions, and change in direction in monetary policy), the second-quarter earnings season should be an interesting one for the financial services sector.On the consumer side, Capital One (COF) will deliver its 2Q19 results on July 18. The Street expects to see $7.01 billion in revenues, representing top-line contraction of nearly 3%. Meanwhile, consensus EPS of $2.85 would fall substantially below last year's $3.71, a number that was boosted by gains on sale of the home loan portfolio. Earnings this quarter could also be pressured by higher non-interest expenses needed to integrate the Walmart (WMT) assets. Credit: The InventoryI expect loan and deposit balances to increase modestly as they have in recent quarters, with the latter benefiting from the company's digital banking and Capital One 360 initiatives. On the product mix, growth in credit card should more than offset a decrease in auto loans, a move that probably bodes well for Capital One's credit quality.On the credit card side (nearly two-thirds of total revenues last quarter), I will be interested to see the impact of the recent decline in yields on NIM - net interest margin. The lower interest rate environment has been interpreted largely as a negative factor by the markets, with the financial services sector having trailed the performance of the S&P 500 (SPY) by nearly three percentage points over the past eight weeks (especially since the Fed's dovish June 18 meeting).One potential benefit of decreased interest will be on Capital One's consumer banking segment (one-fourth of total revenues), particularly in regards to deposit rates that have been pressuring profitability as of late. As a reminder, management pointed at higher deposit costs as the main driver of the 7-bp YOY NIM pullback in 1Q19, and a trend reversal here could be bullish for the stock.Source: New York FedOtherwise, as usual, I will be paying close attention to credit quality metrics. As I have pointed out repeatedly in the past, it worries me that U.S. consumer debt has risen consistently since the mid-2013 trough to surpass Great Recession levels (see chart above on the left), led by skyrocketing student and auto loans. I will be surprised, however, to see Capital One's credit quality deteriorate, given the recent positive read on delinquency and charge-offs.Despite lack of overwhelmingly negative news in the financial services space and what could be bullish developments for Capital One (e.g. lower deposit costs, and strong credit metrics), I maintain my cautious stance towards consumer credit in general. Capital One's business model is highly concentrated in one area of the economy that could suffer from an eventual deterioration in consumer spending, over-leverage, and credit deterioration.Data by YChartsCOF is a very affordable stock, as the chart and table above indicate. Yet, as I have argued about peer DFS, ""a valuation discount on the stock of a company that lacks diversification across commercial, investment banking and wealth management seems appropriate"".In the consumer banking space, I would likely favor an investment in the highest quality possible through stocks like AXP. Still, I continue to favor more conservative, diversified plays within the broader financial services space, including JPMorgan (JPM)."
4251244,104783,2019-03-27T07:07:17-04:00,Capital One shares have declined more than 15% over the last 12 months.Shares yield over 2% at the current market price.Investors should not miss attractive investment opportunities presented by banking and financial sector stocks that are not-so-big as the largest names in the industry.,"Financial sector stocks gained widespread attention in the latter stages of 2018 as legendary investors including Warren Buffett continued to pump billions of dollars into banking stocks, showcasing their optimism for the sector in the coming years. This prompted many investors to assess the suitability of big names in the U.S. banking industry to be included in their portfolios, and many investors readily followed the advice of these legendary investors.A quick look at the most followed banks on Seeking Alpha quote pages reveals that investors are focused on the big names in the industry, and often let go of attractive investment opportunities presented by not so big, but efficiently managed, profitable banks and financial institutions.Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) is certainly not a small institute, but not many investors follow the stock.In fact, this can be justified by looking at how Capital One has performed in comparison to the S&P 500 Index and especially, the S&P 500 Financial Index.(Source – Form 10-K)As an analyst with a focus on under-covered stocks, I decided to have a look at Capital One to assess its suitability to be included in my watch-list.Capital One share price has declined more than 15% over the last 12 months, and the company is certainly not one of the regularly followed stocks by banking sector investors.(Source – Morningstar)COF yields close to 2% at the current market price, and shares are trading at a significant discount to my fair value estimate. Even though leading banks and financial sector companies have attracted a lot of attention from value investors over the last several months, COF is a left behind stock, and I find value in Capital One at the current market price.Capital One operates under three business segments, and the bank provides a wide variety of financial products and services to retail customers, small businesses, and commercial clients.Capital One is one of the largest banks in the U.S. based on deposits, and the company has expanded its branch network over the years to grow its customer base in the country.Capital One has a stellar reputation of involving in timely acquisitions of attractive business ventures, and I believe the company will look for such opportunities in the future as well. Investors need to consider both the opportunities this strategy would open up for Capital One, and the risks involved as well.Recent acquisitions(Source – Crunch Base)A key business strategy of the company is to provide a robust digital experience to its customers, and this strategy will provide the company with an opportunity to tap into lucrative opportunities present in the online-only banking space.Distributing wealth to shareholders has remained one of the key business objectives of the company for an extended period of time, and the rich history of dividends is proof of this. The share repurchase program will also serve the same purpose of distributing wealth to company shareholders.Capital One operates under three business segments, and the credit card segment represented over 62% of company revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Historically, the credit card segment has remained the driving force behind the growth of the company.Business segment results(Source – Form 10-K)The credit card segment in the U.S. was supported by higher economic growth and an incremental increase in consumer discretionary spending. If economic growth stalls however, Capital One will find it difficult to grow its revenue from the credit card segment, and this will significantly deter the growth prospects of the bank.Delinquency rate in the credit card segment increased marginally on a year-over-year basis, which could be the first warning sign of problems in this all-important segment.(Source – Form 10-K)The consumer banking segment is driven by auto loans, and Capital One has been able to grow its loan portfolio at a steady pace over the last couple of years. In Fiscal year 2018, the consumer loan portfolio of the bank declined sharply by over 21%, driven by the sale of the mortgage loan portfolio earlier in 2018.Loans held for investment (USD millions)(Source – Author prepared based on data from company filings)Retail banking segment loan portfolio declined by 17%, whereas the auto segment loan portfolio grew by over 4%, marking another successful year for this segment. I believe the sale of the home loan portfolio is a tactically correct move for Capital One as the company never really focused on this segment to drive earnings. On the other hand, the company was facing intense competition in this segment, and allocating time, effort, and funds to grow this segment would have ended in losses for the company in the long-term in my opinion. The exit from this segment leave Capital One with additional cash that could be allocated to more rewarding strategies such as technological enhancements, or could well be distributed to investors via dividends or share buybacks.Provision for credit losses and net charge-offs have both been in an upward looking trend over the last couple of quarters, and this indicates a deteriorating outlook for the credit quality of the bank. There are no alarm bells whatsoever at present, but investors need to assess and analyze the impacts on Capital One’s profitability resulting from higher provisions for credit losses in future periods.(Source – Investor presentation)On a year over year basis, Net Interest Margin declined by 7 basis point, primarily as a result of higher deposit rates.(Source – Investor presentation)Deposit rates are certainly rising, but most investors believe that banks can charge higher rates from loans and improve net interest margins when rates are rising. However, this is not the case for Capital One. In general, lower than expected economic growth results in lower demand for credit, which is one thing. But mainly, Capital One depends on its credit card segment to drive earnings, and credit card rates are less sensitive to rate hikes than deposit rates and loan rates. In this light, Capital One will find it difficult to avoid a further slump in net interest margins in the future.Capital One is not yet done with its investments to improve the overall customer experience. The company management plans to continue with its investments to improve the overall customer experience by providing streamlined digital banking facilities, and gain market share from the increasing popularity of online-only banking services.Capital One shares yield 2% at the current market price, and historically, shares have traded at a yield close to 2%. This might give a first impression to investors that COF is trading at fair value territory, but history doesn’t always repeat itself when it comes to investing, and investors need to calculate an appropriate fair value for the stock using acceptable assumptions about the future of Capital One.Dividend distributions are fairly safe, and investors can expect further hikes in dividends as the bank settles to distribute bulk of its earnings to shareholders.Capital One has been easily covering its dividend payments with free cash flow, which is a positive sign for investors and a sign that indicates the possibility of dividend growth in the future.Free cash flow VS dividend payments(Source – Author prepared based on data from company filings)With a payout ratio of just above 13%, there is clearly more room for dividends to grow in the future.The shareholder repurchase program on the other hand will provide another income stream to investors, and this will help Capital One achieve better per-share earnings figures in the future as the number of shares outstanding decreases with the execution of this share repurchase program.In order to arrive at a fair value estimate for Capital One, I believe in using conservative estimates as the possibility of a recession sometime soon presents significant obstacles to the company’s future growth prospects.I used an excess return model to calculate the fair value estimate of Capital One, and major assumptions used in this analysis are listed below. A noteworthy consideration is that I have used conservative estimates to arrive at a fair value that reflects the minimum market value that I believe the shares should be trading at currently. This provides a greater margin of safety for investors, and I believe it’s important to have a wide margin of safety when investing in the financials sector.With these assumptions, I arrived at a fair value estimate of $102.19 for COF, which represents an upside of 22% from the current market price.(Source – Author’s calculations and assumptions)Despite the expected headwinds in the credit card segment, I believe Capital One is trading at a significant discount to its fair value, and value investors should find COF attractive. The dividend yield of close to 2% guarantees a healthy stream of income for investors as well, and I expect the share price to converge with its fair value as the bank reports stellar financial results in 2019.One of the primary risks of investing in Capital One is the changing macro-economic environment. Maintaining a sustainable loan growth rate might come into question if economic growth slows down. Even though higher interest rates generally help banks, one should not leave out the possibility of lower than expected credit growth as a result of higher interest rates.So far, Capital One has completed a number of successful acquisitions, but investors can never rule out the possibility of a bad deal down the line. A couple of bad deals could negatively impact the future earnings power of the company, and investors would be quick to react to such a negative development.Management risk is a unique risk to which Capital One investors are exposed to. The possibility of the resignation of the company’s CEO creates a significant risk about the future operations of Capital One.Capital One will continue to invest in improving its digital offering and engaging with customers more efficiently, and on the other hand, the company will look for inorganic growth opportunities to drive future earnings of the company. For me, investing is not only about understanding the risks a company faces and then avoiding any investment in the said company, but rather, it’s about understanding the price at which a company should trade after incorporating all available information. In this instance, I find COF significantly undervalued at the current market price, and this provides an attractive investment opportunity to value investors."
4278284,105281,2019-07-26T17:23:32-04:00,"Capital One Financial Corporation delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.37, exceeding consensus estimates of $2.87 per share.We expect a steeper yield curve to help out the company's margins.Asset quality improves, and its stability is expected to continue.Partnership programs need to be monitored.Our buy recommendation is based on the company's cheap valuations and reasonable returns.","Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) announced second quarter U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.24 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.37. The adjusted earnings figure exceeds consensus expectations of $2.87 per share. Consequently, the share price rose as market participants appreciated the earnings beat.(Source: COF Ticker page on Seeking Alpha)This is the third company in our financial services coverage that exceeded consensus earnings expectations. The first we reported on was Synchrony Financial (SYF) and the second was Discover Financial Services (DFS). As is usually the case - there are more insights to find in the earnings release than just the headline figures. Our job is to make it easier for our readers to note what those insights are. Here is our take on the COF second quarter earnings:COF, like most financial services companies, is affected not just by the level of interest rates but also by the corresponding shape of the yield curve. As seen in the chart below, the spread between the 10-year US Treasury bond and the 2-year US Treasury bond has essentially disappeared compared to five years ago. The spread now stands at 0.25% compared to 2.00% five years ago.(Source: FRED Economic Data)This so called 'flat' yield curve is typically viewed by investors as a negative for financial services companies. This is because the banks (which are the most commonly known financial services companies) tend to borrow based on the short-end of the curve (e.g., certificate of deposits) and lend based on the long-end of the curve (e.g., mortgage loans, auto loans, etc.). The narrowing of the spread between the benchmark rates means that the margins of these banks will likely compress - potentially even causing them to lose money on a risk-adjusted basis.This point of view was validated by Chief Financial Officer Richard Scott Blackley during the second quarter earnings call:While we are modestly concerned with a flatter yield curve negatively affecting COF's net interest margins; our view is that the yield curve will actually steepen as the Federal reserve cuts the policy rate over the next twelve to eighteen months.We talked about this view in a prior article on the Federal Reserve. We think that a rate cut is a done deal in July and that there might be another one (if not two) before the end of 2019.Consequently, we see this as a marginal positive for COF on the funding side of things. This view is consistent with the one described by Founder and Chief Executive Officer Richard D. Fairbank (in response to a question about deposit betas) during the second quarter earnings call:In sum, we think that the combination of falling rates and a steepening yield curve will be positive for COF's net interest margins over the next three to six months. This in turn will be positive for COF shareholders and potential investors.Asset quality metrics continued to improve in the second quarter as COF's net charge-off rate falls to 2.48% from 2.64% in the prior quarter.(Source: COF 2Q19 investor presentation)This improvement is in line with what we have seen from other consumer finance companies. For example, SYF's net charge-off rate fell to 6.01% in the second quarter from 6.06% in the first quarter, and DFS's net charge-off rate fell to 3.22% in the second quarter from 3.25% in the first quarter.COF's asset quality improvement is also in line with what we expect based on broad credit card asset quality trends. Delinquency rates on consumer loans for all consumer banks have remained stable at 2.33% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2019.(Source: FRED Economic data)Our own regression analysis of the Federal Reserve Data indicates that 30+ day delinquencies can predict 60% of the net charge-offs six months later. Consequently, we expect continued improvement, if not general stability, in the asset quality metrics of COF over the next three to six months.Regression of quarterly net charge-off rates and 30+ day delinquencies.(Source: Federal Reserve data; Author calculations. The 30+ day delinquency data was lagged for two quarters. We also tested various lagging scenarios, but results from those scenarios showed lower R Square values (thereby having lower explanatory power.))Here is Founder and Chief Executive Officer Richard D. Fairbank on the asset quality (during the second quarter earnings call):Given where we are in this very long economic cycle - I don't think we could have asked for a better assessment of credit conditions. But growing up in the financial crisis wherein I saw companies report massive surges in non-performing assets means that I find it difficult to rely on any person's outlook. We think our guess is just as good as anyone's when it comes to timing the economic cycle.Hence, we prefer to rely on what management does leading up to a credit crisis and how that has played out for them. In fact, COF is a great example of a company whose actions made it stand out as an outperformer during the crisis: it did not lose money during the financial crisis.(Source: COF Disclosures; Author visualization)We believe that the company maintains this standard until now. Here is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer Richard D. Fairbank during the second quarter earnings call commenting on this topic:In sum, we appreciate the continued improvement in asset quality metrics, and we give due recognition to management for their quality underwriting. Their outstanding results during the last crisis speak volumes.In the second quarter earnings call, management disclosed the loss of several partnership portfolios. In total, these portfolios represented $1 billion in receivables, $68 million in provisions, and $160 million in annual revenue. While this loss may not have a meaningful impact on the overall trajectory of COF - we will continue to monitor further disclosures of a similar nature.Partnerships are very difficult to establish and have very high acquisition costs. In fact, COF has already booked $79 million in launch and integration costs for the Walmart Inc. (WMT) partnership. Continued churn of even low volume partners may eventually impact the bottom line and shareholder value. Taken to the extreme, the loss of these partnerships may be heralds of underlying problems that could affect the larger partnerships.Note how much SYF emphasizes the length of its partnerships in their investor day reports (below). This is just indicative of how much value retaining partners is for a specialized consumer finance program.(Source: SYF 2019 investor day presentation)When asked about this issue, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard D. Fairbank responds (during the second quarter earnings call):In sum, we're willing to take management's word at face value regarding these lost partnerships. However, we're going to closely monitor this issue and potentially do some on-the-ground due diligence with some of their partners to assess if there's more to this story. Our fear is that there are underlying conflicts between COF and their partners which can cause more departures - and therefore, higher acquisition costs (and lower shareholder value).We now estimate a fair value for COF based on the second quarter earnings, management's comments, and our own views. In particular, we will be using a justified price to book valuation methodology. It is an approach we feel comfortable using for financial services companies. We used a similar valuation methodology in this article pertaining to DFS and in this article on SYF.Note that this approach was detailed in-depth in the Equities section of the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Level II materials. The summarized version of this can be found in The CFA Glossary Blogspot. It is essentially an implication of the Dividend Discount Model as seen in the derivation below:(Source: CFA Glossary Blogspot)We prefer this valuation method as financial services companies are primarily constrained by capital. More capital retained by the entity will almost always result in more earnings. Thus, we prefer to use a book value-based valuation model rather than an earnings-based valuation model.We use the trailing twelve months average return on equity of 11% as the base case return on equity. We assumed a 2% risk-free rate based on the ten-year US treasury rate; a 6% implied equity risk premium based on the research of Professor Aswath Damodaran; and a market beta of 1.25, which we feel is appropriate for a financial services company concentrated in consumer lending (e.g., credit cards, auto, etc.). Cost of equity is the sum of the risk-free rate and the product of the implied equity risk premium and market beta. Since our calculated upside of 37% is greater than our buy recommendation threshold of 15% - we recommend that investors go long COF.(Source: Author)It is our view that cyclical companies must be evaluated based on mid-cycle returns rather than just the most recent quarters. In our defense (of using said metric in lieu of a specific mid-cycle return calculation) is that the US consumer loan market as a whole is at a halfway point between the low levels of delinquencies in 2015 and the high levels of delinquencies in 2009, and therefore, the returns of COF now can still be considered mid-cycle from an asset quality standpoint.Relative to other cyclical companies (which is practically our entire coverage), COF is more at risk considering that the margin of its trailing twelve months return on equity and our estimated cost of equity is only 100 bps. A relatively minor shift in credit conditions could easily wipe out that differential and our margin of safety.The table below contains the companies in our coverage and our respective price targets for each based on the same justified price to book valuation methodology. Compared to the other companies in our coverage, we believe that COF deserves the lowest premium as it generates the lowest return on equity (and its relatively higher cost of capital does not help either).(Source: Author)COF beat earnings in the second quarter, and the details of its performance affirm our favorable view. We expect the interest rate environment and the steeper yield curve to be an ally. We are pleased to see improvement in asset quality (as we have seen in the other consumer finance companies in our coverage). We remain vigilant with respect to the strength of COF's relationships. The stock is cheap but with some reason. Nonetheless, we prefer to be buyers rather than sellers."
4277101,105281,2019-07-24T13:18:31-04:00,Ten out of the eleven board members are independent. Only non-independent member is the Chief Executive Officer/Founder.Chief Executive Officer has no salary: 100% of pay is at risk.Performance shares awarded based on dividends and growth in tangible book value and adjusted return on tangible common equity.Incentive pay based on a comprehensive set of qualitative and quantitative factors.Corporate governance and management incentives are critical in financial services: Capital One Financial Corporation's is great.,"This article will focus on the corporate governance and management compensation practices at Capital One Financial Corporation (COF). This is part of our ongoing coverage of financial services companies focused on the consumer lending space. We have done a similar analysis for Raymond James Financial (RJF) in this article and for Discover Financial Services (DFS) in this article.We recognize that, in most companies, the management team plays a critical role in generating shareholder returns. Said responsibility is magnified for management in financial services companies. Financial services companies operating with a high degree of operating and financial leverage: a small loss that puts a minor dent in the balance sheet of a manufacturing company can be enough to wipe out the entire market cap of a financial services company.Analyzing the corporate governance and management incentives is the first step in determining the risk-reward opportunity for a financial services company. Only after that step can an analysis of business quality, competitive advantage, and valuation be made.I have used a similar framework in my prior articles related to corporate governance (as seen if you follow the links above). Do check out those articles to learn more about our general framework and how we've applied them in the past. With that said, let's start with the board of directors.We are pleased to find that ten out of the eleven board members of the company are independent and that the only non-independent board member is the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, and Founder of COF. We generally like to see a lot of independent directors on a board. Said independent directors are more likely to challenge management on key issues including strategy, mergers and acquisitions, and compensation. However, we recognize that this generalization has several exceptions and that is why we can't simply look to independence as the only criterion for assessing a board.Second, we enjoyed seeing that board members are elected annually by a majority vote of the shareholders. The alternative, which is a staggered election of the board of directors, prevents shareholders from fully exercising their power as owners of the company. Board members are more likely to execute their fiduciary duty if they are subject to an annual election process: grave shortcomings by the board can be punished by a strong shareholder resolution.Third, we were impressed to find a meaningful annual board evaluation led by the Lead Independent Director. We find the activity meaningful as it has led to very constructive changes in the way corporate governance is implemented for the company.(Source: COF 2019 proxy statement)A key example of that would be the change in the metrics used to determine the performance share awards. Prior to 2019, the primary basis for granting performance share awards was adjusted return on assets. In 2019, the primary basis was changed to the combination of dividends and growth of tangible book value per share and adjusted return on tangible common equity.The adjusted return on assets metric had a key flaw with respect to performance management measurement: it did not award or penalize management for their ability in managing leverage. A strong company with a favorable long-term outlook will be more likely to raise debt financing and, therefore, raise return on equity versus a company with a similar return on asset profile but a less favorable long-term outlook. Conversely, a company that takes on too much debt will run up a massive financial cost and, therefore, a much lower return on equity profile (and return to shareholder profile) compared to a company that did not have enough debt (yet have a comparable return on asset profile).Shifting the performance metric to adjusted return on tangible common equity resolved that issue without introducing new major weaknesses. The addition of a shareholder return metric (e.g., dividend and growth in tangible book value) only strengthened the alignment between shareholders and management.Our only criticism is that the two metrics are highly correlated and more likely than not will generate the same outcomes for the management team's compensation whether they are taken together or separately/independently.The various board committees all play an important role in setting the direction of the company. However, we tend to focus on the audit committee for our corporate governance framework. Financial services companies like COF are very reliant on management estimates, including those relating to provisions (e.g., loan loss provisions) which directly impact earnings. Specifically, the 2018 annual report states:Four major categories are affected by management estimates: loan loss reserves, asset impairment, fair value of financial instruments, and customer rewards reserve. An example pertaining to loan loss provisions from the 2018 annual report is below:Therefore, shareholders of financial services companies are heavily reliant on a strong audit committee to maintain internal controls and to present financial statements according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We believe that the audit committee of COF is capable of delivering on those shareholder expectations.(Source: COF 2019 proxy statement)Our personal preference is for more accounting and audit professionals in the audit committee (with at least one member being a Certified Public Accountant). Financial services companies face a constantly changing set of financial reporting and regulatory requirements. Most of the changes are technical in nature and require a deep understanding of (potentially arcane) accounting concepts. Furthermore, we believe that critical estimates (specifically those related to fair value of financial assets or loan loss reserves) require industry-specific accounting knowledge (second only to companies operating in the insurance industry).Nonetheless, the audit committee (as a whole) brings a wealth and diversity of experience to the job. For example, Catherine G. West was the former Chief Operating Officer of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; this experience allows her to contribute her unique insights on consumer lending regulation to the company. Another example, Pierre E. Leroy brings a wealth of experience in the digital analytics field; this experience allows him to contribute to discussions surrounding analytics and its impact on financial reporting. On balance, we are confident that this team can deliver above and beyond the needs of the shareholders with respect to the audit committee function.(Source: COF 2019 proxy statement)(Source: COF 2019 proxy statement)(Source: COF 2019 proxy statement)(Source: COF 2019 proxy statement)Next, we'll discuss the top management compensation and the different aspects of the compensation program that lead us to believe that management incentives are exceptionally aligned with shareholder interests. In order to facilitate this discussion, we will be referring to the table below which summarizes the 2018 compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Named Executive Officers (NEOs).(Source: COF 2019 proxy statement)The first compensation component is the salary. We were amazed to find that the Chief Executive Officer does not earn a cash salary: 100% of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation is at-risk based on his and the company's performance. While the NEOs earn a cash salary; the compensation committee actually decreased the total target compensation (for the NEOs) in the form of a cash salary from 35% to 20% in 2018. This increases the proportion of their compensation at risk and further aligns shareholder interests with their own. We also note that the compensation committee claims that it does not guarantee incentive awards and, therefore, the performance-based compensation is truly 'at-risk'.The second compensation component is performance-based compensation.The first performance-based compensation we'll discuss is performance shares. Performance shares are given as incentive for future company performance. These shares vest at the end of a three-year performance period based on the achievement of the performance factors (e.g., dividends and growth of tangible book value per share and adjusted return on tangible common equity) relative to peers. These shares are also subject to a performance share reduction (which we will discuss below), misconduct clawback, and financial restatement clawback.Note that the performance shares vest based on the company's performance versus its peers. It must at least be in the upper half among its peers in order to achieve full vesting. It is also rewarded for exceeding the performance of its peers (up to an increase of 50%).(Source: COF 2019 proxy statement)There is also an absolute threshold of performance for the performance shares. Management is penalized for negative adjusted return on capital employed through the forfeiture of performance shares (as seen in the table below). We believe this further helps mitigate the risk that management takes large risks on the credit or balance sheet side of things in order to generate a massive return on one year at the expense of the subsequent years.(Source: COF 2019 proxy statement)Overall, we like the concept of the performance shares especially because we agree with the performance factors. We also like the comparison to peers and the absolute return thresholds. We have seen other companies who reward management based on earnings per share or earnings per share growth, and we think those aren't appropriate performance measures for financial services companies (which are capital constrained).Given all the things we like about the performance shares, our only apprehension is that the peer group of the compensation committee contains companies that are very much larger than COF and may not be representative of the company's primary competition. We have included the list below. On the other hand, these larger competitors have strengths such as breadth of product offerings, balance sheet, and branch network which make it challenging for COF to compete against them directly.The second performance-based compensation we'll discuss is the year-end incentive opportunity. The incentive opportunity is awarded based on four elements of performance: financial and operating performance; governance and risk management; strategic performance; and winning with customers and associates. The form of the incentive can be deferred cash and/or an equity-based award. Both completely vest at the end of three years and are subject to clawback provisions.We think that the elements considered by this compensation are comprehensive as a whole. For example, it accounts for credit performance and underwriting in the governance and risks management section; disciplined investments in infrastructure, technology, and growth initiatives in the strategic performance section; and employee engagement and retention in the winning with customers and associates section.We think that the incentive opportunity is a good complement to the performance shares as it accounts for the more qualitative aspects of performance. While this increases the subjectivity of the process and makes it more prone to management pressure and manipulation - we think that these risks are manageable.In sum, we find that management incentives are exceptionally aligned with the best practices in corporate governance: a high degree of at-risk compensation, a mix of quantitative and qualitative performance measures, and a set of objective and quantifiable performance targets. We think that the program as a whole is well implemented and our complaints are very limited: none of the mechanisms stands out as particularly weak.We find that corporate governance and management incentives are strong in the case of COF. We especially like the annual performance evaluation of the board and the high degree of at-risk pay for top management. We also like the key performance metrics used by the company.Consequently, investors should proceed to take a closer look at the other aspects of the investment: balance sheet strength, business quality, and valuation.Look out for our future articles on COF and other companies in the financial services industry. Don't forget to like our articles and follow us to get the latest on these under-covered equities."
4279545,105281,2019-07-31T12:02:34-04:00,Data breach affected 100 million Americans.Capital One Financial demonstrated a strong and coordinated response to the incident and managed to capture the perpetrator.The vulnerability has been resolved and is unlikely to repeat.The extent of the damage pales in comparison to the breach experienced by Equifax Inc. whose stock price has since recovered.We believe that the intrinsic value of Capital One remains intact and that the price decline increased the margin of safety. We maintain our buy recommendation.,"Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) announced a data security incident affecting 100 million individuals in the United States and six million individuals in Canada. Consequently the market sold off on the stock for the day - resulting in a decline of almost 6%.(Source: COF Ticker page on Seeking Alpha)We think that the selling is overdone. This is especially easier to believe once we compare this data breach with that experienced by Equifax Inc. (EFX) back in 2017. As seen in the chart below - the short-term sell-off induced by their own announcement of a data breach has since recovered (several times, in fact).(Source: EFX Ticker page on Seeking Alpha)We'll talk you through the three big differences between the COF breach and the EFX one. Next we'll talk through the implications of the COF breach on the earnings ability of COF. Finally we'll connect the earnings implication with our valuation of COF.First, COF was very quick in determining the extent of the problem and in announcing it. Note that an external security researcher reported the vulnerability on 17 July 2019 and COF was able to discover the incident by 19 July 2019; by 30 July 2019 the company was able to announce the extent of the breach and its successful resolution of the vulnerability. In comparison EFX discovered the breach on 29 July 2017 and only reported it to the investing public on 7 September 2017. Second, COF was able to not only resolve the issue but also apprehend the alleged perpetrator of the breach. This allows COF and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to extract relevant information from the alleged perpetrator and take necessary steps to minimize the potential damage of the breach. EFX was not able to identify any perpetrator linked to their data breach let alone capture anyone.Third and most important, the headline number of 100 million affected individuals in the United States for COF is somewhat misleading in comparison to the 143 million affected individuals in the case of EFX. The data breach for COF failed to intercept credit card numbers, log-in credentials, and social security numbers for over 99% of the individuals affected. In the case of EFX, the compromised information included: social security numbers, driver's license numbers, and credit card numbers.Consequently, we believe that COF will not be paying a meaningful amount of fees to the Federal Trade Commission unlike that of EFX (amounting to $425 million in settlement fees). COF was able to independently determine the existence of a vulnerability, to work quickly in closing the vulnerability, and to coordinate a response with investigators to apprehend the perpetrator. We believe that any penalty levied by the Federal Trade Commission or any other regulatory body will be a bad signal to the extent that COF has been a pro-active and good faith solver of the issue.This view aligns with management's own view. COF only expects to carve out $100-150 million in additional costs in relation to this incident. Said costs will revolve mainly around customer notifications, credit monitoring, technology costs, and legal support. Consequently the company is able to affirm its 2019 operating efficiency guidance (which is inclusive of these costs) despite the incremental and unexpected costs form this incident.We now estimate a fair value for COF based on the latest financial information from the second quarter earnings, facts related to the data breach incident, and our own views. In particular, we will be using a justified price to book valuation methodology. It is an approach we feel comfortable using for financial services companies. We used a similar valuation methodology in this article pertaining to DFS and in this article on SYF.Note that this approach was detailed in-depth in the Equities section of the Chartered Financial Analyst (""CFA"") Level II materials. The summarized version of this can be found in The CFA Glossary Blogspot. It is essentially an implication of the Dividend Discount Model as seen in the derivation below:(Source: CFA Glossary Blogspot)We prefer this valuation method as financial services companies are primarily constrained by capital. More capital retained by the entity will almost always result in more earnings. Thus, we prefer to use a book value-based valuation model rather than an earnings-based valuation model.We use the trailing twelve months average return on equity of 11% as the base case return on equity. We assumed a 2% risk-free rate based on the ten-year US treasury rate; a 6% implied equity risk premium based on the research of Professor Aswath Damodaran; and a market beta of 1.25, which we feel is appropriate for a financial services company concentrated in consumer lending (e.g., credit cards, auto, etc.). Cost of equity is the sum of the risk-free rate and the product of the implied equity risk premium and market beta.We adjusted the shareholders' equity of COF by the $150 million charge related to this incident. This is reflective of our believe that this incident will be a non-event in the long-term (therefore not affecting the run-rate return on equity). The recent decline also increases the margin of safety all things held constant. Since our calculated upside of 45% is greater than our buy recommendation threshold of 15% - we recommend that investors go long COF. Note that our upside estimate is even higher now than from our prior article.(Author)We think that the data breach is a non-event in the long-run. We continue to like COF fundamentals and recommend that investors maintain or add to their positions.The EFX data breach (which was far worse than COF) shows that investors can move on from these incidents as long as there is a clear resolution. COF has not only demonstrated that resolution (by apprehending the perpetrator) but also shown great pro-activeness in dealing with the issue (via third party vulnerability reporting processes) and by responding decisively in the face of risk.The recent price decline only enhances the margin of safety for patient investors. Long COF."
4240803,102937,2019-02-13T20:23:17-05:00,Capital One is moving away from home equity loans and mortgages which will grant it greater efficiency in the sectors in which it continues operating.Capital One has made several strategic acquisitions to boost its position as a leading credit card provider and consumer debt service.Capital One is seeing greater returns from its consumer and commercial banking segments.,"Image Source: Capitalone.comCapital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) is a diversified financial services holding company with many subsidiaries. The company has three primary business segments: Commercial banking, consisting of providing financial services to businesses, consumer banking, geared towards providing banking services towards the general public, and credit cards, which provide small lines of credit to consumers. Capital One operates in a highly competitive industry, competing against other companies like Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Discover (NYSE:DFS) for the credit card sector, and regional and national banks for banking services. In its most recent quarter, Capital One reported that 75% of its revenue came from its credit card business, 14% from consumer banking, and 11% from commercial banking. Until Capital One increases the proportion of banking services to credit card services, it should primarily be viewed as a credit card company when contemplating an investment. Nonetheless, each of its main business sectors should be treated accordingly to get a full picture of the company's overall financial health, as well as to get an idea as to where the company is heading in 2019. Capital One enjoys high profit margins from two of its three business cores: credit cards and consumer banking. Its commercial banking revenue lags behind somewhat, but this accounts for its smallest segment. Meanwhile, the company has adopted a corporate strategy that emphasizes its credit card business over the others, and its strategic developments in that arena present a new buying opportunity which should yield impressive returns going forward.Capital One's claim to fame is its credit cards, a convenient and easy way to make day-to-day purchases on a line of credit. Though competition in credit card issuance is fierce, Capital One remains one of the nation's top issuers, behind American Express and some of the big banks such as Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase. As its leading business segment and revenue generator, Capital One pays special attention to its credit card sector and its development. In September 2017, the company chose to shift resources away from its banking sector and into its credit card sector with its decision to cease originating new home mortgages and home equity loan products within the consumer banking branch. Capital One shifted its efforts on strategic acquisitions that would boost its credit card capabilities, such as the mass purchase of credit card loans from Synovus and Cabela's. In its most recent quarter, consumer trends have benefited Capital One, as overall purchases made with its cards are up 10% compared to this time last year, with credit card revenue up 2%, a healthy number for this line of business. Likewise, Capital One has enjoyed a decrease in credit loss, down roughly 11% from this time last year. Together, these statistical trends have granted the company a revenue margin of 16% on its cards. source: Capital One Q4 earnings presentationCapital One does cite some risks associated with its largest revenue producer. Credit card spending is subjected to seasonal volatility, as consumer spending fluctuates during the holidays. Furthermore, if payment patterns change, default rates and delinquencies could rise which would hurt their bottom line. Given the state of the domestic economy, though, with unemployment rates low and consumer confidence high, Capital One seems confident that these risks are worth citing for transparency, but will likely not be cause for concern in the immediate future. Instead, the big risks seem to come from the capital markets, as a rise in interest rates or increased costs associated with funding activities may affect operational profit long before the next recession might. Nonetheless, credit cards remain Capital One's anchor and can be relied on to continue producing hefty profits for the company in the coming years. Capital One is scaling back its lending in the consumer banking sector, particularly with home loans and mortgages. This is due to a shift in its strategic planning, which involves moving resources out of lower profit sectors and into higher profit ones. As a result, Capital One has stated that its booked loans are down 21% from the same period last year. Even though the company looks to move away from consumer bank lending, it still offers basic consumer banking products and services, and as such, has continued growing its deposits. According to its most recent fiscal quarterly results, consumer deposits have risen 7% year-over-year, which will provide the company with additional capital it can use to fund its other activities. source: Capital One Q4 earnings presentationThe commercial banking sector is Capital One's weak link, but fortunately is also its smallest component from an operations standpoint. Capital One has increased its lending activity to businesses and other commercial enterprises in an effort to boost its margins here, with loans being up 9% year-over-year, but revenue from the sector is down by roughly the same amount, as are its deposits. source: Capital One Q4 earnings presentationCapital One is a solid investment, as its credit card business segment will lead it to profitable times ahead. Through its credit card business and its initiatives that focus on expanding it, Capital One has been able to steadily grow its revenue and margins over the past several years. source: TD AmeritradeIn the financial sector, Capital One trades well below its peers in terms of P/E and P/B ratios, indicating that the company is currently trading at levels that could be considered to represent great value. source: TD AmeritradeAs Capital One expands its credit card business in 2019 through more strategic initiatives, it will see its margins expand and its bottom line swell. At current price levels, one cannot ignore this discounted stock, and it pays a nice dividend as well."
4234984,56142,2019-01-23T11:52:22-05:00,Capital One's loan charge-off level is set to rise materially as the economy slows.A weakening share price and relative strength performance trend vs. industry peers and the S&P 500 appeared in 2018.A significant recession in 2019-20 would lead to a sharply lower Capital One stock quote.,"The Capital One Financial (COF) business model is highly dependent on a growing U.S. economy, with a low level of consumer loan delinquencies and charge-offs. Luckily, investors in Capital One have witnessed relatively small/falling credit write-downs of around $7 billion in 2017 and an estimated $5.5-6 billion in 2018, using data from the first nine months as a proxy. In a worrisome development of late, the company has witnessed an uptick in delinquencies since September.My bearish argument revolves around the increasing odds of recession in 2019-20, with sharply increased charge-offs destroying earnings for Capital One. Given a severe recession like 2007-09, the company could be forced to raise additional capital or sell business units to cover losses and remain solvent, greatly diluting existing shareholder value vs. the start of 2019.Image Source: Capital One TV CommercialCapital One is part of a select group in terms of size and focus on the higher-risk consumer loan market, especially uncollateralized credit cards. The company holds $110 billion in credit card loans, and another $60 billion in consumer auto/mortgage/personal loans currently. We have all seen the ads with Jennifer Garner and others hocking quick and easy signature loans through mass media outlets. During good economic times, the company is able to earn strong levels of profitability as loan losses remain low.On the flip side of the coin, the 2007-09 recession nearly bankrupted the company, as credit losses jumped. You can review the chart and table below highlighting the correlation between credit card delinquencies and the Capital One stock drop from $84 a share in early 2007 to under $8 at the March 2009 bottom. The stock price “discounted” expanding write-off levels, trading well ahead of the news on the ground. Great Recession credit market problems reached their zenith at the end of 2009 and beginning of 2010, 6-9 months after the stock price bottomed.The above table of delinquency and charge-off rates for credit cards from 1989 to 2016 is from Wallethub using 2017 Federal Reserve data. By any measure, credit card delinquency rates have stayed at record low levels for a record length of time since 2013.All told, Capital One’s credit card delinquency rate of 4% today is roughly one-third the rate of the last recession and below the long-term 30-year industry average above 5%. What if the next recession is not a mild one, like Wall Street analysts are predicting for 2020 as a consensus view right now? What if record debts all over the world, including the U.S., lead to a large, or even bigger recession than 2007-09? If we get that as our reality soon, Capital One will have huge problems dealing with such a monster, in my estimation.Below are charts of the weakening performance of Capital One vs. peers in the banking business, especially the higher-risk consumer-focused companies of Discover Financial (DFS) and American Express (AXP). The major diversified banks in the U.S., including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citibank (C), Bank of America (BAC), and Wells Fargo (WFC) also began to fade vs. the S&P 500 return last year. Plus, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) was an important laggard in 2018. Are delinquency problems coming for lenders?The price bounce higher in early 2019 looks like a good technical area to sell Capital One shares, or even consider shorting it. You can review the overhead price resistance area in the chart below. The $85-90 range looks like it will be a formidable supply obstacle to overcome. At the very least, a retest of the mid-$70s area, just above the December selloff low seems probable.Hints of the weak quality of the Capital One loan portfolio abound. Perhaps the biggest in my mind deals was the summer of 2017 Federal Reserve stress test snub. Every large U.S. bank passed, but Capital One had to refile and was the only banking company of 34 that did not raise its common dividend in June-July 2017. Again, after the summer 2018 stress test results, Capital One did not raise its $0.40 quarterly dividend payout, while other large banks did. The company has been “returning” capital to shareholders through equity buybacks at elevated prices the last few years. Nevertheless, the present 1.9% dividend yield is below the S&P 500 stock market average, the financial industry average, and well below the major bank average rate.According to the last available balance sheet from the September 2018 10-Q filing, the company has one of the largest credit card loan portfolios in the nation at $110 billion, and one of the highest consumer loan percentages of total assets at 50%. Compare Capital One's 50% asset exposure to U.S. consumer loans against 80% for Discover, 35% for American Express, 12% for Citibank, and less than 10% for JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.The strong 2018 performance of Capital One’s operating income has been almost entirely a function of low and lower loan loss reserves taken, on top of Trump tax law changes. You can review the 3rd Quarter increase in profits below, as write-offs fell considerably.While mainstream analysts are counting on 2018’s peak earnings and margins as sustainable, the stock market pricing of Capital One is starting to look forward to the final stages of the credit cycle and an approaching downturn. When that happens, loan losses will rise substantially, and if past cycles are a guide, interest income will fall with declining interest rates. This double whammy typically produces a material drop in earnings during a recessionary period. It’s possible that all earnings will be wiped clean for a year or two, and the company will have to deal with charge-offs eroding underlying shareholder worth from the $35 billion tangible book value number today. The present $85 stock price is equal to a stock market capitalization of $40 billion.In 2010, at the end of the last recession, the company wrote off about 7% of ALL loan value. That’s well above today’s ultra-low 2% credit loss expense annualized in the September Quarter, reported on $240 billion in loan value. If we get a whopper recession again, Capital One could be writing an “extra” $10 or $15 billion off earnings yearly. Considering 2018 earnings may peak just shy of $6 billion, the downside to profitability and shareholder worth is gigantic, given another major recession. While the current 0.8x price to accounting book value looks cheap (1.2x tangible book value after subtracting $15 billion in goodwill and intangible assets), the 2009 low price was just 0.15x book value. To say that such a low valuation will never happen again is akin to someone saying at the depths of the financial panic ten years ago, the stock market will never recover or trade at record high valuations similar to 2007 or 2000. WRONG. “History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes,” is the famous quote from Mark Twain.If you are looking to sell financials, Capital One should be near the top of your list of prospects to continue researching. My personal view is we are headed for a serious downturn, either in terms of damage to the economy or playing out over a prolonged length of time. Tightening credit conditions as evidenced by the nearly inverted Treasury yield curve in late 2018; the appearance of an actual trade war with China during the summer months; and a sharp decline in confidence and wealth caused by the 20% stock market swoon in the 4th Quarter just ended - all presage a slowing economy in the first half of 2019.Depending on events on the ground, a slowing economy could easily tip into recession. Then, the most overleveraged U.S. economy in history, including sovereign debt, business debt and consumer debt in aggregate vs. economic output, could turn into an economic fiasco quickly. Don’t say it cannot happen. From my 30 years of trading experience, whenever we get three or more significant issues dragging on wealth, output and confidence, we fall into recession. Holding too much leverage going into a recession is what turns a mild one into a deeper one.Seeking Alpha author Danielle DiMartino Booth wrote an interesting article this past week about late cycle credit card usage and how it relates to 2018 trends. It appears the November-December swoon in Capital One shares has plenty of fundamental logic to back the selling. We are long overdue for a recession, nearly 10 years into our current expansion. The clock is ticking.Please consult a registered financial advisor if you are contemplating a Capital One short position. The unique risks of short selling, including the potential for unlimited losses are different than holding a long-only position. Always short a diversified basket of stocks to reduce the risk of one equity creating oversized losses."
4208743,92586,2018-09-27T17:11:25-04:00,"Capital One delivered decent Q1 and Q2 results earlier this year, but I believe the task will be harder in the third quarter.Loan balances should remain healthy, but I fear about narrowing interest margin and rising credit costs.I continue to favor more conservative and diversified plays in the banking sector, and will keep my hands off COF for now.","Trying to break the inertia in the banking sector (KBE), which is down 1% year-to-date against a much stronger broad market (SPY), Capital One (COF) will attempt to deliver second quarter-like results in 3Q18. The company is expected to release its earnings report on October 18th, ahead of the opening bell.The Street is projecting revenues of $6.9 billion that, if achieved, would land nearly 1% below year-ago levels - the worst YOY change since 3Q14. On the EPS side, consensus estimates of $2.85 would represent material improvement of 18% over 3Q17's adjusted $2.42.Credit: CCNDespite the bar having been set low on the revenue side, I believe Capital One's task of impressing investors next month will be a tough one. On the plus side, I expect loan balance growth to remain healthy, given the overall state of the economy and of consumer spending that appear to be robust. In fact, the company's recent 8-K filings suggest that, in July and August, loans held for investment ended each month above their respective monthly average, suggesting a positive trend on both the domestic credit card and auto portfolios. On the minus side, NIM (net interest margin) could very well remain under pressure. As the chart below illustrates, the T10Y2Y interest rate spread continued to shrink in the third quarter, which might bode ill for the company's net interest income that represented a sizable 77% of total company revenues last quarter. As a reminder, in 2Q18, Capital One's net interest margin of 6.7% was down 27 bps, and I would not be surprised to see further deterioration in the metric this time.Source: St. Louis FedOn the cost side, it does not look like the credit provision tailwinds that helped the bank deliver a historically wide EPS beat of $0.59 in 2Q18, corroborated by an industry-wide improvement in delinquency in the second quarter (see graph below), will be much of a factor this time. Once again turning to Capital One's July and August op metrics, domestic credit card 30-day delinquency has risen sequentially by 14 and 12 bps, respectively. As I have stated in the past, I'm constantly monitoring the health of consumer loans in the U.S. and assessing the impact that bad debt may have on banks' bottom lines. While indicators do not look overly concerning now, the effect that rising interest rates and the nearly year-old tax reform might have on consumer credit activity can be meaningfully negative, assuming an eventual (but almost inevitable) deterioration in the macro landscape.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from the Federal ReserveDespite the solid second and first quarters of 2018 that made me just a bit more excited about COF in late April, I still have reservations. Driving my discomfort is (1) the less diversified nature of the business compared to large banks like JPMorgan (JPM) or Bank of America (BAC), (2) interest margin pressures that could more directly impact a bank like Capital One, whose revenues are overwhelmingly driven by interest income, and (3) the company's exposure to a potential deterioration in credit quality at a sector-wide level.Source: table data provided by YChartsPlaying against my cautious stance is a stock that looks very cheap at current levels. As the chart ad table above indicate, COF's forward P/E of 8.7x is at a peer group low, and so are the long-term PEG and price-to-tangible book multiples. Add to the de-risked valuation metrics a stock that has returned a meager -4% YTD, and bargain-hunting investors might find the name compelling at a discount.However, I continue to favor more conservative and diversified plays in the banking sector, and will keep my hands off COF for now."
4214947,92586,2018-10-26T14:16:58-04:00,"Capital One delivered an eye-catching earnings beat in October, driven primarily by a large release in credit loss reserves.Aside from the home loan disposition, the credit card and auto books looked robust, although an increase in delinquency worries me.In the end, I have enough reasons to be less than excited about the stock.","Driven primarily by a release of credit loss reserves, Capital One (COF) delivered a wide 3Q18 EPS beat of 26 cents and revenues that largely matched consensus. A closer look behind the curtains, however, confirms a couple of the fears that I presented in my earnings preview: Shrinking net interest margin and a bump in delinquency rates that make me wary about credit quality. Credit: FortuneStarting with the top line drivers, total loans held for investment dipped 5% YOY, primarily the result of the home loan portfolio sale that impacted the consumer banking segment negatively. Otherwise, my expectations for ""loan balance growth to remain healthy, given the overall state of the economy and of consumer spending"" proved accurate. The larger credit card business (about two thirds of total revenues) saw average loan balance rise by an impressive 7% YOY, pushing net interest income higher by 5%.Net interest margin, expectedly, did not help to propel revenues further. With the interest rate spread tightening, Capital One managed to produce 7.01% in NIM that was 7 bps lower than 3Q17, even after accounting for the benefits of the auto loan book disposition and the extra income-earning day in the quarter. The graph below illustrates the declining trend (2Q18 was impacted by a handful of one-off, unfavorable items) that I expect to persist in the immediate future.Source: company's earnings slidesFurther down the P&L, a sizable release in credit loss reserves accounted for what I believe was the most impactful factor in the positive earnings surprise. While this is a positive development for earnings growth in the quarter, I fear that the tailwinds may not be sustainable in the longer term, particularly if the tides turn and the economy undergoes a period of slower growth.Secondarily, I'm also cautious about underwriting risk, particularly as fierce competition leads to less favorable lending terms and growth in high-quality assets becomes more challenging. Thirty-day delinquency deteriorated by a noticeable 24 bps YOY, further justifying my credit quality concerns. Capital One delivered an eye-catching earnings beat in October, but I have enough reasons to be less than excited about the stock. The current macro landscape continues to be favorable for banks in general, which in part explains the solid performance of the company's credit card and auto businesses. However, an eventual shift in the economic cycle could lead to a perfect storm of slow growing assets coupled with higher credit losses, which might put a large dent on Capital One's future financial results.Source: table data provided by YChartsHelping to support some bullishness is valuation. COF currently trades at a very modest 7.5x next year's EPS and 0.6x long-term PEG. It seems to be the cheapest major bank stock out there, in fact. But the lack of diversification (nearly 60% of total company revenues come from the domestic card business) along with my concerns over the possible end of a long, favorable period of economic expansion are enough reasons for me to steer away from this stock.In the financial services space, I continue to give preference to highly diversified, high-quality names like Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan (JPM), and will continue to leave COF alone for now."

Credit card delinquencies across all major banks have started to rise and most notably at smaller banks.Delinquency Rate on Credit Cards: Small BanksSource: Federal Reserve, EPB Macro ResearchCapital One (COF) reported earnings recently that broadly missed consensus expectations and showed signs that confirm the negative trend in the consumer that we have been discussing in EPB Macro Research, my private investment community.In the earnings report for Capital One, the charge-off rate on credit cards rose 41 basis points over one year ago to a new high of 2.89%.Capital One Credit Card Charge-Off Rate:Source: Company Filings, EPB Macro ResearchThis rise in charge-off rate is a problematic trend and it is currently at its worst level since 2011.While this trend is a red flag and something that should give investors pause, it is not surprising given the trends we have been following closely.In the last public research note, the trends in personal income, credit growth, and the savings rate served to prove that the consumer is actually in a very tough position and consumption is going to start to decline if credit does not continue to expand. As credit expands 9+ years into an economic cycle, rising charge-off rates and delinquencies are the results.Real Personal Disposable Income Per Capita 5-Year Annualized Rate:Source: BEA, BLS, EPB Macro ResearchThe savings rate does not have much room to move lower.Personal Savings Rate:Source: BEA. EPB Macro ResearchWith increasing credit growth for consumers and a falling savings rate, consumption growth should be accelerating. That, however, is not the case, as consumption growth has decelerated over the past few years.Real Consumption Growth:Source: BEA, EPB Macro ResearchRising credit growth, falling income growth, and a rapidly declining savings rate has been a trend for several quarters and it has been a waiting game for when the negative effects would show up in the data. The trend is clearly unsustainable and the data is starting to reflect that reality.Capital One's earnings and trends in credit card charge-offs prove that this is not a one-off event but rather one specific case in a larger trend.It is rather undeniable that there is an abundance of bad debt in the economy and the consumer is over-leveraged. The current level of delinquencies is not enough to cause a problem but the question remains as to whether these trends continue or reverse. The rise in credit card delinquencies is certainly an undeniable trend.I would stay away from COF and other credit card companies that take large credit risk such as Discover Financial (DFS)."
4190122,104183,2018-07-25T16:34:47-04:00,"Capital One is trying to break out of a six-month range following its Q2 earnings report, but investors need to look past this short-term update.The valuation on the stock is compelling, but it’s cheap because of the risk of its loan book being concentrated on autos and credit cards.Volatility in the name will begin to accelerate as we get into the later innings of the cycle and deposit costs continue to rise.","Capital One (COF) has yet to recover from its February dip, in accord with the broader market sell-off. However, following this earnings report and recognizing the current backdrop of the market being late cycle, I am more concerned about the efficacy of the company’s loan book because it lends to a riskier set of borrowers than other credit card companies. Investors should proceed with caution, and while the company is well-run, I think this is the time to exit the position and opt for higher quality credit card names.Source: TimeWith any lender, there’s credit risk and it’s the risk that shareholders must be full cognizant of. Credit card companies are exposed as the rate cycle progresses as borrowers find it increasingly difficult to pay back carried balances and deposit costs rise. Efficiency becomes the hallmark of great lenders at this stage. Additionally, loans become more expensive, and while that’s not always visible at the Fed Funds level, at the APR level and the mortgage level it is significantly more pronounced. More broadly, investors should take the time to read the most recent earnings call themselves, as well as the supporting documents, because of the breadth of Capital One’s services provided speaks volumes about the financial strength of the consumer and the household in the United States.Jumping into it, the first statistic that stood out to me was a lower NII and a lower NIM QOQ, but a slight improvement on the former YOY. A 22 bps lower NIM YOY, however, reflects the heightened risk profile of the underlying book. Clearly, there was a negative effect on the NIM/NII profile from rising deposit costs. Ending deposits were up 4% YOY with a 29 bp increase in the average deposit interest rate. That may not seem like a lot, but that 29 bps is the direct effect of base rates in the United States moving higher and will continue to weigh on the company’s bottom line unless they can find a way to offset that with higher interest income from riskier lines of the business.Additionally, the company expects a relatively flat efficiency ratio YOY for the full year 2018 and expects marketing spend to ramp up with it “all coming in the second half of the year,” which will create further margin pressure. The only other thing I’d highlight at an income level is that the company posted a gain of $400 million from the sale of their mortgage portfolio, which reduces the overall strength of Q2 earnings.Source: Investor PresentationIn particular, the charge-off data is also particularly interesting to me. Net charge-offs are at a very low level at 2.42% and this is down 25 bps YOY and 17 bps QOQ. The lower the charge-offs, the less stress that is placed on the company’s book, plain and simple. Allowance coverage ratio also ticked up on a % basis, but declined to $7.36 billion on an absolute basis. Still, there’s a significant buffer of liquidity for the company and the CET1 crossing the 11% threshold is evidence of that.That charge-off rate is for the broader business, so I think it’s helpful to break it down by segment. Within credit cards, it’s 4.67%, which is actually down from 5.02% YOY and from 5.03% YOY. This still seems quite high to me. While there has to be some benefit from tax returns during the second quarter, this is still a quality improvement, especially as purchase volume was up 17% YOY. This segment actually posted the highest overall charge-off rate as consumer banking saw a 1.19% rate and commercial bank posted 3.1%.Source: Investor PresentationWithin autos, which comprises nearly a quarter of their loan book, the risk becomes all the more apparent and is more risky than standard credit card borrowing. Default rates across the United States have been ticking up slowly as the cycle progresses and are now at 5.8% (for those delinquencies past 60 days). This is a concerning statistic so it is helpful to have positive commentary surrounding the segment from management on the call. First, loans were up 8%, and until that rate turns flat to negative, the company is in a solid risk position. However, that’s far too basic for our purposes of critically analyzing the loan book.Chairman and CEO Richard Fairbank said, “over the longer term, we continue to expect that the Auto charge-off rate will increase gradually as the cycle plays out.” This might seem relatively benign at the forefront, but as these increasing charge-offs become visible in headlines on earnings releases, shareholders will get skittish and sell. This is an impact I expect to be far less pronounced in higher quality lenders. Also, consider that if 60 day+ delinquencies are above last cycle’s highs, and management expects them to continue to increase, what does that say about the quality of the loan book?I do, however, struggle to call significant downside on the name considering that the stock trades at 8.7x forward earnings. That’s cheap at a first glance and relative to Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), trading at 31x and 32x forward earnings, respectively, there is a clear case for value here. I’d advise investors to buy on the dip should one present itself as the company is trading at a one turn discount on a forward earnings basis to its historical average.I won’t discuss the yield at length because it’s simply not a selling point for the stock at 1.62% despite the benefit of outpacing peers Visa and Mastercard by over 100 bps. A sub-S&P 500 yield simply isn’t attractive to me unless it’s a gold miner, so despite the optically pleasing 28% 5Y dividend growth rate, they’ve kept it flat since mid-2015 and haven’t passed along the benefit of rate hikes and higher NIMs to shareholders.This is clearly not a consensus long judging by price action relative to that of Visa and Mastercard, so there’s a clear opportunity for alpha. At the same time, given the risk their credit card book and their auto book contains, I’m not so sure I’d want to be anywhere else but Visa and Mastercard, especially given their tech-forward approaches to banking. When the cycle starts to turn down and economic indicators deteriorate, Capital One adds unnecessary beta to the portfolio and I simply do not want that exposure as rate pressures begin to mount.Source: StockChartsConsider, too, the peers I’m choosing to compare Capital One to. The more identical comparable is Discover Financial (DFS), which reports earnings on Thursday. The valuation is more in line at around 9x earnings, but posted a higher charge-off rate last year than Capital One did (2.7%) and has considerable student/personal loan exposure, as well as international risk in Vietnam and Turkey. Thus, I believe Discover should trade at a discount to Capital One – and a material one at that – if it wasn’t for the 19% RoE and seven straight years of dividend increases. Like Capital One, the company’s loan book is riskier and investors should rotate to higher-quality peers as the cycle edges on.Capital One, despite showing improvements this quarter, contains too risky of a loan book for me to want to have exposure to in an increasing rate environment, especially now that deposit costs are starting to weigh on the bottom line. Until Capital One can show that they can offset the rising deposit costs and take full advantage of the rising rate environment, the stock looks challenging to me. The bulls can point to an inexpensive valuation at sub-9x forward earnings, and I believe that helps to limit potential downside, but considering the stock has been stuck at this mark for nearly six months, I’m not inclined to call upside on the name without a clear risk shift or a new growth avenue. I’d prefer Visa and Mastercard at this time, even despite valuation, as clearly the market is more focused on growth and reduced borrowing risk with these names."
4189340,102683,2018-07-24T01:17:07-04:00,COF is seeing its share price breakout higher.Its operations are improving due to a stronger economic backdrop.I am buying stock in this name.,"Capital One Financial (COF) is breaking out higher on strengthening fundamentals. Rising interest rates and a strong consumer credit environment are leading to both top- and bottom-line growth. Its share price is similarly breaking out higher following months of consolidation. I am buying stock in this name as its operational improvements should lead to investor optimism.COF is attractively valued at current levels due to improving consumer credit quality and rising interest rates leading to both top- and bottom-line growth.COF reported Q2 adjusted EPS of $3.22 compared to $2.62 EPS in Q1 and $1.94 in the year-ago period. The quarter included a $400M net gain on the sale of a substantial majority of its consumer home loan portfolio. Strong performance was largely driven by credit improvement across its businesses, with the growth math now helping overall domestic credit card trends, according to management. Improving delinquencies and lower charge offs resulted in a $72 million allowance release in its Domestic Card business and a $77 million release in its Auto business, according to the earnings call. COF increased its commercial reserves by $41 million over the quarter as they increased its allowance coverage ratio.Its credit card business posted strong year-over-year growth in pretax income driven by revenue growth and significant improvements in provision for credit loss. The segment's results and trends are largely driven by the performance of its Domestic Card business, according to management. Over the most recent quarter, its Domestic Card loan balances were up $7.8 billion or roughly 8% compared to the second quarter of last year. Average loans also grew nearly 8%, while second quarter purchase volume increased 17% from the prior year quarter. The Auto business continues to be a strong segment, growing loans 8% year-over-year. Competitive intensity in auto is increasing, but management still sees attractive opportunities to grow.With regards to consumer banking, average deposits should continue to expand due to rising interest rates, driven by higher market rates and increasing competition for deposits as well as changing product mix as its national banking strategy continues to gain traction. Consumer banking revenue for the quarter increased roughly 1% from the second quarter of last year.Moving deeper into credit quality, provisions for credit losses were down from the second quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of strong credit performance in its Auto business. The Auto charge off rate improved compared to the prior year quarter, according to its earnings call.Management continues to see opportunities to book attractive and resilient loans in its card, auto and commercial banking businesses, while also growing deposits in its consumer banking business. Below is a chart of the company’s revenue and earnings per share over the last three decades. As is seen, revenue has been in a steady expansion as consumer spending and credit have risen. Moreover, EPS has been more volatile, but looks to be picking up as credit quality improves. Over the last few years, EPS has nearly doubled due to a more optimistic credit environment.Looking at a number of peer comparisons in the space, COF looks attractively valued. I am using the Forwards PEG ratio, which is essentially the Price/Earnings Ratio divided by Forward Growth projections. The lower the number the more attractively valued in this case. COF is the most attractively valued relative to its peers by this metric, coming in at a 0.04, signaling that alongside its growth catalysts, it also presents an attractive valuation. Below is a chart of COF’s price action over the last year. After consolidating for much of 2018, its share price looks to be breaking out higher following improved earnings results. Moreover, there are favorable macroeconomic factors, such as rising interest rates taking shape. I am buying this stock on the breakout above $97, with a stop-loss in place at $90 should my investment thesis be proven incorrect.COF is susceptible to the risks of its broader economic backdrop due to its reliance on interest rates and the credit risk of borrowers. As was seen during the financial crisis in 2008-2009, falling interest rates and rising defaults weigh heavily on the company’s lending operations. While this is the main risk faced, we are currently in a period of strong consumer credit quality, as well as rising interest rates. COF is seeing its operations strengthen, leading to increasing investor optimism. Its share price should continue higher, led by improving fundamentals, leading me to buy the shares."

The Street is expecting to see revenues of $7.1 billion land 8% above year-ago levels, with EPS of $1.88 showing material improvement over 4Q16's $1.45.Credit: Callison RTKLJudging by the holiday quarter performance of banks like JPMorgan (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), consumer lending seems to be doing as well as the recent trends in loan growth and rising interest rates have been suggesting. The former, for example, delivered 11% of YOY growth in interest income last week, with the majority of the upside coming from the consumer and community banking side of the business. The latter did not produce results that were as impressive, but the bank's general purpose credit cards saw sequential and YOY increases in both purchase volume and average outstandings that hovered around the mid-single digits.Given the peer results, I am comfortable projecting a solid quarter for Capital One that could reasonably beat top-line expectations for the third straight time. Further down the P&L, however, I will be curious to see what might happen to credit loss provisions, which reached 19% with net charge offs up 90 bps on the credit card side last quarter. As I have argued plenty of times in the past, I continue to worry a bit about record levels in consumer loan delinquency in the U.S. and the impact that bad debt may have on banks' bottom lines if the macro landscape deteriorates.I have recently expressed my reluctance to buy COF due to (1) the less diversified nature of the business compared to large banks like JPMorgan or Bank of America (BAC) and, (2) related to the first reason, the company's exposure to a potential deterioration in credit quality at a sector-wide level. But in the same breath, I have also argued that the company has been executing well recently, having topped revenue and earnings expectations in the most recent period by the widest margin of the past 16 quarters.COF PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsSource: data provided by YChartsFrom a valuation perspective, COF trades at enticing P/E, PEG and price/tangible book multiples, as the chart and table above illustrate. The stock has been on the upswing, but not as much as peers DFS (up 40% since early September) or AXP (up 32% over past 12 months), possibly suggesting that there might be some gains to be made on the stock.Taking all factors into account, I continue to favor more conservative and diversified plays in the banking sector. But on the back of solid performance and favorable economic environment, I understand how COF could still be considered a top pick in the financial services sector for many investors."

Despite my hopes for ""a solid quarter that could reasonably beat top-line expectations for the third straight time"" on the back of strength in consumer activity, the Virginia-based bank delivered a much messier quarter than I had been anticipating.Credit: ProPublicaRevenues of $7.04 billion missed consensus estimates but only by a minimal amount. Pressuring the top line, in my view, was a sequential dip in NIM (net interest margin) that looked weak compared to last quarter's 20-bp improvement. Across all segments (cards, consumer and commercial), the YOY increase in interest income lagged last quarter's growth rate. It looks like soft yields and higher rates on liabilities out-powered the expected tailwinds from growth in domestic cards and larger loan balances.Perhaps equally disappointing was another bump in credit loss provisions, as the tables below illustrate. Following the trend set last quarter, this metric was up significantly YOY, this time by nearly 10% vs. 15% in 3Q17. Net charge-offs also spiked, this time by 23% vs. last quarter's already eye-catching 38% increase. On the domestic card side, net charge off rate of 5.08% was up 42 bps YOY over a 4Q16 that had already seen a sizable bump of 91 bps.Source: DM Martins Research, using Capital One's earnings slideI have repeatedly stated my concerns over ""credit quality deterioration particularly in the U.S., as record-high levels of household debt have been accompanied by an industry-wide increase in thirty-day delinquencies over the past couple of quarters"". Capital One's earnings results only helped to reinforce my caution. In addition, talks about the economy-wide benefits of the recently-passed tax reform could mask a real risk that, in my view, might be understated or overlooked.On a net basis, EPS of $1.84 adjusted for a 22-cent loss from disc ops missed consensus by four cents.I stand by my views that COF is a tricky play due to (1) the less diversified nature of the business, compared to large banks like JPMorgan (JPM) or Bank of America (BAC), and (2) the company's exposure to a potential deterioration in credit quality at a sector-wide level.

4121086,102809,2017-11-06T10:10:48-05:00,"Higher interest rates pushed revenue higher.Delinquency rates are on the rise for the past several months.With higher interest rates expected out of the Fed, higher delinquency rates may lead to disappointment ahead for Capital One.","Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE: COF) surprised to the upside in this quarter's earnings. Expectations were for $1.96 but the company delivered $2.14 per share. While the market surprise has pushed the stock higher, it is my belief that higher interest rates and higher delinquency rates are going to weigh on the company in the future; this elevated price may be a good time to exit.Delinquency rates for credit cards are on the rise. Capital One reported a nearly 1% increase during the month of August alone. This becomes problematic for the company: Capital One said its earnings were higher than expected due to higher interest rates. But, higher interest rates mean higher payments and higher default rates. If delinquency rates continue to rise, and at the very least achieve average, then Capital One's situation would deteriorate significantly.When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates credit card companies raise their interest rates nearly in sync. This is the ""profit center"" for credit card companies. These companies earn a spread between the money they lend to borrowers, i.e., credit card holders, and the funds borrowed that are used to lend out to the credit card holders. As interest rates rise on the cost of borrowing, in line with Federal Reserve interest rate increases, the credit card companies will raise their own rates to borrowers.The increased interest rate levels will mean that delinquency and default rates are going to move higher. The Federal Reserve is on the move with interest rate increases. For now, there is going to be a change in the governor of the Federal Reserve; President Trump announced his nomination of Jermone Powell. Powell is considered to be on the ""dovish"" side, preferring softer interest rates. However, I think the Federal Reserve is going to need to be raising interest rates faster than they may believe is currently necessary.However, I think the Federal Reserve is going to need to be raising interest rates faster than they may believe is currently necessary. I wrote an article showing the Big Mac Index versus reported inflation. In this article, I showed how the reported inflation numbers are lower than what is really present in the economy. Here is the chart for a visual perspective:The blue line shows the actual price of a Big Mac over the course of the past 22 years. If the reported inflation numbers were accurate the green line would be as flat as a board. That tail end trickling upwards shows how the under-reporting is affecting out ""real"" purchases. Read: Inflation is higher than the government is reporting.I do not think Capital One can have the best of both worlds. If interest rates are heading higher, and that was the source of the increased income for this quarter then along with the increased interest rates the company will have to deal with higher defaults and delinquencies.If you look at the chart above the delinquency rate is far below average for the past 20 years. The current rate in the chart is about 2.50%. Capital One reported their delinquency rate rose from 3.81% to 3.91% in July alone.The first, obvious question to me, is: Does Capital One have a higher than average delinquency rate? The chart above is all credit card banks. Some of the very best banks, with the pickiest standards, are in this chart. Yet, the rate is still rising. And, Capital One does lend to individuals that have less than sterling credit rating. I get leery of issues like this.Here is another look at the delinquency rate versus the effect Fed Funds Rate to give you a perspective of how interest rates affect the delinquency rate:There tends to be a lag in when defaults head higher, then the eventual recession that happens after the fact. As I said, I believe that interest rates are going to be forced to head higher.Zack's current consensus for Capital One on their earnings is leaning towards lower earnings in the future. This makes sense since other companies are reporting missed earnings due to higher charge-offs. This is in line with the last quarter's miss that Capital One surprised the market to the downside, something that I covered just last quarter. The company kept their outlook for this quarter despite their miss the previous quarter, which proved to be accurate.But, what is glaring to me is the rise in interest rates over the past several months bringing the 10-year government bond yield upward to 2.50%. The 10-year yield has been moving up lately as this chart shows:In Great Britain, Mark Carney, the Bank of England's governor, is contemplating their first rate increase in over 10 years. Their inflation rate is at 3.0%. While the United States has an official inflation rate of 1.7%, I am not one who really believes that is an accurate assessment of where the economy really is. I believe that the U.S Federal Reserve will be raising interest rates a lot faster than they want to be public about, as I mentioned in this article.Given that, I can see the 10-year eclipsing the 2016 highs within the next several months. However, any moves in higher interest rates are already being felt by the credit card companies, especially as Capital One already did in the last quarter. There is a delay. This will mean that the rest of the industry will begin a long slow sell-off as these numbers start showing up in the respective reports.Take a good look at this monthly chart on COF:The chart is near its 17-year high. You have to ask yourself how much more upside is there with this company. Remember two things: The company is already experiencing upticks in delinquencies and defaults while simultaneously interest rates are moving higher. Given those two important variables, the only conclusion I can come up with on this stock is that if you are long, it is time to head for the exits.There is simply no room for upside growth in the company, with an already higher EPS rate of just over 12, that would push the stock upwards. The rest of the industry saw selling the past several months when Synchrony (NYSE: SYF), spun off from GE Capital Financial (NYSE: GE), reported higher default rates. If more and more companies start reporting higher delinquency rates then, guilt by association will bring this stock downwards.Considering this chart above, the economic landscape ahead of the United States, I am looking for a large move to the downside on COF stock. I always use options when I trade and this is going to be no exception. I am buying out-of-the-money calls. Then, I am shorting the stock outright.The calls I am picking up have a strike of $95.00. They are trading at $3.76 and I can see that cost being picked up quickly over the next 2 months. My short position will be a market order when I get filled - tomorrow - on the option. My target is below $50.00."
4235281,102930,2019-01-24T10:43:33-05:00,"Interest expense is rising faster than interest income.For now, in nominal dollars, NII is expanding, but that is unlikely to be the case in 2019.In 2019, for many financial institutions, net interest expense will outpace net interest income in nominal dollars, compressing net interest margins.","Recently, Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) reported their Q4 earnings figures and the results widely missed consensus expectations, sending shares of COF down by more than 5% as of the market open the following day.COF reported adjusted EPS of $1.87 which was well short of the $2.39 consensus was expecting.Net interest income, which will be the focus of this brief note, was unchanged year over year, an increasing problem that many financial institutions are facing.I want to use COF as an example of the problems plaguing most financial institutions and also dig deeper to understand what the results out of COF can tell us about the economic cycle.At the start, I want to clarify that there is nothing systemically wrong with COF or the banking system in general and the trends I will discuss below are simply part of the business cycle rather than anything specifically wrong with any particular lender.The problem at the end of the economic cycle is the compression of net interest income. The results out of COF highlighted that perfectly and is partly responsible for the decline in the shares after the report.In the past, I wrote several notes on other banks and highlighted this problem of rising interest expense relative to interest income.Many investors just assume that rising interest rates are good for the financials but that is not always the case. If interest expense rises faster than interest income, net interest income can fall or slow materially and that is exactly what we are seeing out of many of the banks.As we will see below, the interest expense at COF is rising significantly faster than interest income, leading to zero growth in net interest income. While it is true that in nominal dollars, interest income is still outpacing interest expense, that is not likely to be the case in 2019.I wrote a note on Bank of America (BAC) in late December and in October of 2018 describing that in 2019 (reported after Q1), that banks will likely see interest expense rise faster than interest income.I also covered this trend in a note on Wells Fargo (WFC) which you can find here.Looking at the income statement from COF shows this trend unfolding as we move into 2019 right on time. I thought interest expense would outpace interest income in 2019 and the Q4 results for 2018 show this likely to be the case.Total interest income for COF was up 7% year over year compared to an increase of 55% year over year for total interest expense.I also want to shift the attention to the box in red showing that deposit costs are rising 65% year over year. Rising rates can hurt financial institutions.Source: Company FilingsIn nominal dollars, interest income was up $444 million compared to an increase of $437 million for interest expense, a $7 million difference that is likely to vanish in 2019 due to the increased cost of funding in Q1 relative to Q4 as well as lower long-term interest rates and a flatter yield curve.As a result of this spike in interest expense (that will continue), net interest income was flat year over year and the net interest margin fell both quarter over quarter and year over year.Source: Company FilingsAgain, I want to stress that this is not something that should be construed as overly bearish or a systemic problem. There were parts of Capital One's earnings report that shows the consumer is still hanging on and that the risk defaults remains low as the credit quality slide below shows.Source: Company FilingsI highlight this point to show that at the end of the economic cycle, with rising short-term rates and falling long-term rates, banks are not the best investment as the basis of most lenders is to borrow short and lend long.If the cost of borrowing is rising rapidly, over 50% year over year in most cases and the benefit of rising rates is not felt on the long end of the curve, bank margins shrink.BAC, WFC and the other very large money center banks with more diversified businesses are better suited to handle a compression in net interest income but as you move to companies focused more exclusively on lending, these late cycle trends do not bode well for them.COF is one example of a lender that may experience a difficult time in the quarters ahead simply due to the interest rate dynamics associated with the business.For the financial companies that you may own, look at the difference in rising costs versus rising income from interest rates. In 2019, we are likely to see some lending institutions have interest expense rising in excess of interest income, not just in growth rate terms but also in nominal dollars.This is something that happens at the end of the cycle, causes a reduction in the growth of the shadow banking system and can ultimately slow economic growth.Capital One stock price sits 25% off the cycle high made in January of 2018 despite the large rally in the S&P 500 (SPY)."

Not unlike last quarter, NIM (net interest margin) seems to have been in part to blame, having dropped sequentially once again after rising in 3Q17, while average loan balances increased YOY in the low single digits.The margin contraction does not surprise me, however, as the interest rate spread continues to shrink (see T10Y2Y graph below). For as long as short-term rates continue to increase at a faster pace, margin is likely to remain under pressure, and the trend could very well continue for the next couple of quarters. But any top line concern related to moderating margins, in my view, should be more than fully offset by positive macro factors like continued job growth and wage increases - at least in the immediate term.(Source: St. Louis Fed)On the cost side, trends appear to be favorable both on the credit and non-interest sides. Possibly catching me by surprise the most this quarter was a drop in credit loss provision - not the dip itself but the magnitude, with domestic cards reaching -16% YOY. The phenomenon might make sense in the context of a loan portfolio that is starting to stabilize compared to 2016 levels, the tightening up of underwriting standards, and slower subprime growth.And on non-interest expenses, a reduction in headcount (-3% sequentially) and continued investments in technology suggest to me that the efficiency ratio improvement (of over 200 bps sequentially) is likely to produce lasting benefits to net earnings. In my view, this should bode well for future financial results and stock sentiment.Below is a quick summary of Capital One's results by segment.(Source: D.M. Martins Research, using data from company reports)To be quite honest, I have never been a COF cheerleader. I argued last quarter that the less-diversified nature of the business and the company's exposure to a potential deterioration in credit quality at a sector-wide level made this stock a tricky proposition. But this Tuesday's results have shown that my concerns may have been a bit overstated, as Capital One seems to be executing well amid what appears to be a healthy banking landscape.COF PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsI am still not buying COF, as I would rather increase my portfolio's exposure to the financial services sector, if at all, through names like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) or JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). But the combination of solid fundamentals and attractive valuations (see above) certainly puts COF on my radar for further consideration.In post-market trading, COF is down 1.5% following the print. If shares kick off Wednesday's session any deeper in the red, I believe the dip could present itself as a potential bargain-hunting opportunity."
4134334,102896,2017-12-28T17:58:51-05:00,"Back in August, when COF was trading for just over $80/share, I highlighted it as a ""Golden Opportunity.""Though rising rates will likely lead to higher write-offs, the accompanying margin expansion and improving loan portfolio quality will effectively offset these costs.Four months (and a 25% gain) later, there's still considerable room to run as P/B remains low, leaving a huge margin of safety.","Even after a 25% run up since I last addressed the stock, Capital One Financial Corp (COF) shares still present a golden opportunity for value and DGI investors due to its solid EPS growth, improving loan portfolio quality, improving margins from rising interest rates, cheap valuation, and strong potential for dividend growth.In its latest quarterly report, COF beat EPS estimates by over 10% while enjoying year-over-year revenue growth of 8.2% as consumer appetite for credit rebounded and the company benefited from its improving quality of credit card holders (that had cut into earnings in previous quarters). These numbers provide evidence that the company's years of heavy investment in IT and data analysis systems as well as loss leading to attract quality long-term credit card members have begun to bear fruit.Meanwhile, rising rates will most certainly improve gross margins and should more than offset the rise in charge-offs, given that, overall, households have consistently deleveraged since the financial crisis and - especially when combined with a reduced tax burden - are therefore better equipped to handle higher interest rates:Improved consumer health will combine with COF's improved portfolio quality to produce higher net margins and therefore consistent earnings growth.Despite significantly scaling back their buyback proposal, the company still plans on repurchasing $1 billion of shares in the first half of next year, adding an additional tailwind to EPS growth. Given these factors, it is unsurprising that analysts also remain overwhelmingly bullish on the stock, with three upgrades in the last 10 days and a projected five-year annual growth rate of ~7.5%. This EPS growth momentum is a very bullish signal for COF's dividend growth. With a mere 22% payout ratio and a strong 61% five-year dividend growth rate, COF is virtually a lock to raise its dividend again next year and enjoys a huge growth runway for the years to come. The buyback alone will enable the dividend to grow without increasing overall cash payouts at all.Most importantly, COF remains a bargain, selling at par with its book value:SourceA growing company with significant tailwinds that's selling for book value is a rare find these days. Even after its impressive fall run, COF still offers investors a solid business backed by several headwinds with solid earnings and dividend growth prospects. Meanwhile the company remains priced for steep earnings declines that would require a recession and/or massive charge-off growth to produce. I believe neither scenario is likely. COF remains a buy."
4095940,102301,2017-08-07T13:35:46-04:00,"Capital One stood out from the pack in its latest earnings beat.The initial stock surge was strong, but can these moves continue?Fed policy could hold keys to next moves in COF.","The banking sector has shifted into the center of the market’s focus this earnings season and the recent moves in Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF) have caught many investors by surprise. The stock surged 8.6% in one day after its latest earnings release and when we are dealing with valuation changes of this magnitude it is only natural to be somewhat skeptical over the validity of the move. But when we look at the factors supporting the upside surprise and Capital One’s lack of exposure in recently problematic areas of the banking industry, we can see that there is still good upside potential even after the initial rallies. Long positions in COF can be taken while the stock is trading above 81.05, as any decline through here would alter the stance and signal a period of stalling in COF. When making investor assessments in Capital One, it is important to understand how the company differs from other major industry competitors like Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS). Recent news headlines for both of these banks have highlighted deficiencies in trading volumes and the effect this has had on generalized profitability in core businesses. Capital One does not rely on trading businesses as a central revenue generator, so this is not something that will need to be factored into the equation when making projections about likely earnings growth in coming quarters. Capital One Earnings Chart: NASDAQMuch more important are the commercial banking, consumer banking, and their popular credit card segments and strength in the areas was what drove the upside revenue surprises in Capital One’s most recent earnings report. For the second quarter, Capital One posted per-share adjusted earnings of $1.96, which was above analyst estimates and an improvement on the $1.76 in per-share earnings seen the previous year. Improved revenues, lower margin pressures and increased loan balances were all cited as positives and market investors responded favorably to the news. In the chart above, we can see that these trends are broadly positive -- and this does bode well for the stock in coming quarters.COF Analyst Forecasts: CNN MoneyPerhaps what is most important in these numbers is what they do not tell us. That is, they do not explain the ways this latest earnings report has allayed earlier investor fears with respect to the bank’s portfolio of taxi medallion loans (totaling $582 million). Analysts have suggested the possibility that these loans would lead to large writedowns. Taxi medallions have lost roughly 80% of their value in areas like New York City now that rideshare applications like Lyft and Uber have risen in popularity -- so the concerns were not unwarranted. But, in total, these loans make up only 0.24% of Capital One portfolio and this is down from 0.36% in the prior year. In addition to this, the nonperforming loan rate for the taxi medallion portion of the portfolio is at its lowest level in three quarters. All of this means that is previous concerns over COF have already started to correct themselves and that any negative influences in future earnings will be limitedCapital One Stock Analysis: Dividend Investments.comAfter the initial rallies, COF pulled back toward the 50% retracement of the entire move higher. We managed to find support at 76.30, which is significant because this was an area of prior resistance. Readings in the Commodity Channel Index are bullish and we are still at mid-levels and so there is plenty of room to extend higher from here. The final part of the equation lies in the actions of the Federal Reserve, which will be looking at Capital One’s revised capital plans to be released on Dec. 28. In conference calls, management has sent optimistic signals in these areas and so the broader framework looks to be in place for COF to make another run higher. Potential headwinds could be seen at 96.90, which was the prior rally high. But at this stage, this does not look like enough of an obstacle to stall the stock"

They represented the strongest top- and bottom-line beats of the past 16 quarters at least.Revenues of nearly $7.0 billion topped consensus by the widest margin on record. The +8.2% YOY growth was propelled by a robust increase in NIM (net interest margin) by 20 bps sequentially to 7.08%, although the improvement was partially driven by the extra day in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $2.42 beat consensus by a record margin of 27 cents as non-interest expense grew at a slower pace than revenues, although a lower effective tax rate also played a role in pushing earnings higher.Credit: time.comAll key segments of the company performed well in the YOY comparison, with the largest credit card and consumer banking businesses benefiting from an increased interest rate environment that sent net interest income up. Better pricing came along with another double-digit YOY increase in loan balances on the credit card side. Commercial banking saw a spike in non-interest income, although off a small base, likely pointing to strength in the bank's capital markets and agency businesses. See summary table below comparing key metrics this quarter against last year's comps.Source: DM Martins Research, using Capital One's documentsAn item of interest to me when it comes to the banking sector, credit loss provisions were up more than +15% this time. The results are not surprising, given what I have seen of peers' results over the past couple of quarters, but also not encouraging. On the more relevant credit card side (the most exposed to credit risk in dollar terms), and particularly looking at domestic cards, the rise in credit loss provisions reached 19% with net charge offs up 90 bps.As I have argued in the past, ""I have been cautious of credit quality deterioration particularly in the U.S., as record-high levels of household debt have been accompanied by an industry-wide increase in thirty-day delinquencies over the past couple of quarters"". Capital One's acquisition of the Cabela portfolio, on paper less risky than the bank's overall assets, may seem like a welcome, defensive move. But in the case of a hypothetical deterioration in fundamentals across the industry, I fear that Capital One could still face challenges due to a potential stalling in asset growth and a pickup in non-performing loans.Capital One delivered a strong quarter that I believe will please most investors. The bank seems positioned to perform well in the immediate term, give the benign macro indicators. In addition, the company's stock continues to look inexpensive, trading at a forward P/E of 11.7x and price-to-tangible book multiple of 1.3x, despite the recent run in share price that saw earnings multiple expand by more than a full turn in the past two months alone.COF PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsOn my end, however, I continue to be cautious about the long-term impact that rising debt and increasing interest rates might have on the economy. Capital One would be particularly vulnerable, in my view, since its revenues are less diversified than those of global banking peers like Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C). For that reason, I currently favor more conservative and diversified plays in the banking sector, but recognize that Capital One's strong execution might still appeal to many.Note from the author: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow D.M.

Though charge-offs will likely continue to rise due to normalization in the industry, the company's stabilizing credit performance reassured investor confidence in COF's underwriting standards. These improvements are potentially an early sign that the company's years of heavy investment in IT and data analysis systems to enable better measuring and forecasting of credit quality are finally starting to bear fruit.The steadying charge-off rates also boosted profits: EPS experienced strong growth in Q2 (26% sequentially and 15% year-over-year). Analysts project sustained strong growth for the company (7% annually) over the next five years as well, even as charge-off rates are expected to continue rising. This would come as a welcome relief to a company whose profits have stagnated since the recovery from the Great Recession and could indicate that the company is about to turn a corner and enter into a sustained growth phase:Another factor contributing to COF's improved performance is its opportunistic acquisitions (e.g., HSBC's co-branded card business and ING Direct), which have enabled it to diversify and grow its business, leading to inorganic growth and numerous synergies. These synergies have contributed to several competitive advantages that also drive earnings growth. Beyond its superior IT and data analysis systems, COF also enjoys economies of scale cost advantages (many of its costs of doing business are fixed) and network effects that come from its national scale. Furthermore, its strategic acquisitions combine with its national presence to create a diversified pool of cardholders which give it considerable data advantages and opportunities for innovative and differentiating offerings. Finally, its rewards program and convenience-related switching costs result in considerable stickiness among its card holder base. These factors should all combine to drive continued steady earnings growth.Another sign of improving performance and management confidence has been the company's dividend performance. After experiencing declines and stagnating payouts in the wake of the financial crisis, beginning in 2013 COF has consistently grown its dividend while also reducing its float by an impressive margin. Today, it yields ~2% with a mere 20.76% payout ratio. Backed by recent momentum, ongoing float reduction, and COF's improving earnings growth outlook, the dividend appears to have a long growth runway.Finally, COF presents a golden opportunity to Value and DGI investors because its strong earnings and dividend growth outlook is available at cheap prices:SourceWhile the company has clearly always lacked respect (as evidenced by its low historic valuations relative to its industry and the overall market), its recent performance and future prospects are now greatly improved. Meanwhile it continues to trade at valuations very close to historical averages, posing an opportunity for investors to capitalize on this price-performance gap:COF offers investors an improving business backed by several competitive advantages with solid earnings and dividend growth prospects at a bargain price. Though the company is finally experiencing some growth momentum, it is priced like the economy is headed for recession and charge-offs will rise at a rapid rate, leading to large earnings declines. If the company can simply maintain its current earnings per share (backed by steadying credit performance, acquisitions, and aggressive share buybacks) into perpetuity, it will return 23% annually with a very healthy 20% margin of safety:Source"

In the article series, the reader was briefed on U.S. economic history, recent political and macroeconomic developments, and concluded with a prediction of the future performance of individual market sectors. As goes with most market predictions, the warnings presented in the article series were mostly ignored by the market, which continued trend higher. Yet somehow, the points laid out in these articles are quite still relevant. This article will recap those important points and, once again, attempt to project how the market is going to perform.As the third quarter approaches, and the calendar year comes to a close, the market outlook is still highly uncertain. The American public has yet to see realistic public policy reach the floor for debate in Washington. Promises of legislative action to improve healthcare, infrastructure, and tax code have gone unfulfilled. The legislative attempts that were made took place after being rushed through impossible deadlines. So far, the legislative process has consisted of putting documents together in a matter of weeks with little research or consideration given. When thinking about the current political environment, it becomes evident that U.S. financial markets have performed well largely because of decade-long efforts to spur economic activity in the post financial crisis era. President Trump has been extremely fortunate to walk into the oval office just as corporate earnings grew moderately, employment continued to expand robustly, and the nation’s gross domestic product maintained its positive trajectory.(Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis & St. Louis Fed, chained 2009 USD)But, obviously, this economic activity is not attributable to the Trump Administration, rather directly attributable to the collective efforts of market participants; hard-working individuals and businesses. It goes without saying, if the bull market is to continue, it will continue to be driven by these economic forces. If the market stalls or pulls back, it will be due to the ongoing geopolitical climate or a threat of war.Looking at where the U.S. economy stands today, the market outlook appears promising. In more recent measures of business and consumer confidence, optimism is still at the highest level seen in years. Both inflation and interest rates remain near the decade lows. The level of confidence has continued to spill over into financial markets. Per The Wall Street Journal, retail investors are “more optimistic than at any time since the dot-com bubble.” SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) and SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY) are two ETFs closely tracking the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes, respectively. The PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ) is one of the more popular ETF names for tracking the Nasdaq 100. The performance of these three ETFs is indicative of optimism translating to investor euphoria, as reflected in the next two graphs.Shorting the VIX has turned out to be one of the most profitable trades of the year. In order to gauge where this market is heading, let us recap individual sector performance while focusing more on the lagging sectors. In the first half of this year, lower oil prices continued to hit corporate earnings, causing energy shares to stumble for most of the year. Recently, efforts from Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to curb production, along with an unexpected number of tropical storms, managed to elevate energy prices higher. As you will see in the next chart, energy sector returns have started to make a sharp turn upward.Conversely, price deflation in the telecommunications sector held company share prices down, as competition intensified among carriers. Mobile phone and data plan prices have declined aggressively this year. Additionally, growth has also plateaued in automobile manufacturing volumes and dealership sales. Despite declining new automobile sales and used automobile prices, shares of auto and subprime lenders have shown resilience, advancing right along with the financial sector. See the sector breakdown in the next image.Evident from the illustration above, Energy and Telecom are now racing to catch up with the rest of the market. From a price-to-earnings valuation, the Energy sector appears overvalued. However, if oil prices continue to rise, earnings growth should offset this measure. The upward trend in Telecom on the other hand is questionable. The decline in mobile phone and data plans will continue to put downward pressure on top-line growth among carriers. Recently, disappointing news about the new iPhone’s sales forecast caused shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to pull back some. This may have some effect on carriers looking forward to a holiday sales boost from the new device. From a value investor perspective, AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) offer attractive dividends, and it is unlikely that consumers will ever put their mobile phones away or forgo upgrading to new devices.Moving now to the economic indicators, let’s start with household debt, which has continued to grow to record levels. In August, the New York Fed published the “Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit,” for the second quarter. The report noted that:There are a few interesting takeaways from this report, mostly regarding the non-housing debt balance, which still appears to be reaching a peak. During the second quarter of the year, household credit card balances grew by more than enough to offset the first quarter declines. Further, the expansion in subprime auto loan origination was the highest observed in the last four quarters.When you look at data from auto lenders, the measure for tightening standards implies that some lenders may be starting to loosen up lending standards again. It is not certain if this loosening in lending standards is due to tepid demand for new autos, increased lender competition, or because perhaps lenders perceive that loan default risks have receded. This last comment is appealing because in the most recent loan data from both the New York Fed and lenders themselves, loan and credit card delinquencies continue to rise. Even with all this publicly available insight, the market capitalization's of financial services companies have continued to rise. Lenders Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) and Santander Consumer USA (SC) have reached 52-week highs, though some lenders like Capital One Financial (COF), Discover Financial Services (DFS), and Synchrony Financial (SYF), were mostly flat year to date. Nevertheless, market pricing of this industry continues to appear inefficient.S&P 500 Year-To-Date Returns Vs. ALLY, SYF, COF, and DFS(Source: The Wall Street Journal)Will U.S. equities continue to rise and the VIX continue to trend lower, or are stocks overvalued? It is the writer’s belief that the economy is still about two or three years away from the next recession. A major crash in stock prices is likely also years away, but a correction may be overdue. The economic indicators in this concluding section support the view that a recession is still years away.The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee (FOMC) plans to continue its course towards interest rate normalization despite the sluggish rate of inflation. The image above illustrates the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank’s Trimmed Mean PCE Inflation. This measure is presented instead of Consumer Price Index (CPI) or Core-CPI, because it filters out singularities such as a cyclical decline in energy, mobile phone plan, or pharmaceutical prices. Ideally, this would be a strong indicator if inflation were becoming a threat to the economy. As you can see from the chart, there is no imminent threat observed. The Federal Reserve Board has projected for several years now that inflation would increase dramatically. The Fed’s projections have served as a base argument for raising interest rates in the past. While inflation measures may not be indicating any immediate threats, the current unemployment rate (4.4%) has stabilized below the long-term natural rate (5.8%) for over a full year now. This is one measure that may likely start to reverse in the near term. Take a look at the historical unemployment rate data in the image below.While the current measure of inflation may not justify the Fed’s interest rate decisions, financial market performance and unemployment do. Additionally, if you observe inflation and unemployment data in close detail, there are usually two or three years of flat activity before a trend reversal becomes apparent. Studying the U.S. treasury yield curves can also help grasp a little more of what market participants see on the horizon. Near-term treasury yields have followed Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions closely. On the other hand, treasuries with long-term maturities show strange behavior as geopolitical and economic risks are priced in. This observation further supports the idea that while the market may continue to outperform in the near term, the economy has only a couple more years of growth ahead.The main conclusion to draw from this article is that investors should be cautious moving forward. The list of uncertainties felt at this time last year are still the same today. There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about legislative promises of tax cuts or government spending. In addition, the impact that these policies will have on the economy is also uncertain. There may be inflation or there may be a prolonged period of growth. Also, keep in mind that the Federal debt ceiling has only been temporarily increased through December. Expect for this debate to resurface in the not so distant future. Regulation of industries such as healthcare and pharmaceuticals has been clouded by infighting between political parties. Finally, there is this looming threat of war with North Korea.U.S. financial markets are approaching a pivot point in history where confidence can erode quickly. The best thing to do here is to only add investments which have a considerable margin of safety. In the event that the market does pull back, the worst thing to do is panic sell. History shows that portfolios are capable of recovering from a correction rather quickly. Lastly, in a market environment where institutional investors start to underweight cash, doing the opposite is probably a safer bet. When closing a position whether for gain or loss, the cash collected may be far more useful when markets fluctuate, rather than immediately adding a new name to the portfolio at current valuations."

I continue to maintain a bearish outlook for the consumer lending industry, specifically, the subprime lending industry. In this article, I will make a close analysis of Capital One Financial, Inc. (NYSE:COF), another company whose business operations fit the criteria I have been investigating. I intend to warn investors of Capital One's rosy business operating results and present a thesis arguing that COF appears to be significantly overvalued. The financial and numerical data I present throughout this article is available in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. I will heavily reference notes found in the company's filings, all other relevant articles have been cited for the reader. In recent trading sessions, COF shares have started to decline dramatically in response to some of the material I cover in this article.Business OverviewCapital One Financial Corporation is a bank holding company that provides various financial products and services in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The company operates in three business spaces: credit cards, consumer banking, and commercial banking. The company offers non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing deposit accounts. The company also provides credit card, auto, home, and retail banking loans; and commercial and multifamily real estate, commercial and industrial, and small-ticket commercial real estate loans. In addition, the company offers credit and debit card products and online banking services, treasury management, and depository services. Capital One has branch locations primarily in New York, New Jersey, Texas, Louisiana, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Capital One Financial Corporation was founded in 1988 by current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard D. Fairbank.ThesisOver the past year, Capital One's stock performed quite well, reaching a record $93 per share in February 2017 from $63 per share in July 2016. The increase came after disappointing performance over the last two years. What strikes me most is how (as many publicly-traded companies have) Capital One's stock price benefited mostly from the post-election ""Trump Rally"" rather than actual fundamental reason. An article published by Bloomberg highlights the optimism-induced speculation that has strategists at Goldman Sachs voicing their concern. In a separate article published by Danielle DiMartino Booth on Bloomberg View, Ms. Booth presents some evidence of a similar kind optimism driving consumer borrowing, despite counter-intuitive macro data.My thesis for shorting shares of Capital One is similar to the one I presented in my article covering Ally Financial. I believe COF is standing with a risk model that has for some time now shown signs of stress. As I will later show, COF's allowance for loan losses and charge-off rates indicate the company is indeed in worse shape than before. Also later in the article, I talk about how the Federal Reserve recently raised their target on the Fed Funds Rate. Following the rate increase in March, the Fed's most recent ""dot plot"" continues to expect three rate increases this year. This compares to the Fed's previous pace of only hiking once per year in December. These rate increases are increasingly important to the performance of loan portfolios of lenders like Capital One. Further, the current administration in Washington continues to face conflict conducting public policy. This uncertainty may start to erode what is otherwise a positive climate of consumer and business confidence.A drawback of consumer lending businesses is the dependence on conditions in the business cycle. Like most financial companies, Capital One's valuation historically follows the credit cycle. As credit markets dried up ahead of the financial crisis, Capital One's valuation closely followed downhill. Preceding the U.S. Presidential Election shares of Capital One declined considerably from a peak of $91 in July of 2015. After what appeared like a sudden rally without material evidence to justify, shares of Capital One returned to 2015 peak levels.Recent HeadlinesAnother article published on March 10th by Bloomberg news highlighted more recent worries from the subprime auto lending industry which continues to provide key insight into the current credit cycle. I have been interested in this credit cycle since the spring of 2015, but only until recently, has my thesis started to gain some traction.In December, I referenced research from the New York Federal Reserve in my article covering Ally Financial. This month, the New York Fed published their ""Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit"" conditions for the fourth quarter of 2016. The report reveals that:This information leads to the main point in my thesis that the current credit cycle has reached a peak and that credit tightening or a downturn in credit conditions is likely imminent.Naturally, in 2008, residential mortgages were the largest component of household debt. Under the current composition, household debt has seen growth in student loans, consumer credit cards, and auto loans which have been financed during the current credit cycle. Due to increased financial oversight and regulation, a system-wide financial crisis such as the one that occurred in 2008 is unlikely. However, I do expect for credit markets to tighten soon and for lenders such as Ally Financial and Capital One to continue to face headwinds well into next year.As I mentioned earlier, the Federal Reserve recently raised their target on federal funds rate and indicated more frequent rate increases throughout the year. As I argued in a prior article, this is likely to have an adverse effect on loan portfolios concentrated in mid-tier and lower-tier subprime consumer credit, and loans with adjustable or variable interest. Additionally, the most recent Fed ""Beige Book"" contained mixed reports across the Fed districts regarding auto and commercial lending. Some districts reported seeing declines in auto lending and mostly flat commercial and home mortgage lending. Additional supporting evidence can be found in the company's filings.Notes from Capital One's 10-K filings:In order to prove that COF's financial performance contradicts the company's current market valuation, I need to highlight the company's financial results over the last five years. I also want to highlight the trend underlying the company's allowance for loan losses, outstanding loan delinquencies, and net charge-offs.Typically, in this industry, managers reference change in business strategy to maximize profitability. The strategy involves updated risk models and an increase in lending to riskier consumers, reaching for higher yield. The question is, does this business model work? To answer this question, I must look at the income statement line by line.Capital One's provision for loan losses has continued to trend upward to such extent that the amount of revenue allocated to the provision has started to hurt bottom-line earnings.Looking at the income snapshot from above, a continuous growth in revenue year on year as well as growth in total net revenue after interest-related expenses is apparent. However, the impact revenue growth has on earnings is offset by higher non-interest expenses and a higher portion allocated to the provision for credit losses. Again, I'd like to mention Capital One's bullish stock price movement as investors mostly ignored the year-on-year declines in operating and net income since FY 2014. The profit gap continued to widen further in FY 2016 while the amount set aside as a provision for credit losses rose by 42 percent. The allowance for loan losses ballooned by 28 percent over FY 2015. Still, Capital One's management continued to move ahead with a $2.5 billion share buyback program set to end in the second quarter of FY 2017.For additional signs of worsening financial performance, I want to point to the company's most recent return on assets and return on equity ratios.Using all metrics: average assets, tangible assets, average common equity, and tangible common equity, Capital One appears to be underperforming. The underlying trend of these financial ratios is part of the reason why I am skeptical of a Goldman Sachs recent rating upgrade from 'Neutral' to 'Buy.' The bank followed this upgrade with an increase to their price target from $106 to $110. Goldman Analyst Ryan M. Nash cites a ""market underestimation of EPS leverage, growth math, as well as flattening net charge offs (NCOs)."" I think the evidence I provide in this article contradicts this optimistic view.Despite worsening credit conditions, the market is already pricing COF shares at a premium to tangible book value and on par with book value. The lengthy section of risk factors in COF's 10-K filings confirms the business is inherently dependent on risk models and middle-to-below-average credit consumers for growth. This business model does not permit the allowance for credit and loan losses to shrink as lending expands. Adding to this, there is the notion that COF lacks the sophisticated deposit balances of larger well-capitalized banks such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). I believe investors should be adequately discounting Capital One's shares and should assume less optimistic ""growth math.""Additional Notes From Capital ""Financial Highlights"" section:My Take: From the table above, did you notice any trend? COF's management defends their increased risk profile as being ""in line"" with their business strategy focused on improving risk-adjusted returns. It is evident from the figures that risk-adjusted returns have not aligned with earnings for at least the past three fiscal years. Adding to this, last year, COF hammered out $6.5 billion to set aside for their provision for loan losses. The operating results appear to indicate the start of a downward trend in COF's business strategy. This performance emanates from a business which was founded on the advent of data analytics in the early '90s. The problem may not be poor data as much as it is excessive risk-taking on loans backed by poor credit and deteriorating subprime credit conditions. My idea is that the U.S. economy is in a late business cycle. Granted an extended period of monetary easing, low interest rates and looser lending standards, the business cycle is well-correlated to business and consumer credit. When credit conditions deteriorate as they did in 2008, credit markets start to dry up. More recently, oil markets have contracted once again and global economic growth appears to continue to face headwinds. Adding to this, we still have major uncertainty surrounding (or lack of) specific plans for conducting public policy in Washington. The main idea is that when the phase of optimism fueling businesses and consumers starts to wane, risky lenders like Ally Financial, Santander Consumer USA (NYSE:SC), and Capital One Financial are likely to be the first to take a hit on earnings.In brief, as the total household debt increased by 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2016, the share of subprime or lower-tier credit as well as delinquencies ticked down a bit. In contrast, looking at Capital One's lending mix, loan-delinquencies, and net charge-offs for the same period, it becomes apparent that the company may have bit into the rotten part of the apple.On this final note, I want to move my discussion on to the appropriate valuation for Capital One's equity.ValuationWhen assessing Capital One's equity valuation, I use the book value multiple approach. To do this, I had to look back at my short-list of comparable companies, which I have recently updated since I last looked at Ally Financial. The short list of comps is presented below.I started investigating further into Capital One in January of this year, just after the company reported FY 2016 earnings. In the table above where I highlight the comps, you can compare across various valuation metrics. These companies were selected due to their exposure to subprime credit lending. In addition, the comps represent exposure to auto, mortgage, consumer and commercial lending spaces. Averaging out each of these metrics helps to better estimate the company's intrinsic value. On a final note, Capital One is not exactly the most lucrative lender. Given the information I presented in this article, expect my estimated valuation to be lower than that of top-tier lenders.COF's current market valuation in my opinion contradicts the company's actual operating performance. When I referenced the stock chart at the beginning of this article, I noted that like most U.S. publicly traded companies, Capital One's shares benefited from the wave of consumer optimism after the election.Given that Capital One has demonstrated a deterioration in financial performance and added a material amount to their allowance for loan losses for several quarters now, the company's common shares should realistically be valued closer to the comps around .70x book value. This valuation prices the company closer to the pre-election trading range below $70 per share, and equates to a market capitalization of roughly $33.6 billion. If my estimated valuation is correct, a short position today would benefit from a share price decline of roughly $13, making the downside potential at least 18%. On price to earnings basis, Capital One still trades pretty high relative to comps. Applying the average P/E ratio indicated in the table above, COF shares should also be valued below $70 per share.ConclusionOn March 21st, shares of Capital One closed at $83.65 per share after what seemed like a late reaction to Capital One's dismal loan portfolio. The company's shares have been in free fall since March 1st.Capital One's fundamentals long ago diverged from growth potential and the company's valuation continued to drift higher. As investors weighed in the reality of Capital One's lending standards, the company's stock has finally started to retreat. Now considering the slow growth in commercial lending, risks associated with consumer lending with household debt near a peak, deteriorating subprime credit conditions and looming interest rate increases; there appears to be more room for alpha on the downside of Capital One's shares.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

4039452,102226,2017-01-25T15:09:05-05:00,"COF produced a solid quarter, but credit costs are rising.I have no deep worries over this, but forecasting is more difficult.Buybacks will remain strong and will help, but DFS has better visibility just now.","Capital one 4Q numbers showed, on the one hand strong operating income growth and, on the other, higher than expected loan loss provisions that nullified pre tax gains from the strong top line.Perhaps the best way to looking at this is via the prism of the company's net interest margin in interaction with its loan loss provisions.This is marked. In the gross net interest margin line you see that the company has gained around 30bps of NIM over the period depicted in the chart, yet when we consider the impact of Loan loss provisions (LLP), the adjusted NI has fallen through the period by 50bps, which is nearly 11% lower. Now look at volume growth:Loans have grown ~17% through the period shown in the chart, which means interest revenue is managing to grow, but the incremental gains are not matching volume growth.Here is gross revenue over the same period:The chart below shows the hit to the top line described in the preceding chart as those provisions (the dark red bar) rise, it counteracts the top line growth and holds back Pre-tax profit. The discount fee environment is also pressured, which is holding down non interest income growth, as we saw in Discover Financial Services (DFS), which released on the same day.The company's discussion of the higher LLP falls under the umbrella of what its management terms ""growth math"". This refers to the time lag between when credit problems emerge and when the credit is extended. Obviously, the problems take time to come through. So as recent vintages of credit risk bed down and mature, they experience a certain level of ""structurally normal "" credit loss, which typically slows down after (hopefully, at least) the loss rate conforms to what the company would expect from its risk models. Of course, if new credit volumes have been extended in the meantime, then the process will be ongoing.One way to look at this is to measure the last four quarters of LLP charges rolled up into a trailing annual number against the new loan volumes embedded in the same period.So that's going up. As you can see, the early quarters when annual new loans were around $10bn were followed by several quarters were the rolled LLP charges against new loans was 20%. E then had period of twice the level of new lending and we've just tasted >40% LLP charges vs the increased volume.It's important to recognize that COF management are relaxed and say they are happy with the risk parameters of the recently extended loan volumes. So while we will see stepped up provision charges, it seems unlikely there will be any kind of serious setback especially given the position of the macro with household income in good shape.The question for investors is just what the outlook is given this new seasoning cost and whether you want to be in something where visibility isn't that great due to the fluidity of the moving parts in the P&L.ConclusionThe above model builds in higher credit charges through 2018 and we have an attractive PE out there. The company bought back 9% of shares in 2016 and will continue in that vein. However, vs DFS the stock is lower visibility and DFS is only a tad less inexpensive out in 2018. I don't see any reason to pile into COF unless you are super comfortable with where the LLP costs will settle, which I'm not as yet."
4060669,102436,2017-04-06T04:51:40-04:00,"The stock has clearly lagged the market, and the Financial SPDR ETF.The Domestic Credit Card segment is a drag on the company's performance.Fast and low-quality growth will make things end badly for the company.","Several months ago, we wrote about Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF), in that article we discussed how the company has become highly dependent on subprime loans, and why investing in COF stock is a high-risk investment.Thus, we recommended investors to get away from the stock, and we were right (at least for now). The stock is down nearly 7% since we wrote about it, way underperforming the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) which is up 4.5% during that timeframe.In this article, we will give more reasons for why we believe that Capital One Financial is still a ""stay away"" stock.The problem is still in the Domestic Credit Card segmentThe company's Domestic Credit Card (DCC) segment is the main problem here. The company is highly dependent on this segment which contributes to 59% of its revenues. This concentration of risk means that the company is highly vulnerable to any shake-out in the US credit card business.During economic expansions, this is not a problem. However, in case of any downturn, the credit card debt is one of the first debts to be defaulted by the consumer. That's because there is nothing tangible to lose and defaulting on the debt will only result in more phone calls by credit agencies (and lower credit score, but that's nothing compared to losing your house or car).With the 8 years old economic expansion still in progress, how much time is left for another recession?And even if the economic expansion continues for another 2-3 years, the higher rate environment is going to kill Capital One Financial customers.That's because COF charges one of the highest rates in the industry. Its average interest yield of its DCC segment is 14.23%, 1.6% higher than its closest competitor Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS).Actually, there are credit cards offered that have very high interest rates. For example, Quick Silver One credit card, which is designed for average credit customers, has an APR of 24.99%.Another example is Spark Business credit card, which is offered to customers of ""excellent"" credit rating, it carries an interest rate of 17.74%.On the other hand, Citi's Diamond Preferred credit card carries an APR of 13.24%-23.24% (depending on credit score), and with 21 months of 0% interest on transfers and purchases (compared to 9 months for most of COF's cards).As a result, it's obvious that COF customers will get the biggest hit in a higher rate environment. And the concentration of COF's portfolio in the DCC segment threatens the company's financial position in a significant way in a higher rate environment.For the record, COF is down 9% since last month's rate hike, whereas the Financial Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XLF) is down 4.5%Just imagine rates going back to 4%. If that happens, COF's ""excellent"" customers would pay more than 20% on the Spark Business card for example.Another problem, high net charge-off rateManagement justifies high charge-off rates by stating that it is a natural effect of the company's "" growth math"" strategy, the one which involves increasing the number of customers meaningfully, which will naturally result in higher charge-off rates.While that is true on digits basis, it's not on a percentage basis. Charge-off rates will naturally increase as a result of a bigger loan portfolio, but it should not increase substantially as a percent of the overall portfolio. If that happens, then it means the company is picking low-rate customers to hit growth targets. And that's what COF is doing.Its Q4 net charge-off rate increased from 3.75% in 2015 to 4.66% in 2016, the highest in the last 5 years.However, there is another thing that should be considered.Capital One Financial increased its DCC portfolio by $6,165 million in 2016 last three months. That's way more than the average quarterly increase of $3,000 million.And since nonperforming loans are charged off once the customer stopped paying his/her obligations for more than 90 days, then dividing the net charge-off Q4 amount of $1,079 million by Q4 2016 average loans held for investment is misleading.In addition, most of the company's cards offer a 9 month 0% APR, which means that it very unlikely that customers would default in this period.Thus, to get the real net charge-off rate, Q4 net charge-off amount should be divided by Q1 2016 average value of loans held for investment (which is $85,148 million), not Q4s.Doing so, COF's real net charge-off rate would be 4.82%, a 16 percentage points increase.That's very high when compared to Discovery's adjusted rate of 2.6%.How much COF really makes on every credit card?There is no doubt that COF is picking subprime borrowers to fasten its growth. That can be clearly seen in COF's statements where it states that the customers with FICO scores below 660 increased 2% Y/Y as a percentage of all customers.The problem is that these increases won't show up on COF's financial statements anytime soon. The credit cards offered have a 9 months 0% APR, which means that its less likely that these subprime borrowers will default during that time.We know that there is nothing wrong with lending to subprime customers, but a red flag should be raised when the company makes little money when lending to those borrowers.The company's Q4 pre-tax income for the DCC segment is $793 million. With an average loans of $92,623 million, that's an annualized return of 3.4%, which is pretty low relative to the risks taken.We believe that's the reason for why the company's stock price is trading at a low price to book value of 0.85, when compared to Discovery's 2.35 ratio. In addition, even with a strong deposit base, the company's capital is low relative to the high number of risk weighted assets. Capital One's Tier 1 capital ratio is just 10.1%, not much above the 8% minimum Basel 3 requirements, and well below Discovery's 13.2% ratio.In sum, we recommend investors to stay away from this stock due to the high risk/low return the DCC segment provides. We think that a shift towards mortgages and other commercial loans will help the company diversify away from the card business. The stock is near the 200 day moving average, thus any close below $82.5/share is a strong bearish sign. In addition, the stock closed below the 200 quarter-day (8 hours), 4 hours, and 2 hours moving averages, which means that a short-term retracement is highly unlikely at this point. We don't believe that the stock is a compelling short due to reasonable valuation, but we do strongly believe that it's a high-risk investment.Cautious Investing to All."
4030905,102436,2016-12-16T04:05:50-05:00,Capital One Financial's biggest segment is starting to show worrying signs.The company's customers are low quality borrowers.Is the upside justified?,"""Markets can remain irrational more than you can remain solvent"".Interest rates rising and pushing bank stocks with them is something understandable. Higher rates will increase net interest margins for well-diversified banks, loud and clear.However, to let them push the stock price of some financial firms which get more than 60% of their net interest income from one of the biggest bubbles since the financial crises, the credit card sector, is irrational.Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) is one of these firms. The firm operates three segments: Credit Card, Consumer Banking, and Commercial Banking. The firm generates 61%, 28%, and 11% of its net interest income from the three sectors respectively.But the Domestic Credit Card segment of Capital One Financial is currently under pressure. If someone looks at the quarter over quarter change in the company's overall credit quality, he would see that quality is actually slightly improving.(Source: Capital One Financial 2016 Q3 10-Q)However, take a look at the year over year change. It is shocking.As seen, the provision for credit losses increased 45% (!) since last year. And most of the increase in provisions for credit losses is from the Domestic Credit Card segment. Take a look. Just for the record, all pictures used are from the company's fillings.As seen, the provision for credit losses increased by $394 million since last year. At the same time, the net interest income increased by $343 million. This means that the provision for credit losses totally wiped out any increase in revenue since last year.What that meansThe company added $9 billion in credit card loans since Q3 2015, or 11% increase, while having a decrease of 17% in pre-tax income. This means that the company is destroying value with its growth. The company is either picking new-bad customers or its old customers are defaulting on their payments.The FICO scores can give us a glimpse of the deteriorating credit quality of COF's customers.In Q3 2015, 34% of the domestic credit card holders had a score of sub 660, the threshold between acceptable and poor credit rating. In Q4 2015, the already-high rate increased to 36%.The FICO scores for the auto lending segment is also extremely worrying. Take a look.49% (!) of all Auto borrowers have a FICO score of less than 660, with 32% of the borrowers having a FICO below the 620 level, which is the upper 50 th percentile of the poor score range.More problems?In addition, the $5.4 billion Commercial Oil and Gas Portfolio is having huge troubles.In the last 3 quarters, the nonperforming loan rate jumped from 6.39% to 20.8%, a high rate even in this uncertain oil environment. That is a very high rate when compared to the 1.47% nonperforming loan rate of Bank of America's energy portfolio in Q3 2016 ( Source: page 75 of BAC Q3 10-Q).No economic profitLastly, the company makes no economic profit for its shareholders, which is the spread between the return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) and weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). Actually, the company is destroying shareholder value by its operations. Capital One Financial's ROIC is currently at 3.84%, while its WACC is 6.36%, which gives an economic loss of nearly 2.5%.ConclusionAll of this, and the stock increased 50% since the end of Q2, after the company announced that the Fed didn't object on the company's $2.5 billion capital plan, and gained ~13% since the election of Donald Trump.I believe that the company is poised to a significant earnings loss in the future. Since last year the company's biggest segment, the domestic credit card, decreased the company's earnings by $172 million in just one quarter. And all of this is happening when rates only increased once. Imagine what will happen when we return to par-2% level (it is still early but it will eventually happen). Besides having a troubled Credit Card segment, the company's Oil and Gas portfolio is having a high nonperforming loan rates, well above other banks and financial institutions. Moreover, the $2.5 billion stock repurchase program, which started this quarter, won't have a material effect on number of shares outstanding at current prices. At the time of the buyback announcement, the stock price was trading at $62/share. However, it's now trading at $90/share. The buyback will only have a merely 5% decrease in shares outstanding. As a result, I recommend getting out of this troubled company and putting your money in much more stable financial institutions, the ones which will benefit from higher rates. Prudential Financial is one of these companies. You can read my previous article about this company here."
4083981,102436,2017-06-26T14:29:12-04:00,"Capital One Financial can lose part of its assets, which are 10x bigger than its market cap.We believe that such a probable loss should be punished with a lower valuation of book value.COF's credit card portfolio is in a bad shape.","Since when we first published our article on Capital One Financial (COF), the stock has been down 11%, significantly lagging the Financials ETF (XLF) which has been up 3% in the same timeframe.To get a glimpse about our thesis on COF before reading this article, you can read our previous articles on the stock. Capital One Financial: Avoid This Firm At All CostsCapital One Financial: Avoid This Firm At All Costs - Part 2Investors who chose to stay long COF not only suffered from an 11% loss, they also missed the opportunity in invest in the stock market (SPY) which is up 8% since our first publication.Today, we remain bearish on Capital One Financial as its credit card business is in serious trouble that it may be stuck in for many years.The Credit Card segment is the biggest in the company. As 41% of the company's assets (loans) are invested in the CC segment, 61.5% of the company's revenues are generated from this segment, and 34% of the company's net income is sourced from the CC segment.Our main worry is the assets part. As of 31 March, $91 billion are given to credit card holders. This means that any 1% increase in the net charge-off rate can wipe out nearly $650 million of the company net income (at a tax rate of 30%), or 17% of the company's net income.The charge-off rate for the CC segment was 5.02% in this year's first quarter (it increased to 5.23% in May). That is 65% higher (!) than the national average charge-off rate for credit cards.US Banks Credit Cards: Net Charge-off Rate  data by YChartsAnd the national net charge-off rate is at 20-year low. So, if that rate increases over time, and there is a huge possibility it will as the chart shows, Capital One's net charge-off rate would also increase (knowing that 37% of the company's clients have a FICO score below 660, which is between the ""fair"" and the ""bad"" category).That isn't much a problem when interest rates are low and it's not a problem when the company has market power on its borrowers. However, both cases are invalid in current market conditions.Higher interest ratesWith respect to the first, it's well known that the Fed is committed to increase interest rates further, which would put pressure on COF's net interest margin as the company would be forced to pay its depositors to let the money stay in the company's coffers.One of the main strong points for Capital One is its deposit base. The company barely pays any interest (nearly 0.66% per annum) on its huge amount of deposits that covers two-thirds of its assets. It lends 41% of that money to credit card holders at rates that are as high as 20%, and lends 20% of these deposits to automobile buyers at mid single-digit rates, making a decent amount of profit.That's a great thing when interest rates are low as the opportunity cost of the deposited money is also low.However, when interest rates go up, COF would be forced to compensate its depositors with higher rates, which will squeeze margins.That's not a problem as long as COF can pass the interest rate increase to its borrowers (or in our case, credit card holders). Which takes us back to the second point:Capital One Financial doesn't have market power at this pointWe believe that Capital One is in deep trouble. The company invested 41% of its assets in a segment that charges the highest bearable rate. Capital One charges 18% per annum for credit card holders. If interest rates increase and COF is pushed to pass the increase to the credit card holders, then the credit card portfolio could suffer from higher charge-offs. Also, if COF decides not to pass the rate increase to its borrowers, then it will barely make any profit in this segment. That's because even at current low interest rates, COF makes a low profit when compared to the risk it takes. A 2.88% profit on every $1 lent means that there is a decent probability that all profits will be wiped out if the charge-off rate increases from current levels.Note: We made a 9-month lag between loans held for investment and revenue/income, since most of the credit cards issued by COF carry a 0% interest rate on the first nine-months. If the national charge-off rate increased more than 2.88%, and history suggests that's very possible in case of any recession, then Capital One will lose money on the assets it holds (a 1% loss of assets for COF wipes out 10% of market cap). For example, between 2002 and 2006, the national net-charge off rate (as shown in the chart above) averaged at 5%, 2% higher than current rate of 3%. If the national charge-off rate increases from current levels - which will happen once interest rates are higher - then there is a huge possibility that COF will lose money from the credit card segment since it already makes just 2.88% when the national average charge-off is at 20-year low. After 10 years of economic expansion, a recession is highly possible in the coming year. COF is now trading at 14% premium to its book value. We believe that such a highly probable loss of book value should be compensated by lower valuation. If COF is valued just at book value, then the stock price would decrease by 12%.Remember, we are just talking about the credit card segment. The auto segment is also having its own worries due to the weak customer base the company has. For example, 31% of auto borrowers have a FICO score below 620, which is very bad.Technical AnalysisCapital One Financial is now trading below its 200-day exponential moving average (blue line). The stock highly respects this level as it dropped/increased sharply and for a long time whenever the stock settles below/above the average.ConclusionWe believe that COF could lose a significant portion of its assets in case of any recession taking place, or even if interest rates go higher. The credit card segment is in really bad shape. The company can't pass higher interest rates to its borrowers and will be forced to pay its depositors a higher interest rate, which will squeeze the already depressed margins. Year over year, CC's net income decreased 55% due to higher provision for credit losses. This means that the company expects further losses. While the stock price decreased 20% from its March 2017 peak, we believe that there is still a probable 10% to 15% decline over the coming months. We recommend investors, again, to stay away from COF as the opportunity cost of investing in this stock is high.Cautious Investing to all."
4028385,101026,2016-12-05T18:56:51-05:00,"Capital One has historically combined explosive growth with notable parallel net income and book value per share increases.This trend changed during the crisis: opportunistic asset growth continued, but profitability has collapsed since 2008.At the end of 2016, COF is a beta sensitive stock with an important upside in terms of ROE improvement and cycle positioning.Therefore, a long short-to-mid-term position in the lender should be very profitable for a bank investor.","Capital One: Restless M&A During 20 YearsThe key elements to understanding what Capital One (NYSE:COF) is at the end of 2016 and the potential it holds are: 1) its aggressive and successful M&A acquisition story and 2) the man behind the construction of the eighth largest US lender by assets from a tiny monoline insurer, Richard Fairbank.The lender has its origins on the credit card business spun off from Signet Financial Corp., Virginia, in 1994. Building on the boom of the late '90s before the dot.com crisis, Capital One grew aggressively, developing an important technological edge in customer data storage, data mining and analytic & pattern recognition.During the 2000s, acquisitions such as Hibernia Bank (2005), North Fork Bancorporation and Chevy Chase Bank, a mortgage originator and consumer credit lender in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, multiplied the balance sheet of the lender.In the late 1990s and early 2000s (1997-2003) asset growth (33.06% on average during the period) matched profit growth (31.35% average) and book value per share growth (32.3%),even with a slight structural percent difference between the three ratios (Data from Bloomberg and WRDS databases).Therefore, Capital One managed to keep an extremely high ratio of growth with a stable increase in returns and book value per share even if it was at the cost of dividend payout ratio, which was very low or non-existent. ROE during the period was a reasonable 17%.Since 2009, the pattern of Capital One's acquisitions has changed, from the purchase of organizations to direct balance sheet growth with deposits and loan package acquisitions. The purchases of ING Direct USA, HSBC's (NYSE:HSBC) credit card operations and the healthcare finance unit of General Electric (NYSE:GE) increased the balance sheet from $177bn in early 2009 to the $345bn level at the end of 2016.Another historic trend at Capital One changed during this second stage of growth after the crisis though; the pattern of high asset growth and parallel net income and book value per share growth was no longer sustained as profitability collapsed.Asset growth continued with opportunistic acquisitions during and after the crisis (averaged 13.66% growth during 2009-2015), but book value per share growth collapsed at 5.74%, and return on equity stabilized at around 10%, not to reach pre-crisis levels again. Significantly, the dividend payout ratio increased from 2013 up to 30% in 2015.Summarizing, since 1997, assets at Capital One have grown circa 53x while profits have grown around 25 times; most of the divergence between assets and profits is attributable to the post-crisis period.Upside To Be Realized In A Highly Sensitive StockCapital One is an excellent short-to-mid-term play for three reasons: the lender has an important ROE optimization potential, is well positioned for the recovery in the US economy, and its stock price is very sensitive to good news.Overall, Capital One has not done a bad job in fundamental terms, particularly taking into account the extraordinary asset growth over the last 20 years. Over the period 2011-2015, assets have continued their growth trend, but earnings per share have been stagnating at around the $7 level though.This has been combined with low payout levels - even if they increased compared with the previous history of the lender - and low return on equity compared with better performing competitors and the historic return of Capital One itself before the crisis. Therefore, CPF has an important potential for ROE optimization.Furthermore, Capital One is well positioned to profit from the recovering US economy, particularly after Donald Trump's announced economic stimulus combined with the so-called ""bonfire of financial regulation"".And even without the Trump impulse, the consumer lending cycle in the US is at its bottom and starting to pick up, taking into account various measures such as employment levels, household financial obligation ratio, and disposable income per household.Finally, in terms of stock price, Capital One's price per share has been historically very sensitive to short-term shocks and perceived changes in macroeconomic and banking landscape; beta values for the stock have moved around 1.4 over the period 2010-2015.Looking at the stock chart, we can see that the fall in 2007 was extreme, even when compared with other peers in the consumer banking sphere that did not go bankrupt. Consequently, the stock price recovery in 2009-2010 was extreme too, with a 260% increase just in 12 months. After that, the stock price increased far more moderately to recent prices of around $70 per share.Therefore, we are talking about a stock very sensitive to positive - and negative - news.Summarizing; taking into account 1) the potential for ROE optimization 2) the positioning of the lender in an economic recovery and 3) the sensitivity of stock price to good news, a long short-to-mid-term position on Capital One would be very profitable for a prudent investor.For a longer-term investment horizon, a more stable growth/returns pattern that might be found in some of Capital One's competitors - American Express (NYSE:AXP) - should be taken into account though."

Capital One Financial (COF) is the most affordably priced stock from a forward P/E perspective. The company's price-to-book ratio of 0.7 also suggests an appealing buy candidate. The company has one of the safest levels of cash as a percentage of capital, which enables its modest dividend yield of 2.1%. COF shapes up as a tempting value play, given its low valuation, track record of stable growth and dividend payments.Strong growth, despite increased competitionThe Virginia-based company is the eighth-largest bank in the U.S. by assets under management. Capital One Financial operates in three business segments: Credit Cards (62%), Consumer Banking (28%) and commercial banking (5%). While the company competes in the U.S., Canada and the UK, its business model is heavily concentrated in U.S. credit cards as 57% of revenue originates from this geographic segment.Within its domestic credit card portfolio, about 65% of debtors have FICO scores of about 660, while the remaining 35% are subprime. CEO Richard Fairbanks noted that ""we really like the business we are booking. While we continue to closely watch the market place, we still see attractive growth opportunities in our domestic card business"".The company released 2Q16 earnings in late July which missed estimates by $0.17 per share. Earnings increased by 17.3% versus last year to $979M, or $1.69 per share. The bank also has a strong Tier-1 Capital Ratio of 10.9%.Management has noted increased competition in its credit card segment from competing rewards products. Additionally, Consumer Banking was hit hard in the current quarter as charge-offs increased seasonally and home loans decreased by 4%. Capital One's increased reserves have taken a bite out of bottom-line growth, as PCLs (provisions for credit losses) increased by 4%.Capital One Financial's assets have grown at the second fastest rate of any big bank in the U.S. since 2006. Its large acquisitions of Chevy Chase bank in 2009 and ING Direct's online banking platform in 2012 have supplemented its smaller acquisitions and organic growth to boost assets under management.Risks: high exposure to sub-prime, little diversificationWhile the cheap forward P/E and Price-to-Book ratios may look tempting, the bank seems overly reliant on sub-prime credit cards, in my view. The economy, while not on fire, has been stable for many years now, due in part to lose monetary policy. As a result, consumer debt has started to rise sharply once again, and seems well on its way to reaching pre-Global Recession levels, as the chart below indicates. Meanwhile, real retail sales (adjusted for inflation) have skyrocketed way past the pre-Recession mark, according to macrotrends.net.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from the Federal Reserve BoardShould the next economic contraction arrive sooner rather than later, it is possible that Capital One would be one of the first financial institutions to suffer from the downturn, as clients might become pressed to make their payments timely.As SA contributor Theodor Tonca points out, the company ""has both over-lent, with total outstanding loans exceeding total deposits by a small margin, and also slightly over-borrowed, with the $45.42 billion in currently outstanding debt on its balance sheet [as of 1Q16] just eclipsing 20% of total deposits and inching up"". And if you are a Capital One cardholder, you have probably noticed that being a generous lender - high credit limits and lower credit quality requirements - is part of the company's DNA.Lastly, while the bank has invested in its U.S. banking segments through targeted acquisitions, it only has domestic branches in 8 states and Washington D.C. Going forward, I believe the company would be better served by making a larger domestic banking footprint a priority in order to increase its product diversification.In the end, Capital One may be one of those ""cheap-for-a-reason"" names. I believe the stock fits in better as part of a diversified portfolio, rather than a high-conviction, low-risk stand-alone play."
4031587,102582,2016-12-20T04:52:15-05:00,"COF seeing a rise in credit costs.
        However, rising net interest margins more than offset this.
        Company likely to benefit from stimulus and deregulation.
        Cheap, but low quality company with solid upside potential.
        Downside to a bad economy or tight credit markets, but probably okay otherwise.","Investment ThesisCapital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF) is a bank holding company that specializes in credit card, auto, and other consumer lending, particularly to the sub-prime consumer.The company is a low-quality consumer financial company in terms of return on equity and high credit costs. But it may be attractive to aggressive investors since rising rates are likely to improve net interest margin, despite rising credit costs, and relaxed regulations are also likely to improve profitability over the next several years.Keep in mind that low quality companies do especially poorly during recessions and that economic conditions can change rapidly, so a small position size and good risk control is warranted.Recent Credit Trends Have Deteriorated . . .Last week COF released its credit card and auto loan statistics for November. U.S. credit card loans were up over 10% year-over year. This growth came at the cost of credit quality, however, as charge offs came in at 4.8% for the month versus 3.9% in the same period last year and full-year 2016 guidance of 4.2%.Other credit metrics were just as bad. Delinquencies greater than 30 days also increased from 3.5% last year to 4.0% this year. Auto loan charge-offs and international credit card charge-offs also increased.The full-year net charge-off guidance of 4.2% is the worst year since 2011, when the company was still recovering from the Great Recession, and turned in a 4.7% full year charge off. At the worst point of the recession, in 2009, charge-offs were 9.2% for the year. This deterioration is probably due to a higher portion of subprime card issuances, but may also be indicative of stretched consumers.Consumer debt ratios are reaching record levels and are still growing. Consumers are also spending more of their income of non-debt obligations, like housing costs.. . . But Looks Can Be DeceivingThe trick with analyzing these types of companies is figuring out if the interest they earn will rise faster than their credit costs. While sub-prime finance companies have higher losses than prime lenders, they can still be profitable if the rates they charge are high enough. What's really important is the spread.With that in mind, rates are likely to continue rising to temper the inflationary impact of the new administration's stimulus programs. Accordingly, sub-prime finance companies like COF may be able to increase rates faster than charge-offs are increasing, thus expanding profitability. In fact, COF is relatively asset sensitive within the consumer finance industry, so it is likely to benefit from an increased net interest margin.If wages and jobs continue increasing, that should also limit the growth in credit costs. Likewise, relaxed regulation on debt collections could help limit credit costs.Credit Card Industry ComparisonCapital One is far cheaper than other companies in the industry on a price-to-book basis, but it's also far inferior on a return on equity basis. This is a reflection of its high credit costs due to its sub-prime focus and a lack of brand cachet vis-a-vis American Express and Discover.Low quality companies like COF tend to do better than average when the economy is expanding, but do much worse when the economy enters a recession. In fact, during the last recession, COF traded at only 0.1X book.I think given the array of tax and spending stimulus likely to hit in the next 1-2 years, COF is likely to continue benefiting from a strong tailwind. While the economy is well into a long expansion cycle, it has been a very muted recovery. There doesn't appear to be many excesses, except in the valuation of financial assets, due to prolonged monetary expansion.Nonetheless, a low-quality company like this should never be a large percentage of the portfolio. Economic conditions can change suddenly and you don't want to be caught with too much exposure to a company with large downside.Company's Current Valuation vs. HistoryPrice / Book, the key valuation metric for a financial company, is right in line with the company's history. Price / Earnings is a little more at the high end. Overall I wouldn't count on further multiple expansion at this stage of the bull market and economic cycle.Looking at upside potential, projected 2018 book value per share is $111.79. Applying a 1X multiple to that, appropriate at the company's mediocre return on equity level, gives a two year target price of $111.79. Adding two years of dividends to the 24% price appreciation target gives a two-year upside total return of about 28%.In terms of the downside, if the company were to fall from 0.9X book to 0.7X book, that would imply a 22% price drop. I think negative earnings is extremely unlikely, even with credit costs creeping up, so the likely downside is more likely to be multiple compression.If the economy remains strong, I think the company can grow EPS in the 8-10% range, depending on credit costs. With a 2.2% yield, likely long-term total return falls into the 10-12% range.RisksRising credit costs / economic deteriorationCredit spread compression if the company cannot raise ratesLiquidity / credit market funding"
3674096,39551,2015-11-10T20:25:37-05:00,"Capital One is able to grow its business aggressively, while maintaining effective control of expenses and credit.The company's expense discipline has historically led to better relative operating leverage.It also boasts a talented management team, which has demonstrated its ability to manage well through multiple cycles.","Capital One (NYSE:COF) is a fast-growing regional bank that the market values as if it were still a specialty mono-line credit card lender. It is able to grow its business aggressively, while maintaining effective control of expenses and credit. Its expense discipline has historically led to better relative operating leverage even as the company expanded through acquisitions and asset purchases. Overall, COF remains a very attractive stock, and its re-rating is long overdue. The bank's well-diversified loan book is fully deposit-funded. While regional banks trade at 12-14x 2016 earnings, COF trades at only 10x 2016 estimates (S&P forward P/E 18.5).Capital One also boasts talented management, which has demonstrated its ability to manage well through multiple cycles. While COF is an attractive investment, it is not without risks. The company is still seeing portfolio contraction, and is exposed to lower-quality consumer credits.Balancing Market Share Gains and RisksFor 20 years, COF has balanced market share gains and risks consistently, rapidly expanding or pulling back depending upon pricing and projected risk-adjusted returns. For example, in 2015, the company observed that some of its card strategies, such as certain cash-back card products, were working, and it ramped up marketing and distribution costs accordingly. COF's management has been able to drive a steady 5% PPE yield on loans since 2012. With domestic card growth accelerating, the upcoming GE Healthcare asset purchase and the eventual likelihood of rising rates, there are good reasons to expect continued PPE/earnings growth.Well-CapitalizedDespite an estimated $400 million in share repurchases in 3Q15, the company's tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio increased by 10 bps Q/Q. In addition, COF's sizeable buybacks of $3.1 billion approved through June 2016 are expected to boost EPS, in spite of limited core growth. COF remains very well capitalized. The bank's common equity tier 1 ratio was above its 8% target under the Basel III fully phased-in advanced approaches method as of September 30, after share repurchases in 3Q reduced net common shares by 7.6 million, or 1%, from 2Q, and by 4% over the last year. Under the standardized approached, COF's Basel III common equity tier 1 ratio came in at 12.1% in 3Q15.Robust Domestic Card BusinessCOF reported strong 3Q15 EPS of $1.98, beating the consensus estimates of $1.94 by 4 cents. Healthy loan growth, higher NIM, and lower expenses all contributed to strong results. Capital One's 3Q15 results were solid, healthier than a negatively skewed consensus following cautious comments on expenses and credit. Disappointing trends in the Commercial Bank segment somewhat weighed on the results, but the more important card business delivered solid results with industry-leading loan and volume growth, resilient margins, and lower-than-expected provision expense.COF's domestic card business remains robust. The company continues to report strong, industry-leading loan growth and in-line credit metrics. It showed strong loan growth of 12% from the year-earlier 3Q in its U.S. credit card business, with relatively stable credit-quality measures and a smaller build of the loan loss reserve than in 2Q, leading to a significant quarter-over-quarter increase in EPS. The reserve increase in 3Q was $171 million, down from $283 million in 2Q.COF's net interest margin increased by 17 bps Q/Q and remains in a good spot, as the U.S. cards are poised to gain a greater portion of the asset base and rising interest rates will increase yields on the other asset classes, i.e., commercial and auto. The impact of higher interest rates will not likely be felt until 2017 - management expects a lag before yields adjust. Analysts at UBS (report published on October 23rd, 2015) expect the asset mix change to benefit the NIM in 2016 with a 13 bps increase, followed by another 7-10 bps in 2017.ConclusionCOF is a fast-growing regional bank that currently trades at a discount compared to core super-regional peers. I believe that Capital One could gradually re-rate to trade at the high end range of regional bank peers, given its above-average loan growth and capital return profile. The company continues to report strong results. The highlight of the most recent quarter was robust card growth, which continues to beat expectations and shows further signs of COF gaining market share. Over the last several quarters, COF has been accelerating in its breaking away from the competition.Combined with an impressively stable and robust NIM, the bank's material market share gains are a key positive relative to its card lender peers, and ultimately, should drive outsized top line and EPS growth. It is worth mentioning here that credit loss reserve requirements depress GAAP earnings initially, but I think COF's industry-leading growth is driving true value creation and remains underappreciated."
4014461,99706,2016-10-25T03:26:56-04:00,"Capital One's valuation and earnings are cheap compared to its peers.The company operates in the credit card space, which is perceived as risky, but it has been generating decent returns with less leverage than its peers.High volatility in the options market going into earnings presents some interesting ways to make some extra money getting into this stock which I discuss.With a top-flight management and room for growth, there should be lots of room to pursue superior returns going forward.","I am always looking for cheap stocks, North or South of the border, and Capital One (NYSE: COF) has been one of the cheaper names in US financials for some time. There is value to be found in US Financials without a doubt. However, Capital One may not appear a screaming bargain at first when compared to the rock-bottom PEs across the sector. Its discount on this metric is marginal, compared to its direct competitors, not-quite-direct competitors, and some other more diversified big US financial names:As you can see, COF is the 2nd cheapest of the bunch compared to its direct competitors like Synchrony Financial (NYSE: SYF), American Express (NYSE: AXP) and Discover (NYSE: DFS). Citi and JP Morgan are huge players in the credit card market as well, but have a lot more size and diversification across activities and geographies.American Express and Discover are competitors for sure, but they are integrated, meaning that in addition to taking on the credit risk of borrowers, they own the payment infrastructure and collect ""interchange"" fees on their network. This is attractive recurring revenue that doesn't involve credit risk, and it makes them nice value plays in the sector if you don't want to pay top dollar for Visa (NYSE: V) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA) who only deal in the interchange trade. Without the credit risk of borrowers, these two trade at a huge premium to their card-issuing competitors and are bumping up against 52 week highs.Amex and Discover are small compared to these behemoths,and they are competing with Capital One and Synchrony to acquire share of wallet in the non-bank and ""private label"" spaces, along with Alliance Data Systems (NYSE: ADS) to a lesser extent. Their businesses live and die by loan and deposit growth, credit quality, and ability to earn interest off of their borrowers. From this perspective, loan and deposit growth has been solid for Capital One, in that it has been positive the last three quarters:(Source: Q2 report)Loans have increased by 12% and deposits by over 6% in the last three quarters. They have also managed to increase the net interest income spread by about 10% in the same period.If we look back at the longer term trend, we also see that Capital One has been managing to increase this, for the most part, year over year for the past five years:(Source: 2015 annual report)This 5 year picture paints a pretty stable picture. The efficiency ratio is stable in the 54-56% range, and the net charge off dollar amounts and rates have not contracted or expanded in a meaningful way. Fundamentally the company is executing well.The GE Connection$9B of the $13B increase in outstanding loans from the end of 2014 to the end of 2015 came from the acquisition of GE's healthcare loan book in 2015. This is interesting because Synchrony Financial, who I will look at in an upcoming column is, in effect, a large part of the old GE capital business spun off with a new name. Getting rid of that business was a critical component to GE getting focused and cleaning up its act. Credit cards is not the prettiest corner of the market to play in but somebody has to do it. With that said, let's look at Capital One's performance.I have held some shares in Capital One for a few years, which I mentioned in a column some months back. They are still underwater. But so are all the companies we are looking at today compared to their all-time highs, which are:Capital One - July 17 2015 - $91 - 17% offSynchrony - August 14 2015 - $35.14 - 17% offAmex - July 3 2014 - $95.84 - 29% offDiscover - December 26 2014 - $66.27 -15% offLooking at these numbers, I think it is safe to asset that right now, the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 was the time of ""peak credit card"" in the market. Looking at this chart, its been nothing but serial underperformance for the names we are looking at in the sector ever since:Synchrony does have the best return over the past two years but its IPO was only in 2014.Credit Card Use Is Not DecliningThese numbers should not obscure the fact that the payment industry is expected to continue to expand as online shopping increases and cash use decreases. This has already been going on for a few years. It is probably reasonable to assert that we are currently in a pullback for this peer group, but the secular trend indicates a buying opportunity. According to research by Synchrony I found on the MarketLine website, transaction volume is expected to have CAGR of 4.76% between here and 2019, cards in circulation a CAGR of 4.68%, and the value of card transactions a CAGR of 5.72%. This line of business offers a stable runway of growth that has a pretty good chance of occurring. This risk/reward to invest capital in not present in many other sectors.And Capital One might be the best place to do it. Capital One really shines in the rate at which it has grown its business. It has outgrown Sychrony, Discover, and Amex in revenue over a five year period:Sure it is not a ""lights-out"" beat, but it is significant when you consider that they have been using less leverage to do it:Admittedly is does the flattest ROE out of the bunch, the only one not in double digits at 8.4%, but it is generating returns with less leverage with fewer revenue drivers.The last value metric is Book Value. Capital One's has been sitting below 1 for years. While the stock does not promise rapid gains, this is a pretty good indicator that you are not overpaying for this business.But I missed the bottom twice in 2016! Has the train left the station?It's clear that this company gets rocked when the market gets the jitters. After all, it has traded as low as $60 two times already this year (during the January correction and after Brexit). Not only that, but the stock actually trades for less than it did 10 years ago. That's right, on October 27, 2006, you would have paid $81.66 a share compared to ~$75.50 as I write this. The perception of the strength of the US consumer is pretty important to this stock, as we saw when it surfed lows of $12 during the financial crisis. However, if you like this company, as I do, there is an opportunity to earn some income off getting long the stock going into earnings by using options:Look at this option chain. Capital One has a historical implied volatility of 16.46%. That means that market makers usually price in about a 16% annual move for this stock either way, 68% of the time or 1 standard deviation. Right now, the stock has an implied volatility of 27%, a 40% premium over the historical average.Why is this important? Well, as an option seller you can earn more premium off Capital One today than you can most of the time. Why? Because earnings are after the close tomorrow. Volatility is always high heading into earnings and after earnings it almost always crashes and reverts to its mean.Right now the market is pricing in about a 70% chance of a $2.50 move up or down before Friday. So if you would like to pay less for the shares than they trade for today, as in $2.50 less, you can take in $65 of premium to agree to buy the shares for $73 by Friday. That's more than the $40 of dividends those 100 shares will pay you on November 4th. Conversely, you can buy 100 shares today and sell a $78 strike call which expires on Friday for $56. Again, more than the dividend, and if Capital One crushed earnings and your shares got called away at $78, you would make $300 on your $7534 investment in 4 days or 253% annualized.That's not to say you'll have opportunities to generate income on Capital One shares like this all the time. You won't. And what happens in both scenarios depends on what happens with earnings, which obviously you have no control over. Personally, I don't think the stock is going to move that much, so I will put in a limit order to be short $72.50 strike puts. I think this company is the best play in large cap financials right now and I'm comfortable adding to my long term position even if they blow it on earnings and I get assigned. This is a company still run by the guy who founded it in 1988, that continues to grow its income and assets while getting no hype from the market. That's the kind of company I want to be long in."

Then I'd like to hold onto to those investments unless the fundamental reasons for which I bought them in the first place changes. Investing long term works! I just want to reduce the occasional pain inflicted by bear markets.Why I HedgeIf the market (and your portfolio) drops by 50 percent, you will need to double your assets from the new lower level just to get back to even. I prefer to avoid such pain. If the market drops by 50 percent and I only lose 20 percent (but keep collecting my dividends all the while) I only need a gain of 25 percent to get back to even. That is much easier than a double. Trust me, I have done it both ways and losing less puts me way ahead of the crowd when the dust settles. I may need a little lead to keep up because I refrain from taking on as much risk as most investors do, but avoiding huge losses and patience are the two main keys to long-term successful investing.The Debt DominosThe major debt dominoes that are teetering already are:As the above dominoes begin to fall, the problems in the economy will cascade into other areas of debt:I suspect by now that we all understand that there is a wave of bankruptcies coming in the energy patch. It will not engulf all $400 billion in debt issued by U.S. exploration and production energy companies. It will, however, impact a significant chunk of that amount. By itself, the financial system would be able to withstand this setback and regain its footing over time. But that is just the first of the dominoes. I have written more about this looming black hole here and about the energy sector in my short series of articles about the Energy Sector Outlook.Next, as a result of junk-rated energy debt being devalued, other similarly rated bonds will also have prices fall causing interest rates on such bonds to escalate higher. Already bonds rated CCC and lower, as rated by Standard and Poor's is yielding nearly 16.4 percent on average. Those companies issuing such debt are often reliant of being able to issue additional debt to stay in business. With rates rising so much this may not be an option for many such companies. The result will be more bankruptcies and even higher rates. The process continues in each debt cycle until either the economy is cleansed of the weakest companies that could not compete on a level playing field or when the Fed or Congress throws the remaining few on life support a rope of relief. That rope often takes the form of lower interest rates or government subsidized loans. Congress does not appear to be in the mood to make subsidized loans and the Fed only has a couple inches of rope left when it may need a hundred feet.Emerging markets are getting hit by a triple whammy domino. According to the Emerging Markets Debt Monitor issued in December 2015 by Van Eck, the total amount of high yield USD denominated corporate debt issued in emerging markets is $1.031 trillion. The three problems are: a rising dollar, rising interest rates on high yield debt, and falling prices of natural resources. Of course, all emerging markets are not fully reliant upon exports of natural resources, but for those that are, this is especially detrimental. The rising value of the USD relative to local currencies causes imported goods to cost more resulting in inflation on the expense side of the ledger. Interest rates are rising on USD denominated debt in emerging markets, not only because of the demand for higher yields on high risk debt, but because the Fed has begun to tighten. Finally, for those emerging countries that depend heavily on exporting natural resources, the falling prices continue to take a toll. Lower revenue, higher borrowing costs and potentially less access to additional debt needed to fund operations could push many dubious companies into insolvency.Subprime car loans are rising in proportion to total car loans and the default rates are beginning to rise too. In the six months prior to September 2015, a total of $110 billion of new auto loans were given to subprime borrowers, according to this article from the Wall Street Journal. In another article from Bloomberg.com:Notice the rising trend; $68 billion in all of 2014, $50 billion in the first six months of 2015, then $110 billion from April through September. That would mean $60 billion in just the third quarter of 2015, almost as much as all of 2014.The default rate has not yet risen significantly to cautionary levels, but when the next recession hits those subprime borrowers are the most likely to lose jobs and to default on car loans with interest rates above 20%. This one has not hit the tipping point as of yet, but it will not take much of an economic slowdown for the subprime car loan market to get ugly. If you wonder why Santander Consumer USA Holdings (NYSE:SC) stock is down more than 40 percent since July, the answer would be that it specializes in subprime auto loans. I consider SC to be the canary in the coal mine for this category.Student loans outstanding now total more than $1.2 trillion in the U.S. That amount is up from around $710 billion in September 2013 and from under $500 billion in 2006 according the chart below from U.S. Federal Reserve.The Wall Street Journal has a nice article about student loan in default here.The student loan situation is a time bomb that will most likely create more of a drag on the economy than a crisis event. Saddled with student loans, young couples are more likely to put off household formation than in the past. Household formations are a significant economic driver in our consumer-based economy. But eventually this time bomb will cause problems and will need to be addressed. If a recession hits, and it will eventually, more of these loans will go into default leaving yet another hole in the federal budget.The major problems lead to more problems in the remaining two debt categories: credit card debt and mortgage debt. When a recession hits people lose jobs and when people lose jobs mortgages get paid before car loans, student loans, and credit card debt. In all probability, student loans will be the first to be left unpaid, then credit card debt because people still want a car and a roof over their heads. Student loans are already being defaulted at the relatively high rate of 17 percent. Car loan defaults will rise and credit card debt defaults could go much higher. That is just what happens during a recession. That leads us to our new candidate and its reliance on credit card interest and fees for a significant portion of its revenue and profits.A probable victim of the debt dominoes is a new candidate for hedgingCapital One Financial (NYSE:COF) total loans were about $213 billion with $90 billion in unsecured credit card debt. As of 12/31/2015, nearly a third of those credit card borrowers were either subprime or on the verge of it (FICO score of 660 or below). Another $67 billion of COF's loans were auto loans and mortgages. Again, a significant percentage of car loans were to subprime borrowers (nearly 50 percent) which amounted to about $14 billion. But the riskiest loan category is the unsecured credit cards.When the next recession hits, and I do believe that it will include another major financial crisis, major credit card issuers like COF are going down. Just look at the ten-year chart:COF data by YChartsI think that where we are today is somewhere around the same place we were about November of 2007. I could be early, but that is my best guess at how I expect the chart to look going forward. It may not get quite as bad as during the Great Recession for some sectors, but COF is positioned to take some of the worst of whatever comes in my opinion. The great income from fees and high interest rates goes away when folks stop making payments. Below is the position I intend to take in COF on Tuesday if the market cooperates.Capital One FinancialI need one COF June 2016 put option contract to provide the indicated loss coverage up to one-eighth of a $30,000 loss on each $100,000 in bond portfolio value. Remember to hold at least eight positions for diversification. I do not know which positions will provide the best protection. Some will go down more than I expect giving us better protection and others will hold up better than I expect providing less protection. On average, I believe eight different positions should provide adequate protection. I tend to use more than eight with each to protect smaller portions of my portfolio. But that is just me and because I believe I should hold everything I write about in the series.Brief Discussion of RisksIf an investor decides to employ this hedge strategy, each individual needs to do some additional due diligence to identify which candidates they wish to use and which contracts are best suited for their respective risk tolerance. I do not always choose the option contract with the highest possible gain or the lowest cost. I should also point out that in many cases I will own several different contracts with different strikes on one company. I do so because as the strike rises the hedge kicks in sooner, but I buy a mix to keep the overall cost down. My goal is to commit approximately two percent (but up to three percent, if necessary) of my portfolio value to this hedge per year. If we need to roll positions before expiration there may be additional costs involved, so I try to hold down costs for each round that is necessary. My expectation is that this represents the last time we should need to roll positions before we see the benefit of this strategy work more fully. We have been fortunate enough this past year to have ample gains to cover our hedge costs for the next year. The previous year, we were able to reduce the cost to below one percent due to gains taken. Thus, over the full 20 months since I began writing this series, our total cost to hedge has turned out to be less than one percent.I want to discuss risk for a moment now. Obviously, if the market continues higher beyond January 2016, all of our old January expiration option contracts that we have open could expire worthless. I have never found insurance offered for free. We could lose all of our initial premiums paid plus commissions, except for those gains we have already collected. If I expected that to happen, I would not be using the strategy myself. But it is one of the potential outcomes and readers should be aware of it. I have already begun to initiate another round of put options for expiration beyond January 2016, using up to two percent of my portfolio (fully offset this year by realized gains) to hedge for another year. The longer the bulls maintain control of the market, the more the insurance is likely to cost me. But I will not be worrying about the next crash. Peace of mind has a cost. I just like to keep it as low as possible.Because of the uncertainty in terms of how much longer this bull market can be sustained and the potential risk versus reward potential of hedging versus not hedging, it is my preference to risk a small percentage of my principal (perhaps as much as two percent per year) to insure against losing a much larger portion of my capital (30 to 50 percent). But this is a decision that each investor needs to make for themselves. I do not commit more than three percent of my portfolio value to an initial hedge strategy position and have never committed more than ten percent to such a strategy in total before a major market downturn has occurred. The ten percent rule may come into play when a bull market continues much longer than expected (like three years instead of 18 months). And when the bull continues for longer than is supported by the fundamentals, the bear that follows is usually deeper than it otherwise would have been. In other words, at this point I would expect the next bear market to be more like the last two, especially if the market continues higher through all of 2016. Anything is possible but if I am right, protecting a portfolio becomes ever more important as the bull market continues.As always, I welcome comments and will try to address any concerns or questions either in the comments section or in a future article as soon as I can.

3852446,39551,2016-02-01T10:13:59-05:00,COF reported another strong quarter.Its U.S. card loan growth beats its peers.Growth in the card industry in general has accelerated over the past several years.,"2016 presents some challenges for Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF). Due to a competitive card space, the current year is likely to result in higher operating and marketing costs. The majority of growth in COF's top-line revenues is likely to be consumed by rising expenses, resulting in limited net income growth.Despite these issues, COF's shares represent a compelling opportunity given strong underlying trends amid growing macro fears. While the company is seeing some pressure on profitability in the auto business, it remains optimistic about continued loan growth and strong profitability in the card business.Based on a number of indicators, such as consumer confidence, COF's management feels that the U.S. real economy looks strong. Indeed, there has been sustained improvement in labor markets. While the sharp decline in energy prices is certainly a headwind for some sectors, the drop in prices has also provided a direct benefit to consumers. At this point, the ultimate impact of global issues and low commodity prices is still unclear and COF is not seeing any indication of stress in the portfolio yet.U.S. Card Loan Growth Beats PeersThere is an argument against COF that the company has material credit exposures that could pressure EPS in a recession. But the stock appears to be already discounting this risk amid little evidence of consumer deterioration. In Q4, COF's U.S. card loans grew faster than all major peers. The company's average domestic card loans grew 13% Y/Y to $88 billion. COF selectively pulled back in subprime auto lending given deteriorating risk-adjusted returns while continuing to focus on expanded prime lending.CEO Richard Fairbank commented on the company's Q4 call that he continues to see ""windows of opportunity."" He believes that these opportunities exist more in the subprime space because of COF's fast growth in that segment. Mr. Fairbank was positive about card industry growth trends, noting that growth was only 1% in 2012-2013, then accelerated to 3% around mid-2014, and it has been over 4% in recent months.In the commercial banking business, ending loan balances increased 24% Y/Y, including the acquisition of the GE Healthcare finance business and about $900 million from a short-term agency warehousing transaction that is already paid down. Excluding both the GE Healthcare loans and the agency warehouse transactions, loans grew about 6% Y/Y. While increasing competition is pressuring loan terms, COF is well positioned to benefit from growth opportunities in specialty industry verticals.Another Strong QuarterCOF reported Q4 GAAP EPS of $1.58, below Street estimates of $1.61. However, after excluding one-time costs of $69 million and an estimated $12 million benefit from the GE Healthcare acquisition, the core EPS was $1.65, above consensus estimates of $1.61. The strong results were helped by growth in cards in what is typically a seasonally weak quarter. The window of opportunity for more card growth remains, and COF reiterated its card loss guidance for 2016 (4%) and said loss rates are likely to be in the low 4% range in 2017. Management also reaffirmed positive operating leverage for 2016.Attractive ValuationCOF's shares look attractive. Despite COF's better relative returns, the company is trading at 7x 2017 estimated EPS, a discount to the bank median multiple of ~9.5x (Source: Baird). COF's relative performance would be best in an extended low-rate environment, where the company can deliver better loan growth and capital return. Less volatility in results should help shares trade closer to high-quality bank peers.With its leading industry growth, COF is taking share in the U.S. card business and its deposit funding structure should allow for sustainable to improving margins over time. Management has been upfront about timing issues associated with higher credit costs and associated operating expense increases. As the market better understands the growth impact and as COF's digital investments take hold, I believe the long-term earnings picture will become better understood and lift the multiple.ConclusionCapital One's card lending/spending continues to be among the strongest in the industry. The company continues to expect efficiency ratio improvement in 2016 largely due to better card revenue growth and productivity gains from digital investments, and believes that it will see further improvement in 2017. Historically, COF's expense discipline has led to better relative operating leverage even as the company expanded through acquisitions and asset purchases.It's true that credit concerns are keeping some investors on the sidelines, but the stock appears to be already discounting this risk. With another strong quarter of growth and profitability, COF remains one of the best positioned card stocks among its peers. With the muted reserve build and rebound in interchange revenues, COF's material market share gains are a key positive relative to its card lending peers that ultimately should drive outsized top line and EPS growth.I think the company's industry-leading growth is driving true value creation that should ultimately help the stock recover."

If you have a credit card that charges you 20%, then saving that money is the same as an investment with a massive return, no risk, and no taxes. Also, it simplifies your life. Financial complexity has a way of sneaking up on you, so it is nice to start from as simple a base as is possible. Getting rid of all non-house debt is a good, simple start. If you like cars, then consider owning stock in General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F) Fiat (NYSE:FCAU), or Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), but don't borrow any money from them. If you like credit cards, then consider owning stock in Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) or AmEx (NYSE:AXP), but don't owe them any credit card interest payments. That way, you will be on the winning end of interest payments that these companies charge their customers. But if you are paying interest payments to AmEx, then check this out:It is the ski chalet that AmEx executives built with your money.What could be more perfect than solving this problem?What's better than getting out of debt? Avoiding it in the first place. Try for scholarships instead of student loans. Never ever roll over credit card debt intermonth, not even once (unless you are using them to buy investments and the APR is 0%). Buy a clunker instead of taking car loans on a fancy car. If you are looking for a bargain on a car, keep an eye out for credit union auctions. In my experience, they are quite price-insensitive. The same goes for all the other consumer financing for everything from boats to washing machines.Buy with cash or do without. There are certainly people who lack whatever stuff you are financing who are at least as content with their lives. As far as possible, avoid advertising. Watching less TV and consuming less media means that you will be able to do without because you don't even know what you're missing.When my family moved from North Carolina to Manhattan, we saw tons of stuff that we just hadn't noticed before. Off the rack suits? Aren't they all off the rack? Factory made shoes? Where else would they be made? I tried to scoff at handmade suits and shoes, but… they really are quite a bit nicer. All of a sudden something that was totally unknown to me was this void to be filled at a high cost. Even if you buy a $10 million home in New York, you can probably see a $20 million home from your window and you will begin to dream ""maybe someday…"" It never ends, so it is easier to just opt out. Don't even look. Don't even know, because there will always be someone available to try to convince you to spend more.Dave's plan is certainly better than most people's plans. But most people's plans are terrible. Outstanding credit card balances are heading to one trillion dollars this year.Capital One (NYSE:COF) reported that credit card sales jumped 14% this past quarter compared to the prior year.I am delighted for Capital One's CEO Rich Fairbank and his fellow Capital One shareholders. If you like his cards, consider buying his stock - it may or may not be a good idea but is almost certainly a better idea than borrowing from his company with your credit card. When you see people doing something crazy, either take the other side of the trade or, at the very least, stay away, but never join in.Average householders have over $16,000 of credit card debt. Dave Ramsey calls these people ""normal"" because it is. In addition to the credit card debt, they have $27,000 in auto loans, and $48,000 in student debt. Some people have much more. As you rid yourself of these payments, Ramsey says you will become increasingly ""weird"" as living debt-free is such a rarity. After Baby Step 2, your total debt would be down to just mortgage debt ($169,000 for average U.S. households).Even in the currently low interest rate environment, the average household is paying $7,000 of interest annually. This is a staggering opportunity cost in terms of lost wealth building potential. If you are doing something of immense value with this debt, then great. If you are durably capturing a spread by consistently making more with that borrowing than you are spending on interest, then great. If you bought a 300 series BMW for the keychain, a cheesy developer's house with a front facing garage and two story foyer with a second story window so your neighbors can see your chandelier, and a masters in philosophy from a third tier, out-of-state state school, then you might not be making sound decisions.Dave Ramsey is fixing a behavior problemWhy not pay off the worst (highest after tax cost or most likely to have violent enforcers) debt first? Why not keep free intra-month credit card debt? While Dave's plan is better than that of the folks who have built up much of the nearly trillion in credit card balances, it is still arbitrary. On the other hand, the underlying issue is not a finance problem, but a behavior problem. So Dave's solution focuses on fixing the behavior.ConclusionAvoid all bad debt (anything other than a tax-deductible home mortgage). If you are in it, get out of it. The subsequent steps will be more fun, but these early ones are necessary. You first set up a strong financial defense which best prepares you to go on offense.When you are in your teens, avoid debt and save while you are living under your parents' roof. Establish the financial habits you want to keep for the rest of your life. Be an earner, saver, investor, and founder.When you are in your twenties, remember how adequate school food and housing was. While I did not want to permanently forgo any lifestyle improvements, I was happy to delay them. I didn't want anything better in school and in my twenties I was too busy starting a family and career to enjoy raising my standards. Just put off any luxuries.In my thirties, I have friends moving into leadership roles in various walks of life, so I am saving up a war chest to be able to deploy towards investing with and giving to people I actually know. I am deferring some of my political donations, philanthropic donations, and various categories of investments, so that when the time comes I can deploy my resources towards people I most know and trust.You don't even need to give up much of anything; you just need to save money and defer spending each decade. Spend like you're in your teens when you are in your twenties. Spend like you're in your twenties when you are in your thirties.You can't keep up with the Joneses, but the Joneses apparently just put a trillion dollars on their credit cards, so screw 'em. Who cares what they think?"
3553836,29391,2015-10-07T11:08:07-04:00,"American consumers have never been in heavier debt, go deeper while wages are stagnant.Any economic shock or unemployment would send bad debts soaring, and annihilate Capital One.Very limited upside, combined with highly leveraged balance sheet, make Cap One the one to short.","Image source: Available under a creative commons license from kb-a on flickr Capital One (NYSE:COF) has been riding the credit boom over the past 5 years. It took some heavy hitting back in the 2007-8 crisis, falling from almost $80/share to $19. Now in July 2015, it hit heights of $92. It has retraced since the summer after missing analyst's earnings expectations and currently trades around $72. The American consumer is one of the most highly leveraged in the world. And this puts COF in a very vulnerable position. According to CardHub the average household credit card balance is at $7,327. However, if you include the households that carry debt, their average debt is $15,706 according to NerdWallet as of June 2015. That represents a rise of 3.48% over the previous year. Meanwhile, total U.S. auto loans are up 11.2% Year on Year to over $1 Trillion now.American consumers are believing that the economy has recovered and are going on spending sprees. And this is great in the short term for lenders and consumers. But if and inevitably when the economy goes south, defaults will be high. And these charge-offs will hit Capital One hard.Competition in the lending market is very strong at the moment, squeezing margins. Credit Karma's statistics show auto loan rates falling from 6.5% a year ago to around 6% now. This squeezes all lenders.The lending market can also be very misleading during good times. The Sub-prime mortgage crisis showed us that lenders lend excessively to bad borrowers, at low rates, during good times because default rates are low. But when things start to reverse, people can't make payments, asset prices fall and the lenders are in trouble.Capital One's positionCapital One has an effective ""net worth"" of $46 billion. Compared to its market cap of $39 billion this is could be seen as cheap. However, there's an item in the balance sheet for goodwill and intangible assets of $15.2 billion. Nowhere in the earnings report is this explained. I presume this is how they value their technology infrastructure and loans they paid a premium for. (Please correct me if I'm wrong).But I wouldn't trust that figure. If things become like 2007/8 again, is the item of Goodwill going to be worth anything to a stockholder or someone acquiring assets? If you exclude the goodwill figure Capital One has a net worth of $31 billion and assets of $276 billion. (Source: most recent 10Q filing)Then breaking that asset figure down, here you go (there may be rounding errors):$87 billion of credit cards. Of which $76 billion are domestic U.S. cards. $40 billion of auto loans. $28 billion of home loans. $50 billion of commercial loans to real estate and companies. $63 billion of investment securities which are not explained in any more depth.The riskiest partAs for credit cards, these are the riskiest when the economy goes down. Although charge off rates are low as 3% in recent months. When the economy falls, charge offs can reach 11%. If that happened, Capital One would have to write off approximately $9 billion on cards. That would equate to a loss of a third of their balance sheet.Auto and home loans would be negatively impacted too if the economy fell. Inevitably the real estate loans and commercial loans would still struggle in a bad economy as well.The commercial loans that are turning sour tooWhat's toxic in COF's portfolio is it's taxi medallion loans. In the Q2 earnings call, it was said that there are ""under $1 billion"" in loans on taxi medallions. I've tried digging around for a more specific figure, but I couldn't find one. While a relatively small part of the portfolio, COF will be recording big losses on these loans.The value of taxi medallions has fallen significantly in recent years, and will only fall further as Uber expands and drops fares. COF is refusing to refinance taxi medallions too, as prices fall. This has brought about a lawsuit. It also risks a fire sale in taxi medallions as drivers can't find financing.They also have loans of $3.4 billion to oil and gas companies which are deteriorating in value as energy prices fall. Many companies are in financial difficulty. Capital One has had it's commercial loan non-performing loans triple (Source: 10Q) and I would expect this to increase while energy prices remain low.The limited upsideIf the economy holds steady for several more years, then Capital One might be able to keep making profits. However, I doubt that they will be able to grow any more in a saturated market without making loans that will become unprofitable in future.Capital One's stock is holding up quite well at the moment because it's turning a profit, default rates are low and it is a seemingly well-run company. But surely there is a limit to how much credit consumers can take on without imploding later on.Why I prefer shorting COF to other credit card firmsMy editor asked me to explain why I prefer shorting COF compared to other credit card firms, like Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA) or American Express (NYSE:AXP).The difference between COF and the last three companies are vast. Visa, Mastercard and AXP - aren't really credit card lenders. They're payment networks, moreover, they're global. They make their profits from transactions fees and having a secure trusted payment network. If the American economy slowed down, they'd still have high transaction volumes worldwide.COF on the other hand is a credit card lender. They hold the credit risk, with the majority of it with the U.S. consumer.American consumers are addicted to credit. Credit cards are completely unsecured and have no assets backing them up. Unlike their commercial lending, auto loans or home loans - there's little that they can repossess. And if the U.S. economy starts to slow down again - the losses on this lending will be catastrophic to Capital One.The catalystWhat will move COF is when the economy starts to slow down. Any signs of slower or falling growth, and slower job creation in the U.S. will start to move this stock downwards. I'm looking to build a short position in Capital One over the next few months. Although I don't expect the stock price to move very much from its current levels in the short term, I think there is potential for a substantial fall over the next few years."
3976938,101535,2016-05-23T01:21:40-04:00,Capital One provides credit cards and consumer & commercial banking.Capital One benefits two to three times more than the actual rate hike.Capital One trades below its book value and is one of the riskier financials at the moment.,"IntroductionAfter last week's hawkish statements from the Fed officials, the rate hikes are back in the picture. They mentioned that the market is not adequately pricing the possible rate hikes. If the data keeps improving, they could hike as early as in June. These statements and good inflation data (thanks to gas prices), lifted the financial stocks that have seriously underperformed. I'm already long Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and was looking for some other company that could benefit from these rate hikes. So I ended up looking closer to Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF). It's one of America's most recognized brands, and also one of the largest banks based on deposits. Headquartered in Delaware, Capital One operates primarily in California, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Louisiana, Maryland, Virginia and in the District of Columbia. It also does business in Canada and in the United Kingdom. In 2015, it had over 45,000 employees, total net revenue of $23.4 billion and net income of $4 billion or $7.07 per share. In Q1 2016, it had over $330 billion in assets and $300 billion of those assets earn interest for the company. The company's revenue comes 62% from credit cards, 26% from consumer banking, 11% from commercial banking and 1% from others.Source: Capital One Q1/16 reportFundamentals and credit qualityAfter going through the main numbers, it really shows how deeply this company is discounted from rest of the market. Unlike some of the big banks that have volatile trading revenue, Capital One's revenue has steadily climbed higher, while maintaining extremely efficient business, hence the efficiency ratio of 51.8%.Source: ReutersCapital One (like any other financial institution) is subject to strict regulations, which means it needs to get its dividend or buyback programs approved. After getting these approvals, Capital One has rewarded investors with large buybacks and increased its dividend significantly in recent years. The company isn't known for being a stable dividend payer, but the 23.3% payout ratio gives plenty of room to grow.Capital One's price to book ratio is 0.76 and price to tangible book is 1.13, both of which are clearly below the sector averages. The company is known to be good at leveraging the business and maintaining the best risk/reward ratio. What I can see in the quarterly and annual reports there really isn't a reason why the company should trade more than 20% below its book value.Source: Capital One Q1/16 ReportThe majority of the borrowers have good credit score, but large portion of the total loans are categorized as subprime, especially in the auto loans. Looking for growth, Capital One raised customers' spending limits and gave new cards, including people who have poor credit score. These efforts boosted card sales by 20% in the first quarter.Rate hike effectWhat I like about the rate hikes and Capital One is that the effects are double or even triple. The hikes will most likely be in 25 basis points and won't hurt the consumers or lower the consumption until the rates are clearly higher. One thing that is hard to estimate is the Fed's pace to hike since the U.S economic growth has seen seasonality.Source: Capital One Q1/16 ReportOutlookOutlook for credit card business remains stable and will most likely expand. Capital One estimates that in 2016 and 2017 the charge-off rate will be around four percent. It's slightly higher than 2015 and would suggest more aggressive growth efforts. Capital One's consumer banking is facing multiple headwinds at the moment. Low interest rates continue to pressure returns in the deposit businesses. Other negative effects are expected to come from the home and auto loans. On the other hand, commercial banking is expected to see good growth even if the oil & gas portfolio remains challenging.ConclusionsCapital One benefits from increasing consumer spending, rate hikes and economic growth. Investors who believe that the U.S economy keeps expanding and that the Fed needs to normalize monetary policy, Capital One would be a choice to consider. The company has clear downside risk if the economic situation softens and it reports it in a transparent way. At the moment, there isn't a clear catalyst for recession. Meanwhile, Capital One keeps on growing and returning value to shareholders."

        Capital One is a well managed and efficient operator.
        Capital One is likely to be a beneficiary of the changing banking landscape.","Several months ago I was talking to the portfolio manager of a small-to-mid-sized wealth management firm about Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF). He dismissed the idea immediately stating he did not want to own shares in a pure credit card company. However, it has been many years since COF was a pure credit card company. The company currently has three main businesses: Credit Cards, Consumer Banking, and Commercial Banking. The credit card business has operations in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Consumer banking consists of the deposit gathering functions and auto & home loan lending activities. Finally, commercial banking activities include deposit gathering, treasury management services, and lending to commercial real estate, industrial, and other commercial customers with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion. COF also has a small investment business that includes brokerage, wealth management, and insurance.According to Capital One's 2014 10-K the average balance for the card division was almost $79 billion, compared to $71 billion for consumer banking and $48 billion for commercial banking. This means that about 60% of loan assets are non-card related. Revenues and net income are still majority card-related as that business generated 61% of revenues (56% of income) with consumer banking earning 29% of revenues, (27% of income) and commercial banking 10% of revenues (15% income). With COF paying $8.5 billion to acquire General Electric Company's (NYSE:GE) healthcare-related loans and its Healthcare Financial Services business they will become even less dependent on credit cards. On a side note, COF only paid a 6% premium to par value of all the receivables. This would, at first glass, appear to be a decent price considering they purchased the Healthcare Financial Services business to go along with the loans. Finally, COF has increased their deposits from about 30% of total liabilities in 2004 to nearly 80% by 2014. Capital One has surely changed over the years.RisksSimilar to all banks COF is subject to regulatory, compliance, litigation, and security/cyber security risks. The banking industry is highly regulated and COF, in particular, could be impacted by credit/debit card regulations and interchange fees. The financial crisis has led to a slew of regulations both domestic and internationally that have negatively affected COF. For example, regulators have more power to control shareholder distributions through CCAR and they already modified interchange fees. The crisis also led to increased litigation which is just now starting to subside. However, in the second quarter COF added $78 million to their U.K. PPI reserve driven by complaint volumes declining more slowly than expected. This dampened financial results and should remind investors that litigation is a constant threat. FYI, PPI stands for Payment Protection Insurance which was sold to customers in the U.K. The customers who purchased PPI can seek compensation if they desire. Cybersecurity breaches can damage a banks reputation and generate lost business and potentially fines. This is another constant threat.The credit card market is becoming more competitive with special deals and higher rewards. Recently in the mail I have received offers from Capital One, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and American Express (NYSE:AXP) offering me to pay me a lump sum cash bonus to use their credit cards. As long as I met certain transaction amounts. I am sure many investors have taken notice as well. These offers also had increased reward benefits. COF offered 1.5% everywhere, BAC offered 2% on groceries and 3% on gas, and AXP offered 3% on groceries and 2% on gas. Also, I received a deal from Citigroup (NYSE:C) and while I can't remember the details it did include some decent rewards. COF mentioned in the Q2 2015 conference call that they were switching non-rewards clients to be rewards clients automatically and I have seen similar activity from Chase/ JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM). Discover and Chase also have 5% rewards from certain stores each quarter. Partially due to the ""growth math"" to acquire new customers COF expects their ""quarterly charge-off rate to be in the mid-to-high 3% range in the fourth quarter and higher from there in 2016."" For several quarters in a row COF management has discussed increased competition and increasing charge-off rates in the card business.The auto loans sector is also seeing strong competition. As stated on the last call, ""In the second quarter we observed increasingly aggressive underwriting practices by some of our competitors, particularly in subprime. We are losing some contracts to competitors who are making more aggressive underwriting choices."" Management also mentioned that used car prices were softening and that a decline in prices would put downward pressure on results. COF is already shrinking their mortgage book of business on the consumer side, so if this continues they may have to shrink their auto book as well.On the commercial side COF has a $3.4 billion portfolio of oil and gas loans (largest exposure is E&P and 2nd largest is oil field services). With oil & natural gas prices declining many of COF's clients are in financial difficulty which could lead to bad loans. COF also has less than a $1 billion in loans in their taxi medallion loan portfolio. Due to Uber and similar companies causing increased competition with taxi's this is putting downward pressure on the value of these loans. While $4.4 billion is not large, it is also not insignificant to COF.Finally, banks are cyclical and can be more negatively affected by the macro environment than other firms. During the financial crisis COF dropped from over $80/share in January 2007 to almost $12 in February 2009. The Capital One Warrants (COFWS) have greater risk to macro factors as they are a leveraged bet on COF; COFWS has much greater volatility than COF. Each warrant has an exercise price of about $42.10 and had a price of $31.70 on 09/30/15 while COF common stock was trading at $72.52. For every $1 the stock price moves the warrant is also likely to move by roughly $1. A $1 drop in COF stock price would create a 1.4% loss, but the warrants would drop over 3%. The warrants expire in November 2018 which makes them more susceptible to the forces of Mr. Market. Since they expire in three years Mr. Market could put a low value on COF at the time they expire which could magnify losses.Investment ThesisCapital One is a well run company with a long history of strong results. Richard Fairbanks is the Chair, CEO, President, and founder of Capital One. According to the last proxy statement he still owned 1.35% of the company's shares. Since their IPO in November 1994 the stock has returned 1,712.8% through year end 2014. COF is the 4th largest credit card issuer, has the 4th largest U.S. Auto loans book outstanding, is the 7th largest bank in total assets as of Q4 2014, and operates the largest online direct banking institution in the United States. Yet, their business model is less complex than the large money center banks as COF does not have the investment banking, trading, or other exposures that most of the other large banks do. During the financial crisis they barely lost money in 2008 and generated a positive return in 2009 when many other banks were generating large losses. COF generated a strong NIM of 6.56% in the second quarter, had a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under Basel III Standardized Approach of 12.1%, and produced an efficiency ratio of 54.63 adjusted for restructuring charges. Investors shouldn't ignore the restructuring charges, but the charges shouldn't be allocated to one quarter either. The company continues to grow. In Q2 2015 ending credit card loans were up 11% year-over-year, average credit card loans grew 9%, purchase volume on general purpose credit cards grew 20%, and card revenue increased 8%. In consumer banking revenue was up 2%, while in commercial revenues were up 8% and ending loan balances were up 6% year-over-year.When I look at banks I like to focus on the NIM, Return on Average Assets (ROAA), Return on Common Equity (ROE), Return on Tangible Common Equity (Tangible ROE), Efficiency ratio and net charge-off rate. Due to the card business COF has a very high NIM compared to peers. For example, Wells Fargo (WFS) is an exceptionally well run bank and had a NIM of 2.97% for the June end 2015 quarter compared to COF's 6.56%. I want to see an ROAA above 1% or the ability to improve the ROAA to over 1%; COF has consistently had an ROAA in excess of 1%. Wells Fargo had an efficiency ratio of 58.5% compared to an adjusted efficiency ratio of 54.63% for COF. I want to see an ROE of 10%+ which COF typically has accomplished, although WFC's is much higher. Finally, due to the card business the net charge-off rate is high compared to peers as Wells Fargo's charge-off rate was only 0.30% this past quarter compared to COF's 1.64%. Overall, the company has shown to be an efficient operator that generates good results.The company is set-up well to take advantage of digital opportunities as it has a strong internet presence. Consumers are moving more and more to digital. While Capital One does have physical branches across New York, Louisiana, Texas, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and District of Columbia their branches are minimal compared to competitors. Most of their offerings are web-based. The company is continuing to invest more in digital to maintain its lead. The low number of physical branches limits their exposure to a potential rapid change that could occur in banking, i.e. they would have limited branches to exit compared to peers.COF continues to diversify its business. As mentioned earlier they increased their exposure to the commercial market through their purchase of the GE healthcare finance business. In 2013, COF acquired Beech Street Capital, a privately-held, national originator and servicer of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA multifamily commercial real estate loans. This expanded their multifamily capabilities and product offerings. With the transaction they also acquired a mortgage servicing portfolio on approximately $10 billion of loans. Also in 2013, COF completed the sale of the Best Buy private label and co-branded credit card portfolio for $6.4 billion and reduced their credit card exposure. They expanded their credit card business into the U.K. in 2000 and have a Canadian credit card operation which broaden their exposure. Finally, COF had $21 billion in Auto Finance Originations in 2014 which increased their exposure to consumer banking.If you think the stock is undervalued, which I do, than share repurchases can add significant value. Capital One has a current market cap of about $39 billion and in the second quarter of 2015 was authorized to repurchase up to $3.125 billion of shares or about 8% of the companies shares at current prices. In the second quarter they repurchased about $626 million in stock which leaves an additional $2.5 billion to be purchased over the next three quarter including the one that just ended. This should help create value and increase the stock price which will benefit the COF warrant holders the most.Going forward rising interest rates could be beneficial for the consumer and commercial operations, in particular, which should see improved NIMs if this occurs. While they had non-recurring costs of $225 million in the quarter ($147 million related from restructuring expense) and expect a modest amount of incremental non-recurring charges later this year, the company is lowering its future cost profile which should start to benefit the company in 2016.CatalystsThere are a few catalysts that could increase the price of the stock and the warrants in the near term. First, if charge-offs and reserve build are lower than expected on the next call this would increase short-term profitability. Second, while the headwinds are known and priced into the stock (growth math, digital, regulatory, revenue pressures in auto and retail banking) many positives are being ignored. For example, in 2016 the efficiency ratio will likely benefit from recent card growth and cost moves. Once the CCAR is complete COF could see an increase in their ability to buy back shares which at current prices adds value and could increase the stock price. Finally, an upward move in interest rates could improve their NIM. If any of these occur investors may revalue the stock to what I think are more appropriate levels. Any increase in stock price will have a multiplier affect on the warrants.ValuationBelow is a simple valuation model to determine a rough estimate of what COF and COFWS are worth. I reduced COF's ROE to 8% over the next three years due to the current headwinds. I expect that they will payout about 2% of the 8% ROE in dividends which reduces Book Value Per Share (BVPS) growth to 6%. Warrants do not get paid the dividend, however, they receive an adjustment after the dividend goes above $1.50 per year. I have made an adjustment to add back the difference between the dividend paid and the $1.50 limit in the Warrant Cash Flows line. At the end of year three I assume a discount rate of 10% and ROE of 10% which generates a BVPS multiple of 1x. In other words, the stock price equals BVPS at the end of year three.To generate the IRR an investor has to pay for the stock today which creates the initial negative cash flow, COF pays a dividend which creates some positive cash flows in years 1-3, and then at the end of year three the stock or warrant is sold at the assumed price based off 1x BVPS. Based on this methodology, which I believe uses modest assumptions, the stock price generates almost a 13% IRR while the warrant generates almost a 22% IRR over three years. I find the 22% IRR very attractive.ConclusionThe headwinds and negatives in the stock are already well known which has caused the price to decline. With the price down almost 22% from its 52-week high the downside has been greatly reduced. Many investors are not acknowledging the positives and well-managed operations that Capital One possess. This, I believe, gives investors the opportunity to generate good returns on the stock and great returns with the warrants."
3235136,88536,2015-06-05T04:25:47-04:00,Capital One Financial is a buy with a diverse asset base and emphasis on returning shareholder value.Capital One trades at a discount in P/E and P/B against peers.Capital One yields 1.9% and instituted a $3.125B buyback program over the next 15 months.,"OverviewCapital One Financial Corp (NYSE:COF) is a diversified financial services company that operates in the Credit Services sub-industry. Capital One operates the largest online direct banking institution in the United States, which is good considering the future of banking is looking to be increasingly online. Headquartered in McLean, Virginia, the company operates in three main segments (percent of revenue 2014): Credit Card (61%), Consumer Banking (29%), and Commercial Banking (10%). It has a market cap of approximately $46B and recently raised its dividend to 1.9%.Over the past 12-months, the stock is up 6.4% excluding dividends, but has experienced a bit of a roller coaster seeing a low of $72.77 and a high of $85.68. Trading very close to its 52-week high, a detailed analysis can see if this is a possible good price for a long-term investment.For the analysis below, I'm using American Express (NYSE:AXP), Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) and Ally Financial (NYSE:ALLY) as Capital One's peer group. This list is not inclusive, but I chose them due to their similarities and relative sizes. All data is pulled from each company's latest 10-K or Yahoo Finance to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison. For latest Capital One, I will also pull data from the company's 10-Q.COF data by YChartsStock AnalysisChart data pulled from Yahoo Finance.From a stock price value perspective, I want to look at the P/E, P/B, and trends over time. Capital One trades at a P/E of 10.91x ttm earnings, versus a 5 year average of 9.3x earnings. Trading above the 5 year P/E average is not usually a good time to start an investment. Capital One trades at a P/B of 1.0, which is way below the peer average based on data from Yahoo Financial, in the table above. Over both P/E and P/B, Capital One is trading slightly lower versus AXP, SYF and DFS; but higher than ALLY. This quick look at its peers shows an undervalued for its sub-industry. As an investor looking for value, I view this as a decent entry point for a financial company. When I do not see a significant discount in the stock, I look to the fundamentals for either rock solid fundamentals or large earnings growth potential to justify the higher multiples or trends. I think Capital One scores on both points.Before tackling the performance metrics, Capital One pays a dividend of 1.91%, after a recent increase, and has a payout ratio of just 16%. The dividend is in family with its peers, which I view favorably as the company returns more shareholder value than some of their peers. The company's dividend growth has been inconsistent, but I believe the M&A activity from a few years ago will level out their income volatility to allow a higher payout ratio and still provide room to grow their core business. Over the last 15 months, the company has repurchased $2.5B in shares, including the purchase of 7.1M shares in Q1 2015. On 11 March, Capital one initiated another round of share repurchases to the tune of $3.125B over the next 15 months. This is a significant tailwind to help shares continue to push higher in the near-term, and a firm commitment from management to return value to shareholders.From the community, there are 22 analysts following Capital One with a mean 12-month price target of $92, which represents a 10%+ upside from the current price based on forward EPS, more income stability based on previous M&As, and the sizable efforts to return shareholder value. In addition, both S&P Capital IQ and Thompson Reuters rate this at their highest levels at the time of writing this. While I like to do my own analysis of a company, I like when the community has similar views to mine on a long play, where I'm not trying to time the market.FundamentalsChart data pulled from Yahoo Finance.The performance metrics are important for a bank. The most important in my opinion are the Net Interest Margin, Return on Equity and Return on Assets. While the numbers by themselves carry weight, digging into their value from the SEC fillings can tell you more about where the company is going. If one value is significantly higher or lower than the others, that should tell you.Net Interest Margin, or NIM, shows how efficient the company is with their investments versus debt; and I like to think of it as their management value. Capital One has a NIM of 6.67%. When compared to peers, the NIM is higher than AXP and ALLY, but lower than SYF and DFS. The large swing in NIM can be traced to the percentage of income that is linked to each kind of loan. Credit card loans have a much higher rate of return for companies than car loans or mortgages. From their latest 10-Q, credit cards make up almost 67% of DFS interest assets and 78% of SYF interest earning assets, which makes them risky for putting all their eggs into one basket. For COF, credit card loans make up 40%, Auto/Home loans make up 35% and commercial loans make up the other 25%. The company has a very balanced asset base that will make it less volatile to consumer spending swings, in my opinion. To ease the concerns a little further, the company has a deposit base of $181B at the end of 2014, which gives it a loan to deposit, or LTD, ratio of 110%, which is not an unreasonable ratio. I believe this makes COF the most balanced of the peer group, and thereby a lower risk investment for a more stable earnings growth going forward.Looking at the ROA and ROE across the peer group, you find that COF is lower than their peers, except for ALLY. This goes back to the proportion of total assets vs the yield that the company receives from those assets. More credit card loans means a larger ROA versus more mortgages can lead to a very low ROA. Capital One has a larger diversity in lower yielding assets, which make the company safer. This will lower the performance metrics to where it looks like a more traditional bank, which I value more. Increasing the percentage of loans with higher yields like credit cards will increase the ROA, but I would prefer a more conservatively run company with a diverse asset base that doesn't put all its eggs in one basket.Since 2013, earnings have increased 7.7% per year over the last 3 years and are expected to grow by 7.05% over the next 5 years. This is hugely favorable, in my opinion. A growing company has more flexibility to continue growing its generous programs to return income to shareholders. I'd prefer a larger dividend, but I'll take what I can get.One last note on the fundamentals, Capital One has done a great job building up its Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, which now stands at 12.46%. In addition, the net charge-offs rate has been declining since it hit 5.18% in 2010 to 1.72% today. I view this trend very favorably and it reflects their goal of increasing loan quality going forward.RisksIt's important to know that Capital One is highly dependent upon the ""financial"" health of the consumers. Credit cards and auto loans make up more than 50% of total loans, including more than 80% of the companies revenues. Any decline in consumer confidence or a rise in unemployment could bump the charge-off and delinquency rates to seriously affect the profitability of the bank. Any significant macro event would keep interest rates depressed for a long time, which could lead to additional NIM squeeze affecting the net income of the company.SummaryI believe the company is at an attractive value for a long-term investment. Being near its 52 week high is a small nit in an otherwise well run company. Earnings are expected to grow by 7% and the mean 12-month target price shows a 10% upswing before dividends. Key macro indicators to watch out for are employment trends, consumer credit and consumer confidence. If all of those continue to do well, Capital One should continue to be a buy going forward."
3972971,101246,2016-05-09T02:27:56-04:00,"The eighth-largest bank holding company in the U.S., available at a 25% discount to book value.It has highly diversified operations, carrying a 2.31% annual dividend yield.Downside risks remain, but the present valuation affords some margin of safety.","It's a credit card provider, no it's a bank, no it's an insurer! Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE: COF) is now all of those things and more.The former monoline, meaning almost all of its business was formerly in consumer credit cards, built up its presence in the late '90s primarily by catering to sub-prime consumers, and thereafter entering retail banking after the turn of the century with its 2005 purchase of Hibernia National Bank - which started a succession of takeovers that included ING Direct for $9 billion in 2012.All told, the bank holding company has come a long way in a relatively short period of time and is now the eighth-largest in the U.S. as of year-end 2015, with over $273 billion in total assets.Along with the many positives of great size such as unlimited access to capital, some of the very best talent in the world, and diversification also comes plenty of negatives to bear in mind which often afflict lumbering giants, such as:All of the above can mean a business's best days are behind it. But interestingly, whether by chance, design, or a bit of both, Capital One has at least managed to avoid some of these common pitfalls thus far.Notably, its original CEO after its spin-off from Signet Financial Corp. in 1994, Richard Fairbank, is still the company's chairman, president and CEO today and continues to hold a 1.42% beneficial ownership stake - significant, given the colossal size of the enterprise.Capital One has also admirably fought to stave off the death knell of officialdom and its associated evil twins, keeping its efficiency ratio in check at 55.51% despite the burdens of progressive regulatory compliance costs in the U.S. and abroad. In the same breath, it has visibly sought to innovate, as seen by the company's refurbishing of former ING Direct locations into non-traditional, cafe-style branches for its 360 brand as well as through its more recent investments in fintech.While the aforementioned are all decided positives for a company of Capital One's size and stature, they alone are not enough to elevate its business.But now consider the other side of the coin. What if Capital One or a business like it could be purchased at a valuation low enough so as to imply little to no growth expectations at all? Taking this thought a step further, what if a piece of such a business could be bought outright for less than its equity capital alone?Not only would such an opportunity, were it to exist, solve our growth forecast problem, it would also provide us with that all-important measure - margin of safety.Just such an opportunity is exactly what Mr. Market is affording intelligent investors at this time.Valuation*All figures in USD billionOf course, this is not to say a business's capital cannot deplete further, most especially in the case of one as highly levered as a financial institution. Far from it. But in this particular instance, Capital One has taken care to protect itself from just such an eventuality.It has done so by adequately reserving for both net charge-offs and non-performing loans to the tune of 119.46% and 90.97% respectively, diversifying its loan underwriting operations geographically across all 50 U.S. states and two countries (Canada and the U.K.), as well as segment-wise (credit card, consumer, commercial), with no single loan category making up more than 41% of its total loan portfolio.Why the low valuation?Despite all the positives already enumerated, any investor at all familiar with bank investing will immediately notice a few trouble spots upon opening Capital One's most recent 10-K.Notably, the fact is that the financial institution has both over-lent, with total outstanding loans exceeding total deposits by a small margin, and also slightly over-borrowed, with the $45.42 billion in currently outstanding debt on its balance sheet just eclipsing 20% of total deposits and inching up. Add to this the fact that consumer credit cards, which are a very volatile segment carrying tremendous downside during times of economic distress, still remain the single-largest component of Capital One's business, responsible for 62% of total net revenue in fiscal year 2015, and it becomes easy to see why some investors are opting to ignore the low absolute valuation.While some of the noted may already be factored into the company's present market value, even capital allocators with greater risk appetites should tread carefully and err on the side of caution in terms of position sizing, with the best fit for a Capital One stake perhaps being within a basket of other financial institutions also below book value as opposed to a standalone investment at this time.Supporting Documents"
3499096,89885,2015-09-10T13:01:42-04:00,"Total consumer credit has been on a consistent rise over the last four years, and for July increased by 6.7% on an annualized basis for a $19.1 billion.Total credit card debt rose by 5.7% on an annual basis in July which is still relatively strong.A name that has long caught my attention in the credit card space is Capital One Financial, and despite the market pullback, it's heavily beating its peers.The acquisition of GE's Healthcare Financial Services U.S. Lending Business will mean higher credit yields at lower costs for Capital One.","While seldom a market-moving report, the Federal Reserve's July Consumer Credit report points to an increasing willingness by American consumers to take on debt. Total consumer credit has been on a consistent rise over the last four years, and for the month of July increased by 6.7% on an annualized basis for a $19.1 billion gain over the prior month. This data was roughly in-line with economist expectations, right between the Dow Jones' expectation for $19.5 billion and Bloomberg's call for $18 billion in total added credit over the prior month.Interestingly enough, non-revolving credit increased by $14.8 billion in July after adding $19.5 billion in June. Student loan debt and auto loans are the biggest contributors to non-revolving credit and this could simply mean that less student loan debt is added during mid-summer. At the same time auto sales got a huge boost in July and the lighter month-to-month number here could also imply that more consumer are buying vehicles with money they already possess. The chart below demonstrates the rolling year-to-date changes to total revolving and non-revolving debt.While it is known student loan debt is on the rise, and the number should greatly increase in August, the bigger surprise came from revolving consumer credit - in particular, credit cards. Total credit card debt rose by 5.7% on an annual basis in July, which appears high at first but when you consider that total credit card debt rose by 10% on an annual basis in June it starts to look less impressive.Nevertheless, the majority of consumer spending is tied to credit card purchases and or the ability to take out loans for large items, like cars and boats, and the aforementioned data supports the notion that although consumer sentiment may be lower, they are still busting out the plastic for the majority of purchases.A name that has long caught my attention in the credit card space is Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF).Richard D. Fairbank and Nigel W. Morris began building the foundation for Capital One in 1988 under the umbrella of Signet Bank, based out of Richmond, Virginia. In the mid-1980s, Fairbank acknowledged what he believed was a missed opportunity by the credit card industry, and he called on Morris to help construct a more integrated and scientific approach to marketing bankcards. Together, their plan allowed companies to fine-tune card product and pricing strategies for individual customers through a decision-making structure by combining marketing, credit, risk, operations, and technology functions. Fairbank and Morris pitched the idea to more than 20 national retail banks before Signet signed on and gave them the means to develop this structure. The final corporation, Capital One Financial, was officially founded in 1993 and is currently headquartered in McLean, Virginia.Today, Capital One operates as the bank holding company for Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (COBNA); and Capital One, National Association (CONA) - all of which provide various financial products and services in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. The company operates in three segments: Credit Card, Consumer Banking, and Commercial Banking. However, the company is perhaps best known for its ingenious advertising of credit cards, but the creative use of technology helped make it one of the largest providers of MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) in the world.Capital One is among the most impressive companies in the credit card space. On July 23, 2015 the company reported its Q2-2015 earnings results, which unfortunately resulted in a heavy setback in optimism from Wall Street analysts. COF reported earnings per share of $1.78, which missed analyst expectations by $0.19. Revenues increased by 3.7% over the prior year to $5.67 billion but still fell short of consensus at $5.71 billion. The Street showed much grumbling following weaker expectations and started to forecast difficult profit margins for the company in 2016. However, COF management continues to surprise and in early August General Electric (NYSE:GE) announced that it would sell its Healthcare Financial Services U.S. Lending Business to COF for about $9.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015. This deal is attractive in many ways, not the least of which is that fact the healthcare loans have strong credit yields (of approximately 6%) and lower servicing costs compared to COF's current credit card portfolio.Additionally, the recent rise in GDP estimates for the back half of 2015, despite struggling industrial data, suggest that consumer spending may actually be stronger than some economists are forecasting. Despite being a relatively low-growth industry, COF still possesses a compounded annual growth rate of about 4.8% over the next five years, and despite the initial disappointment following earnings, EPS trends have been revised to the upside following the GE announcement. Relative to its peers, COF has managed to bounce off long-term support levels and remain in bullish territory. Over the last 52-weeks, COF shares have returned 14.3% while its peers Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS) returned 5.6% and American Express (NYSE:AXP) returned just 1.3%. Once the market stabilizes, COF should be able to re-test 52-week highs once again."

The company has increased its quarterly dividend by a third to $0.40 per share.Capital One has seen solid growth over the years through its financial prowess and effective portfolio expansion, which has enhanced its most profitable segments.","One of the largest banks in the U.S., Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF) has been an impressive performer as of late with its key business segments showing solid growth over the course of the last 4 years. The company's prowess in its credit cards business in particular has seen it grow in the previous years. Capital One has seen its revenues and earnings grow steadily over the last 4 years and is expected to continue to do so in the years to come. The company has engaged itself with portfolio expansions over the course of the last few years which have helped its business grow. Capital One's acquisition of the American banking operations of ING Direct boosted the company's consumer and commercial loans portfolio and added value to one of the company's key operating segments. Capital One has since seen interest income from consumer loans as well as commercial loans grow. Furthermore, Capital One also enhanced its portfolio by acquiring the credit card business of HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC). Capital One has since seen its credit card business grow immensely and become its highest revenue-generating segment and key value driver. The synergies from the acquisition led to a revenue boost as well as a savings impact which improved margins. Capital One has thus seen its margins and hence earnings grow over the course of the last few years. The company still holds massive strength in the financial sector and has massive growth prospects in store for investors.Potential Upsides For Financial Corp.Rising Interest RatesThe U.S. Federal Reserve Bank has ended its quantitative easing program, as the U.S. economy has continued to grow strongly over the years, showing signs recovery from the financial crisis of 2007. The U.S. economy is now about to enter a rising interest rate environment. Interest rates are expected to increase towards late 2015. Capital One is thus expected to witness an increase in overall income without having to expand the size of its operations as the growth in the market rate trickles down into the financial sector and leads to an increase in prime loan interest rates. Capital One thus has massive upsides in store for all of its key segments as a rise in interest rates increases revenues across the company's key credit card and loan segments. The revenue boosts from rising interest rates would add to margin growth as they are not accompanied by any expansion costs. There are upsides in store for Capital One's earnings too as a result.Capital Plan ApprovalCapital One managed to pass the Federal Reserve's stress test for banks, and thus, has had its comprehensive capital plan approved. The company is now set to return $4 billion in capital to its shareholders. The company has increased its quarterly dividend by a third to $0.40 per share. Capital One also plans to reduce its share count and add value to investors through a $3.1 billion share buyback program. Capital One's stock is thus likely to witness a boost, as both dividend seeking investors and capital gain seeking investors are likely to be rewarded. Moreover, the capital plan approval is not the only positive takeaway for investors from Capital One's success in the stress test. The company has exhibited its robustness in highly volatile economic conditions. The company is expected to ride out any future economic storms with relative comfort given its comprehensive capital program and the apt alignment of its portfolio. Capital One thus presents a robust investment prospect for long-term investors and assures the safety of their investment given its inherent robustness and financial prowess.Credit Card BusinessCapital One's credit card business now accounts for 58% of the company's total revenues and is expected to continue to grow in the years to come, as the demand for cashless payment solutions in the global market continues to increase. The use of non-cash payment mechanisms is becoming increasingly popular globally, and with the prevalence of high-speed Internet and mobile devices, the use of credit cards to make payments has grown immensely. Capital One is thus expected to continue to witness upsides for its key credit card business, and the company's growth will thus continue in the years to come.ConclusionCapital One has seen solid growth over the years through its financial prowess and effective portfolio expansion, which has enhanced its most profitable segments. The company is expected to continue to witness growth owing to continued organic prowess as well as upbeat market trends for all of its major business segments. Investors shall be highly rewarded with dividend growth as well as share repurchases in store. Capital One thus represents a highly worthwhile prospect for long-term as well as short-term investors, and buying into the company's stock would definitely be advisable."

The details of the offering are:The prospectus can be found here.The opinion on this new preferred will be based, in part, on how it compares to other preferred stocks of the company's peers. For this, the peer group will be Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). To begin, a look at core fundamentals of the peer group:The key takeaways from the above table (to me) are:Next, a look at Capital One's outstanding preferred stock:As the above table shows, the new issue is attractive relative to COF's outstanding series on a current yield and stripped yield (removing accrued from the price) basis.Finally, how does the new issue compare to the preferred stock of its peers:In my opinion, given the lower beta nature of the issuer (than, say, BAC or C), the profitability and the lack of significant legal/regulatory overhang, the new Capital One preferreds compare favorably to the peer group preferreds (this is not an exhaustive list of peer preferreds).Looking at it somewhat differently, from an interest rate risk perspective (compensation per unit of interest rate risk), the new preferreds are also attractive:Another way to view the value of the preferred is through looking at the yield advantage of the preferred stock over the common stock of the peer group (preferreds typically have a higher yield as they are not an ownership position in the company and therefore do not have the same capital appreciation potential):The new Capital One preferred compares favorably utilizing this basis as well (BAC and C have a greater preferred yield advantage due to their miniscule dividend on the common shares).Finally, a look at the common equity returns of the peer group over the last year can give an indication if something is possibly amiss and warrants a greater risk premium:COF data by YChartsCapital One's equity is in the upper end of peer returns and is, therefore, not sounding any alarms.Bottom Line: The new Capital One 6.70% Series D preferred stock is attractive relative to outstanding Capital One preferred stock as well as preferred stock of their peers. As a result, this new issue warrants consideration for income-focused portfolios.*** It must be noted that the fixed rate, perpetual maturity of the issue exposes investors to potentially significant changes in value in response to changes in rates."

The company has done well in Mr. Market's eyes over the last several years, and many who claim to be value investors will turn away as a result. But true value investors know that Mr. Market's behavior should not impact the investor's opinion about whether the company is undervalued. Rather, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how Capital One Financial fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham, and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation, in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.COF data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass all 6 of the following tests: Score = 4/6Enterprising Investor - Must pass all 3 of the following tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 3/3 Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - 6/30/2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryCOF Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:Defensive Investors, the most conservative level of ModernGraham style investing, may not be interested in Capital One Financial due to the unstable earnings and low earnings growth over the last ten years, but Enterprising Investors should be very interested. The company passes all of the investor types' requirements, and they should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.In recent years, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $3.20 in 2010 to an estimated $6.86 for 2014. This is an outstanding level of growth, which significantly outpaces the market's implied estimate of only 1.46%. In fact, the actual growth demonstrated by the company is greater than twenty percent. As a result of the strong growth demonstrated historically, the ModernGraham valuation model returns an estimate of intrinsic value well above the price, supporting a clear conclusion that the company is significantly undervalued. Enterprising Investors are therefore encouraged to proceed with further research to determine whether Capital One Financial is suitable for their own individual portfolios.Be sure to check out previous ModernGraham valuations of Capital One Financial for better perspective."

The company also signed a deal worth $9 billion with ING Direct USA.The company continues to showcase good management of expenses. Operating expenses have been steadily declining over the past few quarters.With the economic environment improving in the U.S., credit card business is likely to improve, resulting in improvements in top line growth.","Capital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) has managed to ink a deal with Hudson's Bay Company (OTCPK:HBAYF) for a credit card program for the latter. The arrangement makes Capital One the exclusive credit card issuer for Hudson with private and co-branded credit cards for the company's owned retailers which include OFF 5TH, Home Outfitters, and Saks Fifth Avenue.The deal that was recently signed is an agreement that is a win-win situation for both the companies since they are likely to benefit out of it. For Hudson, it means a better shopping experience for customers and a consistent shopping experience across all its owned retailers. Flexible payment options are likely to boost business for the company.For Capital One, the agreement is one that will possibly add a lot of value to the bank's business. Capital One has been on a run to expand its card portfolio for a while now, especially because the institution gains nearly 60% of its value from the business.To this end, the company has worked on developing several different products that are in line with customer needs in order to boost the issuances of its credit cards. Moreover, Capital One has also turned towards forming different partnerships with companies to strengthen its customer base. Earlier during the year, Capital One had made an announcement of extending its contract with Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) for its private label credit card program with the company. The extension of the agreement facilitated an increase in buying power for Kohl's customers. The initial deal signed in 2011, with an agreement for a period of seven years, allowed Capital One to gain about 20 million existing Kohl's Charge accounts.Capital One has been taking its business expansion rather seriously when it first made acquisitions for this purpose in 2012. The company completed two acquisitions at the beginning of 2012. Capital One signed a $31.3 billion acquisition of HSBC's (NYSE:HSBC) U.S. credit card business. The deal added $28 billion worth of credit card loans to Capital One's balance sheet back then. The company also signed a deal worth $9 billion with ING Direct USA. The ING purchase was able to add $80 billion worth of deposits to Capital One.These acquisitions were carried out with the intent of working in favor of Capital One, and they have managed to do so beautifully. The third quarter ended 2014 was just a highlight of the improving business model of the company. The company was able to raise its total revenue by 3% for the quarter to $5.6 billion. While non-interest expense saw no growth, it totaled to $3 billion. Net income for the quarter remained flat year on year as it amounted to $1.1 billion for the recently concluded quarter. Provision for credit losses saw an increase of 17% and amounted to $993 million. Diluted earnings per share rose by 2 cents over last year's EPS, and were announced at $1.86 per share.The credit card business of the company, which is the main earnings avenue for the bank, saw its net interest income decline over last year's earnings by nearly 5%. The net interest income amounted to $2.63 billion for the quarter. Total revenue declined by 3% and amounted to $3.47 billion. The net income from continuing operations, net of taxes, declined drastically by 10% during the quarter to $624 million.OutlookCapital One, taking into consideration its latest credit card agreement and latest financial release, seems to be performing fairly well in a market and is working its way up the ladder into becoming a popular name in the credit card business. By the end of the third quarter, the global credit card portfolio of the company was worth nearly $80.6 billion. Its credit card business has expanded on the back of two acquisitions conducted two years ago, and the company continues to showcase good management of expenses. Operating expenses have been steadily declining over the past few quarters.What is a concern for Capital One is the slowdown in its revenue generation. The improvements in the revenue generation of the company could partially be linked to the acquisitions conducted a couple of years ago. With new deals in place however, the concerns over a slowdown in revenue growth could probably be pacified in the near future.Capital One's stocks have been doing well in the market and have risen by nearly 7% in value year to date. The shares have seen a general upward trend in prices. The share currently trades around the $82 mark, which is close to the 52-week high of $85.39. The stock has also seen a 52-week low of $67.86. Analysts are optimistic about the bullish trend in share prices carrying forward into the next 12 months as they have predicted a price target of $92.26 per share. The shares trade at 11.30x their earnings, offering investors a 1.4% dividend yield.With the end to the quantitative easing program in the U.S. and an improvement in the economic environment, it is likely that consumer spending and its growth is likely to pick up in the future. With higher spending, credit card programs could be more in demand, boosting the consumer business segment of Capital One. With good deals such as the latest one with Hudson, Capital One is taking calculated steps about which companies to partner in, in order to tap into growth opportunities for its credit card business, which is likely to expand rapidly in the near term. The shares seem like a stable investment. The dividend yield may not be as attractive to investors at the moment, but the potential for share price increase could warrant an investment in this share."
2916066,24276,2015-02-14T13:02:06-05:00,"Costco has severed its card relationship with American Express.Costco cards represented 10% of AmEx cards outstanding, and 20% of the loan portfolio.The likely winners are Capital One, US Bancorp, and Costco itself.","In the wake of Costco's (NASDAQ:COST) decision to cut ties with American Express (NYSE:AXP), which had been its exclusive credit card supplier for 15 years, speculators have turned to Capital One (NYSE:COF).The reason: the bank and the warehouse chain are already doing business in Canada, where Costco gave Amex the boot a year ago.But before we see Samuel L. Jackson, Jennifer Garner, or some other Capital One spokesperson standing in a Costco asking, ""what's in your wallet"" (my money is on the lovely Mrs. Affleck) it is important to note what Capital One may be buying, and what it may be paying for the privilege.While some dismissed the loss of the deal because only 3% of AmEx sales were made at Costco, the co-branded cards still represented 10% of all AmEx cards in circulation and 20% of the loan portfolio. AmEx Costco cardholders used the cards for more than Costco purchases, attracted to simple rewards of up to 2% on Costco purchases, done in the form of a ""check"" redeemable on their next Costco visit.If Cardhub figures from 2013 are correct, this means Capital One could be acquiring 5.3 million new accounts with an average monthly spend of about $1,000 each. Costco did over $112 billion in business last year.But Costco is also known for driving a hard bargain with everyone. The ""discount"" AmEx charges most retail merchants is 2.89%, plus a 10 cent per transaction fee. AmEx also has a reputation for holding money for twice as long as other card networks before moving it to merchants. Presumably Costco demanded faster settlements, probably through its OnePoint offering with FirstData.The merchant deal American Express was giving Costco, however, was likely similar to what Costco is giving other merchants through Elavon, a merchant services company based in Atlanta owned by US Bancorp (NYSE:USB). That was a discount as low as 1.38%, plus 19 cents per card swipe, which is a little more than half of what even Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) merchants pay.Of course, there are two sides to every credit transaction, the merchant side and the client side. It's possible that Costco plans to run its merchant account through the US Bankcorp subsidiary, while having a larger entity like Capital One, which already has 6% of the consumer card market - triple USB's share - handle the load of issuing the cards and maintaining the relationships.And while no one has mentioned it, this may be what the smart money thinks as well, because USB jumped 2% yesterday, and is up more than 10% from its January lows. If you want to speculate on where Costco is heading, and get in on its action, buy both USB and COF. The latter is a bargain anyway, with a 10.5 Price/Earnings multiple and 30 cent/share dividend yielding 1.5%. USB will cost you more, 14.6 times earnings, but you get a 25 cent dividend yielding 2.17%, which is better than you'll get on a 10-year U.S. bond.The big winner in all this, of course, is bound to be Costco, whose stock has zoomed almost 30% in the last year and just announced a special $5/share dividend. Guess which is in my wallet?"
2429195,52262,2014-08-18T16:00:00-04:00,"While I like COF's overall strategy, macroeconomic challenges are holding back the stock and this looks likely to continue.
        The company's focus on consumers in its loan book makes it less exposed to the gradual upward turn in business borrowing that seems to be taking place.
        Credit quality at COF is very good and valuation is reasonable, but until the firm starts showing definite signs of significant revenue growth, the stock may be stuck in neutral.","Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) is probably best known by consumers for their often hilarious credit card commercials, but the ~$45B market cap company actually offers a pretty wide array of consumer and commercial lending services. The company is today about the sixth largest depository institution in the US with ~$200B in loans as of CYE 2013. The firm's acquisition of the US ING Direct business made it a real player in the loan space by bolstering its ability to use low cost depositor funding to make loans. Capital One seems to be targeting a select well-off care-free group of US consumers who are more likely to spend money even if they also pay their credit cards off regularly. While credit cards companies always make a pile of profit off consumers who carry balances, consumers who spend a lot on their cards but pay the cards off, can also be profitable thanks to the fees merchants must pay to accept credit cards.I like Capital One's strategy and I think it makes a lot of sense in an era when many US consumers are still very debt shy and have probably permanently altered their spending habits in the wake of the Great Recession. At this point then, as consumer confidence and employment rolls increase, consumers may or may not begin to borrow again. And therein lies the fundamental problem for Capital One. The stock is not particularly expensive right now trading at roughly 10-11X this year's expected earnings (~$7.50). But revenues have been fairly weak the last few quarters and EPS numbers have been coming in basically flat YOY. In light of that, it makes sense that Capital One remains a ""show me"" stock for many investors. And until the firm can demonstrate real earnings growth power, it is simply not going to be able to command a premium multiple.Capital One has been all over the board over the last few years but the ING Direct acquisition in early 2012 and then the purchase of HSBC's card portfolio in mid-2012 really bulked up the firm. Between those events and then the sale of the Best Buy card portfolio in 3Q2013, COF has gone through a lot of changes and so getting a bead on earnings trends is not easy. (Which granted partially explains the weak YOY results in Q1 and Q2 of this year.) Given that, I am hoping that investors will start to see more stability and consistent growth in earnings, as well as a more shareholder-friendly capital returns policy.This significant mixing of the firms core operations also leads to a little bit of difficulty in assessing the underlying credit trends for the firm. It is clear that in 2013, Capital One has very low charge-offs and delinquency rates by any reasonable standard. It will be difficult for the firm to keep that up over the long-run, but the improving economy and COF's focus on finding a specific type of consumer should make it more feasible than it would be otherwise. All that said, when I run through the numbers, I see EPS of maybe $7.55 per share this year. That compares with $7.35 in 2013. Of course as I already mentioned, that year included the Best Buy portfolio deal so it certainly creates comparison issues. At the same time though, I'm not sure given Capital One's size, how the firm is going to move the needle a lot of EPS in the future. Even under somewhat optimistic assumptions about economic growth and spending, I am hard-pressed to see EPS of more than say $7.85 in 2015. While any growth is good growth, 4% EPS growth YOY would hardly be something to get excited about.Capital One's loan book is about 80% consumer with about 40% of total loans in the form of credit card receivables. (20% home loans, 15% auto loans, and 25% commercial loans). The company has pretty minimal international exposure (~5% of loans in the form of credit cards in the UK and Canada), so the firm's story is really a US story. COF's Beech Street acquisition announced last August will help the firm to bulk up its government-backed mortgage origination business and generally grow its commercial business as a whole. The acquisition is a good idea in my view, and I certainly applaud COF's efforts to diversify and enter attractive new markets, but given the miserable state of home buyers in this country and the awfully thin net interest margins, I don't see this having a material effect on the firm's profits in the near future.I'm also unclear on the strategic efficiencies that Capital One is gaining through its expanding loan product set. Other firms, notably Discover (NYSE:DFS) seem to have a more integrated approach to expansion than Capital One does. I'm confident that management knows what it's doing, after all the company has done very well over the last couple of decades, but I also know that being in the credit card business and the banking business are two very different things. Capital One is a great credit card company, and it runs a great ship there (what else can you say about a company that is bringing in charge-offs of 1.67% in the latest quarter). But banking is very different and the competition is fierce. With the credit card market in the US fairly saturated and the US consumer still woozy after the Recession, Capital One needs new sources of profit growth. The firm has ideas on how to get that growth, but until those ideas start to bear fruit, I'm concerned the stock may be stuck in neutral.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

I've been long the warrants (NYSE:COF.W) since last year, and believe this pullback represents a good buying opportunity for either the stock or the warrants. My key takeaways from earnings and ensuing market reaction were:*Bonus round: For those readers who are interested and would like to follow along, here's my methodology. I used the P/BV - ROE relationship laid out on this page by renowned valuation professor Aswath Damodaran. Caveat emptor about textbook formulas, of course, and there are other ways to skin the cat, but this is just for demonstration.The basic relationship is P/BV = [ROE - g]/[r-g]. For ease of writing, we will call P/BV ""m"" for multiple. Some basic algebraic rearrangement yields g = [m(r) - ROE] / [m - 1]. Depending how you do it, you might introduce a negative in both the numerator and denominator to get [ROE - m(r)]/[1-m] but you can convince yourself that they're mathematically equivalent because the negatives cancel out. If this looks scary, I promise it's nothing a bright 8th-grader couldn't do. See below (although I wrote out ""P/BV"" as PBV - don't get confused.)Well, we have all the variables here - in this case I'm using tangible book instead of accounting book - so if you take the TTM avg of 15.8% RoTCE, current multiple of 1.56x, and an r of 10%, you find that the current market price implies Capital One will shrink at 0.45%/yr.A quick sensitivity analysis demonstrates the implied growth if you want to use a higher or lower r or RoTCE:All in all, it doesn't take a genius to realize that a 10.5X P/E doesn't bake in any exceptional demands, but sometimes it's nice to think through what exactly the market is expecting and how realistic that is based on historical precedent and understanding of the business model. My view is that Capital One will not, in fact, shrink by 0.5%/yr, and therefore the current price is too low.This is also a nice illustration of the fact that models don't have to be very complex to be useful - this one took me 20 minutes, including the time it took to write this explanation out. Contrary to what most of my friends think, I actually don't spend a ton of time in Excel, and I don't think my very successful PM has built a model in 20 years. Precision is not accuracy; you can gain a fantastic understanding of the business and your range of potential returns without spending days on a model incorporating every possible variable."

The positioned were established based on the conditional premises and rules that govern The Stock of the Week Strategy.However, it continues to be our opinion that the EPS growth rates for COF both on a quarterly and yearly basis are slowing enough to make the current P/E multiple look rich.On a fundamental basis, COF trades with a current PEG ratio over 2, and although the P/E ratio is only 11, which does not appear high when compared to the market, the P/E ratio for COF was near 5 in 2011 and that tells us that the stock can fall much more.Our observations suggest that risk is there, and if COF fails to grow more rapidly, in other words, if it stays on its current course, simple multiple contractions can cause the stock to fall.The recommendation to take profits was a trading decision, in line with the Stock of the Week Strategy, but the fundamentals support a cautious approach to anyone holding COF as a long position at this time."
2272003,39011,2014-06-17T06:36:31-04:00,"Income investors can receive a very nice income stream from Capital One's newest issue.With the stock market yielding around 2%, this issue triples the market.Capital One is a very strong, stable issuer, making this attractive.","Investors in large banks stocks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) have had a tough go of it this year. Dividends are hard to come by, and capital gains have been equally elusive. However, there are alternatives if you want exposure to large banks but want a steady income stream, as opposed to the thrill-a-minute, income-starved common stock. In this article, we'll take a quick look at one of those alternatives, Capital One's (NYSE:COF) newest preferred issue.The Series C is a new preferred that offers investors exposure to the financial giant without the inherent risk of owning common stock or the company's below-market dividend. The Series C is a perpetual preferred, meaning it has no stated maturity date. However, COF has the option to redeem the Series C at any time after September 2019, or just over five years from now. Whether COF will redeem the Series C is anyone's guess, but as long as you don't pay more than the issue price, it can only mean you're getting your money back and more. In the mean time, you'd collect dividends for five years.Speaking of the price, the Series C was issued at $25, and sports an annual dividend of $1.56. This is good for a coupon yield of 6.25%, admittedly on the low end of preferred yields, but given the strength and stability of the issuer, you'd expect the yield to be lower. Since trading began, the Series C has drifted down a bit $24.45, bumping the current yield to 6.4%. This would represent the principal risk to owning the Series C; higher interest rates could sink the price of this and other preferred issues, meaning capital losses could become significant over time. I see default risk as virtually zero, so the only way to lose money on this issue is if rates shoot higher. If you're a preferred investor, you've got to learn to live with that.Unfortunately, the Series C, like virtually any other bank preferred, isn't cumulative. That means COF could potentially stop paying dividends on the Series C, and would not be obligated to make them up. Cumulative dividends are a very nice backstop for income investors, but with COF, the risk of repayment default is pretty much nothing. Some investors won't take on preferreds that aren't cumulative, but in this case, with a very strong issuer, I believe that may be a bit short-sighted.A positive characteristic of the Series C is that it is eligible for the preferential dividend tax treatment. This means that investors can hold the Series C in a taxable account, and the consequences are likely to be muted. REIT preferreds, for example, aren't eligible for the favorable dividend tax treatment, and this can hinder the ability of certain investors to hold preferreds in a taxable account. However, the Series C could be a good option for retirees who need the money coming from a taxable source. Either way, this is a huge positive.There are plenty of preferreds that have much higher yields than the Series C, but I still like it for certain investors. Those who want a steady income stream that is still triple the S&P 500's yield from a very strong issuer can do much worse than COF's Series C. The favorable tax treatment is icing on the cake, providing flexibility to both taxable and retirement account investors alike. If you need a nice source of income for years to come and you want a very low-risk issue, take a hard look at the Series C from Capital One.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

        Shares have sold off by 6% since the beginning of January, on no apparent news.
        The current environment is favorable for Capital One; shares are undervalued and warrants even more so.","Capital One (NYSE:COF) has stood out to me for a while as an undervalued, well-positioned, well-managed bank. While the discount has never been great enough for the common shares to meet my quite demanding hurdle rate, I've been a fan of the warrants, as they continue to trade with essentially no time premium (likely due to lack of enough liquidity for institutional buyers).The recent sell-off once again brings the warrants (COF/WS) to a very attractive level, so I bought some more this morning. As a quick review of valuation, the stock is currently trading inexpensively - just below book, and 10.5x earnings - both of which seem too low given Capital One's growth prospects and dramatically improved credit quality relative to its historical focus. Growth in recent years has been hampered in recent years by intentional run-off of higher-risk acquired portfolios, but the company's strong position in digital banking and other areas should result in a return to growth over the next 2-3 years.A basic RoTCE model suggests the current price implies slightly negative growth; fair value today appears to be in the mid-to-high $80s with no credit for potential future improvements in RoTCE (driven by cost efficiencies or NIM expansion) or a higher-than-GDP growth rate.The recent sell-off highlights an idea I've been working through for a while: the complete mis-definition of volatility by most market participants. Volatility is often viewed as risk; it is, in fact, the only way finance academics can define risk. That's never made much sense to me. For a long-term investor, volatility is not risk - it's opportunity. When the market gets a little too depressed and takes shares too low, it provides a nice opportunity to add to the position and enhance expected IRR; when the market gets a little too excited, it provides an opportunity to trim exposure and lock in a higher IRR as well.The sell-off also highlights how index-driven buying and selling can cause specific securities to dramatically underperform or outperform in the short term without regard for fundamentals. A lot of selling recently is due to commodity prices, both directly and indirectly - whether active or passive, funds that are facing redemptions (or need to maintain certain allocations) may be forced to sell certain stocks without regard for their actual prospects.In the case of Capital One, the recent decline in oil prices is at worst a non-event and at best a tailwind. While it's hard to make quantitative predictions, it's important to consider their main lines of business. Capital One is involved in energy lending, but not to such an extent that an E&P slowdown would be a significant headwind to results. On the other hand, home loans, auto, and card make up the vast majority of their loan book. As I've discussed in previous articles, it should be noted that one of the major negatives facing Capital One's business is an expected deterioration in auto credit quality from historically high levels. One would think that cheaper gas means, at least in the short-term, that consumers' ability to make car payments increases - i.e. credit quality actually improves!On the loan volume side, lower commodity prices are also a plus. The drop in gasoline prices has already spurred demand of lower-mileage (and higher-cost) trucks and SUVs, which, if it lasts, would be an incremental positive for auto loan growth. Consumers who feel wealthier are also more likely to finance big-ticket purchases with their credit cards. It's true that they probably bought gas on the same credit cards, but this again works out to a neutral-to-positive scenario.In summary, a quick review of the expected effects of lower oil prices suggest that Capital One will be either the same or better off - yet shares are down three times as much as the index. Does that make any sense?It doesn't to me. It certainly doesn't take heroic assumptions to believe Capital One can generate $9 - $9.50 of earnings by 2018 (when the warrants expire). Both an earnings and RoTCE-based valuation suggest a price at or above $100; this implies a (minimum) high-teens IRR on a purchase of the warrants at the current price. Downside appears limited by the lack of time premium, high earnings yield, and shareholder-friendly buyback policy."

        Next we'll attempt to assign a reasonable forward valuation of Capitol One common stock through 2018.
        Lastly, we'll compare the returns of the warrants relative to the returns of the common stock.","Warrant TermsCapital One Financial Corporation (NYSE:COF) has one outstanding issue of warrants that represent the right to purchase 12.66 million shares of common stock, or about 2.25% of shares outstanding. Below is a summary of important warrant features.In any quarter where the dividend payout exceeds the respective threshold, the strike price will be adjusted downward in accordance with the following formula:Additionally, in the case where the quarterly dividend exceeds the dividend threshold, the number of shares purchasable per warrant increases:Capital One currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.30, so the company is still well below the dividend adjustment threshold amount. So far there have been no adjustments made to the strike price or the number of shares purchasable per warrant.Common StockTo put a value on Capital One common stock, I'll consider a few things: 1) The company's equity growth rate. 2) The market's valuation of the company's equity. 3) Quarterly dividend payouts.1) For equity, we'll be taking a look at the company's book value per share, which the company has been growing at a compound annual rate of 6.76% over the past 5 years. On a quarterly basis, that would make for a 1.65% growth rate. We'll maintain a more conservative outlook by using a 1.25% quarterly book value growth rate.2) The company currently trades at a 1.07x P/B multiple, which is still below its pre-recession levels of around 1.5x. For this analysis, we'll assume that the market assigns Capital One a 1.24x multiple by the time of expiration. We'll account for this by increasing the P/B multiple by 0.01 points each quarter.3) For dividends, we'll assume that the company maintains its $0.30 quarterly payout through the end of 2014, which then increases $0.03 per quarter at the beginning of each new year.Assuming all of the above hold true, the common stock returns relative to book value would look like this:Including dividends, the common stock would return 43.5% over 4.186 years, or about 8.9% annually. To me, those are decent returns; but if you want to gain exposure to Capital One, the warrants offer great leverage so that you can maximize your returns.Warrant Returns Relative To CommonUnder the assumptions that we've made, the intrinsic value of the warrants would be $76.47. Additionally, the number of shares purchasable per warrant would increase from 1 to 1.00214, and the strike price would be reduced $0.09 to $42.04. Those are paltry adjustments, but keep in mind that Capital One could raise their quarterly dividend at a more aggressive rate than we estimated, and the actual adjustments could result in more significant adjustments. At today's warrant price of $40.86, an appreciation in the intrinsic value of the warrant would make for a solid 88% gain, or 16.3% annually. Below you can see how the common stock returns compare to those of the warrants.Final ThoughtsCompared to other TARP warrants, the Capital One issue doesn't seem to offer the most upside potential, and for that reason I'll park my money in other TARP issues. However, if you are long Capital One and are more bullish on its future prospects than my estimates portray, these warrants offer excellent leveraged exposure to the stock, and at practically no premium."

Your requests help me prioritize which companies receive attention.Environmental, Social & Governance Research. The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) designed the graph below. SASB is working on industry-by-industry ESG accounting standards to guide corporate ESG disclosures in filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SASB has recently released a provisional standard for the financial sector and the commercial banking group, which can be downloaded here. The graphic below provides an overview of the universe of ESG issues that might impact a company or industry. A growing number of investors are examining a public company’s ESG performance data to make more informed investment and business decisions. This growth complements Ocean Tomo’s primary finding in their Intangible Asset Market Value Study: in 1975, the market value of S&P 500 companies represented about 80% tangible assets and 20% intangible assets. In 2005, that flipped. Now, the market value of the S&P 500 is about 20% tangible assets, and 80% intangible assets. Ocean Tomo also found that a significant portion of the intangible asset value gap is attributable to patents and innovation.ESG performance disclosures also serve as proxies to address the “value gap” -- by highlighting risks and opportunities related to material environmental, social and governance issues for specific companies and/or industrial sectors.Analysis of COF’s 2013 ESG performance. The data in Table 1 shows Capital One’s 2013 ESG performance data, which the company released earlier this year. ESG Disclosure Scores (Column 2) range between 0 (no disclosure) and 100 (full disclosure). Capital One’s ESG disclosure score of 25 is below the group average of 31. The Average ESG performance data shown in Table 1 is a based on Bloomberg’s selection of 24 peers for Capital One. Table 1: A Snapshot of Capital One’s 2013 ESG Performance  Source for Table 1: Bloomberg Professional Finance and ESG Platform June 9, 2014The commercial banking industry group, as a whole, leads other industries in terms of disclosing ESG metrics. This is likely attributable to the banks' desire to rehabilitate their reputation by being more accountable and transparent after the financial crisis. However, in Capital One’s case, ESG disclosure scores have been essentially flat since 2007, except for a one-time score increase to 36 in 2011, which evaporated the following year.Table 2: Capital One’s ESG Disclosure Score Trend for the Years 2007 -2012Source for Table 2: Bloomberg Professional Finance and ESG Platform June 9, 2014The environmental footprint of a global commercial bank is of value to capital markets because it relates to operational costs. Columns 3, 4 and 5 of Table 1 show Capital One’s energy, water and greenhouse gas intensity ratios as a percentage of sales. COF’s Energy Intensity, calculated as megawatt hours of energy consumed per million of sales revenue in the company's reporting currency, is well below the group average. This is also true of Capital One’s Greenhouse Gas Intensity as a % of Sales.A good question for Capital One is how did it achieve these low intensity numbers? Was there a deliberate attempt to address operational efficiency throughout the COF enterprise and, if so, what was accomplished? Capital One has not yet disclosed total water usage or its annual financial investment in operational sustainability (Column 6). So another good question for Capital One might be whether it has a budget for operational sustainability?Capital One’s social performance in disclosing key metrics also has disclosure gaps. The company has not disclosed the percentage of women in its workforce or in management. However, Capital One has disclosed that 20% of its directors are women, and 90% of its directors are independent. Lastly, Capital One did not disclose its community investment metric, and the group average for community investment is $81M.Good follow up questions for Capital One include what are (1) what is Capital One’s business strategy to attract the best and brightest employees to its organization, and (2) what role does Capital One have in supporting the communities where it operates?Finally, SASB issued a provisional ESG accounting standard for the financial sector in February 2014.Investors should expect further development of ESG disclosures by commercial banks in the near future because of the SASB provisional standard, which identifies these additional material issues for the commercial banking industry group: Lesson: Public companies (and the private companies who do business with them) need to recognize that best practices for sustainability disclosures include standard ESG aggregate data like what is presented above. When companies in an industrial sector first disclose sustainability performance, aggregate ESG scores reflect the level of disclosure. Once ESG disclosures are mature for an industry sector, intensity and productivity metrics can be calculated as proxies for operational and management efficiency. Companies that do not disclose ESG data at all risk being eliminated in a competitive situation because of the appearance of risk and lack of transparency and accountability. For a more detailed explanation of ESG data as a game-changer, read this white paper.Where does this data come from?

In the fourth quarter Capital One's consumer and commercial banking units generated more than 40% of the company net interest income and revenue.While the credit card business is still doing much of the heavy lifting, Capital One merits a fresh look as a hybrid of a credit-services company and a good old-fashioned bank. In a recent presentation to institutional investors, Capital One tossed up a PowerPoint slide noting it is now the sixth largest bank in the U.S. with the caption, ""Scale without the size or complexity"", a clear reference to the likes of JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C).Stacked up against the banks, Capital One looks a bit more competitive, using return on assets as a gauge:COF Return on Assets (TTM) data by YChartsIt's the banking prospects of Capital One that interests the management team at the $52 billion Dodge & Cox Stock fund. The Dodge and Cox approach is not just value, but very patient value; the team focuses on the three to five year investment horizon. That's years, not quarters. Over the long-term that's delivered for shareholders, as the fund's 9%+ annualized return over the past 15 years is more than 4% ahead of the S&P 500.At 4% of assets, Capital One is the largest position in Dodge & Cox Stock fund. And Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is the third largest holding at 3.7% of assets (Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) is wedged in between Capital One and Wells Fargo.)The Dodge & Cox managers have been invested in Capital One for more than a decade. Though they didn't add to the position in the fourth quarter, they did devote a chunk of their shareholder letter to explaining why they continue to own Capital One, despite its somewhat sluggish performance over the past few years.At the time of the shareholder letter Capital One was trading at a forward PE ratio of 11. While giving a nod to the possibility that more reform out of Washington could hurt the sector, the Dodge & Cox team concluded that at 11x forward earnings, Capital One remains ""an attractive long-term investment opportunity.""

But Oakmark Global Select increased its share count in Capital One by 17% in the fourth quarter; the stock now accounts for 4.5% of the concentrated portfolio's assets. With their long-term focus, it will be interesting to see if Capital One's stock slide of more than 10% in the wake of its disappointing Q4 release in mid- January spurred the managers to add more.

Many investors may simply decide to throw out the worst years with the rationale that they are outliers that shouldn't be considered when evaluating the company's prospects, but doing so would involve speculation. We don't know whether the financial crisis will happen again, but we do know that if it does, we can expect to see similar results as we did before. By continuing to require the same standards for the historical period, Intelligent Investors are able to widdle down banks to only those with the best financial position, and then they are able to determine an intrinsic value to get a sense of whether the company is a good investment. In addition, a company must have strong financial statements to prove that it is stable enough for Intelligent Investors. This is best done by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries. What follows is a specific look at how Capital One (NYSE:COF) fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.COF data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass all 6 of the following tests: Score = 5/6Enterprising Investor - must pass all 3 of the following tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 3/3Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - 12/31/2013Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryCOF Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:Capital One Financial is a great company for Enterprising Investors to look at in more detail, but it does not quite qualify for the Defensive Investor because it has not shown sufficient growth in its earnings over the ten-year historical period. That said, the company passes all of the requirements of the Enterprising Investor. As a result, Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach based on Benjamin Graham's methods should feel very comfortable proceeding with further research into the company and comparing it to competitors. From a valuation side of things, the company appears to be significantly undervalued after growing its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $3.14 in 2009 to $6.56 for 2013. This solid level of demonstrated growth surpasses the market's implied estimate of 1.39% earnings growth and leads the ModernGraham valuation model to return an estimate of intrinsic value that is well above the market price.Disclaimer: The author did not hold a position in Capital One Financial (COF) or any of the other companies listed in this article at the time of publication and had no intention of changing that position within the next 72 hours."
1801912,56112,2013-11-05T11:30:00-05:00,,"Executive SummaryCapital One's low valuation belies its well-capitalized balance sheet and strong earnings. Sweetening the deal, its TARP warrants trade at a negligible (~6%) time premium despite a November 2018 expiry (five years out, or ~1.2% time premium per year). In the base-case scenario, these offer 20%+ compounded annual returns from now until 2018 (total of 160% upside over 5 years); multiple tailwinds and opportunities could lead to materially higher returns. The company's low valuation and the warrants' negligible premium means that even in the ""downside"" scenario, returns are likely to be in-line with historical equity returns (7-8%/yr), thus presenting an asymmetric risk-reward for investors with a long time horizon. Adjustment provisions magnify the leverage inherent in the warrants, providing the potential for home-run returns in a blue-sky scenario.ValuationTypically, I start with qualitative analysis then hit valuation, but this time I'm doing it in reverse. Why? This is a stock I started looking at because it was cheap, and the warrants are even cheaper (when you consider that you're getting free leverage with very limited downside risk long-term). Also, since this is a fairly large and well-known company (though not very talked-about on SA - no focus articles since May), I'm going to assume that everyone knows what Capital One does - credit cards, auto finance, commercial banking, consumer banking (leader in direct/online, branch-lite presence in key markets). I'll discuss the various factors that will impact growth for these businesses going forward, but growth is actually a secondary concern here - with an earnings yield of 10%+, Capital One doesn't have to grow much to deliver good returns, especially not to warrantholders.Before I actually discuss valuation, I'd like to touch on capitalization. I don't care how cheap a bank is if it's not well capitalized. Fortunately, Capital One (NYSE:COF) is indeed well capitalized, as the slides below illustrate. Not only is it in good shape now, but its continued capital generation has allowed and will allow it to continue to strengthen its position to meet regulatory demands.Now to valuation. First off, it's earning $7 a share; it doesn't take much analysis to realize that a 10 P/E is hardly aggressive. However, given the line of business it operates in, it's probably never going to see a stratospheric multiple. Looking at it on a price/book and price/tangible book basis, it's also quite cheap - currently trading at 0.98x book and 1.62x tangible book by my calculations. For a quick comparison, it traded at 2.5-2.6x tangible book pre-financial crisis. Their business mix is different now and so is the world, so it's not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison, but I think some multiple expansion (to 1.2x book and/or 2.0x tangible book) is likely over the next five years as financials slowly lose their black sheep status. (I know plenty of investors who still won't touch them.)The key to understanding Capital One is seeing how capital-generative its business model is, and how quickly that delivers shareholder value even in the absence of gangbusters growth. It recently raised its dividend to a respectable 30 cents, and will be buying back a substantial number of shares with the proceeds from its sale of the Best Buy portfolio. Shareholder return, via both dividend and buyback, is an important part of management's shareholder value strategy, as evidenced by the number of times it's made mention of it in various conference calls and conference presentations. What doesn't go to shareholders drops directly to tangible book, as you can see in the image below.The model is really quite simple: I take its current balance sheet and simply project out five years' worth of retained earnings (assuming it keeps 50% of $4B/yr in net income). I then multiply final-year numbers by the multiples I just mentioned. I also assume they use ~12.5% of net income for buyback activity, at an average price of $78 per share.As for the warrants (COF.W): the strike price is $42.13. They're currently trading at a bit under ~$30 at the ask (may have changed by the time you read this). I used $30 in the model, so actual returns if you can pick them up at below $30 will be higher. Anyway, add up the strike and ask and you get $72-$73; the implied time premium over the current market price of COF is a negligible 5% or so. This (plus the illiquidity/somewhat wide spread of the warrants, which likely scares off most institutional/professional investors) was what initially drew my eye to them.So here we go:It's a pretty compelling opportunity. In a scenario where Capital One somehow managed to not earn any money for the next five years, a little bit of multiple expansion still goes a long way in creating returns. Because of how capital-generative their business model is, there really isn't any ""downside"" scenario worse than this one short of the financial sector collapsing. I suppose it's possible that multiples could contract some (things that are cheap can always get cheaper), but the strong capital generation each year bails you out of that one. If Capital One simply continues earning money at the pace it currently does, you see substantial upside - to the tune of 160%, or 21% annualized. As I'll point out in later sections, I think growth is quite likely (my implied P/E multiple in that valuation chart suggests EPS of $9.00-$9.25) which would obviously not only increase terminal valuation, but would also increase the amount of money earned in the meantime, leading to more shareholder returns via buybacks and/or higher (tangible) book value.But wait, there's more. This is a conservative model that doesn't account for two very real things I purposely ignored:Non-GAAP Earnings:In the analysis above, I utilized COF's GAAP earnings for the most part (TBVPS is non-GAAP). Below is slide 12 from the presentation accompanying Capital One's third-quarter earnings release. (If you're interested, direct link here.) It details several adjustments; it's up to you to decide which ones you want to include in your own models. Personally, I consider acquisition-related costs to be a ""real"" cost, but I would point to that shady ""amortization of intangibles"" line as one which I don't fully buy as a ""real"" cost. Warren Buffett discussed a similar issue in one of his annual shareholder letters (believe it was 2012). If you disagree and see a reason to count such amortization as a real cost, I would love to hear your opinion in the comment stream. However you want to slice it, I think it's clear that COF's true earnings potential (slash current level of earnings) is a bit higher than the GAAP numbers.How does this impact my model? For starters and most obviously, it means the terminal EPS will be higher assuming the same growth (or will require a lower level of growth to reach). However, it's also worth considering that COF's true net income is probably closer to $5B (slightly below $5B TTM on a non-GAAP basis, though I don't fully count non-GAAP), yet I modeled them returning $2B/yr to shareholders and retaining $2B/yr in capital (in line with the industry payout ratio, though COF plans to exceed that). Obviously, higher earnings are better for shareholders all around. A quick test in my model using non-GAAP numbers (and a couple of other things) suggested 24-26% 5-yr CAGR for the warrants or something like that, but I don't want to get too blue-sky here. Conservatism is better; I'd rather be pleasantly surprised than disappointed.Adjustments to WarrantsAs you're likely aware, all the TARP warrants (the ones I've looked at anyway) have adjustment provisions. See page S-22 of the prospectus here. You can read it yourself, but as a quick taste, both the exercise price and the number of warrant shares will be adjusted (to warrantholders' benefit) for any/all quarterly cash dividends paid in excess of 37.5 cents per share. I haven't modeled this out exactly for various reasons (one being complexity and two being it and all other capital distribution depends on regulatory approval, which I won't attempt to handicap), but in my valuation table above, I did a quick calculation which implied that dividends in 2018 could be around $2.72/share/year. This equates to 68 cents a quarter, well above the 37.5-cent hurdle. Adjustments could further juice returns. I'll leave it up to you to combine this with the non-GAAP CAGR above… 30%+ compounded returns aren't out of the question in boom times, but again, I think 20% is a reasonable baseline. The nice thing about the warrants is there's not a lot of downside (due to there being negligible time premium) but if things go really well, the return is levered.ConclusionEven with flat to very moderately growing income, it's pretty clear that COF's warrants are meaningfully undervalued. Simply put, they deserve a higher time premium. Now it's time to analyze some of the earnings growth opportunities that present themselves.Capital One: Growth OpportunitiesWhile I've demonstrated that even stable net income will lead to solid returns due to the high earnings yield, my P/E valuation implies EPS of $9.00-$9.25 by 2018. This is 30-35% above current run-rate EPS (note that earnings will likely decrease slightly in '14 as certain parts of acquired portfolios run off) and does not require heroic growth (7-8% annually post-'14, in-line with analyst projections). Below, I provide a very brief summary overview of numerous factors that will support Capital One's growth over the coming years, juicing returns for Capital One shareholders and warrantholders. Please note that this is not a complete nor in-depth examination of all the relevant issues and is not intended to replace your own due diligence. Also, please note that my analysis here will be mostly qualitative rather than quantitative in nature - there are plenty of sell-side analysts covering COF; I don't see the point in replicating their work when my meager contributions will likely add only a marginal amount. These are simply some of the qualitative drivers that make a 7-8%/yr EPS growth projection reasonable in my opinion.Before I start, it's important to address the issue of flat-to-declining results in '14. Management has made it clear that the days of huge growth for Capital One (and the industry) are largely over. Nonetheless, that doesn't mean that growth opportunities don't exist. There is one specific area where Capital One will see a significant organic slowdown - auto - but that's mean reversion from what management called ""best in a lifetime"" results, and is not a company-specific issue. Besides that, if you break down the financials, it becomes clear that most of the so-called ""decline"" is really just runoff of a few acquired portfolios (see the mortgage chart on page 5 of the Barclays presentation); management made it clear that run-off will be declining (from $2B in '13 to $1.2B in '14), so it won't be masking organic growth going forward. In fact, to quote them, ""there is growth in all of the segments that we're emphasizing in the card business.""With that brief prelude out of the way, we'll start on the revenue side, then touch on the cost side.Direct BankingThe combination of ING Direct USA (now rebranded Capital One 360) and Capital One's national legacy bank has made Capital One a true leader in digital banking. This positions them very well for growth in the next 3-5 years.It can easily be surmised qualitatively that for many - not just the young - online/mobile banking is a preferable alternative to actually visiting a branch for most routine activities. Indeed, the only time I've actually visited my bank's local branch within the past year or so was to get a form notarized. Many of my friends report similar experiences. To broaden and substantiate that anecdotal report of a trend, I turn to an April report from Capgemini, which suggests that by 2015, over 63% of customers will bank online weekly or daily. Daily users are projected to grow from 21.7% to 28.2%.Unsurprisingly, this translates into higher growth for online banking; for example, one article from American Banker pegs the growth rate for major direct banks as 3x that of industry average. And Capital One is smack dab in the middle of this trend, as the leader, no less. They already have very strong mindshare via their ""What's In Your Wallet"" commercials featuring the Visigoths (I thought they were Vikings until recently - who knew?); combining their strong brand with their leading position in the industry, they're in a great place here.Interest RatesA normalized interest rate environment (which will likely present itself before 2018, or at least one would think) would benefit Capital One. Modeling all the puts and takes gets complex, but for a general idea, here's how former CFO Gary Perlin put it at a Barclays conference in May (transcript here):Credit Card / Loan GrowthOver the past few years, outstandings growth has been relatively weak, as demonstrated by this handy chart from COF's Morgan Stanley presentation:Management has stressed that they think the days of huge growth in this number are over. In addition, their strategy of focusing on different things is impacting total outstandings in the short term. Here's a quick soundbite from the Q3 earnings call that's helpful for reference:In numerous other presentations, management discussed the cautiousness of the American consumer, related to both longer-term and shorter-term uncertainties about the economies and their levels of income. This has led to lower debt, and is likely a contributing factor in the company's very strong performance on charge-offs over the past few years. Without putting exact numbers on it, it's pretty reasonable to assume that growth here will return to solid (though not stratospheric) levels as unemployment continues to come down and the economy generally strengthens. An improving housing market could also lead to purchases of more appliances, etc. We don't need to get into the specific details here, but it's reasonable to think about.Beyond the general growth in credit card usage from the average American, there's still a whole new generation that hasn't fully entered the market: the underemployed, student-indebted millennial. As explained in a May 2013 Los Angeles Times article, millennials are (for good reason) cautious of credit card use. As the generation becomes more affluent (they've been especially hard-hit in recent times), and subsequently discovers the joys of credit card usage, they can serve as yet another growth driver.It's worth noting two caveats here, one positive and one negative. First, due to Capital One's increasing focus on transactors, they can achieve earnings growth without strong card loan growth. Second, on the negative side, the very favorable level of charge-offs seen recently is likely unsustainably low; growth in loans will inevitably lead to a higher charge-off rate, as more people spending money end up realizing they couldn't really afford to do so. Nonetheless, this should still be a net positive over the long run.Briefly moving to the commercial side, the company pointed out - no surprises here -Capital One has, nonetheless, seen good results in the commercial banking segment. As with consumer lending, commercial should continue to improve as the macro backdrop does.Cost Reduction Opportunities'13 OpEx was artificially inflated by a few one-time items, including a legal settlement and some acquisition expenses. Management expects OpEx in 2014 to be down from $11.1B to $10.5B or so, of which ""a few hundred million"" is ""real savings.""Where do these real savings come from? Capital One is engaging in various cost initiatives to reduce third-party spend, for one; these initiatives should save an unspecified amount over the next 3-4 years. For two - this isn't really a cost reduction, but rather a margin improvement - increasing mix shift towards digital (both pure digital banking and e-services like electronic statements for traditional accounts) can offer numerous opportunities and economies of scale. Finally, while this is harder to put a precise number on, management notes that over the next 2-3 years, there's opportunity to normalize costs related to Basel II and other similar projects.All told, Capital One is already run pretty efficiently, but incremental opportunities here can result in operating leverage on moderate revenue growth.Concluding ThoughtsWhile still heavily levered to credit cards (so it's important to watch charge-offs, etc), Capital One has really developed core competencies in several areas that look poised to outperform the broader financial sector going forward. Pair that with an undemanding valuation - and warrants with virtually no time premium - and there's not much not to like.Finally, though it's obvious, I should note anyway that as a leveraged instrument, the warrants will obviously be quite sensitive to changes in the price of COF shares. In the near term, if something caused a 10% or greater drop in the price of COF, the warrants would go down by a multiple of that. This is something you should consider, as the stock has certainly had a nice run year-to-date. However, my analysis makes me comfortable that they're an asymmetric risk-reward over the long-term, and I initiated a position at roughly the current level. There seems to be a well-lit path to solid returns ahead; investors will just have to tolerate higher-than-average volatility to get there.Disclaimer: This is solely my opinion, not an investment recommendation or solicitation, and may not represent the views of my employer(s), associates, or other related parties.

This company is not suitable for the Defensive Investor, due to not sufficiently growing earnings over the ten year period, but it is suitable for the Enterprising Investor. Capital One appears to have solid earnings stability, a strong dividend history, and is trading at low PEmg and PB ratios. Value investors seeking to follow Benjamin Graham's methods for the Enterprising Investor should feel very comfortable proceeding with further research, beginning with a review of ModernGraham's Valuation of American Express (NYSE:AXP). In terms of a valuation, the company has grown EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $3.14 in 2009 to an estimated $6.36 in 2013. This is solid growth that more than supports the market's implied estimate for growth of 1.88%, indicating the company may be undervalued presently.What do you think? Do you agree that Capital One Financial is undervalued? What would be your assessment? Is the company suitable only for Enterprising Investors?Disclosure: The author did not hold a position in Capital One Financial (COF) at the time of publication and had no intention of changing that position within the next 72 hours."
1434921,23479,2013-05-14T18:27:05-04:00,,"A single-minded focus on the credit card industry gives Capital One (NYSE:COF) a very unique business model compared to the country’s biggest banking groups, who are either extremely diversified in their financial services offerings like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), or are focused on the traditional loans-and-deposits model like Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). The credit card business model has a lot of potential simply because card loans demand the highest interest rates among all retail loans offered by banks. Net interest margins on credit cards for banks are normally twice or three times the figure for other retail loans like auto or student loans.But then, there really is no such thing as a free lunch. The high returns come with a higher risk due to the short term, unsecured nature of credit card loans. And card loans are often the first to go bad when the economy shows signs of slowing down. However, the bigger problem for a bank’s credit card business is when there is an increase in loan losses gauged through charge-off rates despite there being an improvement in the overall economic condition for a period. And this is the situation Capital One is currently facing.  The table below summarizes the credit card charge-off rates for each of the banks we named above in the last nine quarters. The data has been compiled using figures reported by individual banks as a part of their quarterly announcements.Quite notably, Capital One has reported the highest credit card charge-off rates among these banks in each of the last two quarters. It must be mentioned here that as a part of its Q3 2012 earnings release, the bank did give a heads up to higher charge-off figures in the future, holding the less stringent lending practices by the acquired HSBC (HBC) card business responsible for an overall reduction in the quality of its loan portfolio. (Q3 2012 Earnings Press Release, Capital One Press Releases, Oct 18 2012)But side-by-side comparison of charge-off figures in Q1 2013 shows a bad sign. Capital One’s card loan charge-offs increased 13 basis points (0.13%) over the period, even as other banks (except for Wells Fargo) reported slightly lower charge-offs. As for Wells Fargo, its card business forms a substantially smaller part of its total business compared to Capital One; to put things in perspective, Capital One’s average outstanding card loans for the first quarter was $83 billion, whereas for Wells Fargo this figure was $24 billion.So why are we so concerned about Capital One’s higher charge-off figures? The answer is simple: because of the bank’s dependence on the card business to generate a bulk of its value. Higher charge-off figures would mean the bank has to set aside higher provisions to cover these losses over subsequent quarters. The impact of higher provisions on the bank’s share price can be easily understood by making changes to the chart below.To explore one such scenario, suppose Capital One is forced to set aside 5% of its loan size as provisions each year in the future – similar to what it did in 2012. In this case, the bank’s share price will lose nearly 12% of its value compared to our current estimate of $58 to reach just above $51. Capital One will really need to work hard to fix the quality of its card loan portfolio going forward if it wants to avoid this huge downside to its value.Disclosure: No positions."
1951531,56112,2014-01-17T07:45:00-05:00,,"A few days ago, I lamented the fact that some commentators were throwing the baby out with the bathwater when it came to bank earnings. There are some institutions that I am certainly not enamored with. However, I believe a trifecta of circumstances creates the ""perfect storm"" in reverse for a few select financials. For these companies, I believe the following three points are key:Investors might be smart to take a look at institutions of this sort while their stock (both literally and metaphorically) is being held down by broader sector-level concerns.Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is one of my favorites (read my recent article here). Capital One (NYSE:COF) is quickly becoming another. While you can read my full thoughts here, I'll summarize the salient points briefly:Capital One's fourth quarter results contained few surprises, demonstrating continued progress on several fronts. Earnings slightly missed expectations in a seasonally weak fourth quarter due to higher marketing expense and increased provisions; the management guided for higher marketing expense to continue through 2014 as they take advantage of opportunities in specific segments of the market. Planned runoff and the full-quarter impact of the divestiture of the Best Buy portfolio obscured growth in commercial and auto, as well as strong purchase volume (up 8% y/y) in general purpose credit cards. As expected, revenue growth in 2014 will be modest as planned runoff continues to offset growth.The Wells Fargo conference call earlier this week suggested an improving consumer and increasing potential for loan growth. Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank made similar comments during the conference call:Charge-offs will continue to increase over time off cyclical lows, but a continued focus on the upper end of the market will mitigate some of that impact.The charge-off rates were reasonable and don't really concern me. The one issue to keep an eye on is marketing spend; one analyst on the call (Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse) asked the management how investors should think about the effectiveness of marketing, and what metrics to watch. The response was interesting:Definitely something to watch over time.Perhaps the most immediate thing investors should look for, however, is the regulatory decision on capital returns. Capital One requested authorization for share repurchases that would result in a total payout ratio ""well above"" the industry norm of 50%.For the sake of conservatism, we'll assume next year's earnings will come in at $6.75 on a GAAP basis. (This is well below the average analyst estimate for 2014 and well below my estimate as well.) The definition of ""significantly"" is up for debate, but let's just call it 60%. We already know Capital One will be paying out $1.20 per share in dividends, so that leaves $2.85 on a per-share basis for buybacks. That works out to nearly 4% of the shares outstanding, which will be immediately accretive given that shares continue to be undervalued.Given all of the above, Capital One shares continue to look attractive to me (and, for risk-tolerant investors, the warrants are even more so). Share price returns in 2014 may be more moderate than those of 2013, but management continues to execute on a sound strategy and the economic backdrop is favorable.Disclaimer: This is solely my opinion, not an investment recommendation or solicitation, and may not represent the views of my employer(s), associates, or other related parties.

1136441,24627,2013-01-28T03:50:20-05:00,,"Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF) offers a variety of financial products and services which include credit cards, business loans, auto loans, as well as consumer and commercial banking services. Capital One shares were trending higher in early 2013, and just recently reached around $62. However, after the company announced earnings, the stock took a big hit and it now trades around $56 per share. This appears to be a solid buying opportunity for a number of reasons. First, let's take a look at the earnings report which caused a significant selloff in the stock.The company announced earnings of $1.41 per share for the fourth quarter. This was below consensus estimates of $1.58 per share. The quarter was impacted by higher loan loss provisions and higher operating expenses. These results were a short-term disappointment, but the pullback in the stock seems excessive, and it was exacerbated by some analysts cutting price targets. For example, analysts at Janney Capital cut the price target from $67 to $63 per share.One reason to consider buying the stock now is because it is trading at the low end of its recent trading range and near a key support level (as shown on the chart) which is around $56, right around the 200-day moving average. This appears to be an area where plenty of investors are willing to buy and that means the stock might not have much downside left.Capital One shares look undervalued when you consider that analysts expect the company to earn about $6.53 per share in 2013. That puts the price to earnings ratio near 8.5 times. This is a significant discount to the average stock in the S&P 500 Index (NYSEARCA:SPY), which now trades for about 15 times earnings. This stock also appears undervalued in terms of book value which is about $68.45 per share. Finally, Capital One looks cheap compared to other companies in this industry. For example, American Express (NYSE:AXP) is expected to earn $4.75 per share in 2013, (which is significantly less than estimates of $6.53 for Capital One) and it trades for over $59 per share.With many of the major market averages trading near record highs, it's getting tougher to find value in this market. That is another reason why it makes sense to buy stocks that drop over short-term disappointments like an earnings miss, especially when the company has a solid business model like Capital One. With the economy showing signs of strength in housing and some improvement in the job market, this could lead to increased consumer and business demand for Capital One's financial products in the future and it could also lead to lower loan losses.Here are some key points for COF:Current share price: $56.32The 52 week range is $44.30 to $62.92Earnings estimates for 2013: $6.53 per shareEarnings estimates for 2014: $6.92 per shareAnnual dividend: 20 cents per share which yields .4%Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance.

Revenue grew almost 5% year over year, which was in line with estimates. Card member spending grew 8% year-over-year and recognized a $400M restructuring charge. This charge will go to funding severance payments related to 5,400 layoffs, which is around 8.5% of its total workforce.The more spending-conscious consumers has helped the credit card company keep default rates at historically low levels in 2011 and 2012. Besides sustaining over 25% return on equity growth, American Express management expects to consistently invest 50% of its excess capital in the business while paying out the remaining 50% to the investors through dividends and share buybacks. Its re-engineering program is expected to be completed by the end of 2012, where management expects to generate annual cost savings of $70 million from 2012 onward.Even with the solid growth and prospects of American Express, it might be trading ahead of itself based on valuation, at 14x earnings and 3.5x book value. Other big credit card companies Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), Visa Inc (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) will be posting earnings several weeks away. Discover -- March 18, Visa -- February 6 and Mastercard -- January 31. Discover pays a relatively low dividend yielding 1.4%, albeit the highest among the credit card stocks.

Visa is 50x earnings and 4x book value, whereas Mastercard is at 31x earnings and 10x book value.Capital One Financial Corp.

The credit card segment encompasses consumer and small business card lending and its consumer/commercial banking segments include lending and deposit gathering for retail and business consumers.With a competitive deposit market, Capital One was gearing up deposits nearly 66% year-over-year to $213 billion in the first nine months of 2012, driven by the addition of deposits from the ING Direct acquisition. Capital One has also shored up its credit card portfolio by acquiring HSBC's U.S. credit card business. From a dividend standpoint, Capital One has the most to grow, where the credit card company pays a dividend yielding only 0.4%. As of Q3-2012 Capital One was well capitalized with capital ratios coming in at Tier 1 capital of 12.7%, Tier 1 common ratio of 10.0% and leverage ratio of 9.9% -- well above the regulatory requirements.Based on the American Express' earnings release and the price performance, Capital One could be set up to outperform with its upcoming earnings announcement.

1030511,29161,2012-11-27T10:43:36-05:00,,"It seems everybody is getting into financial services these days or at least expanding their offerings in the sector. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) are offering debit cards and checking accounts together. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) are trying to combine PayPal and the Discover card into a new kind of financial service. Not to be outdone, Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) has decided to start opening brick and mortar banks that will offer financial services and coffee.Is this headlong rush into new kinds of financial services good news for investors? The geniuses at the various companies involve hope all those new services will lead to increased cash flow and new revenues from fees. But are these hopes realistic? Will the expansion of retailers into finance and credit card companies into banking generate additional cash or not?The numbers from Capital One seems to indicate that they just might be onto something. Capital One's revenues have grown by a little over $6 billion in the past two years from $16.08 billion in September 2010 to $22.31 billion on September 31st, 2012. The revenue from Discover Financial Services has grown as well, but not as fast. Discover's revenue grew from $5.96 billion in November 2008 to $8.841 billion on August 31st, 2012.The amount of cash churning through the financial services companies is increasing, but is it translating into higher profits? The answer is yes. Capital One posted a gross quarterly profit margin of 90.49% on September 30th, and Discover posted a gross quarterly profit margin of 85.79% on August 31st. Basic financial services, such as credit and debit cards and payment processing, are paying off.Selling Financial Services to the UnbankedThe payoff will probably continue as the public seeks an alternative to traditional banks. Around 10 million Americans, or 8.2% of American households, now have no bank account of any kind, according to a survey by the FDIC. That number increased from 1% in the last similar survey by the same agency. The FDIC also reported that around 20.1% of American households are now underbanked. That means they have a bank account, but they use other methods of payment, such as payday loans or money orders. The number of the underbanked grew by around 2%, the FDIC reported.These numbers represent opportunities for the financial services industry, because all of those people still need to pay bills, cash paychecks, and buy groceries. Yet many of them don't trust banks or associate traditional banks with poor service and high fees. Wal-Mart and American Express's Bluebird card is one obvious attempt to serve such customers. It offers no fee and provides most of the services of a standard checking account, including electronic bill pay. A person can sign up for Bluebird without a credit score.Capital One's cafes are another attempt to reach this group. They are friendlier than a traditional bank, yet offer fewer services. Instead of tellers, a person who visits the café finds a coffee bar, a sandwich shop, a salad bar, flat screen TV to watch, wireless internet, and beanbags. There will be no safety box or cash services either, which will reduce the cost of operation. Instead, Capitol One employees on site will help visitors open accounts online or with smartphone apps. All of the banking will be electronic.This strategy can help Capital One from losing customers to eBay's PayPal, Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Wallet, and American Express's Bluebird, which provide a variety of banking services without a bank account. Capital One's strategy for competing with these services is to leverage the ING Direct Assets it purchased earlier this year. This will enable Capital One to go after middle and upper class customers that want more traditional banking services, but don't necessarily want a bank anymore.Capital One recognizes that people are moving away from traditional banks. In addition to alternatives such as debit cards, more people are taking advantage of online banking. Many people no longer think of a bank as a building; instead, they view it as a smartphone app or a website.It's a brave new world of financial services out there, and Capital One is in a good opportunity to take advantage of it. The company has figured out how to turn all of those new financial products into cash. It reported making $9.672 billion in cash from operations on September 30th. There seems to be no reason why Capital One can't continue with that.The new world of financial services is definitely an opportunity for value investors, and Capital One is one of the best values in it. It generates a lot of cash, and it is constantly looking for opportunities to generate more. More importantly, it looks like there are many such opportunities out there.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In my view, however, the global economy is stronger than what the market recognizes when it comes to consumer expenditures. Job figures may be disappointing, but they are heading in the right direction. Towards capitalizing on my bullish outlook, I recommend broadly investing in Amex (NYSE:AXP), Discover Financial (NYSE:DFS), Capital One (NYSE:COF), and Visa (NYSE:V) over time. These consumer financials are the ""infrastructure"" behind consumer spending and thus well positioned to outperform in the event of a quicker-than-expected recovery.Like investing in the S&P 500, I encourage investors to slowly increase any long position in the four stocks listed above. Don't put your eggs in one basket, since any signs of worsening debt crises abroad will limit the principal that allows for compounding. The idea is to not have your investment be disrupted by negative short-term events / news. Top value investors search for long-term growth, and card businesses have a strong brand image to warrant higher multiples.While the S&P 500 trades at 15.7x past earnings, Amex trades at only 13.9x past earnings. With a beta of 1.8, the firm is likely to recover lost shareholder value from the financial collapse quicker than the market overall. Discover is even cheaper at 8x past earnings; Capital One is cheaper still at 7.1x past earnings. The odd ball out in card business is Visa , which trades at a respective 28.9x and 17.5x past earnings. Part of the reason why Visa trades so high is due to the company's strong brand name and sustainability. Based on data from FINVIZ.com, all 4 of these consumer financials are rated a ""buy"" or better.Capital One is nevertheless preferred given how cheap it is. Assuming no growth, the firm raises more free cash flow than its market capitalization. Based on consensus 9.1% EPS growth expectations over the next 5 years, 2016 EPS will be around $9.74. At a 12x multiple, the future value of the company is worth $116.88 per share. Discounting backwards by an aggressive 12% discount rate yields a $66.32 price target, which is at a more than 20% premium to the current market value. With the firm trading 14% book value, I find that margin of safety is large enough to justify making an investment in a brand name firm that could more than double in value.Amex has stronger growth expectations going into its valuation with consensus forecasting 11.5% per annum EPS growth over the next 5 years. That means 2016 EPS of around $7.39. At a 12x multiple, the future value of the stock is $88.69. A discount rate of 12% would imply that the firm is roughly 15% overvalued. The Street's price target is nominally higher than the current market. Despite limited upside, I recommend backing the company since multiples nevertheless have room to expand. My 12x multiple is, after all, conservative in light of the current 13.9x multiple.Discover Financial has a PEG of 0.87, which implies that the market has failed to properly consider growth prospects in assigning a valuation. It also offers an industry-leading 1.2% dividend yield. By contrast, Visa has a PEG of 1.5 and a dividend yield of 0.7%. Brand name is critical in the consumer financial / card business, but the premium appears somewhat risky. Moreover, Visa has a low beta of 0.8, which indicates that it won't outperform broader indices from a macro recovery. The fundamentals are nevertheless solid against peers and reinforced by the absence of meaningful debt and 2.9 current ratio. For safety, go with Visa; for high reward, go with Capital One, Discover, and Amex.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: We seek IR business from all of the firms in our coverage, but research covered in this note is independent and for prospective clients.

648581,23479,2012-06-10T02:49:14-04:00,,"Capital One (NYSE:COF) has finalized two acquisitions since the beginning of this year – the $9 billion acquisition of ING Direct U.S.A. and the $31.3 billion acquisition of HSBC's (NYSE:HBC) U.S. credit card business. While the ING buy boosted the bank's deposits by $80 billion, HSBC helped add credit card loans worth $28 billion to Capital One's balance sheet.In light of the significant value added by these new additions to Capital One's business, as well as some performance and market-related factors, we have updated our price estimate for the bank's stock from $49 to $60, which is about 15% ahead of the current market price. Below we detail the reasons for the near-20% boost to our estimated value for Capital One.See our full analysis for Capital OneCapital One has been bulking up its business in recent quarters through acquisitions. And the fact that many big banks – primarily those based in Europe – have put up many of their non-core business units for sale has given Capital One ample opportunity to shop for those that best fit its growth strategy. The deals with ING and HSBC are recent examples of this approach.Deposits from ING Direct Provide A Cheap Funding SourceCapital One completed the integration of ING Direct U.S.A's business in the first quarter, adding $80 billion in deposits. The fact that these deposits are available to U.S. customers at very competitive interest rates means that Capital One will be able to use these deposits to fund its lending operations – on both the commercial and consumer side – at low costs.This should result in an improvement in net yield figures for the bank's lending business in the years to come. We have captured this with an increase in our forecast for Capital One's net interest yield, as shown in the chart below.Card Loans From HSBC Consolidate The Credit Card BusinessThe $28 billion in card loans which Capital One adds to its cornerstone credit card business from HSBC should raise the value of its outstanding credit card portfolio to well over $90 billion for the year. No doubt, the bank also stands to gain from the fact that this acquisition makes it the third largest provider of private-label cards after GE (NYSE:GE) and Citigroup (NYSE:C).And in a hurry to monetize the synergies the acquisition had to offer, Capital One almost immediately announced a reduction of nearly 1,000 jobs in these card units. ((Layoffs to impact Buffalo, California, Buffalo News, May 5 2012)) This will significantly help non-interest expenses for the card business, as indicated below.Disclosure: No positions"

The consensus estimate is $1.39 for EPS and $4.37B for revenue, according to First Call. In a note to investors on April 18, Stifel Nicolaus wrote that it expects Capital One's Q1 results to reflect high margins, strong profitability, and significant loan growth. Stifel believes that the company's visibility will remain poor during 1H12. However, the firm predicts that Capital One's multiple could increase significantly, and it raised its target price on the stock to $71 from $60 while maintaining a Buy rating. American Express's (NYSE:AXP) stronger than expected Q1 results, and generally stronger credit metrics at the large banks that have already reported Q1 results, should also encourage Capital One inventors. Capital One reported that its own credit metrics in March were little changed, as its U.S. delinquency rate decreased to 3.25% from 3.62% but its charge-off rate inched up to 3.85% from 3.84%."

The strongest price movement of +1.5% comes within thirty trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and -2.6% within thirty trading days when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number.Last quarter the company reported earnings twenty-four cents ahead of the whisper number.

We also have two independent academic studies supporting the premise that investor expectations for quarterly earnings (our whisper numbers) provide greater returns when used as an investment vehicle, and have a greater impact on stock movement than analysts consensus estimates.A company's ""price reaction"" to the whisper number expectation is the key - on average companies that exceed the whisper are 'rewarded', while companies that miss are 'punished' following an earnings report.According to the Wall Street Journal, ""positive surprises are becoming so common they are nearly universal. They are predetermined in a cynical tango-clinch between companies and the analysts who cover them. All the numbers are gamed at this point.""

942241,25210,2012-10-23T14:03:09-04:00,,"Capital One Financial's (NYSE:COF) third-quarter earnings remained noisy in the wake of the company's acquisitions this year, which included the ING Direct purchase, and the purchase of HSBC's domestic card business closing in mid-2012, according to Fitch Ratings. Fitch expects COF's earnings power to be stronger due to lower funding costs and improved loan yields.COF's loan growth was relatively flat from the sequential quarter as continued growth in auto loans and some modest growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans, was offset by a continued planned run-off of mortgage loans that COF inherited with the ING Direct acquisition as well as the run-off of some card loans acquired from HSBC.On balance, COF's credit quality remains reasonably good. However, both overall net charge offs (NYSE:NCO) and 30 day plus delinquencies increased in COF's domestic card portfolio and in its auto portfolio.COF's Tier 1 common ratio improved to 10.7% in 3Q'12, up from 9.9% in 2Q'12. In 3Q'12, COF disclosed that its Tier 1 common ratio under proposed Basel 3 capital standards would be in the high 7% range, which is on the lower side compared to some peer institutions. However, given COF's strong capital generation Fitch would expect the company to be above their assumed Basel 3 target of 8% in the next year.COF's quarterly profit rose 44 percent after two big acquisitions, but the lender said increasing competition for automobile and commercial loans may curb future growth. Auto loans, and commercial and industrial lending have helped Capital One offset lackluster demand, but as more lenders chase the same customers, underwriting standards have fallen. New auto loans fell 9 percent from the second quarter.Net income for the third quarter rose to $1.17 billion from $813 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 40 percent to $5.78 billion. Capital One may return more capital to investors next year if regulators agree. During the second quarter profit fell 90 percent on higher credit loss reserves related to the HSBC card purchase.The stock is up 35 percent since the start of year. Net interest income rose 42 percent while non-interest income more than doubled.ValuationOn a short-term multiplier valuation model basis, Captial One is overvalued. On an absolute basis Capital One is undervalued. The price-earnings ratio is 9.60 and the price-sales ratio is 2.06. The firm is trading at 89 percent of book value.EarningsFor investors, corporate America's top-line figures are of particular concern. The beat rate for revenue forecasts is just 41.4 percent, compared to a long-term average of 62 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.I have been seeing top-line weakness for some time now. With the release of third quarter results, it seems investors are starting to pay more attention to the slowdown in sales growth.ConclusionCapital One has emerged as one of the nation's largest lenders. The firm's financial performance is on an upward trajectory. Liquid ratios are solid and financial performance is good. That said, the firm may be a bit overvalued on a short-term basis. Long equity investors should reduce exposure. I will increase exposure on a decline in short-term multiplier model valuations.Disclaimer: This article is not meant to establish or continue an investment advisory relationship.

It has lost two-fifths of its value from five years ago and, despite having dramatically transformed, still has structuring issues. I believe that the company would make an ideal activist target, excluding the market cap. The stock currently believes that it - in addition to Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) - is a ""buy."" Based on my review of the fundamentals and multiples analysis, I find particularly high risk-adjusted return potential for Capital One.From a multiples perspective, Capital One is the cheapest of the three. It trades at a respective 7x and 7.4x past and forward earnings with a dividend yield of 0.4%. DFS and Citigroup, meanwhile, trade at a respective 7.2x and 8.7x past earnings. To put this into perspective, consider that Capital One is only valued at 76% of its historical five-year average PE multiple:At the forth quarter earnings call, Capital One's management noted:Since the recession, the company has transformed itself into a diversified commercial bank and is now making a stab at online banking. While many of the decisions were strategically attractive, I am reserved about how accretive the ING Direct and HSBC card business will be in the near and intermediate future given their profitability. But from a risk perspective, Capital One is strong as a financial, since the firm's solid balance sheet and strong brand hedges against a double dip.Consensus estimates for Capital One's EPS forecast are that it will decline by 14.1% to $5.84 in 2012 and then grow by 14.9% and 12.1% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 9x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $6.64, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $59.76, implying 21.5% upside.DFS benefits from economies of scale and the sustainable streams of free cash flow driven by its loyal clients. It also offers an attractive medium for investors to gain exposure to global payment processing. Risks include margin pressures from member banks and financing uncertainty. Consensus estimates for DFS' EPS forecast are that it will decline by 17.2% to $3.36 in 2012 and then grow by 0.3% and 6.8% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 9x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $3.33, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $29.97, implying 3.3% upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
305287,24597,2011-11-04T19:52:56-04:00,,"By Carson KoCapital One Financial (NYSE:COF) is a diversified financial company, focusing primarily on credit card, auto loans and home loan lending. The company also offers other financial services such as retail banking and consumer banking, however, in a smaller capacity compared to the rest of the operation. The company established its business in 1988 and grew into a Fortune 500 company within 10 short years by aggressively expanding its credit card market. Capital One has always been known to have strong brand recognition, and its investment in marketing helps it stay competitive in acquiring new cardholders and maintain market share in the credit card business.The company just had its Q3 Earnings Conference Call on Thursday Oct 20th (see transcript) and the stock price increased 7% on Friday due to beating the street's estimate. The stock is currently trading at $45.2 a share; an increase of 6.2% since the beginning of 2011.Business SegmentsCapital One is known for credit card products. The company’s Venture credit card has been gaining momentum in popularity. COF's credit card segment contributes to ~50% of its net interest earnings. To break down each segment in further detail, below is an extract from Capital One’s 2010 annual report. Click to enlarge CompetitorsWithin the credit card segment, Capital One competes with other issuers of Visa and MasterCard credit cards, as well as American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover Card (NYSE:DFS). The chart below compares year to date performance for the three companies. Potential investors will want to establish whether the company’s relative underperformance makes it a value play in the space.Within retail banking, mortgage and auto finance, Capital One competes with bank and non-bank lenders who provide financing for mortgage and dealer-originated loans.Click to enlargeWithin Segment PerformanceCredit Card Segment: Within the unsecured lending segment, there are mainly two concerns that will affect the earnings power of the portfolio, default rate and prepayment rate. Default rate is lead by delinquency rate and will eventually turn into loss of principal. For the last two to three years, high delinquency rates have been plaguing the credit card industry. To combat that, the industry has tightened the underwriting guidelines and is only lending to borrowers that have superior credit. However, when the economy turns around, these borrowers may have a higher motivation to prepay to find lower rate and a lower fee alternative.During Capital One’s Oct. 20th conference call, both Gary Perlin (CFO) and Richard Fairbank (CEO) mentioned this “run off” problem with the installment loans. A similar situation may happen to the revolving loan area in future quarters and cause higher funding and marketing costs to portfolio volume.As shown in the above chart, charge-off rates for the domestic portfolio have been decreasing dramatically in the past 16 months. Although the international portfolio does not show the same improved performance, it does not drag down the overall charge-off rate as much, due to smaller volume.Delinquency rate, which indicates future charge-off rates, has also been decreasing for the last 16 months. The slight upswing for Q3 2011 is normal for seasonality, as Q2 usually has the best performance in credit lending.If we examine the Net Interest Income / Average Loan Balance rate, we can tell that the decrease in the charge-off rate and the delinquency rate do not induce much improvement over the portfolio’s earning power. This could be for two reasons: either loan balance does not remain long enough to generate interest, or higher interest costs lead to higher interest expense and therefore reduce net interest income. The latter seems to be less likely due to the lower cost of funding across the industry. Since the credit card portion is significant to the overall portfolio, the growth in this area posts a serious ripple effect to the company’s competitiveness. If the slow growth situation continues, it will become a resistance to the company’s income growth and cut into profit margin.Consumer Banking Segment:  Within the Consumer Banking Segment, home loan, auto and retail banking account for about 28% of the total loan portfolio. Although the loan charge-off rate is much lower than its credit card counterpart (1.32% vs. 4.23% Q3 2011), its overall growth has not been as healthy. Home loan and retail banking’s portion of the portfolio has been shrinking in the last quarter, however, the auto loan growth was able to make up for losses in the other two areas. We see higher auto sales in the overall economy and estimate this segment of the company will experience a better growth rate and a higher revenue stream in the following few quarters.Commercial Banking Segment: This segment makes up about 25% of the portfolio and has the lowest charge-off rate (< 0.5% Q3 2011). The segment also has the highest growth rate of the three segments. However, the average yield for this segment is also the low. This segment’s clients are mostly commercial real estate and middle market customers who are usually driven by low rates and low fees. We anticipate high grow in this area, but do not see profit margins widening.Overall PerformanceCharge-off rates have been declining across the board and the overall portfolio performance is getting better. The company’s loan balances grew in the quarter by almost $1 billion, however we also see prepayment as a concern to the company if the prepay rate persists at a high level. Capital One is well capitalized and has a healthy balance sheet.Capital One has been investing heavily in advertising and online banking to build up their long term competitiveness in acquiring new customers. Creating brand loyalty to charge higher interest rates while having the customer stick with the business is going to be the key to win this credit card race.ValuationWith the ongoing trends for each segment, portfolio growth is forecasted close to 6% per annum for the next 5 years. Combined with the yield percentage, cash flow growth is estimated at 4.5~5% per annum for the next 5 years and a terminal growth rate at 2%. For the next year or two, financial institutions, banks and credit cards will likely be subject to tightened regulations and increased earnings uncertainty, which justifies a high discount rate. However, even with a higher than usual discount rate of 25%, it will lead to a ~$70 fair value estimate which is equivalent to 8.7 times P/E.With the current economic climate, investors should realize that it might take longer than a year for the market to realize a financial firm’s fair value. Comparing Capital One to its peers shows the company to be a good relative investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
320226,24597,2012-01-18T09:00:41-05:00,,"By Joseph Hogue, CFACapital One Financial (NYSE:COF) reports earnings after market close on the 19th with consensus estimates coming in at $1.54 per share, down 13.0% from the most recent quarter but still up 1.3% over the same quarter a year earlier. Despite the unimpressive quarterly earnings, per share net income for the year has increased by 24.6% over the prior four quarters.The company focuses primarily on consumer and commercial lending through three segments: credit cards, commercial banking, and consumer banking with the card segment amounting to almost half (48.9%) of total loans. Geographic exposure through banking includes the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada but extends across the globe through card lending.Charge-off rates within domestic credit have been decreasing over the last 18 months, from more than 8 percent during third quarter 2010 to around 4 percent last year. The delinquency rate, a measure of future charge offs, has also been decreasing and may signal better times ahead.Though retail sales over the holidays were generally weak, it does appear that the consumer is gradually coming back. Lack of real income growth held sales back to an increase of just 0.1% in December and 0.4% in November. Despite a generally weak environment, consumer credit increased to $20.4 billion last year, the highest level since 2009. Non-revolving credit surged by 10.7% on an annualized basis and revolving credit grew by 8.5% annualized over the month. While this makes for a particularly bullish case going into quarterly earnings, the outlook for the rest of the year may be slower. Consumers have had to cut back on savings to fuel consumption but cannot do this for an extended period.Tightening underwriting standards over the last few years have cleaned up much of the bad loans and credit quality that led us into the crisis. Continued high unemployment and a week housing market will limit growth in consumer expenditures over the next year but should improve in the second half of the year.The regulatory environment is one of the biggest risks to the financials but may moderate depending on the outcome of November's elections. Detailed in a previous article, many of the provisions in the Dodd-Frank bill may still be adjusted. While this is assumed, the market may not be pricing in the positive effects of those unknown adjustments.Capital One has already reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will be exiting its hedge fund and private-equity exposure in compliance with the Volcker Rule. Bloomberg reported last year that the bank will restructure about $150 million in funds but should not have a material effect on business.The heat map above shows fundamentals versus peers in the financials sector. Capital One is relatively well positioned compared to financials in general but not as strong versus its main competitor in the card space, Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS). Discover shows higher profitability measures like return-on-equity and is less volatility with a beta of 1.38 versus COF. Discover also pays a higher dividend yield but is more expensive on a book value basis.The shares have increased 5.9% since our last report in November where we detailed each business segment. The company has outperformed the general market and the Select SPDR Financials (NYSEARCA:XLF) over the last year but much of this is from strong performance since the beginning of the month.A price-to-earnings between 7-9 times trailing earnings is more common for the sector and the shares may return to this range over the next year. A trailing P/E of eight would put the shares at just over $60 for an increase of 23.0% over the current price. The recent trends in consumer credit may help drive quarterly numbers but could weaken in near quarters.Though the company has fairly strong fundamentals, it is still subject to high volatility due to regulatory and litigation risk in the year to come. The stock may be appropriate for investors with medium-high risk tolerances and time horizons of greater than a few years. Investors needing constant income and lower risk may still look to purchase the shares but should do so with a less aggressive strategy. Covered call writing and portfolio insurance may help mitigate near term risk in the general market.Disclosure: I am long XLF."
301274,24805,2011-10-21T16:14:02-04:00,,"In June, Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) entered into a definitive agreement to buy ING Direct, subsidiary of ING Groep (NYSE:ING), for $9 billion in stock and cash. This was supposed to fetch further presence in the direct banking market.In July, Capital One announced a follow-on public offering of $2 billion. You guessed it right; it was to partly fund the acquisition of ING Direct. The moral of the story: Although the second-quarter would have reaped the benefits, the third quarter is going to pay for that. But let's see how the third quarter of this year has turned out to be.Total interest income hardly showed any improvement. Why? Isn't the increasing loan portfolio reaping any benefits? Unfortunately, we see around 2% increase in the non-performing commercial real estate loan portfolio and nearly 5% increase in the non-performing consumer real estate loan portfolio. Needless to say, the US real estate market is taking its toll on the company's performance.You must be interested to know what type of loans the company mostly holds to get an idea of its future performance. Although it focuses mainly in credit card services, its loan portfolio holds over 20% in the consumer and commercial real estate segment. Twenty percent is pretty large considering today's real estate market.Coming to the credit card section, there has been slight (perhaps only a few tenths of a percent) change in the net charge-offs, where the international card section showed better improvement compared to the domestic counterpart. It must be noted that the return on investment is always better in the international arena.Net income from consumer banking incurred a hit since the last quarter this year, down to $296 million from $446 million, which is attributed to the various non-interest expenses. Should we say corporate taxesSame was the case in the commercial banking section. Even though revenues have gone up to $412 million this quarter, over $395 million previous quarter this year, we see no remarkable difference in the bottom line.Increasing loan and deposit balances still make for a strong quarter, and with the issuance of the $2 billion in common stock, the Tier I ratio has gone up.It must be noted that its net profit margin of 23.67% is still better than Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) 19.97%, JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) 17.94%, and Citigroup's (NYSE:C) 16.16%. And although lower than that of Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) and American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP), its return on average assets is pretty tight, more decent than the others.What I would really want to see now is proper execution of the money it's got in its hands, added benefits from the acquisition and improvement in the bottom line Let's watch a few more quarters ahead for these.

301198,20568,2011-10-21T13:08:18-04:00,,"Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF)  reported third quarter 2011 earnings from continuing operations of  $1.88 per share, handsomely beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  $1.70. Though this compares unfavorably with $2.04 per share earned in  the prior quarter, it surpassed earnings of $1.79 per share recorded in  the year-ago quarter.Better-than-expected results for the quarter were primarily aided by  increased revenues. Though the company’s capital and profitability  ratios showed improvement, its asset quality showed mixed results.  However, increase in operating expenses and higher provision for loan  and lease losses were the downsides.Additionally during the quarter, Capital One announced an agreement to acquire HSBC Holdings Plc’s (HBC)  U.S. credit card business for $32.7 billion. The deal, which is  expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012, will bring  long-term benefits for the company.Furthermore, during the second quarter Capital One announced to acquire  ING Direct USA, the online banking unit of Amsterdam-based ING Groep NV (NYSE:ING),  in a stock-cum-cash transaction valued at $9.0 billion. The acquisition  is expected to close late this year or early next year.Quarter in DetailCapital One’s net income from continuing operations was $865 million,  down 8.5% from $945 million in the prior quarter but up 5.7% from $818  million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting the loss from discontinued  operations, Capital One’s net income came in at $813 million or $1.77  per share, compared with $911 million or $1.97 per share in the previous  quarter and $803 million or $1.76 per share in the year-ago quarter.Total revenue for the reported quarter stood at $4.15 billion, up 4.0%  sequentially and 3.4% year over year. The growth was mainly driven by  higher net interest income. Total revenue also topped the Zacks  Consensus Estimate of $4.04 billion.Net interest income upped 4.7% sequentially and 5.6% year over year to  $3.28 billion. Similarly, non-interest income also rose 1.6%  sequentially but fell 4.0% year over year to $871 million.Net interest margin (NYSE:NIM) improved 19 basis points (bps) sequentially  and 18 bps year over year to 7.39%. The rise was attributable to the  increase in earning asset yields, partially offset by higher cost of  funds.Capital One’s operating expenses for the reported quarter climbed 1.9%  sequentially and 15.1% year over year to $2.30 billion mainly due to  rise in salaries and associate benefits expenses.The managed efficiency ratio improved to 55.30% from 56.47% in the  prior quarter. The increase in efficiency ratio indicates deterioration  in profitability.Credit QualityCapital One’s credit quality was a mixed bag during the quarter.  Allowance, as a percentage of reported loans held for investment,  slipped 19 bps sequentially to 3.29%. Also, the net charge-off rate  dropped 39 bps sequentially to 2.52%, as a continued improvement in  credit led to charge-off improvements across all business segments.However, the 30-plus day performing delinquency rate also scaled up 23  bps sequentially to 3.13%. Similarly, provision for loan and lease  losses increased 81.3% sequentially but declined 28.3% year over year to  $622 million.Capital and Profitability RatiosCapital One’s capital and profitability ratios continued to enhance  during the quarter. Tangible common equity (TCE) ratio for the quarter  improved to 8.3% from 7.9% in the prior quarter. Also, Tier 1 risk-based  capital ratio rose 60 bps sequentially to 12.4%.The company’s tangible book value per share was $33.82 as of September 30, 2011 compared with $32.20 as of June 30, 2011.Peer PerformanceOne of the close peers of Capital One, Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS)  posted a solid third quarter, reporting earnings substantially ahead of  the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The surge in profits was driven by strong  sales volume complemented by lower interest expense, reduced provision  for loan losses and delinquency rates based on improved credit quality.The profit was also boosted by the escalated income from both direct  banking and payment services business. However, these were partially  offset by increased operating and tax expenses.Our ViewpointWe anticipate continued synergies from the company’s geographic  diversification. Additionally, the resilience shown by almost all its  businesses will continue to support its financials. The upcoming  acquisitions of ING and HSBC units will also improve the company’s  position in terms of deposits and assets, as well as be significantly  accretive to its financials.However, rising operating expenses and the company’s commercial real  estate exposure will remain dampeners. Moreover, a weak loan demand,  along with the impact of the new financial reform law, will suppress  earnings in the near future.Capital One currently retains a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a  short-term Hold rating. Also, considering the fundamentals, we maintain a  long-term Neutral” recommendation on the shares."
286467,23373,2011-08-10T16:00:47-04:00,,"Despite all the talk about weak U.S. financials, Capital One Financial  Corp. (NYSE:COF) has struck another deal that strengthens its tie to the troubled  sector south of the border. On Wednesday, Capital One announced that it would buy HSBC’s (HBC) $30 billion credit card portfolio in the U.S. for $2.6 billion. (Much like  TD’s purchase of Chrysler Financial Corp., the actual deal value is much  less than the value of the loans outstanding.)The transaction comes on the heels of Capital One’s $9 billion purchase of the U.S. online arm of ING Bank.After both deals, Capital One will have a credit card portfolio worth  $85 billion and deposits that total more than $200 billion. Those  figures make the company the fourth-largest general purpose credit card  issuer in the U.S., the third-largest private-label credit card issuer  and the fifth-largest bank as ranked by deposits.Why would any company want to strength its tie to the U.S. consumer  right now? Because savings rates are going up and delinquencies are  going down. Since August 2010, the percentage of credit card balances  that have been classified as net charge-offs or delinquencies has fallen  every single month, from about 9.5 percent to 6 percent for net  charge-offs and from about 4.5 percent down to around 3 percent for  delinquencies.As for the deposits, a bigger base lowers Capital One’s cost of funds,  making it easier to borrow money. With Americans saving more as they cut  debt, that deposit base can reasonably be expected to grow.To pay for the deals, Capital One will use existing cash and raise new  equity and debt. While the HSBC deal will be paid for primarily with  cash, $6.2 billion of the ING deal will be paid for in cash and  $2.8 billion in stock. Capital One is also expected to raise $2 billion  in new stock and $3.7 billion in debt to finance the deals.The HSBC deal had long been expected after word of multiple bids was reported by the media."

Though this compared unfavorably with $2.04 in the prior quarter, it  surpassed $1.78 recorded in the year-ago quarter.Better-than-expected results for the quarter were primarily aided by  increased revenues and a lower provision for loan losses ensuing from an  improved credit performance. Additionally, the company’s capital and  profitability ratios also improved. However, an increase in operating  expenses was a downside.Additionally during the quarter, Capital One announced an agreement to  acquire ING Direct USA, the online banking unit of Amsterdam-based ING Groep NV (NYSE:ING),  in a stock-cum-cash transaction valued at $9.0 billion. The acquisition  is expected to close late this year or early next year.Quarter in DetailCapital One’s net income from continuing operations was $945 million,  down 8.4% from $1,032 million in the prior quarter but up 16.4% from  $812 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting the loss from  discontinued operations, Capital One’s net income came in at $911  million, or $1.97 per share, compared with $1,016 million, or $2.21 per  share, in the previous quarter and $608 million, or $1.33 per share, in  the year-ago quarter.Total revenue for the reported quarter stood at $3.99 billion, down 2.2% sequentially but up 2.3% year over year.Net interest income slipped 0.1% sequentially but inched up 1.3% year  over year to $3.14 billion. Similarly, non-interest income also declined  9.0% sequentially but rose 6.2% year over year to $857 million.Net interest margin (NYSE:NIM) decreased 4 basis points (bps) sequentially  but improved 11 bps on a year-over-year basis to 7.20%. The sequential  drop was due to a 15 basis point fall in earning asset yields, partially  offset by a 13 basis point improvement in cost of funds.Capital One’s operating expenses for the reported quarter climbed 2.1%  sequentially and 8.4% year over year to $1.93 billion. The increase was  mainly due to a rise in salaries and associate benefits expenses.The managed efficiency ratio deteriorated to 56.47% from 52.96% in the  prior quarter and 51.23% in the prior-year quarter. The increase in  efficiency ratio indicates deterioration in profitability.Credit QualityCapital One’s credit quality continued to improve during the quarter.  Allowance, as a percentage of reported loans held for investment, fell  60 bps sequentially to 3.48%. Also, the net charge-off rate dropped 75  bps sequentially to 2.91%, as a continued improvement in credit led to  charge-off improvements across all business segments. The 30-plus day  performing delinquency rate also fell 17 bps sequentially to 2.9%.Similarly, provision for loan and lease losses declined 35.8%  sequentially and 52.6% year over year to $534 million. The decrease was  driven by lower charge-offs in the reported quarter.Capital and Profitability RatiosCapital One’s capital and profitability ratios continued to enhance  during the quarter. Tangible common equity (TCE) ratio for the quarter  improved to 7.9% from 7.3% in the prior quarter and 7.1% in the year-ago  quarter. Also, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio rose 70 bps sequentially  to 11.6%.The company’s tangible book value per share was $32.33 as of June 30,  2011 compared with $29.70 as of March 31, 2011 and $24.89 as of June 30,  2010.Peer PerformanceOne of the close peers of Capital One, Discover financial Services (NYSE:DFS)  posted a solid second quarter, reporting earnings substantially ahead  of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by a lower loan loss provision  and higher transaction and credit card sales volumes, which also drove  the loan loss reserve release growth. In addition, higher consumer  spending and merchant acceptance also contributed to the substantial  expansion of income across the direct banking and payment services  segments.Our ViewpointWe anticipate continued synergies from Capital One’s geographic  diversification. Additionally, the resilience of almost all its  businesses will continue to support the company’s financials. Further,  we believe with the addition of ING Direct USA, the combined company  will create a valuable banking franchise to take advantages of a large  number of branch banking in attractive high-growth markets and an online  banking franchise with a national reach. However, its commercial real  estate exposure will remain a drag. Also, a weak loan demand and the  impact of the financial reform law will restrict earnings in the near  future.Capital One currently retains a Zacks #2 Rank, which translates into a  short-term ‘Buy’ rating.

294601,24802,2011-09-20T00:30:31-04:00,,"Many people have seen the Capital One (NYSE:COF) commercials, which ask ""what's in your wallet?"" The question we want to ask, however, is what's in your portfolio, and can it benefit from including Capital One?Capital One is one of the largest credit card companies in America, and when it completes the acquisition of ING Direct, it will become the 7th largest bank in America, with some $320 billion in assets. We think now is a great time to invest in Capital One, given its depressed share price. Capital One has been working hard to improve its credit quality since the financial crisis, and its results speak for themselves. Charge-offs fell to 2.91% in the most recent quarter, down 75 basis points compared to the prior quarter, and its Tier 1 Common Equity Ratio reached 9.2%, up 80 basis points from the last quarter. Though Capital One took TARP money, it paid it back quickly to the federal government, and we see the taking of bailout money as a mere pause on the road to long-term success. The acquisitions of ING Direct and the HSBC credit card portfolio will add to Capital One's earnings very soon and will be accretive to long term earnings. The ING acquisition gives Capital One access to a loyal customer base and $80 billion in low cost deposits that allow it to diversify its funding base, further differentiating itself from its credit card competitors, who are banks in name only. Unlike Discover (NYSE:DFS) and American Express (NYSE:AXP), Capital One is the only US credit card company that has truly shown that it is embracing this kind of banking model."

To help investigate how the volume of Capital One traditional mail might be impacting online behavior, Compete assessed some simple search referral results.Credit for Direct Mail’s Impact? So far so good on connections: More people that searched on “Credit Card” on a major search engine were referred to capitalone.com than to any other financial services site. At over 8%, capitalone.com bested chase.com by over 25%. That implies a potential connection between regular mail and online awareness.

The preferred has a nice yield on a company that is extremely stable and generates plenty of cash flow. I recently sold the TRUPS securities and I encourage many investors to do the same.The TRUPS securities are trading well above par value and considering that the call date was on 06/15/2011, there is a certain amount of call risk that exists.However, I see Capital One calling its TRUPS preferreds back very soon. A couple weeks ago, Capital One issued a new preferred. The preferred has a yield of 6%, which is less than 7.5% that the company is currently paying on the TRUPS. In addition to this, the proceeds from this issue are more than twice that of the TRUPS security. So the company will have more than enough capital to redeem its TRUPS shares.If you look at the prospectus for the new issue, it even mentions that the company has intentions to use the proceeds and purchase the TRUPS securities. You can find it on page 15 of the prospectus.The reason I wrote this article is that I wanted investors to know two things:1. Prospective investors should not look into purchasing this security at all. There is a very high probability that the company will call its TRUPS and new investors will experience a loss since they will be buying above par value.2. Current investors should immediately liquidate their positions in the TRUPS security because they will be able to lock in a decent premium above par value as a profit.If you take a look at the chart for the TRUPS, you can see the market has began to recognize that the security could eventually be called. However, the TRUPS is still trading at a nearly 4% premium to par. This is a decent gain and investors should sell and lock in those profits.For your reference, the TRUPS are under the symbol of COF-B and the new preferreds are under COF-P.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

U.S. banking sector stocks have taken a beating in the past quarter and Capital One is no exception. In the first two quarters of this year, the company  reported better than expected results primarily because of higher revenues and lower provisions for loan losses resulting from an improved credit performance. However, in Q3 2011 it will be hard for the company to beat market expectations as the provisions for loan losses slowly begin to climb. Recently both Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) have reported decline in revenues for Q3 2011 because of which banking sector stocks declined sharply on Monday.See our full analysis of Capital One(Chart created by using Trefis' app)Little or No Decline in Provision for Loan LossesDelinquencies at Capital One have started to increase after falling for most part of 2011. The company reported higher delinquencies for its U.S. credit card business in September to 3.65% from 3.43% making it 2 months in a row of worsening credit. Its charge off rate dipped to 3.9% in September after rising to 4.1% in August. [1] These numbers suggest that Capital One’s provisions for loan losses may not decline any further in Q3 2011 and could start to increase going forward.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)Rising Credit Card LoansBanks have started issuing credit cards to sub-prime borrowers and have issued 5.4 million credit cards in the first half of the year which is a jump of 64% from the previous year. Steep declines in late payment and loan-loss rates have caused many banks to grow more confident and are lending to sub-prime borrowers in an attempt to accelerate growth. [2] Thus we expect Capital One to report an increase in its credit card loans in Q3 2011.We have a price estimate of $57.90 on Capital One’s stock which is nearly 40% above the current market price.Notes:Disclosure: No position"
247340,23479,2011-01-19T13:54:12-05:00,,"Capital One (NYSE:COF) is one of the largest banks in the United States, whose banking and non-banking subsidiaries market a variety of financial products and services. It competes with JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) in the credit card business.Capital One benefits from an increase in retail spending if the economic recovery continues in the U.S., and it presents upside for financial firms like Capital One whose profits are directly linked to consumer spending. Capital One also reported a decline in delinquencies for the month of November 2010 which would also boost its stock price. However, recently passed regulations like the 12 cents limit per debit card transaction enforced by Federal Reserve last month could potentially limit its upside.We explore upside and downside scenarios to Capital One’s credit card unit, which we estimate accounts for 41% of the $50.53 Trefis price estimate for Capital One’s stock which is about 4% above the current market price.10% Upside – Fall in DelinquenciesCapital One’s U.S. credit card 30-days delinquency rates which are an indicator of future credit card losses fell from 4.45% in October to 4.26% in November last year signaling that the consumers are recovering from the stress of the financial crisis [1]. However, the annualized net charge-off rate for U.S. credit cards rose marginally from 7.26% in October to 7.56% in November. The charge-off rate is the percentage of credit card debts that the company believes it will never recover. A lower delinquency rate would result in a lower charge-off rate in the future.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)A decline in delinquencies will have a direct impact on the provisions for losses which are expressed as a percent of total outstanding loans. Provisions for losses increased dramatically from 7.8% in 2007 to 16% in 2008 because of the credit crisis but recovered back to 10.6% during 2009 and 7.5% in 2010 as the banks have become more conservative in their lending standards and are avoiding making loans where the risks of default are high. We expect the provision for losses to further decline to 6.5% by 2012.There is a 10% upside to our price estimate for Capital One if the provisions for losses declined to 5% by 2012 due to falling delinquencies and stricter lending requirement which as a result of regulatory changes.3% Downside – Interchange Fee Limit on Debit Card TransactionsA key revenue stream for credit card companies like Capital One stems from the commission charged to merchants in a card transaction by the card-issuing bank, otherwise known as the interchange fee. The Durbin Amendment, enacted in July 2010, granted the Fed the power to control the levels of this fee. In December last year, the Fed enforced one such limit – 12 cents per debit card transaction. This limit could represent a loss of $13 billion in revenues for banks issuing debit cards, as per a report by CardHub.com [2].We wrote two articles recently that discussed the potential impact of the Durbin Amendment on banks and card issuers. (See Impact of Durbin Interchange Amendment on JP Morgan, Bank of America and Cap on Debit Card Interchange Fee is a Positive for American Express)(Chart created by using Trefis' app)We estimate that Capital One’s interchange fees will decline to about 0.4% by 2013 from its current level of 0.5% due to the regulatory changes but there is a 3% downside to our price estimate for Capital One’s stock if the interchange fees decline to about 0.2% by 2013.Notes:Disclosure: No position"
275473,21988,2011-06-17T13:18:56-04:00,,"After Thursday’s close, Capital One (NYSE:COF) announced the acquisition of ING Direct and the terms are favorable for Capital One shareholders.  Capital One will be paying tangible book value after the mark-to-market of ING Direct’s balance sheet.  The deal will be accretive to tangible book value and earnings immediately.  Capital One claims the IRR is greater than 20%.  In addition to the financial benefits, the operational and strategic benefits for Capital One are: With ING Direct’s deposit base, this deal reduces Capital One’s funding risk.  The $80 billion of ING Direct’s deposits will improve Capital One’s liquidity.  Over time, Capital One should be able to let low spread mortgage assets from ING Direct mature and roll off the balance sheet.  At the same time, Capital One will be able to pay off the rest of its risky wholesale funding.  This consolidation and optimization will increase the overall company’s returns and make the Capital One franchise more valuable.The ING Direct acquisition reduces the risk that Capital One does a large dilutive deal in the near-term.  The memories of Capital One shareholders are haunted by visions of the Hibernia and North Fork acquisitions at large multiples of tangible book value.  Some investors fear Capital One’s management team desire to be end-game players.  At least in the short-term, this deal should help mitigate these fears.  Plus, with the fix to Capital One’s liability structure, it takes pressure off management to acquire additional local banking franchises to gain access to deposit funding.This acquisition is an attractive way for Capital One to put capital to work.  Capital One is raising about $5 billion in common equity at 1.67x tangible book and investing it at 1x tangible book, which provides into $4 per share of tangible book value accretion.  ING Direct was in growth mode, so its expense base may not have been completely leveraged, which provides opportunity to Capital One.  Capital One can also test deposit pricing to see how sensitive ING Direct customers are to lower deposit rates.  Overall, Capital One claims an IRR on the deal of greater than 20%.Capital One fixes a mistake it made long ago by allowing ING Direct to become the leader in online direct banking.  In 2002, if there was a financial services company well position to be the leader in online direct banking, it was Capital One.  Capital One had been among the leaders in moving the credit card business into a national scale direct business.  Plus, Capital One was scarred from the securitization markets closing in 1998 and 2001.  Capital One’s leadership knew they needed deposit funding, and they made steps to move into online direct banking.  However, they allowed ING Direct to capture a huge lead and were never able to catch-up.  Maybe there were organizational distractions from the MOU in 2002 that prevented Capital One from being more aggressive.  This acquisition fixes the mistake.Capital One is the logical acquirer of ING Direct considering it is one of the few banks with scale in national consumer lending businesses like credit cards and auto loans.  Of the possible acquirers of ING Direct, Capital One is probably the only company that would be willing to continue to invest in the online direct banking platform.  Capital One’s management team uses a multi-period net present value framework for making investment decisions.  Another way of saying this is: management looks at the lifetime return on investment rather than a short-term payback model.  This leads to more rational long-term investments but can lead to lower margins in the short-term.  Most other acquirers of ING Direct would immediately try to raise margins by milking the deposit base and allow price sensitive deposits to roll off.  I bet Capital One will accept the lower margins and continue to grow the ING Direct platform.Some investors and market commentators will point to the open question about the franchise value of ING Direct.  Was ING Direct simply the best bid on the market for online deposits?  The fact that Capital One was able to buy the ING Direct franchise for tangible book value implies there is no franchise value.  However, I argue that there is franchise value to ING Direct that has not been realized yet.  There could be franchise value if Capital One is able to cross-sell additional products into the ING Direct customer base or if the customer base is less price sensitive than many believe.I’m surprised GE was not more aggressive in bidding for ING Direct.  Given that GE’s percentage of wholesale funding is higher than Capital One’s, one could argue that GE had more to gain by acquiring ING Direct’s deposit base.  Press reports point to GE’s unwillingness to acquire ING Direct’s mortgage assets.  This may make sense.Overall, Capital One shareholders will benefit from the ING Direct acquisition.  The transaction has low financial risk, improves Capital One’s liability structure, and puts capital to work in an attractive way.  Disclosure: I am long COF.W."

We currently  forecast the purchase volume to increase from $102 billion in 2009 to  $111 billion in 2011 but a swift economic recovery could potentially  push the purchase volume to nearly $130 billion by 2011, generating 5%  upside to our price estimate for Capital One stock.Drag the trend-line in the chart above to see how different purchase volume scenarios could impact Capital One’s stock value.5% Upside – Increase in Outstanding Balance on Credit CardsCapital One charges interest on outstanding credit card loans, which can increase significantly during periods of high consumer and business spending. The recently implemented CARD act by the US Congress, which forces credit card companies to disclose their rates and protects customers against unfair rate changes, is expected to boost consumer confidence, provoking increased spending and, consequently, higher outstanding credit card balances.We currently estimate a moderate increase in outstanding credit card loan balance from $20.8 billion in 2009 to $21.1 billion in 2011. If outstanding loan balances instead increase to about $30 million by 2011 on the heels of improved consumer confidence, and approaches $50 million by 2017, there could be an additional 5% upside to our price estimate.Drag the trend-line in the chart above to see how different outstanding credit card balance scenarios could impact Capital One’s stock value.Notes:Disclosure: No position"

This  also compares favorably to a net loss of 38 cents in the year-ago  period.   Results for the quarter benefited over the prior-year quarter primarily  from increased revenues and lower provision for loan losses. Also,  resilience and strong profitability of almost all of its businesses has  acted as positive catalysts in this downturn and credit turmoil.  However, an increase in operating expenses was the downside.   Excluding the loss from discontinued operations, Capital One’s GAAP net  income came in at $336.3 million or $1.40 per share, compared to a net  loss of $172.3 million or 44 cents in the earlier quarter.  Behind the Headlines   Total managed revenues for the quarter decreased 1.8% sequentially but  improved 14.8% year-over-year to $4.3 billion as the increased margin  was partially offset by a 2.9% decline in average loans.   Managed net interest margin (NIM) increased 20 basis points (bps)  sequentially and 121 bps on a year-over-year basis to 7.10%. The  sequential increase in NIM was driven by a 17-bp decrease in cost of  funds and a 3-bp increase in loan yields.   Net interest income decreased 1.8% sequentially but improved 17.4%  year-over-year to $3.2 billion. Non-interest income decreased 11.5%  sequentially but improved 7.7% year-over-year to $1.1 billion.   Managed provision for loan losses decreased 20.0% sequentially and 30.7%  year-over-year to $1.5 billion. The sequential decrease in managed  provision for loan losses was driven by lower charge-offs and an  allowance release of $566 million.   Capital One’s operating expenses for the reported quarter decreased 3.5%  sequentially but increased 6.5% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. The  managed efficiency ratio decreased to 43.07% from 43.85% in the prior  quarter and 46.25% in the prior-year quarter.   Average total deposits for the quarter increased 2.6% over the prior  quarter to $117.5 billion.  Questions Regarding Credit Quality  Capital One’s credit quality remained mixed during the quarter.  Allowance as a percentage of reported loans held for investment  increased 134 bps sequentially to 6.29%. Managed net charge-offs  decreased 7.8% sequentially but increased 1.4% year-over-year to $2.0  billion. The net charge-off rate has improved 35 bps sequentially to  6.35%. The 30-plus day performing delinquency rate decreased 53 bps  sequentially to 4.46%.  Evaluation of Capital and Profitability Ratios  Capital One’s tangible common equity (TCE) ratio for the quarter was  5.53%, down from the prior quarter level of 6.30%. The Tier 1 risk-based  capital ratio decreased 300 bps relative to the prior quarter to an  estimated 9.6%, and continues to stay above the regulatory  well-capitalized minimum.   Tangible book value per share of common stock was $22.86 as of Mar 31,  2010, compared to $27.72 as of Dec 31, 2009 and $23.91 as of Mar 31,  2009.   We anticipate continued synergies from Capital One’s geographic  diversification and expense management initiatives. The repayment of  bailout money and the warrants sell-off by the Treasury augur well for  investors as the company is now free from government intervention and  pay restrictions. However, its commercial real estate exposure will  remain a drag. We also believe the weakening demand for new loans and  the pressure on credit quality will restrict earnings in the near  future.  Comparison with Competitor   Rival card company American Express (NYSE:AXP) also reported its  first quarter results concurrent with Capital One’s earnings release  after the market closed on Apr 22, 2010. AmEx’s first-quarter earnings  from continuing operations of 73 cents per share were 10 cents ahead of  the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

In statements made on December 9, Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank predicted that the company's chargeoff rates would peak this quarter, while consumer credit cards are still facing ""elevated losses.""

There has been a fundamental shift in investors attitudes, habits and psychology,- It doesn’t seem that long ago that you could have gotten 4-5% on a savings account. Now the best savings and money market accounts are yielding under 2%.- Credit was free flowing and companies like Capital One (NYSE:COF) were mailing blank check loans to consumers hoping that they would spend, spend, spend. Now credit is much tougher to come by.- Oil was supposed to crack the $150 barrier by 2009. Oil now trades for almost half that value and was trading in the 50’s for much of 2009.- The greatest asset that most people have would decline in value. We were led to believe that home prices would only rise and could never decline. Homes were used as ATM machines to finance everything from vacations to car purchases.- As a nation we would change our consuming habits and becoming savers again. Personal savings rates for individuals changed from a negative .1% to a positive 6%.- The stock market would bottom out and hit a generational low in March 2009.

Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) is down Tuesday on disappointing spending by the consumer, but should be up by Wednesday. Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) had a rise in delinquencies; but not to worry - it was only down 4%, and now that this bit of fundamental news is out of the way we can rally it back on ... well certainly not valuation.I do see estimates for 2010 have been raised from about 0.00 to 0.70. As I wrote in this week's summary, for any remaining consumers who still carry debt in America, the rates are jumping big time as these companies position ahead of new regulations in 2010. Greater than 50x estimates out more than a year is cheap in this market, so I am surprised the stock even bothered to falter for a few hours.I dropped a quarter of my short exposure into this ""correction"", we are down 20% on the stake, but it's only a 2% position, now down to about 1.5%. At this point we have to question what seismic event it will take for that gap under $24 to fill.Specific to Capital One, I think all this delinquency data is now moot, since this firm can borrow from the Fed at nearly nothing and push that money into buying U.S. Treasuries for risk free gains, or letting consumers borrow it at 23%+. Even if the default rate is 25% (more than double from here) they should make money on a 20%+ spread on paying consumers. It's great to have the Federal Reserve making your business completely idiot-proof to run.The larger question, if indeed U.S. consumers matter anymore, is how will spending get back to the good ole days if easy credit is no longer available. Borrowing at 23-29% is very different than 0-12%. But these are not questions anyone is asking, and since the government now is taking the place of consumers as the spending machine of the economy, I suppose U.S. consumer's behavior is a moot point. When in need, simply put your hand out, and the government will fill it so you can go consume. Or pay back Capital One's debts.As for the greater market, as I stated once over S&P 1050, there really seems to be no resistance until 1100, so I have replaced those September SPY calls I got rid of late last week with 1 batch Monday (October 105s), and one Tuesday (October 106s). Until proven otherwise, S&P 1040 is the floor for now. I'm enjoying being complacent... it's sort of fun.I see now we are back to the pattern we had in March & April where you can buy S&P futures overnight when they are in the red and make a mint as the market surges to the green during the day. Almost like clockwork. I used to do a game when I wrote down S&P futures at midnight then checked at 9 AM and it almost created a gain (and a large one at that) March, and April - same thing past 2 sessions. I still wish someone who had access to the futures data could tell how much of the rally from March 6th was during normal market hours and how much has been during ""overnight"" when these futures are much more easily ""moved to the correct spot"".Short Capital One Financial in fund; no personal positionLong October SPY 105, 106 Calls in fund; long SPY 105 calls in personal account"

Please bear in mind, Barclays had a $20 target on the stock back in April. In May, the stock gained around 100% on Goldman Sachs upgrade from neutral to buy. It is our opinion that if Barclays wanted to have credibility regarding their call they should have announced an upgrade to the $50 level back in July when the stock was trading at $20.We have been bullish the stock up to the $35 level however it was recently recommended to close long positions at $34 reversing to the short side at $37.7 on the day Barclays decided to upgrade shares of Capital One Financial. Unlike Barclays, it is our belief upside in share price is limited to the $41 level at most therefore not justifying a new long position according to Barclays on the day shares opened at $37.7Here are some reasons for our sudden change in sentiment:1. Sentiment shows that most Wall Street analysts are now very bullish the stock unlike a few months ago when the stock actually bottomed (currently two have strong buy ratings while 3 months ago none of them rated the company a strong buy)2. New credit card law: From August 20, credit card issuers will have to give clients at least 21 calendar days to pay monthly bills and will have to warn consumers 45 days in advance of major changes in conditions, under provisions of a law signed in May by President Obama. However the biggest changes to the credit card industry looking to limit the ability of companies to impose fees, raise interest rates or sell credit card to students will not go into effect until February. This may support the stock short term giving some time for institutions to play with it before actual dumping begins. 3. Estimated available credit lines could be cut by about 20 percent, or $1.2 trillion, as banks adjust to comply with the new credit card law.4. In fiscal 2010, any recovery in the credit business is likely to be hampered by the enactment of the new Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights Act in the U.S. and other restrictive regulatory measures in the U.K. and European5. Public anger against credit card companies grew as the same banks that were penalizing customers for late payments started receiving billions of dollars of taxpayer money in federal bailouts: this important fact led the retail investor to sell short the stock however it is our belief they already covered having actual fear to short it giving the very strong momentum on share price.6. Share price has been rallying on better than expected credit card data however there is a limit for the “better than expected” buy approach: at the current share price the “better than expected” is perfectly priced in.We consider to close short positions assuming new long positions in case the stock sells off to more reasonable levels.

Despite the mixed picture, FBR Capital had a relatively upbeat view of the company earlier this week. The firm said that the credit card issuer's overall Q3 loss rates were lower than expected, and it predicted that Capital One's EPS will come in meaningfully above the Street's then-consensus estimate of 11c. However, FBR Capital thinks that in reality the Street is expecting the company to beat the consensus estimate, and it predicts that the stock will react to the company's guidance rather than its results. FBR Capital raised its target on the stock to $40 from $27, but maintains a Market Perform rating. Goldman Sachs has a rosier view of Capital One.

(NYSE:COF) stated a rise in its net annual charge-off rate to 9.60% in Nov 2009 from 9.04% in Oct 2009. The statement came as a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, thereby signifying its continuous credit card quality deterioration and payment failures.   The charge-off rate is the percentage of default loans compared to total loans of the company. Additionally, the rate for loans at least 30 days delinquent rose significantly to 5.87% in Nov 2009 from 5.72% in Oct 2009.   Although the charge-off rate in the auto-loan segment of the company fell from 4.32% in Oct to 3.67% in Nov 2009, the delinquency rate ascended to 9.57% from 9.30% in Nov 2009.   However, the non-U.S. position appeared to be marginally better. According to the SEC filing, Capital One’s charge-off rate for international card operations was flat at 9.50%, marginally up from 9.49%. The international delinquency rate was slightly down to 6.60% from 6.67%.   We believe the adverse trend of the charge-off ratio has accelerated in the recent quarters and is anticipated to continue at least through the first quarter of 2010. Cyclical factors such as the ongoing financial crisis across economies, weak capital markets, job losses and rising unemployment issues have contracted the consumers’ debt-paying capacity. We don’t expect any significant improvement on this front anytime soon.   Although the market condition may stabilize by mid to end of fiscal 2010, any recovery in the credit business is likely to be hampered by the enactment of the new Credit Cardholders Bill of Rights Act in the U.S. and other restrictive regulatory measures in the U.K. and European Union.

This incentive ends in November, and low home appraisals for foreclosure properties as resulted in many failed contracts.Even so, single family housing starts rose to a meager 490,000 annual pace, the highest since October.The Housing Market Index (HGX) continues to show a topping out pattern with a negative daily chart.Bad Loans continue to be Problems for Community and Regional Banks. According to the quarterly survey of banks’ senior loan officers conducted by the Federal Reserve, lenders continue to be stingy in loaning money to businesses, real estate developers and consumers. The tighter credit standards will remain for at least another year.For home mortgages, banks have tightened loan standards for eleven consecutive quarters by increasing down payments, wider interest rate spreads, and higher credit scores.Delinquency rates for all loans and leases at US banks increased to a record 6.49% in the second quarter up from 5.58% in Q1. For real estate loans, delinquencies increased to 8.27% from 7.10%.Credit card defaults are generally on the rise on rising job losses. Capital One (NYSE:COF) one of the largest issuers of Visa and Mastercard credit cards, tells us that the annualized net charge-offs for all US credit cards increased to 9.83% in July from 9.73% in June.

On top of this commercial property loans are a worsening problem for community and regional banks.Sources say that $83 billion of office, retail, industrial and apartment properties have fallen into default, foreclosure or bankruptcy so far this year. They say that GDP will be shaved by 0.5% this year and in 2010, hurting the prospect of ending the Recession.As I have been saying the easy credit of 2001 into 2007 resulted in developers building too many shopping malls and office buildings from 2004 to 2007. As the economy worsened by The Great Credit Crunch, vacancy rates rose with property values are down about 40% from their 2007 peak.Most of this years 77 bank failures included overexposures to C&D loans and CRE Loans, and more failures will occur. This is a clear indication that the deterioration of The Great Credit Crunch continues.Remember that question I submitted to the FDIC over the weekend? I asked what the current status of the Deposit Insurance Fund was, and whether or not they tapped their line of credit with the US Treasury.The FDIC’s response is laughable and shows a total lack of transparency promised by the Obama Administration. Let me repeat, “The FDIC does not keep track of the amount of money in their Deposit Insurance Fund on a daily basis”. No wonder our banking system is on the brink!With 56 bank failures since the end of March costing $15.676 billion to the Deposit Insurance Fund, I can only assume that the FDIC is in arrears by $2,669 billion, but they will probably show a positive balance on June 30 of $4.346 billion, because they will not add in the costs since June 30.

I thought it was an important story. The NY Times put the issue of Debt Repudiation on the table. Exactly where it belongs. The author also contributed a new adjective to describe many of America’s troubled borrowers, “Ruthless Defaulters”. This definition comes to us from the “lending” side of the equation. I think that is a misguided definition by the industry. I don’t think they know what they are up against. Yet.I disagreed with one premise of the article and wrote Mr. Streitfeld.I was going to respond to this privately but thought it might be interesting to throw this out for discussion. Neither Mr. Streitfeld nor I can say conclusively that the number of Ruthless Defaulters is either, (a) A small handful or (b) A significant number that is growing rapidly. In the blog world I can throw out some data and some anecdotal information and draw a conclusion of what it means to me. The readers will make up their own minds. My response:I follow default rates through Realtytrac. (And others) The numbers for June were terrible. In the first six months of this year there were an additional 1.5mm homes in default. Not all of these borrowers are Ruthless Defaulters. A significant majority were just fed up with the nightmare of home ownership.The personal bankruptcy rate is also soaring according to aacer (automatic access to court electronic records). They described July 09 as, “The hottest month for filings in three years”. From their report:A 50% rise year over year has nothing to do with Ruthless Defaulters. For $3,000 you can go chapter 7 and just say, “The hell with it all”. There is no downside. They are not ruthless, they are just defaulters. I have lived in a small town for 30 years and know a diverse group of people. I give free advice. Business has been booming for the past two years. I spend, at most, one hour with and individual or a couple. By the time they get to me there are typically only two possible outcomes:Admittedly, my narrow exposure to this is not indicative of anything on a broader scale. That said, the data on foreclosure rates and bankruptcy filings coupled with my neighbor's calls, tells me that the default rate on mortgages in excess of $500k is going to explode this fall. That timing is driven by the end of the ‘selling season’. With that, the CC numbers would follow. Broad based debt repudiation is a distinct possibility. It is the biggest systemic risk that we face. There is no fix to this. BBQ Talk:This is by no means a joke on my part. I was at the party.Click to enlarge:"

Also, COF’s U.S. auto annualized net charge-off rate rose to 3.89% in June from 3.62% in May. In addition, the delinquency rate increased to 8.89 percent from 8.59 percent. However, positives were noted. While COF’s international operations (to include Canada and U.K) showed a glimmer of improvement as the annualized net charge-offs for credit cards moderated to 9.26% from 9.77% for the same comparative periods, the delinquency rate was unchanged at 6.69% for the month. COF’s 2Q09 is expected to show the company's third straight quarterly loss next week, hurt like most of its rivals by growing credit losses and higher provisions for bad loans. A key indicator for the potential future loan losses -- the 30-day delinquent rate -- continued to exhibit positive trends, moderating for the fourth straight month, to 4.77% for June from 4.90% for May.

COF lost $112M. COF’s U.S. credit card charge off rate climbed from 8.1% last quarter to 8.4% this quarter. Perhaps of more note is the fact that that rate was 9.3% for the month of March. This shows quickly deteriorating conditions. Revenue fell $221.1M to $3.73B or about 5.6% relative to Q4 2008. Tangible Common Equity was 4.8% (an improvement of 20 basis points). COF added $14B in deposits with the acquisition of Chevy Chase Bank. This led to a net deposit growth of $12B for the quarter (a loss of $2B excluding Chevy Chase Bank).COF's US card business includes $11B in installment loans. The performance of these loans has been significantly worse than the rest of the credit card business. COF essentially stopped making these loans at the end of 2008. The old ones will continue to be a drag on 2009 earnings.COF expects the denominator effect to lead to an increase of 50 basis points in its charge off rate in Q2. In addition COF expects the new OCC minimum payment policies to lead to increases in charge off of 20 basis points in Q2, 80 basis points in Q3, and 50 basis points in Q4. In other words there will be a 70 basis point increase in charge offs for Q2 before even taking into account the increases due to further economic deterioration. For Q3 this figure would be 130 basis points.To get a clearer picture, the charge off rate for March increased to 9.3% due mostly to economic deterioration. One might estimate that the charge off rate for Q2 will be at least the 9.3% seen in March. If one adds the 70 basis points increase due to non-economic factors described above, this rate rises to 10.0%. That figure may be conservative!!! The charge off rate seems likely to increase perhaps dramatically due to economic factors. The losses incurred by COF should be commensurately larger.Auto Finance had a $71M net profit, but COF expects worse results for the rest of 2009.Recoveries on already charged off debt were lower than expected in Q1. This may bode ill for future quarters as the unemployment rate rises.Q1 non-interest expense declined $200M due to operating efficiencies. This was offset by declines in revenue (see above). In Q2 the costs associated with integrating Chevy Chase Bank will lead to an increase in non-interest expenses.The IMF yesterday lowered its world economic growth estimates from 0.5% to -1.3% for 2009. This is an almost 2% decrease since the IMF’s January estimate. The IMF also lowered its 2010 estimate from 3% growth to 1.9% growth.If the IMF news wasn’t bad enough, the Congress may have a huge problem in store for COF. Wednesday, a Congressional panel is expected to approve legislation that would curb high credit card fees and penalties assessed by banks that have benefited from the government’s financial bailout program. COF is one of those banks. There is some doubt about whether such legislation would pass. However, President Obama is firmly behind the general idea.Even without this last headache, COF stands to lose lots of money on its credit card business in 2009. If such legislation is enacted, COF will lose even more money. If the downtrend in world economic growth estimates from the IMF continues much further, COF will lose even more money. Charge off rates are almost certainly going to grow as unemployment rates in the US increase throughout 2009. COF may be reporting billions of dollars of losses soon. I don’t see a near term upside for this stock. It may recover in the future. However, that time is more than 6 months away. Wall Street does not usually like to bet on future circumstances that are so uncertain. If you like this stock, it might be more appropriate to sell it now. Then you can buy it back in October or November if at that time you think you can begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I see no light now. If fact, significant future NPL problems are likely to exacerbate COF’s current problems. The company even admitted to this in its conference call.Disclosure: I am short COF."

That equates to $21.6 billion charged on Capital One credit cards in the first quarter and $67.0 billion in outstanding balances.The portfolio is showing serious deterioration.

Fairbank, Capital One's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said:The problem with Capital One however is that it was never a true dividend growth stock. It pretty much paid the same quarterly dividend of $0.0267 for 13 years. Then in January 2008 the company increased its dividend to $0.375 and initiated a $2 billion stock buyback program. Investors.Because Capital One never had any record of consistently increasing dividends, I doubt that any dividend growth investors suffered as a result. The company that charges exorbitant rates to credit card holders should have rewarded shareholders better by sharing its prosperity through consistent dividend increases. The current dividend payment is still twice the size of the dividend payment in place over the whole 1995- 2007 period. I would not have been a holder of this stock as it never raised its dividend consistently even for ten years, unlike Citigroup (NYSE:C) , Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC).

If it is, chances are it will cut or suspend its dividend to you the shareholder. The typical excuses used by CEO’s are that this would make the company stronger and maintain its liquidity, or that would enable the company to repay the TARP money back.

116279,20149,2009-01-25T04:11:10-05:00,,"When I construct an equity portfolio, I focus on individual companies rather than sector allocations. My thought process is that if I can pick the winners and avoid the losers in any given sector, I don’t have to predict which sector will do well and which won’t.Now, I could go out on a limb and avoid all energy stocks, for instance, if I thought demand for oil (and therefore prices) would decline. But what if I was wrong? Energy stocks could soar and I would have no exposure whatsoever. Personally, I find it far easier to identify strong energy companies than to predict where energy prices will go.If the energy stocks I choose to invest in are better than average, then the energy portion of the portfolio will outperform the S&P 500. If I can replicate that in more sectors than not over the long term, then I can outperform the benchmark index. In a nutshell, that is how I try to beat the market over the long term.It sounds simple enough, but in unique times (such as today) rationality completely goes out the window, and that makes my job as a long term investment manager very difficult. I will use Capital One (NYSE:COF) as an example. If you believe in efficient markets, this will serve as some evidence against that hypothesis.I have followed Capital One for a long time and have written about it extensively over the years. In my view, it is one of the best managed and financially strong banking companies around. As a result, when faced with a choice of paying 10 times earnings for Citigroup (NYSE:C) or the same price for COF, I chose COF.My analysis has been mostly correct. Capital One has avoided huge losses on packaged securities of sub-prime loans and purchased various deposit banks before the credit crisis hit, which allowed it to maintain appropriate capital levels without begging the government for cash. As a result, the company’s tangible book value per share in 2008 dropped from $29.00 to $28.24, a loss of 2.6% in a year when many banks went out of business or were bailed out by the government and larger competitors.As you can see from the chart below, however, Capital One’s stock price has fared far worse than their book value deterioration would suggest. It has dropped 60%, from over $50 to under $20 as of Friday morning. Fundamental analysis has gone completely out the window lately.Sellers of Capital One will tell you that as the unemployment rate rises, Capital One’s loan losses will increase throughout 2009 and their earnings will decline, if not turn negative. I completely agree! Everybody knows this, including the company (management is forecasting $8.6 billion of loan losses in 2009, a dramatic increase from 2008).Still, that does not justify a 60% drop in share price coinciding with a 2.6% drop in tangible book value. Let’s say book value falls 10% in 2009 (nearly four times the 2008 rate), reflecting an even worse year. At the same rate (20% decline in stock price for each 1% loss in book value), COF shares would drop 200% in 2009. Fortunately, a stock can’t go down more than 100%!The market is behaving as if larger loan losses and a temporary disappearance of earnings threatens the survival of Capital One, although the company has a very strong balance sheet and can withstand these recession-related shocks, unlike many of their weaker competitors. Because such an assumption is off base, it makes very little sense for a long term investor to shun strong bank stocks in the current market environment.Capital One may trade at two-thirds of book value today (how that figure is justified, I don’t know), but when the recession ends and the unemployment rate begins to drop, the odds are very good that the stock trades at two times tangible book value or more, which means the stock could triple in value, even ignoring any increases in book value which would certainly result as time went on.Until then, the market will continue to only focus on the short term and conclude that a bad 2009 means companies like Capital One somehow have bad business models or are broken in some way. In actuality, they are simply riding the economic cycle. Finance companies make good money when times are good and do poorly when they aren’t. Fortunately, the good times far outlast the bad times.Full Disclosure: Peridot Capital was long shares of Capital One at the time of writing, but positions may change at any time."

Essentially, it comes down to this: if you take loans on bank balance sheets and mark them to market, you can show that the bank is insolvent. Of course, bank loans held for investment are not marked to market according to GAAP (instead loan loss reserves are set aside over time to cover future losses), but why let some silly accounting rules get in the way of bank solvency analysis!Here is a graphic put together by Townsend to illustrate how a bank (in this example, Capital One (NYSE:COF), a Peridot holding coincidentally) can be very solvent under GAAP but insolvent if you mark every loan on its book to market.

Remember, the analyst is suggesting a bullish strategy.Here are the highlights of the analyst’s report and a few comments:So, Mr. Rathnam, Capital One should just abuse its current customers and demand that they pay for the problems associated with the remainder of the company? Wow, I do not want to be your client! Also, have you noticed that there is pending legislation to stop these types of egregious practices? And one more thing…. kindly see this little item about COF capping fees for cardholders. Maybe you missed this piece that discusses how Capital One is freezing the variable rates on some cards and converting them to fixed.Charge-offs trending lower? What information are you looking at? The latest report released yesterday shows a 13% increase in charge-offs since December, 2007. Moreover, you should know this: Charge-offs decline during economic expansions. We are in a totally different market condition now. Also, write-offs PEAK just prior to an economic recovery. The latest 8-K reports charge-offs are 4.11% for managed and 5.46% for national lending (credit card segment notching up to 6.54%).Question: Wasn’t 2003 the start of the recovery? Isn’t 2008 the beginning of the decline? With all respect, I believe you should revisit Econ 101. I will not get into the fact that there is a clear uptrend going on. (Chart courtesy of Capital One investor meeting March 2007.)Defaults improbable? Where is the money common from to pay the bills? How out of touch you are with what is going on down here with us common folk. Give me some cake, please…YIKES!!!! That is one of the largest problems… That off-balance sheet item ($49B) has a default rate of 5.8% where the base portfolio is 3.26%. What are you looking at? Is it possible that the recent 12 months of reports from the company have not made it to your desk?

Given that Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) has dipped heavily into the subprime borrower market, it seems to reason that COF will be a large part of the collateral damage. So far, COF has been able to keep charge-offs at a manageable rate, one that was stable at 6.1% in March and April. This leveling off of the charge-offs in the most recent month prompted Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Foran to offer optimistically, “any sign that credit deterioration in U.S. cards could be taking a breather is positive.” COF’s stock is currently 30% above the January low and has traded in an ascending triangle, as the chart below shows. While the stock is up this morning, it is testing the bottom of the triangle pattern. Ominously, on balance volume shows a significant divergence from the price pattern, with at least three significant distribution days (down on above average volume) over the past four weeks. While XLF, XBD, C and LEH are all important indicators of the health of the financial sector, keep an eye on COF to see how the credit crisis is affecting subprime credit card holders.

This includes never saying things like: “Back on such and such a date we highlighted the problems with XYZ and today they went bankrupt.” Additionally, when necessary I have no qualms about taking myself to task about information that, although always well intended, I might have misinterpreted or a statistic I might have gotten wrong, even going so far as accepting grammatical help from a British friend and reader. After all, we are all just human.With that in mind, I wrote yesterday about the widening CDS spreads and declining stock price in Capital One (NYSE:COF) since their earnings announcement and the negative outlook proffered by their CEO when he said: “U.S. credit card charge-off rates are going cross 10% in the next couple of months, up from 8.4% in Q1.” Since I don’t give recommendations or opinions here I’m not going to climb into the stockade but I do think the COF situation requires a little more space this morning.It would seem that in the face of what the company itself describes as “higher charge offs” in the months to come the management at COF decided to institute a $0.05 quarterly dividend yesterday. With the stock closing at $16.93 that works out to a yield of about 1.18% In the same breath it also announced that it would cut 58 employees from its credit card division. This is the same bank that sold $3.55BN worth of preferred stock and warrants which amounted to 26% of its market cap at the time to Uncle Sugar under the TARP.I am as “free markets” oriented as the next person but something here just doesn’t seem to jive. The world is waiting on pins and needles for the Treasury’s Stress Test results; every pundit in the world is expecting unemployment in this country to cross over into double digit land and the Government has just spent the $1.197BN between the stimulus and the Omni-pork bill to stem the flood tide of out of work workers. COF itself said it expects worsening business conditions.Even with the comment yesterday by KBW that “COF can avoid a capital raise even in an adverse scenario,” does it make sense to institute a dividend and lay people off on the same day? Evidently it does to the market as the stock rose $2.55 or 15% yesterday while the CDS came in 13bps or 3.75%.Isn’t this the kind of stuff that should get the boys and girls in D.C. blustering about wasting hard earned tax payer money meant to save the banks, and not profit the shareholders? Has COF used all of the commotion surrounding BAC’s acquisition of MER to slip by the bouncer unnoticed? Where is Barney Frank when you need him most?"
61693,21423,2008-01-27T04:02:14-05:00,,"Recent earnings guidance from Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) revealed that delinquencies on its credit card and auto loan portfolios are on the rise, and starting to show up as rising defaults. As I read this, it occurred to me that there are many similarities between the business models of Countrywide Mortgage Corp (CFC) and Capital One. Both are basically payment processing operations, attached to a bank, using cheap deposits to fund originations, and both cater to subprime borrowers. Both have relied on the debt markets to bundle loans and sell as securities to replenish working capital. And both, regardless of the efficiency of their operations, are at the mercy of larger trends in the economy, especially in their exposure to the fortunes of low-income working families. As home prices fall, real estate equity evaporates. In the recent past, it was common for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to borrow against the equity in their homes to pay off credit card debt, or in more urgent situations, to sell their homes to pay off delinquent mortgages and credit cards. As more homeowners find themselves in a negative-equity situation, this option becomes unavailable, and thus defaults and foreclosures rise. Credit card processing, like mortgage servicing, works on very thin margins, usually only pennies per account per month, and when the economy is healthy, and borrowers are making timely payments, these costs are low, and profit margins are high. When delinquencies rise, collections expenses increase, and what were once inexpensive electronic payment transfers and simple check-processing become increasing hours of telephone calls between collections agents and borrowers, as well as mailing expenses on default notices, and then legal expenses, as more accounts go deeper into default. What triggered the sudden drop in Countrywide's share price? The change from a buy to a sell rating by one Merrill analyst, perhaps, and the realization that there was nothing that could be done to change the trajectory of losses from Countrywide's servicing portfolio. And, of course, the mention of the ""B"" word. Countrywide was saved from bankruptcy by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and I suspect that losses from CFC's operations will put a drag on BA earnings for years to come, and that potential would-be suitors for Capital One, should it find itself in the same boat, will be few, wary, and unwilling to pay aggressively to acquire their book, and the loss exposure that comes with it."
60569,21406,2008-01-17T10:04:39-05:00,,"On Wednesday, January 16, 2008, Fitch affirmed its previous A- ratings on Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF), citing the company’s strong business and solid liquidity. The stock closed the day up 3% from its previous day's $42 close. The Fitch report presented a fairly stable picture of the company and handed a bit of hope to the bulls.  However, I want to take a look at the language in the report, and a few other facts, and show why I think this presents a rather bearish case for the company. Fitch had this to say about the company’s situation: Credit deterioration beyond current expectations with a corresponding hit to segment profitability, particularly in US Card, an absence of earnings and asset quality improvement in the auto segment, decreased liquidity, or weakening risk-adjusted capitalization could trigger negative rating actions (and earnings potential). I would like to substitute that word “could” in the report with “will”. If we take a look at the business segments mentioned we will see that the credit card and auto loan segments are the areas in which the latest round of the subprime situation has manifested itself. There have been recently published reports of increased credit card delinquencies and auto loan defaults. And get this- Capital One is one of the leading subprime credit card issuers with a reputation of extending credit to less than suitable borrowers. As far as the part about decreased liquidity is concerned, we all know that reasonably priced financing is hard to come by with the confidence in the credit markets so seriously shaken and most lenders taking a wait and see approach or seeking capital injections to beef up their own balance sheets. The fact is that the worsening macroeconomic conditions will only impact negatively on the business segments mentioned and you can add to that the personal, student and mortgage loan businesses which Capital one also operates. But just in case we are too far gone with the pessimism, Fitch wants us to know that all is not lost and that stabilization of segment credit metrics, improvement in the UK credit card portfolio, and a turnaround in the auto business with the development of consistent segment profitability, could provide positive rating momentum. Interpreted to mean they are hoping that not withstanding the mess in the credit markets, the economy and an increasingly burdened consumer, improvements in the auto business will save profitability. We know better. Just last Thursday the company announced that its full year profit would come in 21% lower than forecast citing, among other things, mounting consumer loan losses. I think it only gets worse from here on. I also get the feeling that there is a lot of crisis management taking place. Evidence of this lies in the fact that the company basically had their bank, Capital One National Association, through a holding company; take over the Auto Finance portfolio on the basis that it will allow: the auto business to leverage the bank's deposit funding. This change will make COF less reliant on the capital markets, which is a positive development, given the uncertain environment. It seems to me that they are seeing early signs of trouble in the Auto loans business and are taking preemptive steps. This could be seen as good management if it were not for the fact that the auto loan business will not be the only segment that will need propping up. Furthermore in its most recent sec filing COF stated that their balance sheet position is very strong with some 29 billion in available liquidity. But I would like to point out that this “liquidity” consists of: unencumbered and highly liquid investment securities, unused committed conduit capacity, and available borrowing capacity from the Federal Home Loan Banks. OK. I have a few questions here. What exactly are these highly liquid investment securities? Are they of the subprime variety? How long will they remain “highly liquid” in this credit environment? Just how committed is this unused conduit capacity in this increasingly recessionary economy? And when they speak about borrowing from Federal Home Loan Banks are they referring to the Macs- meaning Fannie (FNM) and Freddie (FRE)? The same Fannie and Freddie with the ailing balance sheets? The present situation does not look so good for COF. They are trying to deal with the problems but their methods are suspect (shifting auto finance to its bank). And their contingencies are questionable at best. I expect a little more light to be shed on the COF situation at their earnings conference call later this month when the questions start coming in. If the answers to some of these questions do not hold water (and I suspect they won’t) the downgrades will be fast and furious and the stock price will falter further. Of course, the Fed will probably dish out a 50 basis point cut at the end of the month and throw a lifeline to COF and the entire financial sector. I expect an initial positive reaction in the stock price and then, when the situation is reassessed, we should continue on our downward march. The Fed will not be able to help everybody. The reason why capital is so hard to get these days is not due to a lack of money; there is plenty of money in the system. The problem is a lack of confidence in the system - and a lot of uncertainty about what lies on the balance sheets (and in the SIVs) of financial companies like COF.

Full Disclosure: Long shares of Capital One at the time of writing."
59849,20306,2008-01-11T06:28:28-05:00,,"Should we be surprised that Capital One (NYSE:COF) warned yesterday morning? No. When Capital One announced that its 2007 earnings would fall short of previous expectations, thanks in part to loan delinquencies, how could you be shocked? The only shock is that there are those that believe this is the bottom for the company. It's not. And I'd use any up-move to short even more. This isn't the first time I've encountered a Capital One short opportunity. Along with the homebuilders, lenders, subprime, Alt-A, and prime names I was shorting for former readers, I also saw a profit opportunity from credit card companies, especially those with subprime exposure. Wooing Higher RiskWhen homeowners become delinquent in housing payments, the lender can foreclose on the property. But when a credit card borrower becomes delinquent in monthly payments, one of the things the bank can do is give that borrower more credit or market credit availability to those with poor credit. That would explain why companies like Capital One (COF) have tanked from $80 to under $40 in recent months. A 2007 Boston Globe article reported:That means that credit card issuers boosted their marketing efforts to a group of people that are having a hard time paying other bills. Thinking that these same people would be able to pay off credit card debt, the companies offered more credit. These are the people that can no longer refinance or tap into home equity, and are turning to credit cards as a last alternative. Unfortunately, the move proved to be a bad one. Delinquencies on the RiseIn the first five months of 2007, credit card delinquencies were 3.7% higher than 2006. Late payments were up by 30% over the same time. Even more interesting, and worrisome for those long credit companies, is the fact that throughout the housing boom, home equity was used to pay off credit card debt. But nowadays, with home equity woes, people can't do that any more. As of November 2007, credit card debt ""soared at an 11.3 percent annual rate in November following an 8.5 percent rate of increase in October."" There's more than $850 billion of credit card debt out there, as we speak. Worse, according to this BusinessWeek article, delinquencies are still on the rise, spelling further bad news for credit card issuers… especially credit card issues to subprime folks. Other negatives for the likes of Capital One… The company may have shut the door on GreenPoint Mortgage, but it's another subprime credit card / auto loan lender witnessing delinquency problems. What's shocking is that no one saw this coming. I did, in February 2007, as my team and I shorted homebuilders, lenders, Alt-A, subprime, and big banking names. And if you don't believe me, here's a video I was asked to do in June 2007. Be sure to stay tuned for my new options service coming soon.Disclosure: none"

That was to be expected given their announcement that their GreenPoint Mortgage Business had died and needed to be buried. Financial funerals are very expensive.   Executive comments were front end loaded with how well the share repurchase program was going and supporting the stock. I guess you lead with your best card in these cases. Speaking of share repurchase, the ASR (Accelerated Share Repurchase) was completed in August at a cost of billions of dollars of capital at a time when huge losses are occurring and extra capital would be a good idea.While the ASR was going great guns, Richard D Fairbank (Chairman, President & CEO), was very actively selling during the same time frame. Given the very bad news that was blowing up at the time, the sales have a very ""Angelo Mozilo"" quality to it. We will have to see how it all turns out."
45170,20929,2007-08-21T16:35:19-04:00,,"Every week there seems to be another mortgage malaise casualty and this week it was Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF). 
From Reuters:
Based on the most recent data I could pull-up, Capital One’s TTM net earnings were about $2.4 billion, so the $860 million charge is equivalent to about 35.83% of its TTM net earnings. As we can see from COF’s slashing of its earnings forecast, the closure of GreenPoint Mortgage will decrease 2007’s forecasted earnings by about 1/3rd as well. 
Before investors go rushing to Capital One’s shares expecting that the worse is over now that they’ve shuttered their subprime mortgage unit, I’d like to remind them of the following:
1) The “Rise” reported in the Reuter’s article was approximately $0.02 
2) Since the beginning of the “mortgage crisis”, has there been a single lender that only released a single bit of bad news, OR has the pattern been that a single instance of bad news is nearly always followed by several more negative announcements?  At the moment, I believe we’re only seeing the weakness in one subprime unit; Capital One offers ARMs, HELOCs and low documentation loans which could begin hurting earnings at any minute. After all, ARMs are hurting prime and subprime lenders, Alt-A lenders are dropping like flies and Countrywide reported problems with its prime HELOCs nearly a month before its current troubles surfaced. 
3) Cutting your profit outlook for the year by 1/3rd is nothing to gloss over. Whilst COF has implemented various cost cutting initiatives that will help mute the impact of the charge, the decline in profit will undoubtedly hurt COF’s expansion efforts, in the form of buying regional banks as both a diversification tactic and as a source of cheap deposits. 
4) Capital One is also a subprime credit card lender, and whilst they saw strong results from their credit card business last quarter, delinquencies are increasing. 
5) Capital One has exposure to the subprime auto loan business and in its last quarterly report, noted a significant decrease in the profitability of its auto lending business as a whole (prime and subprime). Profits within the auto lending segment dropped by nearly 60% and the provision for lending losses increased by roughly 143%. During Q1 of last year, auto lending constituted 17% of net income and for the most recent quarter it constituted 5%. Now, COF’s other business units more than made up for the decline in auto lending, but it’s still a cause for concern. It’s also worth noting that Capital One securitizes a great deal of its subprime auto loans; considering the current state of the market, it’s safe to say that it’s going to be more expensive for that unit to operate, even if the profit declines and loan default trend were to reverse. 
For now, I would maintain a “wait and see” outlook on Capital One as it has two additional subprime dominoes that could indeed fall, as well as possible weakness in its mortgage business overall. While I believe that COF will weather this storm, I think that the stock will become even cheaper in the next 3-6 months due to weakness in its credit card, auto lending and home lending businesses. 
Disclosure: The Author doesn’t own a position in Capital One and hopes that disclosing this won’t cause the Huns from the COF commercials to come swooping down on him and force him to purchase the stock: “What’s in your portfolio?”"

45097,20954,2007-08-21T07:15:48-04:00,,"The latest victim of the subprime crisis, Capital One Financial Corp. lowered its 2007 earnings outlook after halting residential-mortgage origination operations at its wholesale mortgage banking unit GreenPoint Mortgage. Citing near-term profitability challenges given current conditions in the secondary mortgage markets and the likelihood that markets for prime, non-conforming products will remain challenging for the foreseeable future, the ninth-largest U.S. bank by market value said GreenPoint, which specialized in nonconforming loans, will cease making new loan commitments immediately, but continue to meet contractual obligations for commitments to customers with locked rates already in the pipeline. The company will close GreenPoint’s California headquarters along with 31 locations across 19 states, resulting in the elimination of some 1,900 jobs. The company estimated an after-tax charge of $860M ($2.15/share) related to the closure, including $110M related to ongoing operations, and therefore revised its 2007 earnings forecast down by that amount to $5/share. Without the charge, Capital One said it would have maintained its earlier outlook as its other businesses remain on a “solid trajectory,” with revenue growth and credit performance in line with expectations. “Capital One’s other businesses are supported by ample liquidity and funding including deep access to deposits, a ‘stockpile’ of subordinated credit card funding in place that allows approximately $9B of AAA credit card funding going forward, and a $25B portfolio of highly liquid securities,” said CFO Gary Perlin. Capital One noted that it will retain a $12.5B mortgage portfolio that includes $680M of second mortgages originated by GreenPoint. Capital One will continue to originate and sell traditional mortgages through its 750 bank branches.

51077,20929,2007-10-24T05:54:34-04:00,,"By now, Capital One’s (NYSE:COF) Q3 loss stemming from the closure of their
GreenPoint mortgage unit has been fairly well documented. So rather than beat
the dead mortgage horse for another bank, let’s review the results from their
auto lending and credit card units. The fact that Auto Lending has gone from a net
profit of nearly $100M in Q2 of ’06 to a loss of nearly $4 million in Q3 of ’07
hasn’t gotten enough attention, nor has some of the problems within their
credit card unit. First, let’s quickly review some of the high level data from Q3 (see conference call transcript):Now, the results from their Auto Lending and Credit Card segments: Auto Lending: COF’s auto lending
segment has been in decline for some time and reported a net loss (as I
predicted in September)
of $3.8 million. After recording $95.1 million in net income in Q2 of ’06, the
unit has generally trended downwards typically generating net income of
$30-$40m per quarter. If we look at credit quality metrics over that time
period we see that loans that are 30+ days delinquent have risen by 57% and net
charge offs have increased by 131%. The losses come despite the fact that COF increased
total loan originations and revenue; if the unit continues to lose money it’s a
clear indication of a need for higher credit standards. COF can “spin” this situation as a change from a time period with
historical low delinquency rates, but credit quality is still deteriorating,
the unit is losing money and will probably continue to do so or the next 2-3
quarters. Thinking about the larger economy, the performance of COF’s auto lending
unit could be an indicator of weakness in auto lending space overall,
particularly in the subprime segment. I wouldn’t be surprised to see auto
lending follow the same trend as mortgages: problems in the subprime segment
are followed by problems within the prime segment. If people are losing their
homes, it’s just a matter of time before some of them lose their cars as well. The big question is: what measures is COF taking to rectify this
situation? Credit Cards: The story with
this unit is rather simple, COF is (at the moment) able to grow the business
faster than the rate of delinquencies and losses, so net income continues to
grow, with net income increasing 33% YoY. With respect to credit quality Q3
delinquencies increased 3.29% to 4.43%, roughly 35.6% on a YoY basis and
charge-offs increased by 25%, moving from 3.30% to 4.13%. In Q4 the company
expects the charge-off rate for credit cards to hit 5.25%. However, it’s worth
noting that a combination of policy changes, moving from a 30 day to 25 day grace
period, a changed fee structure, etc, “goosed” these numbers a bit.Thinking about the future of Capital One’s credit card business I have
some concerns due to their increased “courting”
of the subprime credit card market. Subprime Mortgages and Auto Loans are already
hurting the company’s bottom line, so I’m not particularly confident about
their ability to successfully evaluate subprime credit card customers.
Mortgages, Auto Loans and Credit Cards could easily turn into a “subprime
triple whammy” for COF. Another item I find troubling is that their new policies and fees and
made it harder for some of their customers to pay their credit card bills on
time, as it indicates that many of their customers are struggling to hold on.
It’s not uncommon for delinquencies from new financial pressures to be a
lagging indicator, so I wouldn’t be surprised if the changes to the COF credit
card agreements continue to increase the delinquency and charge-off rate in
future quarters. Another scenario stemming from the changes to agreements and
fees (especially if it’s enough to cause defaults) is that other customers may
simply stop using the cards all together, cancel the accounts, etc. Finally,
their plan to offer fewer teaser rate cards may back-fire as it may result in
them winning fewer prime customers who can easily get teaser rate cards from
other banks. Overall I’m not bearish on Capital One, if they can continue to
diversify their business, develop the retail banking segment and avoid the
pitfalls of the subprime market they can continue to grow the company. I also
think their new found focus to return more earnings to shareholders in the form
of dividends and share buybacks is a good move as well. However, the company
has some significant short-medium pitfalls to overcome, which are likely to put

33282,20149,2007-04-24T06:13:39-04:00,,"Frankly, I prefer my headline above to the one I saw atop an Associated Press piece on Friday that was quite a bit more frightening: It's a shame that whoever wrote that article didn't really do much research before writing about the company's first quarter earnings report last week. First, the facts: What about mortgage woes leading to a profit plunge? Why isn't that fact number three? Well, that's not really what happened. The year ago comparison was affected by one-time gains in 2006, so profits really didn't fall by 43% on an apples-to-apples basis, despite what many articles have stated. The weakness in the mortgage market was the main reason that Capital One reduced guidance for the year by 40 cents, but it was not a large contributor to the widely reported (but misleading) 43% profit decline. Capital One's mortgage business lost $12.6 million in the first quarter, reversing a year ago profit of $35.4 million. Since Capital One has 415.5 million outstanding shares, we can calculate how much the mortgage business contributed to the profit decline. A delta of $48 million equates to a negative impact of $0.12 per share. Twelve cents! The sky is hardly falling. Capital One's mortgage division is a very small part of their business. Last year they bought North Fork, a New York regional bank with a mortgage division called Greenpoint. Even after the acquisition, most of COF's profit stills comes from credit cards, not mortgages. As for Capital One stock, it's no surprise that the shares fell more than $4 after releasing a weak earnings report and lower guidance. As I mentioned recently when talking about M&T Bank Corp. (NYSE:MTB), the regional banks will have short term earnings pressure due to the flat yield curve and a weak mortgage environment. First quarter reports from these banks will be disappointing, as was the case with both MTB and COF. However, investors in Capital One stock (myself included) should view the shares as a long term investment. The current banking environment (flat yield curve and unprofitable mortgage lending) will not persist forever. Now, I do not know when mortgages will return to the black (Capital One is assuming no incremental mortgage earnings in 2007) and I cannot tell you when the yield curve will steepen. It might be six months, one year, two years - I just don't know. Frankly, nobody predicted the yield curve would stay flat this long. In fact, this is the longest period it ever has stayed flat without a recession. However, that time will come. It always does. Why should investors continue to hold consumer lending stocks like Capital One if 2007 earnings are likely to be weak and positive catalysts could be months or even years away? Because the stock is a bargain. If you wait until the mortgage market improves and the yield curve steepens, COF shares will be $90, not $70, and you will have missed 20 points very, very quickly. How much downside is there in Capital One stock in the low 70's? Not much in my view; it probably continues in its recent trading range (the stock has been dead money for a while). Even in the negative business environment we currently see for consumer lenders, COF is still most likely going to earn more than $7 per share this year, giving the stock a P/E of 10 on a depressed earnings level. Once things improve, earnings will soar and the multiple should expand. When that happens, COF could easily be in the triple digits, but unless you buy the stock beforehand, the train might leave the station without you.

He lists his favorite five stock picks for the years ahead. They are: Anadarko (NYSE:APC)  Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF)  Centex (NYSE:CTX)  Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN)  MetLife (NYSE:MET) As I always look to capture a return on my subscription investment, I decided to research and purchase one of the five stocks recommended by David Williams. My selection is Capital One Financial, due to the stability of the equity over the last five years with additional appreciation opportunity. Company Overview Capital One Financial Corporation operates as the holding company for the Capital One Bank, which offers various financial services in the United States and Canada. It accepts demand deposits, money market deposits, NOW accounts, and certificates of deposits, as well as offers consumer loans; commercial loans; automobile and other motor vehicle financing, including financing for the purchase of new and used vehicles, as well as refinancing of existing motor vehicle loans. The bank also offers credit card products, as well as small business lending, installment lending, and health care financing. The company invests in various securities, including the U.S. Treasury and other U.S. government agency obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, and asset backed securities. The company was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in McLean, Virginia. 5 Year Financial Trends  For the 5 year period of 2002 to 2006 [TTM], COF has achieved a revenue compounded growth rates of 12.0%, with annual growth increasing every year of the 5 years. The net income growth has outpaced revenue with a 5 year growth rate of 28.0% with every year in the double digit rate. Resulting in a consistent improvement in the return on sales metric.  Historical Stock Performance If you invested $10,000 on Jan 2nd, 2002 in COF common stock, your portfolio balance would be worth $15,358 or an 7.4% annual return, ~2.0x higher than the S&P 500 of 3.7%. The equity has achieved most of the increase in 2003 and 2004, with a –11% performance for 2006. On a 2007 YTD basis, the equity is up 7% as of February 9th, 2007.  Value Scorecard A very impressive value scorecard for COF, capturing a passing mark on 6 of the 8 indicators. The strongest of the passing grades is within the free cash flow yield section, coming in at 14.9%. Of the 2 failing marks, there is a slight inconsistency with Free Cash Flow and the update long-term debt to book value has been improving every year.  Sensitivity Chart My current valuation model is resulting with the common equity of COF to be valued at a market cap of $39.1 Billion or $95.34 per share. Here are my assumptions: Here is the sensitivity chart on annual sales increase per year vs. the perpetuity rate:  Disclosure: Author does not own any COF shares but has the intention of owning shares in a few days."

""For the subprime sector, 60-plus-day delinquencies (on 2005 loans) once again moved above the levels seen in the 2003 and 2004 vintages after a steady five-month increase,"" S&P said. A slight uptick in delinquencies among subprime car loans suggests that subprime mortgage holders, unable to make their house payments as their adjustable-rate mortgages are reset upward, are also having trouble making their car payments. Car loan delinquencies might also be exacerbated by the relaxation of credit standards by some subprime auto lenders, like Capital One Financial. Still, the impact of the subprime mortgage crisis on car loans will likely be contained, since most subprime auto borrowers are renters, not homeowners. High-quality car loans, like their housing equivalents, continue to do well.

16226,20149,2006-08-31T19:15:29-04:00,,"Last Friday I found myself astounded that shares of Capital One (NYSE:COF) were hitting new 52-week lows at $69 and change. As far as large cap growth stocks go, I'm not sure there is any stock out there that looks more attractive to me at current levels than COF. Normally I might not share my best ideas on this blog, but in my mind this represents an excellent opportunity that I wanted to mention to my readers. Of course, the stock has rebounded to $73 over the last several days, but the dichotomy between the company's outlook and the stock price remains evident. Capital One is one of the cheapest non-cyclical names in the S&P 500 index right now. With such a meager valuation (around 9 times forward 12-month earnings) one might think the growth outlook for the company was murky. However, when I look at what they are doing, and at the expansion possibilities they have over the next several years and beyond, I can't help but me completely baffled by the market's recent distaste for the stock. Whenever this happens, I just sit back and hit the ""buy"" button. As most of you probably know, Capital One made a name for itself in the consumer lending business via direct mail and media advertising. For the next leg of growth, COF management has decided it could leverage its brand awareness by expanding into retail banking and owning bricks and mortar branches as a new distribution network for its products. Capital One bought Hibernia Bank last year, entering the Louisiana and Texas markets. This year they announced plans to acquire New York based North Fork Bank. The deal is expected to close prior to year-end. Since announcing the North Fork deal, COF shares have fallen 20% from their closing high of $90 per share. There are many reasons why investors could be concerned, but none of them really warrant the kind of price cut we've seen, in my view. Let's go through the list of possible negatives for Capital One. Now I can't refute any of these bearish arguments outright. The only thing I can do is look at the track record of Capital One's management, look at the strategy they are undertaking, consider the expansion opportunities left even after these two bank deals are digested, and determine if the company's growth outlook for the next 3 to 5 years warrants a P/E ratio of 9 times earnings. When the North Fork deal was first announced, COF presented a model to investors that showed an EPS target of $10 per share in 2008, the first full year after the integration, was possible. If they hit that number, we're looking at only 7 times post-merger earnings power at current prices. Given that Capital One's expansion into retail banking will have only encompassed three states out of fifty by 2007, the growth opportunities for COF remain bright. There is no reason to doubt the company can deliver double digit earnings growth for the rest of the decade and perhaps beyond. And if they ever decide to sell COF outright, the stock trades at a price-to-book ratio of 1.4, whereas recent bank deals have been priced at 2.0 to 3.0 times book. All in all, a single digit multiple for COF, at this stage in their growth track, seems like one of the best large cap bargains around in the domestic equity market. COF 1-yr Chart"
14118,20149,2006-07-24T10:20:33-04:00,,"Last quarter Capital One (NYSE:COF) blew past earnings projections, reporting $2.86 versus the consensus estimate of $2.06 per share. Despite the beat, the company kept its annual guidance steady at $7.40-$7.80 for 2006.  Some investors were disappointed that Q1 was so strong but the company was seemingly being conservative about the year. When asked, management expressed that they saw things being tougher and uncertain later in the year, prompting them to reiterate their guidance rather than raise it. Fast forward to this past Thursday night and investors should be no be surprised. Despite the company leaving estimates for the year at $7.60, analysts were at $7.91 in 2006 EPS heading into the report. The stock reacted by dropping to under $80 per share after earnings were reported. Given what we saw and heard in Q1, the earnings miss should not be as surprising as some seem to think. The stock's drop appears very overdone and I would suggest long term growth oriented investors pick up Capital One shares today at a sale price of under $80, or 10 times earnings. Several years from now it will prove an excellent entry point, in my view. COF 1-yr chart:"
45344,20149,2007-08-22T14:51:25-04:00,,"Those who have said the mortgage market's survivors will thrive due to fewer competitors are certainly right, but as the Capital One (NYSE:COF) announcement on Monday night shows, even those that could survive might not even try to do so.  The company has decided to shut down its GreenPoint wholesale mortgage unit and cut 1,900 jobs as a result. The secondary mortgage market is to blame, as Capital One is one of many banks that can no longer sell mortgages at profitable prices to investors in order to fund new originations. Despite the headlines that will undoubtedly result from this news, let's go through what it actually means for Capital One in dollar terms. GreenPoint was hardly in shambles before this announcement. After losing $12.6 million in Q1, the division actually earned a profit of $2.6 million in Q2, and management was assuming a breakeven year in 2007. During the second quarter, wholesale mortgages represented an immaterial 0.3% of Capital One's net income. For the first half of 2007, the unit's $10 million loss negatively impacted the company's earnings by only 0.7%. Why the rush to shut down Greenpoint, then? I was actually surprised they didn't halt new originations for a while to see how the secondary market shaped up in coming months, but given that there were 1,900 jobs within GreenPoint, and the odds of it generating any significant earnings in the short or intermediate term was essentially zero, it does make sense that Capital One management decided it was not a good use of resources to continue to fund the division. Why not just save a ton of money and cut the thing loose now? Interestingly, even in 2006 when the mortgage market was great, GreenPoint only earned $138.5 million. That's a lot compared with this year, but even then it contributed only about $0.33 to Capital One's earnings of more than $7 per share. As you can see, even in good times GreenPoint might not be missed all that much, especially if the company can reallocate that money into higher return projects, which I suspect it can. And keep in mind that this decision does not mean that Capital One is no longer in the mortgage market. They will still be loaning money to home buyers in the form of new mortgages and home equity loans through their local banking operations. They simply decided to halt the wholesale business in order to have more control over their loan operations. All in all, this decision sets Capital One up nicely heading into 2008. The mortgage pressures on earnings will be lifted meaningfully, much of the merger related charges and other restructuring charges will be behind them (2007 was an integration and transition year), and the yield curve has steepened somewhat in recent weeks, so the company's margins should improve. Given that Capital One is still slated to earn more than $7 per share this year before one-time special charges related to the GreenPoint closing and merger-related charges will decline in 2008 as cost savings are further realized, I would not be surprised to see an earnings per share number meaningfully above $8 next year, (perhaps even approaching $9). In addition, after the company's current $3 billion buyback is completed (it is more than half done), I would expect a new ""bank-like"" stock dividend put into place as well. In such a case, Capital One stock should no longer be anywhere near the current $66 quote. Full Disclosure: Long shares of Capital One at the time of writing. COF 1-yr chart:"
8426,20149,2006-03-20T01:30:21-05:00,,"Shares of Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) are continuing to fall after news of their nearly $15 billion bid for North Fork Bank (NFB). After hitting new highs at $90 per share, COF stock has dropped more than 10 percent to $80 and change. This sell-off is exactly what we saw after the company announced plans to buy Hibernia a year ago. History tends to repeat itself, and this instance should reinforce that view. Patient buyers will be well rewarded once the deal closes and investors realize how strong of a move it was. Momentum traders and merger arbs are causing longer term investors such as myself to salivate at the stock's current price."

Capital One also warned that its full-year 2005 earnings would be at the low end of its $6.60 to $7 guidance, again lower than the $6.97 the Jack-and-the-beanstalk crowd was expecting. 
Naturally, Capital One trotted out the newest version of the dog-ate-my-homework excuse.
While there is certainly some truth to the hurricane and bankruptcy impact, it isn’t like nobody knew about them. The hurricanes -- while horrible -- are old news and the surge in bankruptcy filings have been front-page news for weeks. 
The reality is that Americans are having trouble making ends meet because of higher energy prices, higher interest rates, higher insurance premiums, higher real estate taxes, and higher inflation on everything from eggs to nails to clothes. 
You can tell by these other troublesome warnings buried in the fine print:
Even though Capital One is an accident waiting to happen, its problems are NOT company specific. Everybody in the consumer lending business is going to see their deadbeat rate sharply rise and profits sharply fall.

8428,20149,2006-03-13T01:36:55-05:00,,"Given that Capital One Financial (COF) recently closed its acquisition of Hibernia, I was a little surprised to see that they are buying New York based North Fork (NFB) so soon after. Also interesting was the fact that news of this deal did not leak out whatsoever ahead of time. In case you missed it (I didn't given that COF is a long-time Peridot holding), Capital One stock was up $4 on Friday to an all-time high.
Given that merger arbs will be shorting Capital One stock to play the deal out, we will likely see some of that huge gain given back this week. The stock is down $5 in pre-market trading. Nonetheless, COF management continues to execute on their strategy and shareholders will likely continue to reap the benefits. The NFB deal appears to be a good one for everyone involved. NFB holders get more than a 20 percent premium to Friday's closing price, and yet COF is only paying 1.6 times book value, which is hardly considered high in the world of bank buyouts."

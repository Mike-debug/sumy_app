CPAH did not release any news at this time, and it seems that rather than due to any material developments for the stock, the catalyst for this move was a number of Twitter users along with a popular chatroom (""Top Stock Alerts"") alerting it:Most Twitter users discussing this stock along with the Top Stock Alerts chatroom referenced its potential in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space (below are just a few such tweets):Given CPAH's extremely low outstanding share count (likely still below 6 million; its latest 10-Q gives a weighted average of 5,945,181 shares outstanding for the three months ended January 31, 2019) and lack of prior volume, it was relatively easy for the stock to move upward quickly before the selling pressure took over - especially in a booming cryptocurrency market where any stock seemingly related to this space will rise. But is CPAH a reasonable company, and to what extent is it actually involved in blockchain and cryptocurrency?Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is most certainly not CPAH's main business, and you would be forgiven for wondering how it has anything to do with this space at all. CPAH's core business is in Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) solutions for making audio and voice calls, primarily through its Bria softphone suite and X-Lite products, and blockchain technology has never once been used in any of these. Searching for the terms ""blockchain"", ""bitcoin"" or ""crypto"" yields no results on CPAH's website (including in its entire list of press releases), nor do they appear anywhere on CPAH's previously linked latest 10-Q or the latest 8-K.After extensive searching, literally the only thing I found linking cryptocurrency and CPAH was a series of three blog posts from the VP of technology for CPAH mid-last year (see Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3), where he casually discusses blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies and the potential use they may have to CPAH's business. There are absolutely zero concrete announcements in there regarding CPAH's plans to enter the cryptocurrency space or use blockchain technology (only that it is researching the possibility), and in the year that has passed since then, there have been no updates or further information (again, this is the only thing I could find for all time relating to CPAH and cryptocurrency). I am not sure if those discussing this stock on Twitter genuinely believe CPAH has anything to do with blockchain technology or if they are being intentionally misleading, but in any case, it is ludicrous to tie them together.CPAH does have a legitimate, if difficult, business in VoIP solutions (its latest 10-Q shows around $2.6 million in revenue for the three months ended January 31, 2019, with a loss from operations of $1 million), and I am not criticising those investing in CPAH based on its real business. However, I am strongly advising against speculating in CPAH on the idea that it is somehow a blockchain play, as I've yet to see any concrete evidence of that. Please comment or message me if you believe any of the above is inaccurate."
3781646,23140,2016-01-28T14:48:00-05:00,"CounterPath has contracts with 400+ customers and partners in 60 countries.CounterPath has a first-in-class, carrier-grade telephone software, Bria.Amazon was a first adopter with CounterPath, but now the rest of the enterprise market will convert over to VOIP.","I have owned CounterPath's (NASDAQ:CPAH) stock since 2004. It's not been a pretty story. I've gone to the basement with this one with a 5-for-1 reverse split in 2008, and the sub-sub-basement with another draconian reverse split 10-for-1 in October.Reverse splits are never happy news, but if you have been around long enough, one of these mosquitoes is bound to bite you. I had one called J2 Global (NASDAQ:JCOM). It suffered a reverse split, one for four, and then declined again, and the stock was down to a dollar. From there it went up rather spectacularly to where it currently sits at $80, but after two 2-for-1 splits, the stock price is really $320. I found this company when I needed to see my faxes when I went down to Buenos Aires. It was perfect. Faxes were converted into PDF email attachments. I could see everything. Then I invested in the company. Too early, as I always am. It does not always pay to have foresight that might be taken for a touch of clairvoyance. It took some years to see this one through, and not without the heart-sinking reverse splits mentioned above. (Now it seems the only faxes I get are from roofers, I don't know why. Only a few important documents came to me via fax in the last year, which would make me a seller of JCOM at these prices.)My point is that as an investor, you must dismiss stock splits (of either kind) as almost irrelevant and certainly distracting. All that ever matters are the prospects of the company. And so we will deal with that.Why recommend a stock that has done so poorly? When things have been discouraging for years, one has to realize there might be another side of the story. Enterprises and system operators have been really slow to change. Ask yourself just one question: does your carrier allow you to see your texts on your computer? No. You can only see your texts on your phone. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has its Facetime and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has its Skype, but these don't play well with each other. If you have an Android phone, ask yourself, does your phone come with video software? No.So, you ask yourself, is there a standard for video software that will be adopted by the industry, as there is for audio? The answer is something called SIP (Session-Initiated Protocol). I think that may ultimately be common standard, and it may very well be that these other standards (Skype, Facetime) will evaporate.On the enterprise end of things, many enterprises have bought all manner of software and hardware over the years, and so they may need something that will play nice with iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, Lync, Linux, and what all, plus all manner of server hardware. CounterPath has been plugging away at solving this mess of standards and has made great strides in this.Probably this is a story of compression, of possibly pretty substantial compression.On a value basis, it has a market value of $12 million. About the size of its revenues. It has 20+ patents. Its customer list of over 400 companies includes most telephone system operators and telecom equipment makers in the world. It has what could be argued is the state-of-the-art telephone software product, Bria. Its software has won many awards, and it is the standby software that gets used in demonstrations.This alone is worth money. Bria works well with others. It works with Windows, Linux, iPhone, iPad, Blackberry, Android, and it was recently announced that it is compatible with Microsoft Lync. So there are no cobwebs on the product.What to look for: announcements of major enterprisesThe company has been working with a couple of the largest equipment manufacturers in the world, and the signing of major enterprises may be announced. This company has been prevented by secrecy agreements from announcing many, many contracts. We only learned that Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) was a large customer (10%-15% of revenues) when it was required for a 10-K filing. But the company has been pushing to permit such announcements, and if you see one for, say, a major financial institution or other such large customer, that will mean millions for CounterPath, and that would certainly be a time to buy.I am not giving management a pass. They have not made their case to shareholders or potential customers or to the investment world. The stock price tells you that. But what you can say is that the management has connected with all of the important companies in the telecommunications business and has contracts outstanding with most of them. The other thing you can say is that their main software product, Bria, is state of the art. Comparable with anything made by anyone else. And this may be enough.What I am saying is that this stock is so compressed that with good news, it doubles in a day, and that would be good for new shareholders. For most shareholders, including billionaire Terry Matthews, it is a case of recovering a lot of lost time and money. Even if it doubled in a day, Matthews would still be out of the money.A lot of these old time telecoms and equipment makers are dragging their feet because of their sizable investment in legacy hardware, but a new day is dawning. Why can't I check my texts on my computer? Or send texts from a computer? And why is it that I can only see someone if they also have Skype software? Why isn't there standard software for video telephone? (Answer: there is such a standard, it is called SIP for Session Initiated Protocol).Contract LeverageThe company has contracts with most of the large telecommunications companies in the world. Some of the 400+ customers and partners are mentioned below. But new ones show up from time to time. An African customer, an Argentine customer, and a ""European carrier"" were announced in the last six months, and new agreements can come from anywhere. Ireland and New Zealand customers were cited earlier in the year.Here is a sampling of customers, and the contract leverage I am speaking to:Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NYSE:NTT), the largest telephone company in the world. Revenue is coming in here, but this is the tip of the iceberg type of revenue. It is marketing to enterprises, so as it converts to VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol), this is a possible large contributor to earnings.Rogers (NYSE:RCI) - A $12 billion revenue Canadian carrier. After a rush to develop, Rogers has had management changes, and its initiative, Rogers One Number, has gone into limbo. But if it were to get advertised and seriously marketed, it could be a large contributor to earnings.LM Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), the largest telecom equipment company. Its targets would be system operators and large enterprises. This is also a possible large contributor to earnings.Cisco uses CounterPath for particular server situations. Decent revenue comes from this source but I am not anticipating anything spectacular here.Avaya - Same as Cisco, particular server situations. Again, decent revenue. Not expecting anything spectacular here.BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY). CPAH coordinated to be compatible with BlackBerry software. If BlackBerry wanted to coordinate with iPhones, it could buy CounterPath and could immediately extend its privacy and security driven software to another large block of cell phone users, that is, Apple users. But CounterPath's customer list also gives it access to just about every telephone company and equipment manufacturer on the planet, which would help it to maintain and penetrate its target market - enterprises and governments.Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) - Acme Packet was bought by Oracle as another root, this one is a new foray into the telephone business that Larry Ellison could grow. CounterPath has collaborated with it. Oracle is another vendor who comes to CounterPath when it needs reliable telephone software.Alcatel (NYSE:ALU) and Nokia (NYSE:NOK) are going after large enterprises, and taking CounterPath along in tow. If they land big customers, then CounterPath's revenues could suddenly ramp up.So, my contention is that there are 400+ revenue streams. So far, these streams have been little rivulets, but as corporations (enterprises) ramp up, this could mean substantially greater streams, and these streams represent the contract leverage that I am speaking to.Telephone companies and the equipment companies will really be feeling the heat as Microsoft ramps up its Skype for Business program. These companies cannot seem to get their heads around competition. Skype just walked in and took over 30% of the international calling business. Of course, Skype did it through a free offering. So, the question is how long will Microsoft subsidize all of this business? It seems to be willing to do this forever, but I think that this loss leader approach has limits. Microsoft paid $8.5 billion and it has earned precious little. It looks like its strategy will be to embed it in its Office suite of programs and bury the cost.Although on the downside, the telephone companies have been lazy dogs all along, trying to get all the use they can out of their legacy networks, failing to do the necessary cannibalism to stay on top of the market. And they may continue that way. Not good for CounterPath, though CPAH's focus has shifted from system operators to enterprises. It still does business with the system operators, but it seems to be on the business/enterprise end of things with NTT, British Telecom (NYSE:BT), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and others, where they need CounterPath's help with their back office servers and where they need to connect with all manner of devices - iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, which CounterPath has developed over the years.Telephone companies are still regulated and have to collect huge taxes for governments, Skype is exempt from all of this burden. It would be worth the telephone companies' effort to have Skype regulated. It is not an even playing field. Skype can sweep up a lot of customers for free, but if it has to compete on the same playing field, the situation changes.As it is, the telephone companies have been slow on the draw, and this has deterred the progress of CounterPath and other competitors. But I have invested in telephone for years and years. And I can remember how slow the telephone companies were to switch over to DSL. We waited years.Early adopters, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), have long been customers of CounterPath, and they were about ten years ahead of the pack, but now as the rest of the pack adopts, CounterPath's position with its partners, Nokia/Alcatel, Ericsson, Genband, Mitel, Oracle, and the like, will be ready to set it up.CounterPath has one thing that makes it a very attractive partner, and that is this: its Vice President, Todd Carothers, explained to me its software must work just about all the time. It has been tested and been out in the marketplace now for many years now, and such testing is a requirement of carrier grade installations whether by carriers or very large enterprises.It seems a situation whether either the company will do very well, or that the company disappears, and investors must put this into their calculations. Such a risky company should only occupy a very small part of the tiny percentage that investors allocate to such ultra risky investments.The company's loss of $333,000 stands against $3.1 million in cash, so it could burn away cash in a couple of years, but if cash is ever in question, Daddy Long Legs, Terry Matthews, who made $1 billion when he sold Newbridge Networks to Alcatel (which helped to make Alcatel number two in routers, which in turn, made it attractive to Nokia), will figure something out. This past year he and another large shareholder put in some more cash. In past years, his team persuaded Fidelity to take a position.But that ""figure something out"" may not be a happy thing for current investors. Terry Matthews has been taking a larger and larger percentage of the company as it has failed to meet its targets and has needed more funds. I think he is able to see the strategic value of the company more than others (witness Newbridge deal mentioned above and about 80 or 90 other deals), and I doubt that he will let it go. More likely, his course of action would be to fold it into one of his other companies, such as Mitel (NASDAQ:MITL). That potentially means that new investors, and all other investors, might get pennies on the dollar for the money they put into it now. Good for Terry, bad for new investors. This again makes this a terribly risky proposition for investors other than Terry Matthews.On the other hand, Terry put about $25 million into the deal when he initially bought in. He does not always take an active position, but with CounterPath he took the office of chairman. He would need above $25 per share to break even. I don't know how meaningful that is, but it is something to consider. Also worth considering is that he didn't invest to break even. I am sure he thinks it is worth well beyond what he invested in the company. Everyone has been dragging their feet, but if enterprises and system operators decide to power up, then Terry will be in the catbird seat.We may only know what this particular company is worth when an offer is made which would potentially lock out all the other users from its product and services. I think it is quite possible other offers might come its way. Why? Because after a spate of buying similar companies in the mid-oughts by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft and others, there are few independent, first-in-class, carrier-grade telephone software companies available for purchase. And that's the bet.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
4189143,21815,2018-07-23T10:34:25-04:00,"The shares popped on a substantial order, and this came off the back of another substantial order a couple of weeks ago and good growth figures in Q3.But while its solutions are well accepted by big customers and partners, revenues are still surprisingly small and the company isn't cash flow positive nor consistently profitable.On the other hand, executives are buying consistently, and the company does have a SaaS platform model.","If you look at some of the basic performance metrics of this company, you're not inclined to get terribly excited:Yet quite a few insiders are excited, from FinViz:And on Wednesday (July 17), there was quite a bit of fizz in the share price:CounterPath (CPAH) offers communications over IP solutions, including:Bria helps companies to set up a unified communications strategy, basically a platform which integrates voice, text messaging, video and additional stuff like sending files. Softphones, or telephone software if you like. One is perhaps inclined to argue how this differentiates from stuff like Skype, but this is more of an enterprise solution. The X-Lite product that can be downloaded for free at the company's website is a more direct Skype substitute. The company has three revenue streams (from the 10-Q):Bosch, a large German technology company went in part for the Bria platform, rather than installing PBX systems or having VOIP handsets, as all employees already had access to a computer (it's on 30,000 employee laptops for instance). There is a case study of how this helped Bosch on the company's website (here).An enterprise grade system integrates seamlessly with other company systems (like IB based PBX, message servers and the like). Here you see how that works for Bosch (from company website case study):The Bria softphone application integrates with a host of other stuff (like Microsoft Office) and there are additional applications to broaden that field, like Bria for Salesforce (integration with CRM applications).They have quite a substantial interoperability program, showing a host of third party solutions with which the Bria softphones can work.There are also Bria softphone apps for mobile (Android and iOS). The company can provision and manage these softphones centrally from the Stretto platform:Here is an interesting opportunity suggested by SA contributor Thomas Barnard in 2016 and we have to quote at length:That quote also suggests that their solutions are rather competitive. We're no specialists on these kind of communication solutions, it's not easy to ascertain this with any degree of confidence. What is certain is that they have both important and large customers, as well as partners. With respect to the competition, the obvious one is Skype, now owned by Microsoft (MSFT). However, SA contributor Thomas Barnard on the differenceOne would think that with all these big clients, partners (like Oracle) and interoperability, sales would be booming but sales have tended to decline a bit the last couple of years. The latest figures (Q3) actually do start showing substantial (21%) growth. From the 10-Q:However, the interesting part is that recurring revenue (subscriptions support and maintenance) only grew by 9%. This doesn't quite establish solid emerging SaaS platform credentials, for that we were hoping the subscription part would actually grow faster than overall revenues.And quite frankly, for a company that sells to such big clients the revenues are rather small. This matters because the lack of scale seems to be a main reason why operating margins are solidly negative.There is some improvement in margins over time, but operating margins have been negative for five years (at least):The lack of scale seems to produce another problem, which is a limited ability for R&D spending in an industry where there are much better capitalized players and rapid technology change. Cash flow has been negative for years as well, and basically the company finances this by issuing stock:The company has $3M of cash and cash equivalents, which could last a year.The stock price rise on Wednesday was the result of what seems to be a substantial order for their hosted Stretto solution. A few weeks before that there was another substantial order:The company is making losses (apart from Q2 when there was a small non-GAAP profit) and isn't cash flow positive, but the company doesn't have debt. Selling phone software to even large carriers and corporate customers apparently isn't big business, and neither does it seem very profitable. Nevertheless, the company has a couple of things going for it. Their solutions seem to be well accepted in the market given the stellar name of some of its customers and partners. Another thing is that the company could be considered a SaaS platform company, as the Bria phone apps are increasingly managed with Stretta in the cloud. Then we have something pretty unusual, concerted buying by insiders, and it's quite likely they see something that we don't. What we do see is a couple of substantial orders in Q4, coming off the back of already solid growth in Q3, so perhaps the reason why executives are buying is hiding in plain sight.

284120,23140,2011-08-03T08:16:14-04:00,,"The analogy is pretty clear.  Facebook is a social network of individuals for pleasure,  LinkedIn (LNKD) is a network for businessmen and professionals.  Similar to Facebook, Skype is used primarily by individuals, and especially by émigrés wanting to stay in touch with home.  Thus, its most significant footprint is the international sector, and this is evidenced by its having captured 20% of all international minutes.  And there is little surprise in the recently disclosed pact that Facebook and Skype will be working together.Sure, Skype, now owned by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), is used by some business people. There are always these kinds of cross migrations, but primarily it is used by individuals outside of their businesses.  Apparently, Skype has security issues that are inherent in its architecture, and it is likely that business will have a problem adopting Skype in its present form for its communications.  For that, they will look to the open standards, which does not use the Skype node scheme, but servers.  So, what company would be the business complement of Skype?  Information about business VOIP and video is sketchy, and while I don’t think I’m exactly reading tea leaves here, I think you can ferret out a few things if you look.Where would be a good place start to see where corporate video telephony is headed?  The Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) commercials, of course.  Alex Baldwin baldfacedly did an embedded plug for Cisco in 30 Rock, and in a Cisco commercial Ellen Page talked to “her doctor” face-to-face, her in the U.S., him in Denmark.  Those featured Cisco’s high end product, but for regular face-to-face communications Cisco developed the Unified Communicator.Cisco’s Unified Communicator uses the open systems technology of Counterpath Corporation (NASDAQ:CPAH).  Cisco has been setting up corporate systems with this technology since at least 2005.  Because of secrecy or privacy agreements, this information only popped up in a 2006 annual 10K SEC disclosure, where it was revealed that Cisco provided as much as 14% of Counterpath's revenues.  Revenues of 14% means, in any pricing scenario (and it is easy to imagine that Cisco would get the best pricing imaginable), that Cisco has been installing Unified Communicators at a rate of thousands a month for many years.  But Counterpath has many resellers – Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), Broadsoft (BSFT), Avaya , Juniper (NYSE:JNPR), Metaswitch, Alcatel (ALU), Mitel (NASDAQ:MITL).So, there have been many resellers, and many thousands of endpoints have been put in place in the past six years.  An endpoint here means the software interface for a computer, such as the Skype program loaded on to a computer, or it could be an app for an iPhone or Android cell.  Since June of 2006, Counterpath has made available for free its X-Lite product, which the company disclosed reached 340,000 downloads per month in 2009.  But by the end of that same year, the CEO announced the company was up to 500,000 downloads per month.  So, at the very least, for 2009-2011, there should be 10 million free X-Lite endpoints sitting out there.  That is not counting 2006-2009 numbers, or any incremental increases during the 2009-2011 period.  But the number of endpoints for Counterpath’s products must be millions more, because the resellers, like Cisco, have been selling its upscale product, Bria, in the thousands every month for years.Counterpath, which mostly devotes itself to its resellers, does have a few customers for its own account – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Bosch, for example, are mentioned on its website.The MechanicsAs I understand it, all of the video telephones so far require that both parties be part of the same network.  Thus, a Skype video user can only see another Skype video user.  And that is the way it works for all the video users to date.  In corporate systems, it is the same. Only others within the same company can see each other because these companies have been basically setting up their own telephone networks with their own servers.  All connect to the outside for audio calls, but not for video.X-Lite ConnectNow Counterpath has not even announced-- rather it has leaked through its corporate blog -- something called X-Lite Connect.  This will permit users from one corporate Counterpath network to make video calls to other Counterpath corporate networks.  They will be testing it with Counterpath’s own friends and family in the next few months, with a wider launch planned for 2012.  I submit this will be the biggest VOIP enterprise (or business) telephone network in the world.  The company, in announcing this network, denies the comparison to Skype. Nevertheless, the company says, “Users want the capability to connect to other users leveraging X-Lite.”   This is the need the company attempts to satisfy, and as I have stated above, this is millions of people it attempts to connect.  It would create, as I stated above, a very large business network comparable to the group of individuals connected through the Skype network.Thus, Counterpath is to Skype as LinkedIn is to Facebook.  Q.E.D.What is Such a Network Worth?If we apply the SAT relation (Facebook is to LinkedIn as Skype is to Counterpath Corp.) to the problem of valuation, it would go like this:  Facebook’s pre-IPO value fluctuates wildly, but if a low-end value of $50 billion is applied to Facebook and LinkedIn is currently worth $9.5 billion, then with Skype valued at $8.5 billion per the buyout, that would put Counterpath at $1.61 billion.  Something like $38 per share.Approach it from revenue side.  Let's say there are 20 million X-Lite and Bria endpoints out there, and eventually the company charges for the network connection (such charge not announced yet), and let's say if it gets 5 million to join the network for a MagicJack introductory charge of $40 per year, that would be $200 million,  a stupendous revenue increase for a company that just broke $10 million.The revenue generated could turn out to be much greater than this.  It seems to me that everyone will want to join the network, in which case you have 20 million endpoints paying, eventually, $40 per month, which would generate revenues on the order of $9.6 billion, which would put our stock valuation at the low end.Perhaps $40 per month is high, but isn't that the kind of number that AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) are charging for their audio-only service (I am including long distance)?  Those of us who have been enjoying Skype's free service would be silly to expect that free is the way of the future.  Free is not a profit model, it isthe suck-you-in introductory offer. But if free means paid for by advertising, what does that mean-- an annoying message popping up in the middle of a conversation?  Certainly on the business side of things, they will never put up with it.I am assuming in my model, that by the time these kinds of numbers are achieved, the major telephone companies will be offering standard open systems video service, and that Microsoft / Skype will have re-written its code to conform to the rest of the world.But this model does represent a significant risk to the major telecoms.  They will still carry these phone conversations in the pipe, but they may very be excluded from on-top-of-the-internet revenues.  Which could be half of their revenue mix, a fact I mentioned in my piece, ""Why Major Telecoms Are in Trouble"" (link below).There is a KickerSuch a value, in the relation I have outlined, would assume that Counterpath is a closed network such as Skype. However, Counterpath has a kicker: there are larger networks out there than these enterprise networks that will want to standardize and connect all video traffic, namely AT&T, Verizon, Sprint (NYSE:S), British Telecom (NYSE:BT), Deutsche Telekom, Telmex, and others.  Get this-- all these companies know about Counterpath because they all are customers of Counterpath.The networks are going to be more inclined to use the robust, open systems product of Counterpath than Skype’s parochial proprietary system.  It is more secure, and thousands more engineers have applied their brains to the open system standards than were applied to Skype.  And I suggest that Skype will likely get re-written to open systems if Microsoft wants to make it viable (meaning connectible to everyone else in the standard video format I think we will be seeing soon).Even without the kicker, Counterpath is worth very big money because the enterprise side (by which I mean the business side) is always the most profitable.  It has been the most profitable for Microsoft.  I freely admit there are many conjectures here, and Counterpath has not been a willing informant.  My guess is that there are privacy agreements which prevent full disclosure.The Ducks are in a RowThe company is in the right place at the right time, a fact which has been alluded to many times by the company’s primary stockholder, Sir Terry Matthews.  There are few entrepreneurs who would recognize the value of a small software telephony company like Counterpath, but he is one of them.  He sold his main corporate vehicles, Mitel and Newbridge Networks to BT and Alcatel respectively, becoming a billionaire in the process.  His vehicle for developing start-ups and tiny companies he has bought into is Wesley-Clover, and he has been doing perhaps as many as 80 such deals:Counterpath’s recent financials show a company around break-even.  Though the spending for a new network will set it back into the loss column.Who Would be the Buyer?The buyer could come literally from anywhere.  It could come from the equipment resellers - Cisco, Ericsson (ERIC), Avaya, Alcatel (ALU).  It could come from software giants – Microsoft, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM).  In its efforts to make its corporate networks more robust, Counterpath offered apps for Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone and Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android, so they seem like possible acquirers.  It could come from networks, itching to nail down video: AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint.  And since this technology is important to all of them, it is possible they might band together as a consortium (as happened recently in the Nortel patent bid), which would, in effect, cut out the middle man.In laying out this analogy, we believe we are presenting a relation that tracks with the facts, but there may be other facts of which we are unaware.  Further, the use of acronyms and technical language by all the companies in the industry makes it notoriously hard to figure out what is really happening.  I have attempted to run the hurdles to get a picture of where the telephone industry is going.  The principal change that has occurred since that piece is Counterpath’s announcement about linking all X-Lite users, which permits the analogy that is the basis of this article.All warnings that apply to small companies in high tech industries apply here.  Very risky.  But risk is everywhere-- the trick is trying to learn enough to avoid potholes.  Disclosure: I am long CPAH."

Only stocks that achieve those Ratings on the tables below are highlighted in our article headlines, and have our articles linked to their Seeking Alpha company profiles.The intention of our Round Up articles is to both separate real insider investment intelligence from time-wasting noise and to educate investors that - though insider transactions are indeed an excellent source of investment intelligence - it takes much more analysis than screening by dollar values to make money from insider data.Seasonal Note: Insider filing volumes are at a seasonal low point, as companies close trading windows to their executives until June-quarter financials are released. Form 4 filing volumes will continue to wane into the third week of July, before surging again in the first week of August.On Today's Tables:Insider trades were rated Significant at :Insider trades were rated Nearly Significant at:Insider trades were considered Insignificant at:Don't agree with our Rating?

1561272,23140,2013-07-22T09:58:40-04:00,,"Acquisition Target: CounterPath Corp.In my last piece Ben Bernanke Owns This Bubble, Baby, I posited that the best place to look for real gains was among stocks that might be acquired. CounterPath (NASDAQ:CPAH) was designed to be acquired, if not from inception, certainly since the takeover by Terry Matthews in 2007, although it may do fine on its own, another desirable feature.The problem with investing in development companies is that it takes a long time for the new technology to be adopted. That was the case when I invested in DSL technology, which took ordinary telephone landlines and turned them into super digital technology, capable of transmitting another altogether higher magnitude of information. We waited and waited for the Baby Bells, as they were called then, to deploy this new technology, and it seemed to take forever, but it finally happened, and now DSL lines are everywhere.Actually, what CounterPath does is it plays right into that digital stream. CounterPath's telephone software sits at the end of that stream and converts it into: a) regular telephone service (audio), but so much data is coming down the line that it can also transmit b) a video signal and c) texting as well. Hence, the term Unified Communications (UC) - audio, video, texting, plus other goodies. CounterPath substantially completed its software development two years ago with the introduction of software (""apps"") for mobile phones and tablets using the Android or iPhone operating systems. So now the company's telephone software works on most computers - laptops, desktops, tablets, and what are smartphones but tiny computers?The software is called Bria, and it is the defacto standard for the industryMost people see these features on Skype, and CounterPath's Bria offers this same software, but targeted to the higher security needs of business. Hence, it has equipped many companies with this new technology - Amazon, Citibank, Coca-Cola, Bosch, and others. But most of the companies they have provisioned are unknown to shareholders because they were sold through the company's extensive list of distributors - Alcatel/Lucent (ALU), Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Avaya, Genband, BroadSoft (BSFT), Oracle/Acme Packet (NYSE:ORCL), Huawei, Mitel (NASDAQ:MITL) and Metaswitch. Basically, all of the important players. And because all of the important equipment providers use Bria, I believe it is the de facto standard for the telephone industry.CounterPath cites the cost-savings enterprise example of Bosch in Germany, for example. Bosch found that 40% of all its calls were intra-campus calls (that is, within the company). For this, no third party exchange, like AT&T (NYSE:T), or in Bosch's case, Deutsche Telekom, is needed. In effect they set up their own network (their own intra-mural telephone company) with the ability to tap the third party legacy exchanges as needed. There is a real, self-evident savings in this.In October of last year, CounterPath inked a deal with a carrier for this enterprise service, which could easily be the largest referral source anyone could ever ask for - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NYSE:NTT), which is the largest telephone carrier in the world.I would expect that all telephone companies will be moving over to this digital telephone service in the next few years. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) says that all of its calls will be digital by 2016. So far, only one system operator has provided Skype-like service to its customers and that is Rogers in Canada. CounterPath provided the interface software, Skype-like software, for that installation.That system operator experience with Rogers (NYSE:ROG) means that as carriers consider switching over, CounterPath may very well be the one that moves to the top of the list of software providers. Why? Well, suppose you are the one charged with this changeover decision for a big carrier, like AT&T or Verizon, who will you choose? Probably you are going to go with the one that has the most experience with big installations, the one with the most SIP telephone programmers in the world, the one with the product that has received the most commercial testing in the world, the most awards, the one that has developed system management tools with its installation at Rogers like their Client Configuration Server, the one big corporations are using around the world, and that would be CounterPath.And speaking of system wide deployments, we don't think it is such a stretch to think if NTT is happy with its experience on the enterprises it sets up with Bria, that they might use CounterPath's software throughout their system.Like a lot of developmental companies, I expect that the company will be bought out by some larger company. I expect that that potential acquirer will be one of its distribution partners. One that wants to get ahead of the others. Even the smaller companies in the list above may have rich venture capital parents that may want it for their offspring. Avaya, for example, is owned by Silver Lake Partners, which got a windfall from its $8.5 billion sale of Skype to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (so it is comfortable in the telecom area, though it appears Silver Lake is distracted. They are spending a lot of their loot for Dell Computers even though other savvy bidders have dropped out).A recent favorite target of speculation among CounterPath investors regards Acme Packet, which was bought by Oracle for $2.1 billion. Oracle has a treasury of $20 billion. A price of $10 for CounterPath would cost a little over $400 million, which would be a mere bagatelle. But others have big treasuries. Cisco has a treasury of $48 billion, and is one of CounterPath's oldest customers.The reason Acme Packet has got CounterPath's investors' attention is because Acme Packet, which worked with CounterPath on Rogers and Bosch, announced that they are partnering with CounterPath to produce better-than-Skype performance.CompetitorsSo, what is the downside? Skype is the biggest digital telephone software entity out there, but has Skype connected with any of the large distribution players or system operators, like Ericsson or Cisco or Alcatel or AT&T or Verizon? No. In fact, their strategy is distinctly anti-social. They intend to steal all of AT&T's and Verizon's business right from under their very eyes. Their plan was to use their huge installed base of Windows users to integrate its telephone software. But this cannot work as in the past because now the installed base of computer operating systems now includes a huge mobile base of Android and Apple computers (smartphones and tablets). A big problem for MSFT.What has become of the other small start ups? This is what my research has turned up:I was surprised that a small firm named Vivox, which had only games companies on its customer list boasted that it was the power behind T-Mobile's Bobsled. I looked again at their customer list before writing this piece, and I can no longer find T-Mobile on it. So maybe T-Mobile found that more expertise is required. No doubt some telephone companies will try to develop their own telephone software, as Telefonica did. But Telefonica's offering followed from its purchase of Jajah (from the list above). None of the other system operators has purchased a telephone software company. The problem these companies must overcome is that their software must run nearly perfectly all the time or it is worthless. CounterPath's computer software has been tested over nine years. Their Android and iPhone applications have been out for over two years, and were probably in testing another year or more. It will be hard for telephone companies to get this kind of testing done in the short window before they will need to bring this software to market. (After all, Skype, whatever its shortcomings, with one third of all international call minutes is breathing down everybody's neck). This brings up a small, tiny, infinitesimal, chance that the major system operators (AT&T, and the like) will band together to buy CounterPath to share the technology, as one of the last substantial independent telephone software companies available.Adding New CustomersAlthough CounterPath has not issued so many PR announcements on new customers in the past year, that is rather par for the course for a white label supplier like CounterPath, but that does not mean nothing is happening. In both the first and second quarters, it was revealed in the conference call that seven out of the top twenty customers were new customers, including three cable companies. So, look for cheap Wi-Fi-only phones in your future.And don't forget NTT was announced in the past year.The Scope of the OpportunityThe entire telephone business will be changing over to the new digital technology. They have been using parts of it for years, sending digital bits down optical cable long distances to a converter, which sends out the old analog signal. Now we come to the final few inches - the digital signal now goes all the way to the computer (desktop, smartphone, laptop, tablet) where the signal gets converted by this new telephone software to audio (and video, if desired), and new services - for example, you will be able to tell if the party you want to speak is on the line, what is called ""presence.""We stand with Lewis & Clark before they crossed the Mississippi. The whole of the west remains undiscovered. Only one major carrier, Rogers in Canada, has undertaken the transformation. All carriers will be switching over - AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, British Telecom, Bell Canada, Telmex, and the rest.The way we think this will play out is that CounterPath's software will be a part of a total contractor solution, and since they are hooked up with so many of the telephone suppliers, in a strategy called ""swarming"" by industry observer Andy Abramson, we think CounterPath will get a substantial share of the changeover.FinancialsCounterPath is in the black so far this year in spite of the last two rather lackluster quarters. The 4th quarter, which ended April 30th, is seasonally their best quarter, and the CEO, Donovan Jones, said in the last conference call, that he expects it to be in line with previous 4th quarters, and it wouldn't require much to make this their best revenue quarter ever (let's say $4.5 million or above). So I take that to mean that this will be its first year in the black (if there aren't currency exchange losses or other extraordinary items). The obvious conclusion from reviewing the revenues and profit and loss below is that revenue is increasing and losses are diminishing. They have over $12 million cash, no debt, and Fidelity Investments was one of the big buyers in the last funding, and owns over 5% of the company.ManagementThe largest stockholder of CounterPath is Sir Terry Matthews with over 20%, who made $1 billion for himself when he sold Newbridge Networks to Alcatel for $7 billion (see him lecturing to business students at UBC). He lends over forty years of credibility and knowledge in the telephone and networking area to the company. I would be surprised if Terry Matthews would settle for less than $10 per share for a company that has the best, most desirable telephone software in the world, and on which he invested seven years and millions of dollars. Management is motivated with options; beneficial owners have 64.94% of the company. It will be difficult for these owners to cash out their shares without the sale of the entire company.WarningsNew technologies and new competitors may develop that may blindside the company.The knowledge gap here between all the information about the stock and its price is huge by my estimation. I mean exactly this: the public is not very well-informed. Partly this is the fault of management, which does not seem to know how to explain its business or tell its story (in spite of Terry Matthews's focus on communications in the link above).My advice to buyers is to use limit orders exclusively. Buying shares in CounterPath is like buying stock in a privately owned company; shareholders may well find themselves in the same shoes as the beneficial owners, waiting for sale of the entire company to get their money out. But I expect the payoff to be well worth the wait. Traders, avoid it.SummaryDSL - digital subscriber lineSIP - session initiated protocol (telephone interface software)UC - unified communicationsDisclosures: I have owned this stock continuously since October of 2004.Disclosure: I am long CPAH.

4315623,105503,2020-01-07T13:15:48-05:00,"CounterPath's share price is down by 25% in the last year.Revenues are up, operating costs are down and the earnings per share has improved but the company is loss-making with high level of debts.There are also cash flow and delisting risks.The company has a strong leadership with strong financial management.There is an opportunity to invest but investors need an in-depth understanding first.","CounterPath Corporation (NASDAQ:CPAH) is a provider of desktop and mobile VoIP software products and solutions. Its share price has gone down by 25% in the last year (when ignoring that “blip” at the end of March 2019).Figure 1: CounterPath share price evolution in the last yearSource: Seeking AlphaIts share price is currently at $0.98. Now, an investment in CounterPath at this stage could be a good entry point and provide a comfortable margin of safety, provided that the stock shows an uptrend in the future.However, when considering an investment in stocks, there are important metrics which need to be considered, like the market, competitive position, company's leadership strength, revenue progression, profitability and debt level. Moreover, this being a penny stock (stock price < $5 and small market capitalization of $5.41 million), it is also important to consider the cash flow. Finally, following a letter received by CounterPath from the listing qualifications department staff of the Nasdaq stock market, investors have questions as to the ability of the company to raise equity capital.VoIP, or Voice over the Internet is a way to communicate just like a normal landline or mobile phone. WhatsApp audio is a form of VoIP as it allows people to communicate as soon as they have access to the Internet. However, VoIP services like the ones provided by CounterPath allow much more like multiple calls, including conference and group calls, the ability to have a local number, which are important advantages for businesses. VoIP services have gained increasing popularity among small business owners because of their simplicity of use, ability to offer a wide range of features, and most importantly, offering a cheaper alternative to traditional phone line systems. However, since the technology has not yet fully matured and is still dependent on the quality of internet connections, there is a learning curve before it is fully adopted.With the VoIP market estimated to hike from USD 20 billion in 2018 to around USD 55 billion by 2025, according to a report by Global Market Insights, it is not surprising that there are different players offering their services. They mostly compete on a features-offered basis as well as specific competencies developed for particular industries like real estate investment or travel agencies.Figure 2: Global VoIP market, 2015-2021 (USD Billion)Source: SemacomI consider the main competitors of CounterPath, namely Ooma (OOMA), Vonage (VG) and RingCentral (NYSE:RNG). I compare Bria, which is CounterPath's flagship VoIP soft phone application to the equivalent product supplied by the competition.First, to be clear, a hosted VoIP softphone application makes use of the cloud and is seen as an important technology evolution in the use of communication tools. Instead of using the traditional landline phone and associated hardware, the softphone application can now cater for a complete communication management tool for businesses and individuals alike.Figure 3: Bria vs. Ooma Office vs. Vonage Business vs. RingCentral Office Comparison ChartSource: Sourceforge, with the SaaS in the ""Platform Supported"" updated from Bria’s product info.As can be seen, CounterPath and RingCentral support all platforms. Moreover, one key differentiator between CounterPath and its competitors is that it has recently started to work with channel partners.Now, unlike a distributor who is just an agent who supplies software products to retailers, a channel partner partners with a software development company, to market and sell the developer’s product.In fact, CounterPath has been developing solutions especially for the needs of channel partners in an effort to expand its reach globally. These solutions concern the company's new SaaS-based offering.While developing solutions for channel partners who, in turn will then sell the product can be time and resource consuming in the beginning, the results can be impressive. Salesforce (CRM) is a successful company that has grown on the back of channel partnerships to promote sales.However, in order to generate sales, there should be an appropriate pricing model.The company now offers the Bria Solo, a subscription offering to replace the previous Bria 5 softphone solution which was offered on a one-time payment basis. Previously, CounterPath was selling products on a one-time payment basis. This important change from a one-time payment to a monthly subscription model will mean more frequent contact with customers and therefore increases the customer association with their products. Financially, this model will be more revenue-generating as the company will continue to make money from users (on a recurring basis) after acquiring them. In the longer term, there will be increased customer retention.In the Second Quarter Financial Highlights, the CEO,David Karp mentions:In addition, CounterPath also offers a free version of Bria, called Bria Solo in an effort to better target the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) segment.Free trials can be an effective marketing method, resulting in significant gains in terms of number of customers and increased sales revenues. Major antivirus companies have used free trials effectively. Ultimately, the aim is to get much more users to use the product than with a paid version and then converting a proportion of these “free” users to “paid” status.In the Second Quarter Financial Highlights, the CEO, David Karp further mentions:In the next section, I verify whether those management statements have translated into increasing revenues.Figure 4: Revenue for last 6 monthsSource: CounterPath Corporation SEC Filing - Quarterly Report (10-Q) December 11, 2019In fact, revenue has increased by 11% to $2.7 million compared to revenue of $2.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 while there has been a growth in subscription, support and maintenance revenue (revenue of a recurring nature) of 14% for the quarter compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, there has been a significant decrease of 33% in terms of operating expenses, largely following a drastic reduction in administrative expenses. The net loss in the most recent quarter is now $0.13 per share, compared to net $0.35 per share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2019.Thus, management statements have translated into increased revenues. However, the revenue figures paint a rosy picture of the company and are not enough. I also consider the other side of the coin, namely profitability and debt.On the downside, it must be mentioned that this is a loss-making company and the debt level has increased considerably from the $1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 to $4 million in the current quarter. As a result of recurring losses, there is an accumulated deficit of $70 million as of October 31, 2019. The total debt to equity currently stands at 290%. This is the highest level among its competitors.Figure 5: Profitability and debt level comparisonSource: Seeking AlphaThe lack of progression in revenues is mainly due to a number of factors including an increased focus on building the cloud-based subscription platform and a change from the current licensing (one-time) model to subscription-based licensing (recurring). Also, the fact that CounterPath has not yet reached profitable status has resulted in substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue operating as a going concern. The underlying finance risks have to be identified.First, lack of cash flow may affect CounterPath's ability to continue operating as a going concern. The company needs cash for continued research and development and expansion of market share. Therefore, additional financing is required to fund working capital and pay for operating expenses and capital requirements until a positive cash flow is achieved.The operating cash flows are currently not sufficient to meet operating and capital expenses. Raising of capital through issuance of additional equity securities would result in a dilution in the equity interests by current stockholders. Commercial loans will further increase liabilities and future cash commitments.Second, CounterPath is currently not compliant with the continued listing standards and this could impact its ability to raise equity capital. In fact, a letter has been received by the management from Nasdaq Stock Market, notifying the company that the stockholders' equity of $1,922,675 as reported in the company's Quarterly Report for the period ended October 31, 2019 was below the minimum stockholders' equity of $2,500,000. The company has been provided 45 calendar days, or until January 30, 2020, to submit a plan to regain compliance.A delisting of a company from the Nasdaq doesn't mean that the stock can't continue to trade. Delisted companies can choose to be listed on the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. One disadvantage resulting from delisting is a loss of investor confidence, and potentially reduced access to capital, but it's not fatal. There have been cases of companies return to compliance and relist on the Nasdaq after delisting.Moreover, CounterPath still has the option to perform a reverse stock split, aimed primarily at bringing the company into compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for maintaining its listing on the Nasdaq stock market. It can, for example, implement a ten-for-one reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock. In this case, the total value of any investor's stake in the company doesn't change as that value is just spread out over fewer shares.Despite the downside risks, there are some elements which point to a possible upside.The company currently has a high gross profit margin of 79% which is the highest among its competitors. Now, a high gross profit margin means that the company is doing well in managing its cost of sales. It also shows that the company has more to cover for operating, financing, and other costs.Moreover, the net income margin is the lowest among competitors. Therefore, the company is giving away the relatively high gross margins at the detriment of relatively high operating costs.However, this is the current status and what matters more, according to me, is that management is already addressing these problems, both strategically and operationally.The change in strategic focus is reflected in a now differentiated product portfolio consisting of growing recurring revenue, increasing product adoption by offering a free trial and working with channel partners. If well-executed, the returns can be astoundingly high.Now, on the operational side, I strongly believe that with the reduction in operating costs (33% less when compared on a quarterly basis), the company is on track towards improving those net margins. As a matter of fact, the reduction in earnings loss by a factor of nearly 3 (-$0.34 to -$0.13) shows that the company is moving in the right direction in terms of profitability and positive earnings.For a company which has sustained a negative net profit margin for some time, it is important, in addition to the revenue and cost metrics, to have a strong management team at the helm in these difficult times and plan financing in order to avoid cash flow difficulties in such a way as to not run out of money.The CEO is David Karp, not to be confused with David Karp, the founder and former CEO of the short-form blogging platform Tumblr. He has been working for more than 13 years in CounterPath as the CFO before taking the helm in September 2018. With a career in corporate finance, he has experience in raising equity financing and also managed a number of mergers and acquisitions.In the current financial context, he is the ideal CEO, someone with in-depth experience with the company finances. In this context, he has already made his mark by those drastic reductions in operating costs. I believe that he is key in driving the company to better execute on its strategic and financial goals.David Karp also manages the accounting and finance. This organizational role is appropriate in this loss-making company where “balancing it financially” and raising finance, is relatively more important than in a profit-making one. The reason is that a business sustaining a net operating loss can experience cash flow difficulties because it is not earning enough to cover expenses.The CEO is aware of the issue of cash flow, which has received significant coverage in the Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Financial Results where there is evidence of stringent planning in order to avoid cash flow difficulties in order not to run out of money. Also, it is mentioned that the company also has an existing line of credit contracted on October 10, 2018, of which there is an unused portion of $1 million.Also, the company has been successful at raising private capital in the past.Figure 6: CounterPath funding historySource: OwlerTherefore, taking into consideration the profitability and leadership strength, the outlook is not completely negative and an entry position in the company can be envisaged.The share price has continued its downtrend despite a favorable earnings report (Revenue of $2.7M, +10.7% Y/Y ) and significant reduction in the loss per share on December 12. The main reason for the good news not to have been translated into sustained stock upside is, according to me, the uncertainty induced in the minds of investors as a result of the letter received by the delisting from Nasdaq on December 16.The stock trades at $0.98 currently. At an RSI of 41, the company seems nearer to the oversold (RSI < 30) than the overbought (RSI>70) mark. Also, there should be some volatility in the stock price as the January 30, 2020 deadline approaches. By this date, the company will have to submit its plan to be compliant with Nasdaq listing requirements.Figure 7: Counterpath total returns compared with peersSource: YChartsThe company’s stock has a one-year total return of -20%. At the same time, the total return of Ring Central (another provider) has appreciated by more than 100%, with the rise fueled mainly by revenue rises of nearly 30% year on year and also, the realization by investors that cloud-based VoIP solutions and associated UCaaS (cloud-based Unified Communications as a Service) technologies are still relatively new with relatively little competition. This lack of competition could also benefit CounterPath.I believe that after the company has complied with Nasdaq listing requirements, it will benefit from an upside in its stock price. Now, even this upside is a quarter of the total returns of Ring Central (which stands at 100%), the share price of CounterPath could rise to $1.20-$1.25, that is an increase of nearly 25% from the current price of $0.98.CounterPath is operating in a still developing market characterized by high R&D costs. This is also a huge market where the internet and the cloud have disrupted the traditional landline telephony model and as a result, there is significant potential for companies operating within to grow their revenues.Also, taking a wider perspective, the net margins of all the providers (including CounterPath) are negative, that is they are all loss-making. The reason is that cloud-based VoIP and associated technologies are still in the development phase when compared to the products offered by the traditional on-premises providers like Cisco (CSCO). Therefore, the R&D expenses remain considerable.Provided the company can execute on its plan to get on board more paid customers through the free trials and transition to a fully recurring revenue model as well as cut down further on operating costs, generate sufficient cash flow and maintain equity financing, there could be an upside in the company’s stock price in the short to medium term. To support the execution, there is a strong leadership, well-versed in financial management."

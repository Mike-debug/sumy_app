4377657,103480,2020-10-05T13:26:43-04:00,"Shares of Salesforce have risen ~20% since reporting Q2 earnings I late August, even after a September correction.
        And despite this ~10% fall from highs since September, Salesforce still trades at a >10x forward revenue multiple, richer than 7-8x historically.
        Expect growth rates to slow to the teens, at least optically, in Q3 as last year's acquisition of Tableau begins to be comped.
        Earnings also remain slim, despite the fact that Salesforce has reached a >$20 billion annualized revenue run rate.","Salesforce.com (CRM) has had a lot of things go right for it this year. The cloud software company - often touted as the first pure-play cloud company that began charging customers on a subscription basis instead of via an upfront license - was admitted for the first time into the Dow Jones, signaling its presence as a cornerstone of the modern economy. It has executed well amid the pandemic, with its entirely recurring revenue base shielding Salesforce from the type of volatility that license-based peers, like Alteryx (AYX), have suffered.For all of these strengths, investors have rewarded Salesforce with a ~50% year-to-date gain, far better than a ~5% gain for the S&P 500. Enthusiasm for Salesforce's stock only picked up after Salesforce posted a blowout second quarter toward the tail end of August. The stock is still up ~20% post-earnings, despite dipping ~10% alongside other tech stocks in September.The big question now for investors is: can the market continue to find enough bullish drivers to keep the Salesforce rally going? In my view, the answer is no.The first reason is due to valuation. As you can see in the chart above, Salesforce has now notched a 10.5x forward revenue multiple. That might not sound so unusual in a very expensive tech landscape, but we do note that Salesforce has historically traded at a 7-8x valuation multiple instead (and this was when the company was growing, organically, in the ~20% range over the past two years - technically, as growth rates come down, so should valuation multiples).Salesforce's current growth rates are currently inflated, as they have been for the past four quarters. The reason is Tableau - and starting next quarter in Q3, Tableau (which generated ~$1.4 billion in annual revenue at the time of Salesforce's acquisition) will be fully comped in Salesforce's results. As a result of this, Salesforce's third-quarter guidance of 16% y/y growth should be thought of as Salesforce's true, organic growth rate.Figure 1. Salesforce guidance updateSource: Salesforce Q2 earnings releaseVersus other cloud software companies that are growing at a mid-teens/low 20s pace, meanwhile, Salesforce trades at a quite a premium, with the exception of Workday (WDAY), against which Salesforce has always traded at a roughly one-turn discount:The second major reason is that despite profit expansion this year, Salesforce is still nowhere near being able to support its valuation with true earnings, which to date are still paper-thin. To put this into perspective: Salesforce's >$20 billion annualized revenue scale makes it the largest pure-play cloud software company in the market, and in the software space overall, it's only behind Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP), and Microsoft (MSFT). Yet even among the faster-growing cloud-based peers, Salesforce is lagging. Adobe (ADBE), for example, is only slightly more than half of Salesforce's revenue scale, yet generating richer cash flows and EPS than Salesforce.The bottom line here: Salesforce is at risk when sentiment on tech stocks reverses. There's little to suggest that Salesforce has earned a permanent valuation re-rating above its historical 7-8x forward revenue range, when the story on Salesforce remains pretty much the same: decelerating growth owing to saturation in Sales Cloud, and thin margins due to Salesforce's continued investments in growth and M&A. I'm neutral on this stock and watching from the sidelines.Let's now investigate Salesforce's latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q2 earnings summary is shown below:Figure 2. Salesforce Q2 resultsSource: Salesforce Q2 earnings releaseTo me, Salesforce's results are ""more of the same."" The company's revenue grew 29% y/y in Q2 to $5.15 billion (again, benefited by the no-Tableau comp in the prior-year Q2), which beat Wall Street's expectations of $4.95 billion (+23% y/y) but slipped one point relative to Q1's 30% y/y growth rate.Salesforce's organically developed cloud products - namely, Sales Cloud - are growing slower than the company as a whole. Sales Cloud has fallen to 13% y/y growth (from high teens last year), while Service Cloud and Marketing Cloud have fallen to ~20% y/y growth (versus mid-20s last year). Salesforce's ""growth"" is all centered around its platform segment, into which the company has placed recent acquisitions like MuleSoft and Tableau which make up the lion's share of that revenue.Figure 3. Salesforce revenue by cloudSource: Salesforce Q2 earnings deckMark Hawkins, Salesforce's longtime CFO, characterized the demand environment for Salesforce as strong in Q2, despite the pandemic. Per his prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:What we do want to zoom a bit closer on is Salesforce's profitability. On a pro forma basis, Salesforce did do a good job of expanding its operating margins by 590bps to a record 20.2%.Figure 4. Salesforce operating margin trendsSource: Salesforce Q2 earnings deckMany investors, however, see this margin expansion as long overdue for Salesforce. And my concern here is that the pace of margin expansion that Salesforce achieved in Q2 may not be sustained. Hawkins additionally added that Salesforce planned to ramp up spending in the second half of FY21 that was originally intended for FY22:For the current year, Salesforce has guided to $3.72-$3.74 in EPS, the midpoint of which is up 25% y/y from last year's $2.99. For next year, Wall Street consensus is calling for barely any earnings growth at all - consensus has pro forma EPS at $3.76 for FY22, per Yahoo Finance. The key takeaway here: Salesforce's constant spending growth is putting a damper on its earnings, and because Salesforce is already so large we fear that the company may never reach the margin levels of similarly-sized peers like Adobe, which year-to-date has generated a GAAP net margin of 32% (Salesforce, meanwhile, is at 27% net margins for the year, but that also includes a $1.8 billion tax benefit and a $0.9 billion accounting gain on an acquisition that, together, is worth virtually the entirety of Salesforce's GAAP profits this year). Salesforce is currently valued at ~68x P/E - even though the company has demonstrated no near-term path to meaningful profit expansion that would bring that multiple down to more normalized levels.Salesforce is an iconic cloud company and owner of a vast portfolio of software products, but that doesn't mean that the stock still has upside. Salesforce's ~10% correction since September is an indication that the stock may have reached its near-term ceiling, especially with valuations hovering above historical multiples. Tread with caution here."
4375057,41961,2020-09-17T23:33:03-04:00,"Salesforce.com once again delivered strong results this quarter, with revenue increasing almost 30%.Evidence of its transformation from just a sales management tool has been emerging over the last few years.The Mulesoft acquisition has now helped position Salesforce.com as a core platform for digital transformation, something that was most clearly evident this quarter.","Salesforce.com (CRM) again demonstrated strong results, above investor guidance and analyst expectations. While the business is best known for its flagship sales cloud product, the results from the business during this latest quarter demonstrates the power of a platform-based approach to easily land and expand into existing customers. It is for this reason that the business continues to remain a core holding of the Project $1M portfolio.While Salesforce still remains the original SaaS (Software as a Service) company and is now well into to its third decade of growth, having been founded in 1999, the business is showing few signs of becoming long in the tooth.The company most recently reported quarterly revenue growth of 29%, which would be the envy of many nimbler, less well-aged growth businesses.Source: Salesforce Q2 Investor DeckIn the time since founding, Salesforce has become much more than the original sales funnel management tool that started the Salesforce empire. However, Sales Cloud is still a strongly growing segment with significant upside, something that was in evidence from its 13% growth rate.Sales Cloud continues to help enterprises fill their core need to have their sales teams quickly and easily manage sales pipeline and sales opportunities from wherever they are in the field. It delivers significant productivity enhancements to a sales force to help maintain sales efficiency, while still providing the needed visibility that sales management requires.The Sales Cloud remains a key tool for sales leadership to be able to communicate progress toward sales goals, understand where the business is with respect to progress in a given quarter, and be able to remediate and address productivity issues or poor performers.Salesforce has significant mindshare within the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) market. In fact, at many companies, it is expected that new sales people will have a working understanding of Sales Cloud. Sales people themselves are known to actively push Sales Cloud as their preferred tool to manage a sales pipeline and funnel to ensure that they can maintain existing productivity and not have to be trained on a new system.This strong market presence shows up in market data. The company has been accelerating market share gains against competitors such as SAP (SAP) and Oracle (ORCL) in the market for CRM.Salesforce now has nearly 20% market share in CRM, compared to other competitors who are in the mid- to low single digits in terms of market share. While the CRM market is fairly mature, the runway for growth is strong, with a compound annual growth rate of almost 13% expected over the next 4 years.Source: Salesforce Q2 '20While Sales Cloud is the historical growth engine of the business, in recent years, Salesforce has significantly augmented its capabilities and has been successfully pursuing a land and expand approach, something which is now bearing significant fruit. What's helped drive Salesforce's success here is a platform strategy, which allows the company to layer on additional capabilities that coexist with the core Sales Cloud.In fact, each new module further reinforces the core value of the Sales Cloud and provides more meaningful data and context to allow a business to view its broader interactions with both potential and existing customers. Salesforce's service, marketing, commerce and platform cloud will be the more dominant drivers in the company's growth over the next decade.Service Cloud, which now generates almost as much revenue today as Sales Cloud, helps an enterprise to deliver customer support and operations management. This is a very natural function to have managed alongside a core CRM capability. There are synergies in having a platform approach to manage trouble tickets, and then associate them to customer data contained in the CRM system and allow for appropriate prioritization based on size and value of a given customer.Marketing cloud also helps track marketing effectiveness and campaign outreach and attribution to eventual account creation, helping marketing teams understand the effective value that they generate from marketing spend.Each of these segments are large opportunities in their own right, with robust growth prospects.Service Cloud now contributes $1.3 billion per quarter revenue and is growing at 20% annualized growth, while Marketing & Commerce Cloud is the smallest of all the of the clouds, contributing $0.7 billion in Q2 revenue and growing at 21% year over year.The Service Cloud market segment is expected to grow at 17% annualized over the next 4 years, with marketing cloud experiencing a 21% annualized growth in its addressable market over the same period.Source: Salesforce Q2 '20Finally, Salesforce Platform, which is the fastest-growing segment of all, currently has quarterly revenue of $1.3 billion and was built off the Mulesoft integration.Salesforce Platform provides a way for enterprises to connect and integrate software as a service application data that exists across cloud platforms and on premises to provide a unified view of a customer, across both Salesforce clouds as well as third-party applications. It does this through providing a variety of API interfaces to allow such data to be pulled in, without requiring expensive custom development or middleware licenses.Salesforce Platform is positioned to benefit from digital transformation. As enterprises rush to be more data-driven organizations, an increasing number of software packages and tools will be used in this process. Salesforce Platform is an enabler for businesses to transform by allowing enterprises pull in their data in a consistent way into a central repository through an integration work flow. Through this process, Salesforce helps turn these individual applications and services with siloed data into a useful, consolidated picture.Salesforce's valuation ratio has generally been very consistent over the last few years, with a price-to-sales multiple that has generally been within 8x-10x sales. The company's most recent results have pushed this multiple up a little, though not terribly above its longer-term range.While revenue growth will likely pull back a little into next year, the company's platform positioning and enterprise demand to consolidate various SaaS application data into a single view should continue to propel Salesforce platform growth going forward. When looked at in this context, the spike in the company's valuation from historical trends can be rationalized.One of the largest risks associated with an investment in Salesforce is the acquisitive nature of the company's business strategy. Mulesoft has been a follow-up to other large recent acquisitions, such as Tableau and Datorama.The risk of such an aggressive acquisition strategy is high integration risk, talent retention and the challenge of systems not interfacing in a cohesive matter. In Salesforce's case, the company appears to have the integration of acquisitions down to an art form, however, there is always a risk that it may overreach and erode shareholder capital in this process.Salesforce is cementing its transformation toward a platform-oriented business, an approach which is clearly paying dividends based on current results. Its platform approach is helping the company to land and expand and layer in other related Salesforce cloud capabilities which leverage the core Sales Cloud data and provide enterprises with additional productivity tools and insights on their customers' behavior.Additionally, Salesforce Platform, built upon the company's Mulesoft integration, helps to unify data not only across Salesforce clouds, but equally importantly, third-party data, which will provide enterprises with a consistent view of the activity that takes place within a company.All of this is available at a relatively undemanding forward price-to-sales multiple of 10x sales. With Salesforce likely to continue growing revenue at a rate of 20% for the next few years, this seems to be a business that is poised to deliver good returns over the medium term."

It announced its second-quarter results this week, and what a blowout quarter it was. The company surpassed all market expectations and revised its fiscal year revenue targets upwards despite current pandemic conditions. Earlier this week, Salesforce was also added to the Dow Jones index. Post the result announcement, the stock climbed an impressive 13% in the after-hours trading session.Salesforce's revenues for the second quarter grew 29% to $5.15 billion, above analyst estimates of $4.9 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.44 per share was also better than the market's forecast of $0.67 per share.By segment, subscription and support revenues grew 29% to $4.84 billion, professional services and other revenues grew 23% to $310 million.Among key metrics, remaining performance obligation grew 21% over the year to $30.6 billion. Current remaining performance obligation grew 26% to $15.2 billion.For the third quarter, Salesforce forecast revenues of $5.24-$5.25 billion with an EPS of $0.73-$0.74. The market was looking for $5.01 billion with an EPS of $0.76. Salesforce expects to end the current fiscal with revenues of $20.8 billion and an EPS of $3.72-$3.74. The market was looking for revenues of $20.01 billion for the year with an EPS of $2.97.Salesforce is focusing its efforts on addressing the current pandemic induced conditions. For instance, it recently introduced Salesforce Anywhere - an integrated platform service that will help organizations deliver productivity and customer success even in the current conditions. With Salesforce Anywhere, organizations can sell, service, and market from anywhere; collaborate from anywhere using the new Salesforce Anywhere app that embeds chat, alerts, comments and video into the Salesforce experience; work from anywhere with a new employee service solution and new employee data model that enable organizations to build, manage, and scale employee apps and services quickly and securely; analyze data from anywhere by leveraging its earlier acquisitions of MuleSoft and Tableau; and skill up from anywhere by using Einstein Recommendations for Trailhead and its new learning content.It also entered into a partnership with Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) to help organizations manage the new normal. Together, the two companies will develop a new workplace technology suite that will support businesses to safely reopen and manage physical workplaces under the new social distancing framework. As part of the tie-up, Salesforce's Work.com will be integrated with Siemens' Smart Infrastructure solutions, including Comfy and Enlighted, to help workplaces create and manage processes essential to creating safe, connected workplaces. Its solutions will include a touchless office that grants safe access into buildings and elevators, an occupancy management system to allow conference room reservation and even emergency response and contact tracing capabilities.Last quarter, Salesforce also announced the release of Government Cloud Plus, a dedicated instance of Salesforce's cloud infrastructure isolated for U.S. federal, state, and local government customers. Government Cloud Plus has achieved a FedRAMP Provisional Authority to Operate status at the High Security Impact Level.I think Salesforce's PaaS strategy has been its mantra to its success. I count Salesforce as the leader of the PaaS pack because of its successful developer ecosystem. Salesforce fuels innovation among developers and, in return, is able to expand not only the capabilities of its platform, but also offer industry-specific solutions.Salesforce had launched its AppExchange back in 2006. By 2018, the company had recorded over 3,400 apps on the platform recording over 5.6 million installs. Today, the AppExchange has over 5,000 apps with more than 6.5 million installs. It has a wide array of over a thousand consultants building apps on the platform. Salesforce reports that 95% of the Fortune 100 companies have installed a solution from its AppExchange and nearly 88% of its customers have installed Salesforce apps.The AppExchange has helped empower companies like Vlocity to build industry-specific solutions and build sustainable businesses that translate to billion-dollar valuations and exits.Another stellar example is that of Veeva (NYSE:VEEV) that has a very close relationship with Salesforce. Veeva was founded by former Salesforce SVP of Technology Peter Gassner, and it built its CRM platform powered by Force.com. Veeva has continuously integrated and expanded these offerings, all on Force.com. Today, Veeva has become a $30+ billion-dollar company in a very capital-efficient way.Then there was MapAnything that Salesforce acquired last year. MapAnything was also built on Force was available through Salesforce's AppExchange store and was both a Salesforce SI Partner and an ISV Premier Partner. The acquisition helped Salesforce add location-based intelligence solutions to its services that were already integrated with its offerings.Vlocity and Veeva are illustrations of how Salesforce continued to focus on building a platform that catered to the omni-channel and multi-industry requirements while Vlocity and Veeva leveraged the platform to build vertical specific, niche offerings. MapAnything illustrates how Salesforce was able to add significant capabilities to its services without building them out on its own.Its stock is trading at $208.46 with a market capitalization of $194.7 billion. It had touched a record high of $218.35 earlier this month. The stock fell to a 52-week low of $115.29 in March due to the global crisis.Photo Credit: Open Grid Scheduler / Grid Engine /Flickr.comOriginal PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4371186,104442,2020-08-27T14:27:36-04:00,"Salesforce.com is the undisputed leader in the area of customer relationship management software and managed to grow by double-digit growth rates despite a very challenging market environment.The stock surged by around 27% the day after the quarterly figures were released, as the company literally pulverized Wall Street expectations.Nevertheless, Salesforce.com shows a significant undervaluation compared to its peer group and on the basis of a DCF calculation despite its recent surge.In this article, I want to discuss on which basis Salesforce.com is significantly undervalued and what potential the stock could have.","In this article, I want to present Salesforce.com (CRM), which is another one of my favorite technology stocks, and discuss why the stock could potentially double from here.This week began with two good news for Salesforce.com. First, it was announced that Salesforce.com will be the first pure Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company to be included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index, highlighting the company's dominant market position in general and the growing importance of digital business models.Secondly, the company has reported stunning quarterly figures for the second quarter, which have literally smashed market expectations and the company's own guidance so that the stock was up around 15% pre-market and 27% intraday.Salesforce.com's operational success is especially visible when looking at the chart for the past ten years and comparing it with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices. As can be seen in the following chart, Salesforce.com outperformed both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices by far. That not only highlights once again the company's operational success but also the increasing shift in the global economy towards digitization and software-based business models.(Salesforce.com stock performance vs. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. Source: YCharts)When looking at the one-year chart, it is noticeable that the stock fell behind the Nasdaq 100, especially in the wake of the pandemic, due to growth worries, and was able to move ahead of the Nasdaq 100 after the surge in the stock price in connection with the release of the Q2 figures.(Salesforce.com's one-year chart compared to Nasdaq 100. Source: YCharts)In this article I would like to discuss why the lag in Salesforce.com's stock price may offer an opportunity for investors and what overall potential Salesforce.com may have.(Salesforce.com logo. Source: Salesforce.com)As mentioned above, the stock underperformed other SaaS and technology companies due to growth concerns and worries about declining corporate software spending in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.With the publication of the figures for the second quarter, this logically turned out to be a fallacy. This is due to the fact that especially when consumers needed to stay, work and shop from home during the lockdown, it is increasingly important for companies to better understand customer behavior and to have a smooth customer relationship management system in order to master the increasing demand and gain market share from competitors. Who would be better suited for this purpose than the global market leader for customer relationship management software (the following image illustrates Salesforce.com's software solutions)?(Salesforce.com offerings overview. Source: earnings call presentation)Consequently, the company smashed expectations by releasing the following figures for the second quarter of its FY 2021:In this context, it is noteworthy that the company recorded double-digit growth rates in all of its business areas, as can be seen in the following figure.(Salesforce.com growth by service offerings. Source: earnings press release)Additionally, the company recorded double-digit growth rates in every geographic region, which underlines its leading service offerings as well as loyal and increasing customer base (see following figure).(Salesforce.com growth by geographic region. Source: earnings press release)In this context, it is noteworthy that 94% of Salesforce.com's revenues are subscription based and thus are recurring, which in turn makes revenues more reliable and predictable (see following figure).(Salesforce.com revenue breakdown. Source: earnings press release)Turning to guidance, the company raised its Q3 and overall FY 2021 guidance, as can be seen in the following figure. Additionally, the company now expects a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 15-16% for FY 2021.Salesforce.com guidance for Q3 and Q4 FY 2021. Source: earnings press release)After a quick overview of the current quarterly figures, let's now take a look at Salesforce.com's valuationWith a market cap of $244B, Salesforce.com is currently together with Adobe (ADBE) the largest SaaS company by market cap, as demonstrated by the following figure.(Salesforce.com market cap compared with peers. Source: YCharts).Additionally, Salesforce.com is currently the largest SaaS company by revenue, as illustrated by the following figure. In this context, it should be mentioned Salesforce.com had a relatively high revenue growth rate of 29% in Q2. Adobe, for example, had a revenue growth rate of 14% in its most recent quarter.(Salesforce.com annual revenue vs. peer group. Source: YCharts)And now comes the most interesting part. Although Salesforce.com is the largest SaaS company by revenue and market cap, and seems to be a necessity for corporate customers based on the revenue surge despite the pandemic, it shows a significant undervaluation compared to other SaaS companies on a forward EV to revenue basis; despite the fact that some of its peers even have a significant smaller market share and generate much less revenue (see following figure).(Salesforce.com EV/revenues multiple vs. peers. Source: YCharts)Salesforce.com is currently up 26% following the day of its Q2 earnings release. If today's surge in the share price is factored out, Salesforce.com had an EV/revenue multiple of just 7.4. In comparison, Adobe, for example, has a current forward EV/revenue multiple of over 18.Consequently, if Salesforce.com were now to catch up with Adobe's or other large SaaS peers' valuation, the share price would have to double.For the sake of completeness, it should be mentioned that Salesforce.com generates a bit less free cash flow in comparison with Adobe (see figure below).(Salesforce.com free cash flow compared to peers. Source: YCharts)Additionally, the company's profitability is far lower in comparison with Adobe but much higher compared to other peers (see figure below).(Salesforce.com operating income compared to peers. Source: YCharts)With regard to profitability, the CFO mentioned the following during the earnings call for the Q2 results:Consequently, going forward the company intends to invest in growth but at the same time expects increase in profitability.Nevertheless, I prepared a calculation of Salesforce.com's fair value based on a DCF model in order to make a more accurate assessment of the valuation.In order to choose a conservative approach, I have chosen a growth rate of 20% per year in terms of the free cash flow, which is lower than analysts' estimates for the next few years provided by MarketScreener and also lower than the free cash flow growth rates in the past six years provided by Morningstar (see following figure).(Salesforce.com FCF growth over time. Source: Morningstar)Furthermore, I have chosen a multiple of 32 for the last FCF, which corresponds to the average Price/Cash Flow multiple for the past five years and is significantly lower than the current multiple of 45, according to Morningstar (see following figure).(Salesforce.com price/cash flow multiple. Source: Morningstar)Based on my valuation method, the fair value is $503.55, which corresponds to an undervaluation of the stock of 84% (see left side of the calculation below).Since I was often asked in my articles how the fair value changes at a discount rate of 8%, I included the calculation this time. As you can see on the right side of the calculation below, the corresponding fair value would be $423.47, which would represent an upside potential of 55%.(Salesforce.com fair value. Source: author's calculation)As the following figure illustrates, the stock broke out of its bullish trend on August 25 with a strong volume, which was confirmed the day after the quarterly figures were published by an even stronger surge in the share price with an even higher volume. This also supports a further climbing stock price.(Salesforce.com chart and breakout. Source: Finviz)Salesforce.com is the undisputed market leader in the area of customer relationship management applications and has managed to grow with a growth rate of around 29% despite a difficult market environment. This underlines the company's dominant market position and its growth potential going forward.As already described, the company is massively undervalued both in the peer group comparison and on the basis of a DCF calculation of the fair value of the stock.While the peer group comparison based on an EV/revenue multiple indicates a doubling of the share price, the DCF calculation results in an undervaluation of 84%, which would correspond to a fair value of approximately $500. At the same time the chart-technical breakout also supports further rising share prices.Nevertheless, even if the shares appear fundamentally undervalued, unexpected events are always to be expected on the stock market and there is no guarantee of rising share prices. Investors should always bear in mind that stock prices are volatile and should not be influenced by price movements alone, but rather should pay attention to the underlying fundamentals. In this respect, investors should always pay attention to their individual risk tolerance.PS: If you liked my article and you want me to write more articles of this kind in the future, then like, comment and share this article.

4370805,69905,2020-08-26T07:37:33-04:00,Salesforce's revenue growth rates are guided higher and remain surprisingly strong.Salesforce pushes aside its previous reliance on an M&A strategy.Salesforce still has more upside potential ahead.,"Salesforce (CRM) is in top form. Presently, I make the case that its stock is undervalued and has more potential ahead.By analyzing its growth rates, EPS targets, and cash flow potential, one can reasonably assert that Salesforce still has ample room to grow further and that its stock remains underpriced - even now.Furthermore, I contend that Salesforce is cheaper than many of its peers and in some cases unjustifiably cheaper. This stock is well worth adding to a well-diversified portfolio.(source)In the way of background to my stance on Salesforce, I should note that I had been vocally bearish of Salesforce in the past, arguing that Salesforce's revenue growth rates were being supported through inorganic M&A. That acquiring plug-in companies in a very hotly priced market (public and private) was not a rewarding strategy or a reason to be bullish Salesforce.However, Salesforce's latest set of results firmly changed my mind on Salesforce's prospects. Here's why:Source: author's calculations, ***company guidanceOn the surface, it appears that Salesforce's revenue growth rates for fiscal H2 2021 (its next two quarters) will pale in comparison with its performance during fiscal H2 2020.If last year Salesforce reported approximately mid-30s percent revenue growth rates, this year it's poised to report mid-teen revenue growth rates - a 2000 basis point deceleration y/y. Typically, this would be difficult to get excited about a company.However, let's consider what analysts were expecting for Salesforce over the next couple of quarters:Source: SA Premium ToolsFor a company that was previously expected to grow its fiscal Q4 2021 at single digits and is now expected to grow its revenues in the mid-teens growth rates, this will force many analysts to upwards revise their financial models.Put simply, this is Salesforce arguing that despite its size, it's not being hindered and still has a lot of promise ahead.Another issue I previously had with Salesforce was that its cash flow was being supported by inorganic acquisitions.Accordingly, Salesforce had deployed huge sums to acquire Tableau and MuleSoft and I could not see how that strategy was sustainable.However, during the earnings call yesterday, Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff said,Consequently, given that Salesforce is now stepping back from its reliance on consistent and expensive acquisitions and is now looking towards improving its underlying margins, this could nicely reinforce the bullish thesis here.In fact, for fiscal 2020, Salesforce's non-GAAP EPS was $2.99 and at the time, it guided for fiscal 2021 to be up to $3.16 to $3.18. Thus, not only is Salesforce now guiding to finish fiscal 2021 at $3.73 at the midpoint, but this implies an increase of approximately 25% y/y.What's more, on its cash flow from operations line, if we take its high-end guidance of 13%, this would imply that Salesforce's cash flows from operations could come in just shy of $5 billion.Not only is this a significant amount of cash, but it certainly helps support the bullish thesis that its valuation is not exuberantly priced.Source: author's calculationsIn the land of productivity-assisting cloud stocks backed with recurring business models, Salesforce is in no way expensively valued.What's more, given its new guidance, naysayers can't even argue that Salesforce's growth rates are all that slow. Looking ahead over the next few quarters, Workday (WDAY) is largely pointing towards very similar growth rates to Salesforce, yet Workday trades more than one turn higher on a P/Sales multiple.Anyway one appraises Salesforce's fiscal Q2 2021 results, it was a very strong quarter without any blemishes.Moreover, it's difficult to argue that at less than 10x forward sales, this leading cloud company is fully pricing in its full potential. Given its raised financial targets and strong cash flows from operations, this stock is well worth considering."
4364612,35181,2020-08-05T10:05:24-04:00,Salesforce has strong free cash flow margin and nearly $10 billion in cash and cash equivalents.Revenue growth of 30% is also exceptional for a company with revenue exceeding $18 billion.The company will most certainly come out of the pandemic and recession in excellent shape.Salesforce's stock price has broken out to an all-time high. I believe that the stock is a smart investment for the current economic conditions.,"Salesforce.com (CRM) is considered to be the granddaddy of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and a major force in the paradigm shift called digital transformation. But there is much negativity surrounding this company, with some analysts believing that Salesforce's best days are behind it. While it is true that Salesforce is achieving a portion of its growth via acquisition, this should not diminish its stature as a leader during these uncertain times when digital transformation is dramatically accelerating due to the pandemic-driven work-from-home phenomenon. With Salesforce’s strong free cash flow margin of 23% and nearly $10 billion in cash and cash equivalents, this is a conservative company that investors should consider investing in.(Source: Salesforce)While most other companies have withdrawn guidance for the remainder of the year, Salesforce management has confidently provided positive guidance with revenue ~$20 billion, up from $17.1 billion the previous year. Operating cash flow is expected to grow by 10% to 11%, and free cash flow is expected to grow by 13% to 14%. Given that Salesforce generally does not miss analysts’ estimates, I take comfort in this company’s prospects for the coming year.(Source: portfolio123)Not only is Salesforce in a good position to weather the pandemic and global recession, but Mr. Market is signaling bullishness as the stock price has now broken out to an all-time high.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)For me, the vote of confidence from Mr. Market makes Salesforce an easy investment choice. This company’s revenue growth will likely exceed 20% in a very dismal economic environment. And an already strong free cash flow is expected to grow by double digits. I also find that Salesforce is undervalued relative to its software peers. For these reasons, I am assigning a buy rating for Salesforce.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The rule provides a single metric for evaluating both high-growth companies that aren't profitable and mature companies that have lower growth but are profitable. Revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) must add up to at least 40% in order to fulfill the rule. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can tolerate some level of negative free cash flow. But if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth. This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so ones.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to a previous article I have written.The two factors required for calculating the Rule of 40 are revenue growth and free cash flow margin. Salesforce's annual revenue growth for the last year was 30%, while its free cash flow margin was a strong 23%.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)Therefore, the Rule of 40 calculation for Salesforce is as follows:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 30% + 23% = 53%Salesforce's score fulfills the Rule of 40, suggesting that Salesforce has a healthy balance between growth and profitability.Now critics are going to jump all over this because the Rule of 40 has traditionally been calculated based on organic growth. As I pointed out earlier, Salesforce achieves a fair proportion of its growth via acquisition. In all fairness, there are very few SaaS companies that still grow entirely organically. As a compromise, one could subtract share dilution. In the case of Salesforce, share dilution was 16% over the last year.This results in a modified score on the Rule of 40:53% - 16% = 37%While the share dilution was significant, the modified score is very close to 40% and I wouldn’t discount an investment based on this factor alone. Salesforce is still in the right ballpark and other SaaS companies typically dilute shares by at least 5% anyways, something that I am not considering here. In any case, Salesforce has other attributes that make it an attractive investment, attributes such as its history of steady revenue growth and free cash flow growth. Both factors suggest exceptional management.The plot below illustrates how Salesforce stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward EV/Sales versus forward revenue growth. Note: Please refer to a recent article for more information on the scatter plot relative valuation technique.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)Salesforce is situated below the best-fit line on the scatter plot, suggesting that the stock is somewhat undervalued on a relative basis relative to its peers.It seems unlikely that we will see a vaccine until at least the spring of 2021 and that depends on everything going well in Phase 3 trials for vaccine candidates. Therefore, it will be at least a year (in my opinion) before we see a return to some kind of normalcy.While we wait, the government and the Federal Reserve are being generous with handouts and stimulus. But how long will this last? The handouts are a heavy burden for taxpayers, and I can’t see such handouts persisting for much longer, certainly not past the November election. When the handouts stop, I expect that the stock market may become very bearish.There are suggestions from critics that Microsoft (MSFT) Dynamics 365 is outperforming Salesforce in its own backyard and will in fact have more market share in Salesforce’s core market within three years. While it may be true that Microsoft is taking some market share, I am not seeing the evidence that Salesforce is in any trouble.(Source: Salesforce)Investors should always take such critical market share analysis with a grain of salt. The ultimate indicator, even if Salesforce is losing market share, is Salesforce’s revenue and free cash flow growth, and these fundamentals do not appear to be unduly slowing down by any significant amount beyond what should be expected over time for a high-growth company.Salesforce has been in business for a long time. Through 21 years and two previous recessions, Salesforce has proven to be a SaaS cash machine. Salesforce is credited with introducing SaaS to the world and SaaS is now being replicated by almost all software companies with very good results.Salesforce sports an annual revenue growth of 30%, albeit fueled by acquisitions. Apart from the expected revenue growth, Salesforce has strong free cash flow and nearly $10 billion in cash and cash equivalents. As a leader (or perhaps the leader) in digital transformation, I expect that this company will navigate the pandemic successfully and still achieve double-digit growth in spite of the global recession. After all, the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation and Salesforce is a company that should benefit from this massive pandemic shift.We don’t know when the pandemic will subside, and we don’t know how the recession will play out, although it is very likely that it will be long and deep. Salesforce’s strong balance sheet and recent financial performance make it an ideal investment in today’s market. Given that Salesforce stock is undervalued relative to its peers and the stock is making a move to all-time highs, I am giving the company a bullish rating."
4370828,101959,2020-08-26T09:34:35-04:00,"Salesforce.com reported earnings and shot up like a rocket in AH trading.Results were better than expected, removing fears of companies reeling back IT spending.Salesforce.com is never cheap, and rightfully so. The company is growing at an impressive rate considering its size, and remains founder-led, agile, and continuing to expand in lucrative markets.I'm long for the long term.","I've been a long-time fan of Salesforce.com (CRM). The company has been one of those long-term compounders that is quietly making investors huge returns. I say quietly because I don't see it popping up in the news nearly as often as many other tech giants, and definitely not as much as other cloud names in the past few months. However, this is likely not justified. Given the company's valuation, track record, and growth prospects, I think that CRM is well-positioned to continue to crush the market for years to come. The company is still led by its founder, Marc Benioff, who has successfully steered it into new lines of business over the years and overseen exceptional growth.The Dow will welcome CRM to the storied index on Monday, August 31, to increase its technology exposure due to the Apple (AAPL) split. If you don't understand, you can read into it, but it's really not worth your time, since price-weighting just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Despite all the buzz about the Dow shakeup, however, I expect that the news over the next week will likely be focused on the resurgence in growth for the company following concerns over a pullback in IT spend.(Source: Company Q2 2021 Earnings Call Presentation)The most recent quarter saw acceleration in revenue growth, which was happy news for shareholders following a dip in the last quarter as companies reeled in spending. Management also upped revenue guidance for the fiscal year to $20.7-20.8 billion, even as revenue topped $5 billion for the first time this quarter. Adding on to that, operating margin was up to greater than 20%, with an additional 75 bps projected for the fiscal year, and current remaining performance obligation (basically mark-to-market, or revenue backlog, abbreviated CRPO) was up 26% yoy as well to $15.2 billion. Looking across the quarter, I don't see any real downsides to CRM's performance, and the acceleration in CRPO and revenue growth likely explain the huge uptick in the shares post market.(Source: Company Q2 2021 Earnings Call Presentation)CRM's website offers an in-depth and interesting look at the products that the company has to offer, which I've found useful, including video demos and use cases. Looking above, Salesforce Platform and Other benefited by 41% from the Tableau acquisition (data analytics), which will compare against itself starting next quarter. There was solid growth across all business lines, but it's worth noting that Sales Cloud grew slower than the rest of the product lines, despite being the company's legacy business.This is a very positive sign to me when I'm researching a company. Although CRM launched as a sales force tool (obviously), it has managed to pivot and grow into other business lines organically or via acquisition very effectively. This ability to pivot is indicative of an organizational agility that many mega-cap companies don't possess.(Source: Company Q2 2021 Earnings Call Presentation)Looking at the size of a company like CRM, its market cap is right around $200 billion (forgive me if it changes significantly as the stock trades on 8/27). That comes with some safety, considering the size and breadth of the company's customers and operations, but the law of large numbers does tend to limit how quickly a big company can grow. However, when it comes to tech, the best companies haven't been held back so far. Look at some of the blowout numbers from the FAANG/FANMAG/whatever it's being called now over the past few years. Likewise, CRM's projection of 21-22% revenue growth for FY2021 is amazing considering the company's size.Looking above at the company's TAM projections, the overall TAM is projected to be ~$176 billion by 2024 with a 14% long-run growth rate across business lines (this has been adjusted upward over time). This is a useful thought exercise, but is by no means limiting for the company, as it has expanded into many different business lines over the years. Consider the launch of Work.com, which has gained traction in the past few months. CRM was able to quickly launch this product in conjunction with Accenture (ACN), among others, to aid companies, governments, and others to re-open effectively, while sharing information and best practices. Not only is this beneficial to the company's results, it's truly a beneficial product for the customers and will improve brand loyalty coming out of the pandemic. Here's CEO Marc Benioff on the earnings call:Other victories from the quarter included a partnership with PayPal (PYPL) and onboarding of the first 35,000 customers from the deal with AT&T (T) inked back in February.One of the more interesting points to understand about CRM is that the individual value propositions are less than a combination of the whole. The company offers a wide array of products to its customers, with over 1/2 of them using more than one of the clouds at a retention rate of >90%. All of the things that investors love about SaaS companies are evidenced by the long-run returns for CRM, which is effectively the company that I hope my smaller software companies can turn into.(Source: Company Q2 2021 Earnings Call Presentation))CRM is the leader in CRM applications (go figure), and the lead has expanded over time. It had the first-mover advantage in deploying software as a service, giving all of the benefits so touted today on Wall Street, like low upfront costs to customers, easy onboarding, low overhead, high retention, no piracy, etc.Data by YChartsLooking at the company's cash generation, free cash flow has grown meaningfully over time and is projected to increase by 15-16% this year, with FCF coming in at $315 million at 22% growth this quarter. Management has guided for ~3% of revenue spent on capex, with solid operating margin expansion, so I expect to see a continued upward trend in free cash flow, which could some day be used to fund a dividend (although a minimal one considering the company's P/E).Although CRM is profitable, it trades at a very high P/E ratio. This is to be expected considering that the company has maintained its stellar rate of growth despite its large size. As margin expands, I do expect to see meaningful earnings increases in the coming years with the potential for a slowdown in revenue growth.Since CRM is profitable, I will use F.A.S.T. Graphs to take a quick look at compiled analyst earnings projections compared to average valuations. The use case is limited here, in a way, due to the long-run average valuation skew based on CRM's earnings. I'll use ~80X, which is likely what the company will be trading around when the market opens 8/27. Based on that, an investment today could yield around 19% annualized, with the caveat of very high uncertainty. However, I expect upward revisions to these estimates based on the company's results, with management projecting $3.72-3.74 in adjusted EPS for the full FY. Considering valuations across the sector today, I think that CRM is still worthy of a look, and I added to my position yesterday. I'm long for the long term.If you liked this article and would like to read more like it, please click the ""Follow"" button next to my picture at the top and select Real-time alerts.

4370773,92586,2020-08-25T23:06:01-04:00,"Salesforce.com delivered an earnings smasher that made even the more optimistic analyst look too conservative.The sales pipeline has bounced back quickly, and so have margins. The large share price gain on Tuesday does not even account for the 24% bump in full-year EPS guidance.I remain long Salesforce.com because the company and the stock tick many of the boxes in my All-Equities SRG criteria list.","It's as if the 2020 crisis had never happened.In my Salesforce.com (CRM) earnings preview, I stated that I would be ""looking for signs of stabilization,"" following soft guidance for fiscal 2Q delivered three months ago. Instead, the San Francisco-based cloud company delivered an earnings smasher that made even the more optimistic analyst look too conservative.Revenue of $5.1 billion was the highest in the company's history, and the YOY growth rate of 29% was very much in line with pre-pandemic levels. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.44 was nearly double the consensus estimate, as margins headed back up strongly.(Image Credit: Fortune)The table below summarizes the results of the second fiscal quarter of 2021.First, top line performance lavishly exceeded management's growth guidance of 22.5% at the midpoint of the range. The revenue beat was much more aligned with the executive team's remarks about ""improving trends within the pipeline and closed rates between March through [late May],"" offered last earnings season, than with management's cautious outlook. In the earnings call, Salesforce.com credited (1) new business driven by the transition to remote work, (2) a spillover of revenues from AT&T's (T) recent deal and (3) favorable FX as key drivers of the sales upside.The even better news is that profitability found its way back north. In fact, adjusted op margins of 20.2% were the highest ever, and the first time that the metric climbed above the high teens. As I mentioned in my preview, EPS consensus estimate could prove to be overly de-risked, considering that most of the bottom-line headwinds felt in the first fiscal quarter appeared to be one-off or short-term in nature (e.g., guaranteed bonuses to employees and COVID-19-related expenses). And in fact, it was.(Source: Company earnings slides)At first glance, high-end EPS guidance of $0.74 for the next quarter looked a bit soft, even though the revenue outlook surpassed current consensus by quite a bit. However, I believe that any potential bearishness was squashed in the earnings call, when management explained that the earnings pressure in the back end of the year would be a result of accelerated investments in growth. Given the current environment of economic uncertainty, a commitment to plow money back into the company sounds like a bullish vote of confidence in the business fundamentals.All accounted for, between regular and after-hours trading, Salesforce.com finished its earnings day higher by nearly 18% - a whopping $35 billion in market cap generated in less than 24 hours. Some of the rally can be attributed to the stock being included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), but the lion's share of the market value creation has to be credited to the company's strong performance and encouraging prospects.Investors who tend to seek value opportunities will not only take another pass on this stock, which is now up just about 50% for the year, but find it even less appealing at all-time highs. I, on the other hand, choose to maintain my bullishness.Data by YChartsFor starters, the sudden 18% spike in share price does not even fully cover the 27% bump in guided EPS for the full year. Therefore, once Wall Street adjusts its projections, I expect to see CRM trade at a current-year P/E in the low 60s at most, and long-term PEG that may dip below 3.0x.But more important than valuation, I remain long CRM because the company and the stock tick many of the boxes in my All-Equities SRG criteria list: from market dominance to stable and predictable financial performance, to the ability to execute well even in adverse macroeconomic environments."
4360113,103644,2020-07-23T04:05:57-04:00,"Shopify is a fantastic company that benefits from this stay-at-home movement, but will grow fast regardless of how long that lasts.However, Shopify trades at valuations I've never seen before.I offer up Salesforce as a similar, more mature, high-growth alternative.","Are we entering another tech bubble? Obviously, this debate has been back and forth for years. People have been calling for stocks like Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Tesla (TSLA) to fall for the last decade. Typically, the arguments were rudimentary and would say they aren't worth their current P/E ratios. The problem with those bearish arguments was that these companies still had high growth runways of decades, not years, so the valuations made sense. To me, some tech stocks have gotten too high, while others still have plenty of room to run.Valuations still matter at some point and the most ridiculous one to me is Shopify (SHOP). They are a fantastic company and have a great setup for growth for the next decade or two and the stay-at-home mindset is certainly fantastic for them. It will certainly help them expand customers to new small and large businesses alike. However, their valuation has gotten ahead of itself as they now have a higher EV/Sales ratio than Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, or any other high-growth name I could think of had at any point in those companies' histories!Data by YChartsSo even with such high valuations, I expect SHOP to eventually grow into those valuations. It's just a matter of how far ahead do you want to pay for it. Even if SHOP averages 50% growth for the next 5 years, they still will have to trade at ~9x EV/Sales at that point to be the exact same market cap as now. As you can see below, current estimates don't even have them growing at 50% a year, but closer to 40% per year.Data by YChartsNow perhaps if you're willing to hold for at least the next decade, you can justify these valuations; but I'd still just call them a Hold at these levels even so, not a Buy. They'd have to grow revenues at a CAGR of 30% for the next decade for the stock to see any sort of returns. The reason valuation matters so much is because stocks like AMZN and NFLX had the advantage of high growth with people not respecting that they'd ever be profitable, so they traded at much lower multiples. They were able to experience both the fantastic revenue growth as well as multiple expansion, with both companies trading at higher multiples now than most times in their past. Here is how much their multiples have expanded in the last 10 years, with markets finally giving them their due on just how long their growth runways are.Data by YChartsThe problem with SHOP is that I can guarantee you they won't see multiple expansion from their current 64x EV/S in 10 years. Even if they still trade at 10x EV/S (more than most tech companies currently) in 10 years, they will have to keep up 30% annual revenue growth for an entire decade to even see 8% annual return on shares. 30% revenue growth is possible during the first few years of a company, but extremely tough as the revenue base gets bigger. Some companies have seen that sort of growth over a decade span, but even Amazon growing from $25B at the start of 2010 to $280B at the start of 2020, means a CAGR of ~27%.Granted Amazon was already further along a decade ago than SHOP is now, so perhaps they weren't able to grow revenues as quickly from the larger base. I personally think the best comparison to look at for SHOP is Salesforce (CRM). Unlike Amazon, Shopify won't be stealing market share from the entire American consumer market. Both CRM and SHOP help businesses move to an online format and benefit greatly as more and more do, but they won't be selling directly to the American consumer. The business models of Salesforce and Shopify seem very similar to me as they help small and large businesses alike update their ways to do business.The Salesforce comparison also works out well to see where Shopify could be in a decade, as CRM also had between $1B and $2B in revenue a decade ago (similar to SHOP's $1.58B at the end of 2019). Salesforce managed to grow their revenue from $1.3B at the start of 2010 to $17.1B at the start of 2020 for a CAGR of 29.5%.Data by YChartsNow certainly I would expect Shopify bulls to see Salesforce as an excellent company to be in when making comparisons. Salesforce has been truly groundbreaking in bringing about new ways to do business and their CEO Marc Benioff will surely go down as one of the greatest CEOs of all time, revolutionizing the sales business the way Jeff Bezos has consumerism in America. Salesforce has decimated the returns of almost all companies not in FANG over the last decade.Data by YChartsSo while it is great for Shopify to be compared to Salesforce from a probable growth perspective, they are definitely not in the same starting place from a valuation perspective. Back a decade ago, Salesforce was only trading near 10x EV/Sales, so with SHOP trading at more than 6x higher, it means 1/6th of the returns if they grow at a similar rate, but eventually come down to in-line valuations with peers. 1/6th of CRM's 720% returns comes out to 120% returns over the next decade.Data by YChartsNow it's not saying investing in SHOP at these levels is terrible. If you do think it's inevitable that SHOP grows at 30% for the next decade, then getting 120% return or a CAGR of ~8% is not terrible. And if you think they can grow at a CAGR of 40%+ for an entire decade, then they are truly a Buy. However, I think there are much better options for total returns, such as Salesforce themselves. CRM is still expected to grow revenues at 15-20% the next few years.Data by YChartsSo if both SHOP and CRM hit current estimates, and valuation metrics eventually even out for both (say in 5 years), I expect CRM to return 15% a year and SHOP to return 8% per year. I also think CRM offers less risk as they've already proven themselves over a long time period. For SHOP to hit the same sort of growth that CRM has done for the last decade is no certainty and I posit a lot would have to go right, even with their excellent business and positioning.Shown another way, even with Salesforce being a truly groundbreaking company with a revolutionary CEO for more than a decade, they still barely trade at a higher market cap today than Shopify, who is still in their early days revenue-wise.Data by YChartsData by YChartsWhile I think Shopify trades at reasonable multiples if you're willing to hold for the next decade or more, the upside is minimal at this point and plenty of things can go wrong. If you own SHOP and are looking for an alternative if you were to sell, I would recommend CRM as a fantastic stock to park your money in. Perhaps if SHOP traded at half of where they do now or about what CRM traded 2 years ago, I would consider them a Buy."
4371180,71685,2020-08-27T14:43:32-04:00,"Salesforce.com reported blow-out quarterly results, crushing analysts earnings expectations.But most of that earnings beat came from gains in its equity portfolio.Earnings would have been lower if not for the gains.","Salesforce.com (CRM) saw its shares soar to an all-time high following better than expected quarterly results. After digging through those results, we find there's more than meets the eye, and the results were not nearly as strong as they appeared. The Salesforce second quarter press release reveals that the company had operating income $178 million, vs. $58 million in the same quarter the year prior. But that's now where the big earnings beat came from. In the fourth paragraph of the same release, we see that unrealized gains in its equity holdings drove the massive earnings beat. Gains on strategic investments increased by $682 million in the quarter vs. $109 million last year. According to the report, that significant increase led to an additional $0.58 per share in non-GAAP diluted earnings. The company reported $1.44 per share in non-GAAP earnings, which beat analysts' estimates of $0.67 per share, or $0.77 per share. The majority of that $628 million came from a $623 million in gains came from the company's unrealized gains in its equity portfolio. Without the added $0.58 per share, Salesforce would have earned an adjusted $0.86 per share, a beat, but not nearly as impressive as the headline numbers would suggest. The company did raise its full-year guidance to $3.73 at the mid-point of the range, from $2.94 at the mid-point, and an increase of $0.79 per share. The increase in Salesforce's earnings guidance is a result of the earnings beat in the second quarter and not due to an improving outlook for the actual earnings. The company had been looking for earnings in the second quarter in a range of $0.66 to $0.67 per share. The company issued third quarter earnings guidance that came in a range of $0.73 to $0.74 per share, which was below analysts' estimates for $0.77 per share. What's surprising is that the weaker than earnings guidance comes on stronger than expected third quarter revenue guidance, which came in ahead of analysts' estimates. This could suggest that the company sees rising costs somewhere that analysts were not anticipating.It seems hard to imagine that a stock should run up nearly 25% on an earnings beat because a company had a strong quarter investing in the stock market. But essentially, that is what's happening here with Salesforce. Salesforce isn't the only company that has holdings and an equity portfolio. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), in the past, reported massive earnings beats and misses driven by its equity portfolio. In fact, in its second quarter results, Alphabet had a gain on its investment portfolio of about $1.5 billion, after losing $814 million in the first quarter. If you are OK with investing in a hedge fund that also happens to be a software company, then there's nothing to worry about. You better hope the equity trading desk has a good third quarter too. There's sarcasm when saying that, but that's why it's always important to dig through all the details."

But it takes a particularly strong business to deliver blowout earnings during a sharp recession and in periods of record uncertainty on a global scale. Salesforce.com (CRM) has just delivered precisely that, and this speaks volumes about the quality of the company and its management team. Furthermore, the stock is not too expensive at all at current levels, so Salesforce.com is well-positioned for sustained outperformance going forward.Revenue during the quarter reached $5.15 billion, growing by 29% year over year and exceeding Wall Street estimates by $200 million. Salesforce.com has an impeccable trajectory of outperformance, the company has delivered revenue numbers above Wall Street expectations in each of the past 16 quarters in a row.Source: Seeking AlphaIn this last quarter, the magnitude of the revenue surprise was even larger than usual, and Salesforce.com outperformed sales forecasts by a record difference in percentage terms.Source: Seeking AlphaRemaining performance obligation stands at $30.6 billion, an increase of 21% year-over-year. The current remaining performance obligation came in at $15.2 billion, an increase of 26% year-over-year and 24% in constant currency. This bodes well for the company going forward.Profit margins expanded considerably during the period, and rapid revenue growth in combination with expanding profit margins allowed Salesforce.com to deliver a massive beat in earnings per share during the period.Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.44 versus $0.77 expected on average by the analysts following the stock. Also on the bottom line, Salesforce.com outperformed expectations by a record margin.Source: Seeking AlphaSource: Seeking AlphaFrom a competitive perspective, Salesforce.com looks stronger than ever, which is particularly important. Periods of volatility and uncertainty are when market leaders can either consolidate their competitive leadership or they can start losing ground versus the competition. In this case, Salesforce.com is leveraging on its strength to become even more dominant in CRM.Source: Salesforce.comThe company had lowered its full-year guidance due to the particularly uncertain environment in the prior quarter. In a sign of confidence, management now raised revenue guidance to between $20.7 billion to $20.8 billion versus prior guidance for $20 billion. The new guidance compares favorably versus $20.08 billion estimated on average by analysts.An excellent quarter from Salesforce.com provides validation for two main drivers in the bullish thesis. To begin with, digitalization and customer relationship management are key investments for corporations all over the world, and customers are not looking to cut spending in such a critical area in times of pandemic and work from home.Just as important, management has the skills to sail through the storm and to continue delivering solid returns at the top line and the bottom line, even under particularly uncertain circumstances.The software sector has been on fire over the past several years and especially more during the pandemic. Many of the companies in the sector have delivered very resilient numbers in recent months, especially when comparing sales and earnings numbers for software companies versus most other sectors in the economy.The other side of the coin is that valuations have expanded substantially because of this outperformance, and many companies in the software sector are currently trading at record valuation levels.But that is not the case when it comes to Salesforce.com. Looking at valuation multiples based on revenues, EBITDA, and cash flow from operations, Salesforce.com stock is priced in line with average valuation levels for the company over the past five years.Data by YChartsFrom a comparative perspective, Salesforce.com looks quite reasonably priced too. The table compares some basic data for Salesforce.com versus Intuit (INTU), Adobe (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT), and Autodesk (ADSK). The comparison is not completely straightforward because these four companies operate in different segments and they have their own unique weaknesses and strengths. Nevertheless, it can be interesting to get a rough approximation of Salesforce.com's valuation in comparison to other big software companies.Looking at sales growth in the past five years and also in the trailing twelve month period, Salesforce.com has the highest growth rates in the group. Interestingly, Salesforce.com also has the lowest price to sales ratio among the 5 companies in the table.This can be justified to some degree by the fact that Salesforce.com still has relatively small profit margins in comparison to the more mature software companies. Nevertheless, margins are moving in the right direction over time, and it is not much of a stretch to say that Salesforce.com has some room for valuation expansion from a comparative perspective.Valuation ratios should always be interpreted in the context of other return drivers. A company that generates strong growth and consistently beats Wall Street expectations deserves a higher price/sales ratio than a business with below-average growth rates and often underperforming expectations.However, it can be complicated to incorporate multiple factors into the analysis and quantify them in order to see the complete picture. In that spirit, the PowerFactors system is a quantitative system that ranks companies in a particular universe according to a combination of factors: financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123The backtested performance numbers show that companies with high PowerFactors rankings tend to deliver superior returns over the long term, and the higher the ranking, the higher the expected returns.Salesforce.com has a PowerFactors ranking close to 93 as of the time of this writing. This means that the stock is in the top 7% of companies in the US stock markets based on quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength together. After the recent earnings beat, the PowerFactors ranking for Salesforce.com will probably increase even further in the days ahead.The numbers alone cannot tell you the whole story, there are some crucial fundamental factors that go beyond the plain mathematics of valuation and growth. Nevertheless, it is good to know that Salesforce.com still has room for further upside potential from current levels if management keeps executing well and the company continues crushing expectations going forward.Growth tends to naturally slow down over time, especially as a company gains size. It is obviously much easier to generate high growth rates from a small revenue base, and Salesforce.com is well on track to exceed $20 billion in annual revenue this year. One of the main risks for investors in Salesforce.com is that revenue growth could decelerate more abruptly than expected, which could have a negative impact on the stock price.There is no sign of that in the most recent earnings release. On the contrary, the company is firing on all cylinders in a challenging environment. But that is precisely the point, a high bar is difficult to beat, and expectations for Salesforce.com will be quite elevated over the middle term now that the company has crushed expectations once again.Speaking of which, acquisitions have been a major growth engine for Salesforce.com in recent years, and this can be a very smart strategy when done right. If you have the resources, scale, and customer reach, growth via acquisitions can be remarkably effective both from a financial and strategic perspective. The company's track record in this area is outstanding, but integration risk is always an important consideration when assessing a position in Salesforce.com going forward.Those risk factors being acknowledged, the bullish thesis for Salesforce.com is actually quite simple and straightforward. The company is producing outstanding financial performance with vigorous revenue growth and expanding profit margins during a daunting recession. This shows that Salesforce.com is a mission-critical solution to its customers and that management knows how to deliver in good and bad times.At these prices, the stock is also fairly reasonably valued when considering the quality of the business, so chances are that Salesforce.com stock will deliver solid returns for investors in the years ahead."
4370620,92586,2020-08-25T10:58:02-04:00,"When salesforce.com reports fiscal 2Q results, investors will probably be looking for signs that the business has returned to some sort of normal.I will keep an eye on margin trends, the revenue pipeline and a possible improvement in cash flow metrics.Considering a pricey stock market in general and software sector specifically, I find CRM an affordable growth play.","Following a very atypical fiscal first quarter of 2021, salesforce.com (CRM) is gearing up to report results of its second period. Revenue growth has been guided at 22.5% at the midpoint of the range, and analysts' consensus expectations have not deviated much from the outlook. Estimated non-GAAP EPS of $0.67, if achieved, would land just about flat YoY.Beneath the headline numbers, investors will probably be looking for signs that the business has returned to some sort of normal in fiscal 2Q. Last time, salesforce.com's financial performance, which tends to be rather stable and predictable, got shaken by the COVID-19 challenges faced by the San Francisco-based software company.Credit: Perforce SoftwareIn fiscal 1Q, revenue growth of over 30% looked healthy, beating expectations. All cloud segments saw revenues increase robustly, although in great part due to M&A. However, guidance for the following period suggested that the top line would suffer in the short term from more conservative client IT budgets. The good news is that, during last quarter's earnings call, the management team reported ""improving trends within the pipeline and closed rates between March through [late May].""I expect to see some normalization of margins this time (see recent trend below). In fiscal 1Q, profitability was trimmed by what I expect to be primarily one-time or short-term costs (e.g. guaranteed sales commissions and pandemic-related initiatives), some of which should be largely confined to the first three-month period of the fiscal year. Should this be true, current EPS consensus may prove to be a bit too conservative.Source: Company's earnings slidesOtherwise, I will be looking at another couple of metrics that may speak to the health of the underlying business. These would encompass the revenue pipeline, including trends in future performance obligation. Last quarter, cash flow also looked weak, due in part to the company's willingness to extend payment terms to clients in the face of the COVID-19 crisis. It will be good to see at least some improvement on this front.While short-term headwinds could very well persist over the next quarter or two, whether in the form of slightly lower revenues, pressured margins or cash flow gap, I remain a CRM bull. My optimism is better justified by the long term prospects of the secular cloud transition and salesforce.com's growth opportunities in the many enterprise software sub-segments in which the company is a major player: from flagship CRM to e-commerce and cloud platform.Data by YChartsThe stock will probably never be cheap, absent during March-like corrections that happen infrequently and do not last more than a few weeks. Still, considering a pricey stock market in general and software sector specifically, I find CRM an affordable growth play. As the chart above suggests, next-year P/E of less than 60x and long-term PEG of less than 3.0x is about as attractive an entry valuation as an investor will get into a high-quality company in this sector, in my view.For this reason, and because CRM ticks many of the boxes in my All-Equities SRG criteria list, I stay positive ahead of (and likely after) earnings day."
4351674,104941,2020-06-03T05:59:04-04:00,"I released a bullish note on Salesforce earlier this week, and I am following up with an analysis of the company's recent less than desirable earnings report.While the company's reduced guidance isn't ideal, it serves to highlight why I always implement a margin of safety in any valuation I perform. ""I saw it coming.""Now for the good stuff: Salesforce remains the #1 CRM service for the 7th year in a row.Salesforce had $4.87 billion in revenue, a 30% increase year-over-year for Q1’20. The company inked a series of blockbuster deals, which I highlight in the article.I reiterate my buy recommendation on Salesforce.","Source: www.technologyadvice.comIn my recent Salesforce article, I discussed Salesforce's (CRM) acquisitive streak and its CEO Mark Benioff’s vision to make the company's comprehensive client relationship management software an essential part of large enterprises around the globe. As we are all aware, the virus has negatively impacted most businesses from a financial perspective, including Salesforce. Notwithstanding, during this time, Salesforce has invested in its customers and by extension its own business by aiding the transition of businesses even further into the cloud.That is, Salesforce, as it has always done, has gone on the offensive while others stand flatfooted. But as they say, it takes money to make money, and there have been and will be financial repercussions due to the virus.I attended Salesforce's recent earnings report, and today, I am going to share the information that I gathered. Interestingly, the company reduced guidance, but, as you can see in our recent Salesforce article, we had already accounted for this through very conservative assumptions about growth. It's our margin of safety at work! A truly beautiful sight to see.During a volatile quarter (Q1 2020), Salesforce provided decent results and revealed an interesting new project, i.e., work.com, which is going to be vital for governments and businesses' reopenings (just another example of Salesforce going on the offensive). While the world roils in a time of uncertainty regarding the economy and the virus, something certain is that the transition to digital will remain a central component of all businesses' plans moving forward, and Salesforce will reap the rewards of this accelerated digital transformation.Today, I am going to highlight:Work.com Overview Demo Video | SalesforceThe above video explains what work.com is and how it helps businesses get back to work. The goal of the website/application is to allow businesses to reopen as quickly as possible while keeping employees and communities safe and up-to-date.In my recent Salesforce article (linked above), I discussed how Salesforce has always looked to serve its customers by acquiring new services/applications to offer or by developing these services/applications themselves. Work.com is another example of Salesforce’s goal to continually evolve and serve its clients.In the company's recent earnings call, Benioff said that Salesforce started developing work.com early on in the pandemic because the governor of Rhode Island highlighted that governments, universities, and businesses would need a device to understand what’s happening around them and help businesses become operational again in a ""new normal."" Since the service launched, it’s now used by governments (30 states) and businesses such as PWC, Deloitte, and IBM (IBM).Workday (WDAY) also partnered with Salesforce to integrate its employee data directly into work.com. Work.com has seamlessly integrated into Salesforce's flagship offering, Customer 360. This further highlights the massive strength of Salesforce's offering. That is, its offering is highly adaptable and can serve numerous functions for innumerable businesses.Additionally, Salesforce started a Salesforce Care line (has three versions), which is designed to help businesses work, sell, service, and market from home, and the service already has 38,000 sign-ups. Salesforce expects its investments in the last three months in work.com and Customer 360 to contribute to a strong pipeline of customers.All of this contributed to the much lamented and lambasted elevated expenses. But the reality is that these should be seen as investments for the future. As I mentioned above, Salesforce has proven and continues to prove that it can rapidly evolve, adapt, and serve as a force for good, and most importantly, value creation.In Q1, Salesforce signed AT&T to a long-term deal, as the company moves toward a digitally-powered system that’s going to be powered by Salesforce. AT&T was planning to slowly transition to being fully digital, but due to the virus, it is accelerating the transition and will utilize Customer 360 to bring 5G to the world.In an interview following the earnings report, Benioff said regarding AT&T,Companies and organizations are accelerating their plans to transition to digital, and as the #1 CRM service, Salesforce is in a strong position to capture this trend. In fact, Salesforce increased its market share this year, as can be seen below.Source: Salesforce Q1 FY21 SlideshowSalesforce also expanded its relationship with the Standard Bank Group, the largest bank in Africa which operates in 20 markets. Additionally, Salesforce’s partner, nCino, built a system for end-to-end solutions for the Federal SBA Cares Act loans and processed more than $35 billion in loans for its banking customers utilizing Customer 360.Salesforce expected to generate $21 billion in FY21 before the virus but lowered expectations to $20 billion (my original analysis, linked in the first paragraph, implemented a margin of safety, so, in short, I saw this coming... and the stock still offers compelling value). Benioff said that this is partially due to the average of contracts being shorter and the economic uncertainty for its customers. Now, obviously we don’t want to see revenue projections go down, but a mere 5% decrease in revenue for FY21 leaves me feeling confident in Salesforce’s ability to recover.Here is what CFO, Mark Hawkins said in the earnings call regarding anticipated revenues,The new expectations are within the company’s reach because Salesforce has now projected conservative growth to account for the economic uncertainty. Now Salesforce expects 17% year-over-year growth for 2021, compared to the 23% which it anticipated going into the year. It is important to note that the company said it would release a new target revenue (likely lower than the $35B it recently projected) for 2024, which will be announced at 2020’s Dreamforce day in November.Salesforce provided financial flexibility to companies that were severely impacted by the virus, although it does expect to receive the payments later down the road. This contributed to higher costs as well as additional spending on IT services to adapt products for the crisis. The company also expects to incur a cost of $65 million from cancellation fees with clients and making its 2020 Dreamforce day virtual.The company also issued a one-time $140M commission guarantee to pay its sales team since they couldn't work in the field. This allowed Salesforce to retain its sales team and to have them transition to communicating with potential customers virtually. These expenses will reside in Q1 for 2020 and explain why operating margins declined, which can be seen below.Source: YChartsThe additional spending from the quarter resulted in only $1.54 billion in free cash flow, which is 15% lower than the previous year. The company does not anticipate the above conditions to apply to future quarters and expects IT expenses will decrease in 2021. Salesforce believes that its efforts during this quarter are going to allow its customers to resume business activities and will prove to be pivotal for its pipeline.Source: Created By AuthorSource: Salesforce Q1FY21 Earnings Press ReleaseNow, the above data are important because I employ them to create the following sum of parts valuation.So as to illuminate the math behind this valuation, here are some notable assumptions I used to create this valuation.Last note, if any of this was unclear to you, please feel free to ask your questions regarding the valuation in the comments section below. It would be two articles alone to write out every bit of math employed in this valuation. The present revenues for each segment can be found in the company's 10-Q multiplied by 4. You can then take those revenues and apply a conservative FCF to equity margin that you can then divide by the total shares outstanding.This is everything you need to create a very conservative projection of intrinsic value for each component of the company's business.Now, let's check out the results.Source: Author's Own Calculations And The LASV ModelBased on each segment’s future projected value, Salesforce will have a market cap of ~$696.36 billion in 10 years. Using the current value of each segment divided by shares outstanding, Salesforce is worth $243 today, which means it is undervalued while trading at $175.Salesforce’s current market cap is $158.34 billion, so we can expect an ~16% return on investment based on each segment.These returns were based on very conservative estimates, which gives Salesforce the room to underperform the stronger growth that we actually anticipate will materialize throughout the 2020s. However, we never invest based on our optimistic assumptions. Rather, we choose to invest based on our most pessimistic assumptions, thereby ensuring we can be very wrong and still be right.Therefore, with an expected return on investment between 15-16%, Salesforce is a strong buy as it beats our 9.8% hurdle rate.For estimating the value of each segment, I use a safe anticipated growth based on the previous three years of revenue, which is best highlighted in the revenue graph above the chart. As can be seen in my revenue growth graph, each segment is strongly contributing to Salesforce’s growing revenue, but the estimates we used were much smaller than the previous three years, giving us a strong margin of safety.In my previous article, I used a 17.5% growth rate over a 10-year span to be conservative and account for market-altering scenarios (i.e. the virus). While Salesforce’s growth is going to be affected by the virus, I am confident that it will continue to grow at a strong rate because of its market-leading core businesses and the growth in the digital CRM market. This is reflected in Salesforce’s 17% growth for FY2021 (during the worst of times), so we can expect the company to actually achieve growth north of 17% over the next five years (assuming no further implications from the virus).Salesforce had a strong quarter in terms of strengthening relationships with its customers to help them through this difficult time. Further, while its revenues won't grow as fast as anticipated by the company, they will grow just fast enough for me and my conservative valuation approach.When the going got tough, businesses turned to Salesforce for help, and the company has proven itself to be an incredibly valuable asset for businesses (as evidenced by AT&T's acceleration of its deal with Salesforce). The ""digitization of reality"" continues to consume the world as we know it, and Salesforce will continue to reap the rewards of this revolution. I expect that the company will continue to grow and improve margins after the economic turmoil begotten by the virus dissipates.As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow for more, and happy investing!"
4351327,103480,2020-06-01T13:25:37-04:00,"Shares of Salesforce dipped after the company released Q1 results and issued dour guidance for the remainder of the year.
        Salesforce expects revenue growth to decelerate to ~22% y/y (from 30% y/y) in Q2; things will optically get much worse in Q3 when the prior-year comps begin to include Tableau.
        The slimming-down of sales and marketing headcounts across major companies in an attempt to save costs are directly hurting Salesforce's products.
        For a company with true organic growth expected in the low/mid-teens, Salesforce's valuation at ~7.4x forward revenues is overblown.","Salesforce.com's (CRM) best days, in my view, are behind it. After an impressive market-beating performance so far in the year to date, up ~5% while the rest of the market is down about 7%, Salesforce looks to be on a path to correcting downward. Most investors have treated the technology industry - and the software sector specifically - as safe havens during the coronavirus pandemic. But obviously, there are a lot of nuances within software that make some companies more affected than others, and Salesforce unfortunately falls into that category.After releasing disappointing first-quarter results and offering only a dim outlook for the rest of the year, shares skidded - and I think the correction has much further to go.Steer clear of Salesforce here. In the software space, it's best to invest in pandemic-proof names that benefit from the shift to remote work.I'll give Salesforce one positive note: over the past several years, the company has done an admirable job of expanding its product portfolio beyond its core Sales Cloud, the largest and most dominant cloud CRM (customer relationship management software). I don't necessarily agree with Salesforce's ""buy rather than build"" approach to growth and its aggressive M&A tactics, but Salesforce has proven its ability to join the ranks of mega-cap software companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) by offering a broad portfolio of technologies.With that being said, we have to acknowledge that Salesforce's largest money-maker is still the Sales Cloud, contributing 29% to Salesforce's FY20 revenues. Salesforce's Marketing Cloud, meanwhile, contributed another 16% of revenues - so about half of Salesforce's revenue is exposed to users involved with sales and marketing.CRM is such an attractive space because virtually every company has a sales department. And sales departments, particularly at B2B software companies, tend to comprise the single largest headcount out of any other department in the company. This makes Sales Cloud, which typically prices its services per user, per month (the ""most popular"" plan listed on Salesforce's website is the Enterprise plan costing $150/user/month), as shown below:Figure 1. Sales Cloud pricing tiersSource: Salesforce.comUnfortunately, sales departments have also been among the most vulnerable in the pandemic. Outside salespeople (that is, the kind of people who proactively make ""outside"" calls to prospects and log their activities on a CRM) aren't able to be as productive given the recent travel bans, and overall business is down anyway - so when many businesses decided to slim down their workforces, sales departments often felt the biggest hit. Each layoff of a sales professional is a direct hit to Salesforce's subscription revenues. The effect is less pronounced, but still applicable to marketing departments. As companies have cut marketing and advertising budgets, headcount in these departments have also moderated, leading to less users needing to use Marketing Cloud.So far through Q1, Salesforce has maintained fairly strong growth of 30% y/y, but that's helped by the company's acquisition of Tableau which started contributing to FY20 results in the third quarter. Its forecast for Q2, however - which still includes a no-Tableau 2Q20 comp - calls for things to get much worse. Figure 2. Salesforce guidance updateSource: Salesforce.com 1Q20 earnings releaseQ2 revenue is expected to decelerate about eight points to 22-23% y/y - suggesting that for Salesforce, the majority fo the coronavirus impact stemming from Sales Cloud and potentially other difficulties will be felt much harder in Q2 than in Q1. Then for the full year, Salesforce is dropping its outlook to ~$20.0 billion, or just 17% y/y growth - a sharp pullback from an original guidance view of $21.0-$21.1 billion, or ~23% y/y growth, issued in the fourth quarter of 2020. Wall Street consensus, meanwhile, had hoped that Salesforce would only cut its guidance to $20.75 billion, or ~20% y/y growth. Considering both the gap to consensus estimates and Salesforce's prior guidance, it's surprising that Salesforce shares only fell by ~4% post-earnings. Salesforce's guidance also implies that, once Tableau starts getting worked into the prior-year comps in Q3 and Q4, revenue growth in those quarters will only be in the low teens to hit a full-year mark of 17% y/y, given the higher growth rates in Q1 and Q2. Salesforce's guidance pulldown is also a reflection of the fact that the company has had to cancel a lot of customer conferences - including its famous Dreamforce event which last year drew 171,000 participants - from where it sources a lot of new prospects and upsells a lot of existing customers. Mark Hawkins, Salesforce's longtime CFO, noted that the company's guidance forecast contemplated a slight rise in churn to account for the difficult macro conditions. Per his prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call:Assuming only a one percent increase in attrition, however, might be too optimistic. On the bright side, Hawkins did note that Salesforce saw some positive trends towards the back half of April and early May that may help to alleviate some of thee concerns.One other brief point we have to make: investors have long clamored for Salesforce to deliver profit growth, given its massive scale. But Salesforce continues to fail to deliver on this front.The most recent Q1 probably had it the worst. Salesforce's pro forma operating margins foo to 13.1%, 520bps worse than 18.2% in the year-ago quarter, while GAAP operating margins slipped to negative. Figure 2. Salesforce margin trendsSource: Salesforce 1Q21 earnings deck The bright side is that some of the margin headwinds that Salesforce faced in Q1 won't recur - the company paid a lot in cancellation fees for its sales events. Per Hawkins' remarks:This $65 million in cancellation fees works out to 130bps of margin impact; another ~$20 million (40bps) of impact came from mask donations to help the coronavirus aid efforts. The remaining ~350bps of margin loss, however, may be sustained weakness.With all these flaws, it's surprising that Salesforce has managed to maintain an optimistic valuation. At current share prices near $175, Salesforce's market cap is $157.21 billion. After netting off the $11.70 billion of cash and investments and $2.67 billion of debt on its balance sheet, its enterprise value is $148.18 billion. That represents a 7.4x EV/FY21 revenue multiple - which, for a company whose organic growth is expected to fall into the mid-low teens this year, seems quite rich. Steer clear here and invest elsewhere."
4357117,103373,2020-07-06T11:40:24-04:00,"Salesforce.com has a significant presence in the healthcare segment and there are indications of continued strong momentum.The valuation is high but reasonable, as this thesis will hopefully show.This author is definitely bullish on Salesforce.com.","There's no doubt that Salesforce.com (CRM) has almost perfected the art of growth. If the past two decades are anything to go by, it's clear that growth is not going to be an issue with this company. Valuations, on the other hand, are a different kettle of fish. We'll touch on that as well but, today, I'd like to focus on one of its units - Salesforce Healthcare and Life Sciences. My purpose is to showcase how CRM's launch of Health Cloud in 2015 has allowed it to tap into the global digital healthcare market, which is expected to grow strongly and steadily over the next half a decade or more.CRM's Health Cloud was first announced in September 2015. According to the press release:In essence, it was a way for healthcare providers as well as payers to have a greater degree of visibility and engagement in terms of patient care and the processes involved therein. It allowed both parties to see a timeline of a patient's health journey by compiling a profile using multiple sources such as electronic records, medical device usage, smartwatches, and so on.Although it wasn't an industry first, it did roll out on a large scale because of the partnerships that Salesforce.com had built, not only with healthcare providers, payers and other entities dealing in digital healthcare management but also companies like PwC and Accenture (ACN) for EMR (electronic medical records) integration, content, and other needs.The other branch of Salesforce Health Cloud was its Life Sciences services, which offered targeted solutions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The solutions were aimed at helping these entities be more agile at everything from research and development to pricing workflows to sales resources management.Over the past five years, Salesforce.com has acquired an impressive list of clientele for its healthcare and life sciences solutions, including companies like Amgen (AMGN), Novant Health, etc. While the company doesn't break out its revenues by specific reportable segments (""The Company operates as one operating segment""), there are clear indications that Health Cloud is one of the growth engines for the company. According to Keith Block, Co CEO, on the Q4-20 earnings call:Relatively recent acquisitions like Tableau have spurred further growth for Salesforce.com in the healthcare segment, and the widespread use of free Tableau COVID-19 Data Hub for live tracking, as well as the paid Work.com platform for contact tracing and related services, will not only serve to boost the top line but also act as marketing ambassadors for the company's cloud-based products. As of June 25, 2020, 35 states in the U.S. are using the Work.com platform's contact tracing capabilities, which will help CRM forge stronger relationships across a broad industry base.All of this has been setting the pace for strong future growth in this segment. The current rate of digitization of the global healthcare market can translate to significant growth for companies like Salesforce.com, which are well-positioned to address the rapid cloud deployment requirements of the new normal.If we were to quantify the opportunity, we're looking at CRM having a significant presence in a $385.8 billion market by 2025 (with a CAGR of 24.6% between 2019 and 2025) through its partnerships with companies like Cerner Corp. (CERN) and Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG), among others.That's a question the majority of potential investors in CRM keep asking, but the answers are so varied that it's hard to make a decision either way. Since April 2020, SA authors have argued for every rating from Very Bearish to Very Bullish.Source: Seeking AlphaOn the one hand, there's been tremendous growth so far: 34% constant currency revenue growth in Q4-20 and 30% in Q1-21, not to mention a long history of strong double-digit revenue growth; on the other hand, FY-21 updated revenue guidance is 17%, revised down from the earlier guidance figure of 23% mentioned on the FY-20 earnings call and 50% down from the FY-20 growth figure.Source: Seeking AlphaThe price 'over-correction' that began at the end of February this year and sent the stock plummeting nearly 30% in less than a month clearly shows that the market is fidgety with respect to Salesforce.com and that price action is heavily dependent on reported and projected growth figures. The fact that it took a further three months to get back up near $200 validated the assumption that there was, indeed, an over-correction, but that the market was not quick to bring the stock back to such high levels.This is where my thesis takes a twist. You may have missed getting in at under $140, but even as the stock surges toward the $200 mark that it was headed for prior to the Q4-20 earnings announcement, CRM is trading at a 'reasonable' level. I had better qualify that lest it draw negative commentary from the shorts.If you look at companies with cloud services as a major - or, at least, significant - component of their portfolio, you'll notice that CRM is up there with growth rates as impressive as Amazon (AMZN) and far ahead of movers like Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Data by YChartsBarring Amazon, you can see that CRM is also trading at proportionately higher valuations. And let's not forget the fact that COVID-19 is rapidly forcing fence-sitters to move to the cloud as a matter of urgency; of survival, even. Salesforce.com's portfolio of products is completely on the cloud and has been from the very beginning, which gives it a significant advantage over other cloud service providers. Couple that with the strong partnerships it has forged within the healthcare industry and it's not hard to see that the valuation is reasonable, albeit high.Data by YChartsTo offer additional perspective on why valuation is so high, a lot of the margin contraction seen in Q1-21 was from one-time expenses. Per Marc Benioff:Source: Q1-2021 Earnings ReportThese expenses, as expressed by Mr. Benioff at the Q1-21 call, will fuel future growth beyond FY2021 and are the primary reasons why the stock is trading at such a high forward earnings multiple. Not only will they translate into future revenues, but also bolster the company's positive image among its employees, partners, and other key stakeholders. Simply put, the earnings part of the price to equity ratio will return to former levels once these revenue realizations come into play.When seen in that context, the valuation doesn't seem that high; hence, my use of the word 'reasonable.' But that also comes with a caveat, and that is the fact that investors should not expect short-term gains from companies like Salesforce.com. There's little room for error at the current levels, so it would be more prudent to treat this as a long-term holding that will grow in value over an extended time period. Think in half-decades rather than two-year periods. As an added safety measure, I would recommend a dollar-cost averaging approach in order to keep your cost basis as low as possible."

In fact, the company has been consistently increasing its market share, and we expect this trend to further extrapolate in the future as the company continues with its strategic acquisitions.Source: Company Quarterly ReportSaaS business models have a high switching cost, which means that customers are unlikely to switch from one provider to another unless they have no choice (through acquisitions) or if the benefits simply outweigh the costs. The high switching cost is because of the predetermined contracts that clients sign, paying an x amount every month for a fixed duration.At first glance, seeing that firm's Cash Conversion Cycle hovers around 50-60 days, the company may not seem to have a strong cash flow generating ability.

Coupled with financing abilities, the company has grown its cash positions at a similar rate too.Data: Company Annual ReportsWe looked at the company's debt to analyze credit risk. The D/E ratio came down from ~40% in FY16 to a stable 16-20% from FY18 to FY20. Moving forward, we do not expect the capital structure to change drastically. The Debt/EBITDA multiple also depicts a relatively safe situation with a multiple of 2.0x in FY20. The firm has an A issuer credit rating from S&P global ratings and an A- issuer credit rating from Moody's. We believe Salesforce has an extremely low chance of default and would not expect credit to be an issue for the firm.Data: Company Annual Reports, Author's AnalysisSalesforce has a two-pronged approach to continue innovation and mitigate disruption risks. Over the last few years, Salesforce has made several acquisitions that complement its products and technologies. The company acquired Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA) for a consideration of $14.8bn in August 2019 and ClickSoftware Technologies for a consideration of $1.4bn in October 2019. Tableau, a data analytics company, generated $1.2bn in revenue in 2018 and Salesforce has integrated only slightly over half of that for their FY20 numbers. Salesforce also acquired MuleSoft, an integration platform company, in May 2018 for a consideration of $6.4bn.Past Acquisitions; Source: Dreamforce 2019 PresentationSuccess of Acquisitions; Source: Dreamforce 2019 PresentationThe acquisition strategy works well, especially as the SaaS industry heads towards maturity. As mentioned previously, SaaS user bases are sticky and this strategy resolves that problem by outrightly acquiring other solution providers which boosts Salesforce's product offerings and clientele. This would lead to a consolidation within the market which is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 15.6%.Data: StatistaThe other approach was to invest in startups through its corporate venturing arm, Salesforce Ventures. Since 2009, the venture has partnered with over 375 companies, helping them accelerate growth, resulting in 19 IPOs. Case in point, Snowflake, a cloud data platform valued at $12.4bn, has recently filed for an IPO which might occur within the next few months. The great thing about their fund is that they invest in companies that provide unique solutions within the technology space, which provides opportunities to expand within and outside of Salesforce's expertise. Having dipped their toes in up-and-coming startups, it sets Salesforce up to acquire these companies and technologies in the future. Thus, the firm can pivot and react towards shifts in technology and consumer trends - a key advantage that helps market leaders stay relevant in this volatile, uncertain, and complex world.We project revenues to take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak due to businesses being shut down and increased probability of defaults. We expect to see a decline in new clients onboarding and a higher attrition rate for Salesforce's products in the months to come. The company mentioned that they provided temporary financial flexibility to their customers who were most affected by the pandemic. Our view is that the financial impacts may not be obvious until the later quarters of the fiscal year. We are following management's guidance of a 17% revenue growth for FY21 (vs. 28.7% in FY20).Keeping in mind that major acquisitions were carried out in 2018 and 2019, a decrease from 26.0% and 28.7% (respectively) to 17% is not as bad as one would have thought. We will further explore the impact on the company's financials and valuation in subsequent sections.In response to the outbreak and lockdowns, the company created a free rapid response product, Salesforce Care, which is equipped with various tools to help businesses get through the pandemic. The product provides employee & customer support and other business tools. The firm also created Tableau Data Hub, a free resource for companies and governments around the world to visualize and understand data about the pandemic. These moves might attract new clients post-COVID-19, offsetting the increased attrition rate.Source: Bangkok PostLooking at the company's financials, revenue has been growing at a strong CAGR of 26.5%, driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. Looking at margins, we can see that the net income margin fluctuates while the EBIT margin appears to be stable between 2% and 4%. This is expected as net income included many one-time expenses related to acquisitions that the company has made over the years. We will use EBITDA numbers for our valuation as the company has substantial D&A expenses.Data: Company Annual ReportsOur model begins by building the firm's revenue and projecting the two business segments (Subscription and Support& Professional Services and Other) separately. We incorporated a scenario analysis in our subscription revenue build to determine the financial impact on the company depending on which scenario plays out. The first scenario is a bull case where we project a less material impact on revenue in FY21 (21.3% growth vs. 17%) and a slightly higher growth rate (compared to the other two cases) in the next 4 years. Our second scenario is our base case where we followed management guidance for FY21 with a 17% growth in revenue and expect full recovery (in terms of growth rates) by FY22. Our last scenario, a bear case, projects FY21 to have only 16% growth (vs. 17%) and lower growths in a prolonged economic decline.Data: Company Annual Reports, Author's AnalysisData: Company Annual Reports, Author's AnalysisFor Professional Services and Other revenue, which makes up ~6% of total revenue, we assumed a stabilizing growth rate of 23.3%, 20%, 20%, 18%, and 18% for the next 5 years. By extrapolating the company's expenses and margins, we projected the firm's EBIT and Net Income.Data: Company Annual Reports, Author's AnalysisTo value the company, we first looked at public comps. Our set of comps includes the likes of Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and SAP (NYSE:SAP). Our comps multiples paint a very conflicting picture when we looked at median EV/EBITDA and EV/Revenue multiples. The figures suggest a huge price range of $60.17 to $252.20 for our base case ($61.71 to $261.00 for our Bull case and $59.85 to $250.36 for our bear case).Data: Company Annual Reports, Author's AnalysisWe turned our focus to Salesforce's historical trading multiples. We found that the EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA has one of the lowest coefficients of variation. Thus, using these multiples for our valuation should provide the highest probability of achieving our target prices.Data: Company Annual Reports, Author's AnalysisNow, using the median of our historical multiples, it paints a much more consistent picture. As you can see, the EV/EBITDA multiple is extraordinarily high for Salesforce, but it appears to be stable for the past few years. Our base case shows an implied target price of $180.31 to $184.52 and our other two cases are also well within the $180 to $190 range.Data: Company Annual Reports, Author's AnalysisWe understood the risks of using historical multiples as the past does not always equate to the future. We performed a sensitivity analysis for our base case to understand the impact on valuation if our multiples were to vary by ~6% to 13%. We found that 76% of the time, our valuations provide an upside to the current share price of $172.05.Data: Author's AnalysisWe understand that valuing a tech company with a DCF model may not be the most suitable methodology, but we wanted to take a peek at what the firm's valuation might look like if it becomes a company with stable cash flows. We started by building our assumptions for WACC, using the firm's cost of debt and cost of equity. We faced some issues while calculating the beta for the company. Our data showed a low beta of less than 1.0 and online sources giving a range of 1.02 to 1.2. We found that the above range did not have a material impact on the final numbers. Effective tax rates were based on historical rates and terminal growth rate was assumed to follow the US GDP growth rate.Data: Company Annual Reports, Author's AnalysisWe then projected the cash expenditures that weren't in the income statement. Our assumptions and projections for the base case gave us an implied share price of $151.52, representing an 11.9% downside to the current share price. Our bull case presented an implied share price of $180.71 and our bear case had a low of $127.85. As you can see, the issue with a DCF valuation becomes apparent for a growth stock with ""unstable"" revenues. As such, we will not be using DCF for our choice of valuation, but merely as a gauge of the firm's cash flow and financial standing.Data: Company Annual Reports, Author's AnalysisSimilarly, we did a sensitivity analysis for our DCF model by varying our WACC and terminal growth rate. As expected, most scenarios point to a downside to the current price. However, the silver lining is that if terminal growth rates were slightly higher (which might be a possibility for Salesforce), there are gains to be found. While we believe that cash flow valuation may not be the optimal valuation choice, investors who are looking to hold the stock over a long-term horizon (>5 years) could consider adding Salesforce to their portfolio if prices were to dip below $151.52.Data: Company Annual Reports, Author's AnalysisThe key investor takeaway is that we have a strong tech stock that doesn't seem to be stopping its growth any time soon. Industry tailwinds and superior products would drive Salesforce further as a market leader within the ever-growing CRM market. Prices below $150 would be a great entry point with a long-term target price of $181.24."
4352473,104952,2020-06-08T06:03:04-04:00,"Despite having achieved a 30% revenue growth in Q1, Salesforce will guide a lower 17% growth for the full year. However, we expect growth reacceleration beyond 2020.The pandemic allowed the company to enhance its community and culture-building efforts, which also signal its resilience and focus on culture-driven future growth.The 360 platform grew by 62% to drive almost a third of the business in Q1, while enabling Salesforce to land AT&T as a customer, its largest deal to-date.","Salesforce (CRM)’s recent ~10% pullback from its YTD high in light of the softer full-year outlook provides an attractive entry point opportunity. We believe it still has one of the most interesting growth stories in the cloud software market, and we continue to recommend its fair risk/reward profile. The company will continue to benefit from its strong culture, resilient business, comprehensive platform offering, and the increasing penetration of enterprise BI and AI markets.Salesforce's strong culture and resilience provide itself a strong position to consistently win in the market for the long term. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Salesforce has spent over $160 million in community building and culture strengthening programs in Q1, such as a one-time partial commission guarantee for its sales teams and also healthcare-related donations. While these programs have put pressure on the company’s core activities and cash flow profitability for the quarter, they have demonstrated its strong culture and resilience, which will drive long-term growth post pandemic. Despite these one-time activities, Salesforce still delivered a 30% revenue growth with a ~$9.8 billion of liquidity, though OCF (Operating Cash Flow) was down by 5% to $1.86 billion.Accelerating growth in the BI and AI market should continue contributing to the adoption of the 360 platform by high-valued enterprise clients, effectively accelerating growth beyond FY 2021. Salesforce has strong offerings across those markets, such as Einstein and Tableau. Its MuleSoft offering should provide another important piece of the puzzle that glues all of these offerings together. While Tableau is a proven market leader in BI and was a ~$689 million-a-year business at the time of the takeover, MuleSoft’s core competence in the enterprise cloud-legacy integration will play a key role in accelerating Salesforce’s sales cycle in the context of digital transformation.(Source: Company’s 10-K)As of Q1, Salesforce 360 continued to gain meaningful traction as the company landed important government customers such as Navy Federal Credit Union and Commonwealth of Australia. The highlight for the quarter, however, is the AT&T (T) deal, which the CEO Benioff described as the company’s largest deal to-date. In our view, the AT&T deal brings both financial and strategic values for Salesforce. First, despite the deal not baked into the FY 2021 current RPO just yet, it already drove the overall RPO to almost match last year’s performance in Q4, which is traditionally Salesforce’s strongest quarter. With that in mind, it has massively contributed to the steady RPO performance despite the COVID-19 situation. Second, the deal will also strengthen Salesforce’s positioning in the domestic telecommunication industry, in which the company has a relatively weaker presence than in the international markets, where it already landed large enterprise players like Vodafone (VOD), StarHub (SRHBF), and Telstra (TLSYY) in Europe and APAC. Consequently, while Salesforce will expect a 17% YoY growth to ~$20 billion for FY 2021, we are optimistic that growth can reaccelerate by 200 to 400 bps in 2022, based on our observation on the company’s annual growth patterns.This year will be the first year in which Salesforce cancels Dreamforce, which is probably not only the company’s largest but also the cloud industry’s largest annual event.(Source: Company website)As a result, Dreamforce has been a critical part of the company’s go-to-market strategy. In addition to missing out on these opportunities, Salesforce has also incurred $65 million one-time event cancellation fees. Despite the optimism on the shift to digital virtual experiences, the effectiveness of the overall sales execution will also remain uncertain.Overall, we do not see any concern about Salesforce’s long-term growth prospects. While Sales Cloud has been the flagship product of the company for some time, Salesforce 360 increasingly looks more like the future of the business. In Q1 2021, Salesforce 360 drove the overall revenue growth, as it grew over 60% YoY, while already making up over 30% of the business. Furthermore, all of the business segments, including Sales Cloud, still grow at healthy double-digit rates.(Source: Stockrow)On the other hand, the company's FCF (Free Cash Flow) margin has always been steady between 18% and 23% over the last five years. Given the catalysts, we expect a strong reacceleration beyond 2021, which will potentially drive the stock to trade back at the historical +9x P/S. At ~8x P/S today, Salesforce’s price is attractive and also a good entry point. We will maintain our Overweight rating on the stock."
4357014,105308,2020-07-05T23:18:15-04:00,Salesforce shares have surged to new all-time highs.Reasonable EPS estimates point towards 11.5% CAGR returns.Prudent cash flows suggest that shares are reasonably priced.The stock remains a buy to hold in the long run.,"Salesforce (CRM) has been a favorite stock of mine for a long time now. The company has not seen the same love from all investors, as it has continuously been criticized for being overvalued, showing no intentions of reporting profits, and that its growth is reliant on future acquisitions. A little more than a month ago, the company lowered its guidance, which caused shares to decline, amid shareholder disappointment. While nothing tangible has changed since, shares have been hitting all-time highs, currently trading at around $193 apiece. As concerns towards shares being overvalued reemerge, let's examine whether Salesforce's current rally is justified and if shares have further fuel going forward.Salesforce has been growing its revenues consistently. The company projects full-year sales of $20 billion. While sales growth is soothing to all investors' ears, concerns over lack of profits have been growing. Many articles here on Seeking Alpha have expressed that the company has its priorities wrong, since the bottom line has been lagging forever.Indeed, the company has never reported constant profitability. However, as the market realizes by propelling shares higher, it's the future potential earnings that matter. In that regard, Salesforce has been more than promising. Gross profits have been growing in line with sales, which increase the company's total potential for future profits.I have heard many times the argument that the growth in Salesforce's sales has only been possible due to the company's nonstop acquisitions. While this is partially correct, as the company has acquired more than 60 firms over the past few years, I see no problem with this strategy. It simply works. Salesforce can build synergies within its family of products that allow for growth acceleration. For example, when Salesforce acquired MuleSoft in 2018, the company was growing at 38%. At the end of 2019, the company was growing at 52%, after being integrated into the Salesforce ecosystem.Moreover, the underlying potential profitability is not only growing, but the growth rate is accelerating. As you can see from the chart, the 3-year and 5-year gross profit CAGR is 28.2% and 26.1%, respectively. Recently, gross profit growth has been, in fact, advancing.With healthy gross profit margins, the company should eventually deliver a more intriguing bottom line. The mid-range of its revised guidance of EPS at $2.94 is a good indicator that substantial profits will start flowing in. At the current $860.3 million shares in issue, this translates to a little more than $2.5 billion in net income. According to management's projected revenues, this suggests a 12.5% net income margin.I am going to forecast EPS CAGR at around 20% over the next five years. I believe this is a prudent and fair estimate since:Projected EPS, then, looks as follows:(Source: Author)Salesforce has expressed no intentions to make any distributions in the medium term. Therefore, investors are to enjoy gains based on what multiple the market is willing to assign to CRM, based on its future EPS.Below, you can see what compounded annual growth rate returns investors are expected to enjoy, based on different future (2025) P/E ratios and the stock's current price.While a P/E of, say, 45 may sound like a high one, it's actually not. Most well-established tech companies with consistent and growing profitability attract similar, if not higher, P/E ratios. For example, currently:Remember that all these companies have been delivering robust bottom lines for years and still attract such valuations. I believe that a 2025 P/E of 45 is fair, as a result. In that case, with said projections, investors are to enjoy CAGR returns of 11.5%, even after Salesforce's recent impressive rally.Salesforce currently has a levered free cash flow of $5.58 billion. To be prudent and exclude other sources of cash such issuance of stock and debt, I am going to simplify this figure as Cash from Operations - CAPEX. I come out with a free cash flow of $3.41 billion. I then assume that its growth rate starts at 20%, which then gradually drops to around 10% over the next five years. I believe this is a prudent estimate, since the growth decline is unlikely to be that steep. Besides, we do not account for additional sources of funds, such as cheap debt, which could increase future ROI and, as a result, cash flows.(Source: Author)The WACC comes out at 6.33%, based on the following figures.(Source: Author)Plugging everything in, the intrinsic value per shares comes out at around $196, which suggests a small upside of about 1.57%.(Source: Author)With regard to its valuation, Salesforce does indeed have some risks. While further upside remains, the current price provides little margins of safety. Even if the company were to distribute 50% of its EPS, the FY2020 and forward dividend yield would be 0.76% and 0.91%, respectively. With little tangible returns, shares could suffer significant losses should the company underperform the market's expectations.Further, Salesforce has been consistently raising more and more equity to fund acquisitions, diluting existing shareholders. Sure, owning a smaller chunk of a far bigger company is great, but the strategy is risky. Consistently acquiring companies may not be sustainable in the long run, and synergy-optimal fits may not always be possible.In the company's latest 10-K, management clearly states:Finally, while Salesforce's revenues are primarily in the form of a subscription service, a potential recession could cause other businesses to cut the unnecessary or less primary SaaS products, drastically reducing recurring operational cash flows.Salesforce is a quality business rapidly evolving in the ever-growing SaaS world. The bottom line has been historically weak. However, the potential future profitability has been continually advancing. Despite the revised guidance, the company aims to deliver solid profitability in FY2020. Reasonable EPS growth assumptions point towards double-digit returns, while prudent cash flows suggest that shares are reasonably priced.To ensure a margin of safety, investors may want to wait for a potential correction before jumping in. However, as medium-term CAGR returns remain attractive, such an opportunity may not be a probable one. I will hold on to my CRM shares and possibly add on a potential dip."
4356737,102194,2020-07-02T11:03:46-04:00,"Salesforce guided dim (FY21 Sales of USD20bn, 6% down from earlier company projections) for the rest of the year after Q1’21 results; maintains sales growth momentum.Wide product offering and increasing adoption of platform services to drive future business growth as digital transformation becomes imperative.Acquisitive growth strategy will be the way forward, although only after streamlining the recent acquisitions on its plate.Revenue visibility is moderate for FY21; profitability will remain a key challenge over the medium term. However, liquidity is ample to sustain the business even if the pandemic lingers.Salesforce valuation at 39x price/FCF FY21 commands premium over its peers.","Operating profitability continues to disappoint even as topline grows Salesforce.com (CRM) announced upbeat first quarter (Q1’21) results on the topline (+30% YOY). However, it had its share of woes from the ongoing pandemic, suffering a negative operating margin of 2.9%. A one-time commission guarantee, cancellation of events, and office space lease payments shaved off an additional 450 bps from its profitability, increasing the overall operating profit margin impact to a negative 850 bps. Despite achieving the operating scale with an acquisitive strategy, CRM’s operating margins have remained stable over the past 4-5 quarters. However, EBITDA remained positive at USD1.3bn in Q1’21, almost flat on a YOY basis. Though one-time costs incurred in Q1’21 may not repeat, the company will have to find ways of improving the business mix and/or curtailing costs, certainly in the long run, if not over the next 12 months (which seems overly challenging).Source: Q1’21 earnings presentationAmid gloomy pandemic conditions, CRM reduced its revenue guidance to 17% YOY for FY21 to USD20bn vs 23% YOY growth issued at end FY20, which mainly emanates from its sales and marketing function-based subscription revenue model that is set to dwindle in the prevailing situation. A revenue attrition rate of 10% (previously less than 9%) by the company’s CFO Mark Hawkins seems quite bullish at this point, even as CRM tries to assuage revenue concerns by additional business that it expects during this lean period of business activity across verticals and geographies.Short-term pain is inevitable; revenue certainty over the near-term stems from existing contracts Over the next couple of quarters, new deals and subscription rates will remain sluggish as companies adopt a cautious approach and tighter budgets with increasing uncertainty around COVID-19. And this can get worse if the situation prolongs. As such, earnings quality is poor, with the savior being the free cash flow (FY2020: USD3.7bn, FY2019: USD2.8bn) that’s helping sustain the company in the present conditions. For a high-growth acquisitive company like CRM, an earnings generation of ~USD1bn seems like a long-term achievable target to remain invested in the game. To achieve this, the company should focus on integrating all its recent acquisitions (USD25bn acquisitions in the past two years, including Tableau, ClickSoftware, and recently Vlocity for USD1.3bn in Feb 2020), and go slow on new ones.Another pertinent point to note is its increasing share of current Remaining Performance Obligation (cRPO), which stands at USD14.5bn at the end of Q1’21. With USD4.9bn revenue in Q1’21 and the revenue guidance of USD20bn for FY21, it seems the chunk of the balance of USD15.1bn in revenues for FY21 is going to come from cRPO at the end of Q1’21, due to reasons mentioned above. With that being said, the share of cRPO in total RPO has been inching upward over the past three years (49% in FY20 vs 47% in FY18), providing fair revenue visibility over the next 12-month period.Source: Company filingsPost COVID-19 digital transformation and enterprise deals to bolster topline growth As new trends of working evolve due to the pandemic, CRM’s entrenched market position will help it thrive and grow. As a dominant leader in the space it operates in, CRM’s market share (18.4% in 2019) is way ahead of the competition, in a way that it’s greater than the sum of the market shares of its closest rivals put together (17.8% cumulative of SAP, ORCL, MSFT, ADBE). However, in the ongoing cloud war, as large enterprise players look for scale and differentiation, CRM also presents itself as a potential opportunity for being acquired by a larger technology company.Source: Q1’21 earnings presentationLeveraging on its core strengths, CRM has scaled up from being a mere sales cloud company (27% of revenue in FY20 vs 41% in FY16) into one that offers Platform as a Service (PaaS) while maintaining momentum in services cloud (26%-27% of revenues). These three together account for ~80% of revenues that are almost equally spread. As with the past trends, product vision and continuous innovation will be the key catalysts to steer the company forward for larger, strategic deals.Source: Company filings During the onset of the pandemic, the company’s cloud and platform services (75%+ YOY in Q1’21) had a far-reaching impact across its clients, business scales, and geographies from the likes of Zions Bank (a community-based bank), various state governments in the U.S., AT&T, and the Commonwealth of Australia. This is only a start to the kind of deals that may flow in the future, where digital transformation is becoming imperative across various industries and sectors irrespective of size and scale. A total addressable market of USD174bn (Source: Salesforce Q1’21 earnings presentation) across services, marketing, and ecommerce, combined with CRM’s wide product portfolio and ecosystem, should propel the company’s future deals during the post-recovery phase.Valuation: Potential for scale; and steady stream of cash flows still leave a room for further premium We prefer to use the Price/FCF multiple compared to P/E or EV/EBIDTA multiple, as the earnings of the company are not a true reflection of its current performance and growth potential. For instance, CRM’s forward P/E of FY21 is at 64x vs industry peer average of 36x (refer to Table 1 in the Appendix). In addition, for such a dynamic business model, acquisitions are apparent and can involve substantial capital outlays. Considering this, FCF holds merit as it encapsulates the cash flows of the business, factoring in the subscription-based revenues, profitability margins, and acquisitive trends. In a subscription-based model, cash flows are definitive and recognized early on, while acquisition costs and related expenses are recovered over the lifecycle of the service/product. Additionally, this factors in the seasonality of cash flows that are typical of this business, which is dependent on renewals that other metrics would not reflect. At the current market price of USD183 per share (market cap is USD165bn), CRM’s Price/FCF (FY21) is 39x vs the industry average of 23x (refer to Table 2 in the Appendix). CRM is a high-growth company (set to double its topline to USD34bn by 2024) commanding a relatively higher valuation than its peers.Even though the company has been on an acquisition spree to fuel its growth, its free cash flows have always been consistent and growing. We believe that its acquisition of Tableau and the recent developments around the pandemic have been priced into the stock. Compared to its peers, CRM may appear to be overvalued. Although there are short-term concerns about the business and its earnings, the long-term prospects are bright on the road to economic recovery post-pandemic. As the company embraces product innovation and integrates past acquisitions, digital transformation deals will lead to better adoption rates of its 360 platform. Hence, the company deserves to be valued at a premium versus its peers, with a target price of USD200/share (~7.5% upside) over the next 12-month horizon. We have a “Hold” rating with an optimistic view on the stock.Appendix:Table 1:Source: Yahoo Finance Table 2:Source: stockrow.com, MarketScreener.com, YCharts"

The leading customer relation management SaaS company can rely on rock-solid free cash flows with annual growth rates settling at 18-20% over the past five years. While I bank on lower growth rates from FY 2022 onwards, there's a lot to like about the company despite its lofty forward FCF multiple of 28 for FY 2023. Future shareholder returns are therefore expected to land between 12% and 15% when factoring in some safety margin in the form of multiple contraction. Since there are liquid options available on the stock, a simple covered call writing strategy is expected to play out very well and will lead to 20+% annualized returns going forward. In addition to that, a combination of reducing risk first and then leveraging our returns via buying call LEAPs will yield even better results.In search of long-term leaders that can be implemented in our option strategies, I'm looking at a couple of parameters to separate the wheat from the chaff. First and foremost, can the company retain its economic moat and squeeze FCF out of its business? Second, we're looking for underlyings that are ranked among the best stocks of the entire US market based on predictability and relative outperformance. Lastly, is there an opportunity to utilize option strategies in order to increase our long-term probability of profit and minimize standard deviation in our portfolio returns? Salesforce easily passes all of our system criteria. Let me highlight four fundamental aspects that demonstrate its true strength, the current technical picture and three option strategies that can be combined to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns.#1: Wide Economic Moat Results in Solid FCF GenerationIts CRM market share has grown steadily to 18.4% in FY 2020, making it the biggest player in a fragmented market where Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) are relatively small competitors. In fact, Salesforce captures more market share than all of its four biggest rivals combined. As such, Salesforce's dominance paves the way for predictable cash flow growth and FCF margin expansion to 23.3%. Stickiness to its services is reflected in 94% of revenues being generated from subscription-based solutions, along with high switching costs that form a barrier for customers to leave for one of Salesforce's competitors.(Source: Option Generator's Research Based on Company Data)#2: Ample Free Cash Flow Generation To Fuel Accretive TakeoversThe primary reason why dedicating some of your capital to Salesforce is a good, long-term idea can be explained by its robust free cash flow generation. Not only have these cash flows been growing faster than revenues for a long period of time, analysts are also expecting an uptick to $7.5B over the next three years compared to $4.5B today. Without any new acquisition having the proportion of Tableau (a deal of $15.7B), Salesforce's net cash position will mount to $23B by the end of FY 2023. To put some context around that number, it's about 13%-14% of its current market cap. A possible takeover prey could be Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV) as such a deal would leverage Salesforce's presence in healthcare cloud-computing.(Source: Option Generator's Research Based on Company Data)Growing by an annualized rate of close to 12%, total addressable markets for Salesforce's businesses continue to expand. More importantly, these opportunities are widespread across many industries including analytics, commerce, marketing...(Source: Company Report)Compared to its nearest competitors, very few are close to matching Salesforce's revenue growth and booming cash flow generation. In fact, every three to four years, the company expects to double its sales pointing to a $35B target by FY 2024.(Source: Company Report)(Source: Company Report)#4: Attractively Priced On Forward Three-Year BasisBased on the FY 2023 numbers, FCF is expected to come in at around $7.5B with a fat net cash position of $23B. Taking these two numbers into account, shares are trading at a forward FCF/EV yield of 4.8%, which is quite reasonable given its anticipated high-teens free cash flow growth. All in all, I consider the stock to be attractively valued on a five-year horizon.Looking at the monthly technical picture, Salesforce shares are hovering near all-time highs with a possible breakout move to $225. The MACD has recently seen an up-cross, while the Directional Movement Index is ready for a new positive streak as shown below.(Source: Pro Real Time)Option StrategiesLet's now explore the strategy possibilities in the world of options.1) Monthly At-The-Money Covered-Call WritingCumulative Performance: Backtesting Results (From June 2010 to May 2020)The first strategy I'd like to present to our readers is at-the-money covered call writing. This means selling a covered call against 100 shares of stock you already own with a strike as close to current market value as possible. At the end of the expiration period, we roll out to an at-the-money strike regardless of whether or not we have to pay a debit. No management prior to expiration or early assignment was taken into account.Below, three curves are plotted. The red line represents an at-the-money covered call without rolling down during a correction. For example, we maintain a $100 strike on a stock that's dropped from $100 to $95. The blue line is the buy-and-hold performance, while the green line is an at-the-money covered call which picks a strike that's always at-the-money, i.e., thus also rolling down when a pullback occurs.(Source: Option Generator's Research)As can be seen from the graph above, the at-the-money covered call strategy without rolling down performed the best, while the buy-and-hold investor would have generated a return equal to that of at-the-money covered call writing with rolling down. But what about the risk-adjusted returns for each strategy?Annual Returns and Drawdown Graphs: Backtesting Results (From June 2010 to May 2020)As for the annual returns per given year, we'll notice that in high IV environments the covered-call writer tends to outperform the buy-and-hold investor (for example in 2011, 2015, 2016).(Source: Option Generator's Research)The reason why the covered-call writing has produced such great risk-adjusted returns can be found in the following graph. By selling a covered call, we're collecting a premium which dampens the losses on our long stock position. Even if the stock goes down, we can still capture a 0.5% time value return.(Source: Option Generator's Research)As such, we're reaching new highs more frequently than the buy-and-hold investor.(Source: Option Generator's Research)The loss-mitigation factor is more pronounced for the active covered-call writing strategy which rolls down during corrections instead of maintaining the strike. However, there's a trade-off we cannot neglect: rolling down means a lower profit potential when a rebound takes place.(Source: Option Generator's Research)Subsequently, given Salesforce's stellar past returns, the outperformance gap between the ""passive"" and ""active"" covered-call strategy is pretty wide. It should be noted, however, that in very bullish market environments any covered-call write strategy is expected to underperform holding stock outright. Fortunately, Salesforce's decent IV of 34% has led to a steadily growing outperformance for the passive covered-call strategy.(Source: Option Generator's Research)Probability of Profit and Correlation: Backtesting Results (From June 2010 to May 2020)The #1 success factor that distinguishes the covered-call strategy from buying stock is the probability of profit. We see less outlier moves and obtain a higher win rate than holding stock, i.e., more monthly trades were profitable.(Source: Option Generator's Research)In terms of measuring directional risk, the active covered-call writing strategy would have seen a relative beta of +0.39, which grows to +0.75 during corrections. The correlation with buy-and-hold returns is a strongly positive 0.73. As written in a previous article, monthly covered-call writing should be considered a beta reductor, not a correlation differentiator.(Source: Option Generator's Research)Conversely, the passive covered-call strategy sees a much higher beta (and thus directional risk) of +0.62 with a +0.86 correlation. In return for taking on more risk, we would have gotten a substantially higher reward.(Source: Option Generator's Research)2) 5% In-The-Money Covered Calls on Salesforce.com5% in-the-money covered calls vs. buy-and-hold performance: returns (backtesting from June 2010 up until June 2019)Another strategy that reduces both directional exposure and correlation is the one-year in-the-money covered call write.Let's evaluate the forward one-year returns for 5% in-the-money covered calls with a one-year duration on CRM. For example: we enter a covered-call trade on June 1, 2010, and take a look at the return on June 1, 2011 ... we finally execute our last monthly trade on June 1, 2019, and take a look at our June 1, 2020, return. We do the same with a buy-and-hold approach. Both strategies are not managed and don't factor in the dividend distributions. The in-the-money covered call is thus held until expiration, as the backtesting results should paint a fair picture.Please keep in mind that the in-the-money covered call trades that would have been entered during the extremely high IV readings in March of this year are NOT included in the study. That's because the realized forward one-year return is still unknown as it will depend on CRM's share price in March 2021.As can be noticed from the graph below, the red dots are wide-spread, whereas the yellow ones are virtually perfectly correlated with the implied volatility level at order-entry. Given the noticeably higher standard deviation in Salesforce's buy-and-hold returns (of 20.6%), we'd expect to see more variations.(Source: Option Generator's Research)The box plots give us a perfect overview of the data distribution. For all observations in ITM CC, the spread between the 25% and 75% percentile is narrow, i.e. 4.3%. The 25% best trades would have had an average one-year return in excess of 12.5% with the maximum profit standing at 19.4% without any type of management. The minimum return would have been 7.9%, while the average profit amounts to 11.0% with 3.9% standard deviation.(Source: Option Generator's Research)As for the buy-and-hold results, the spread between the 25% and 75% percentile stands at 27.53%, indicating the variance in the data. More importantly, 31.48% of the time, the in-the-money covered call write would have outperformed the buy-and-hold strategy. To get the average return of 20.3%, we need to take the standard deviation of 20.6% into account.(Source: Option Generator's Research)Beta and correlationThe beta of the options strategy compared to buy-and-hold investing is close to 0. To put another way, we'll experience less directionally pronounced outcomes for the defensive options strategy.(Source: Option Generator's Research)Talking correlation, there seemingly doesn't exist a relationship between forward one-year returns for buy-and-hold investing and in-the-money covered calls. We, therefore, believe that in-the-money covered call writing on the right underlyings can be utilized as both a beta and correlation reductor.(Source: Option Generator's Research)Salesforce has proven to be an excellent in-the-money covered call vehicle as it not only exhibits relatively small standard deviation per unit of return (3.9% standard deviation on an average 11.0% return), but also acts as a zero-correlation strategy with buy-and-hold investing. If Salesforce were to go down, there's no guarantee of seeing a loss on an in-the-money covered call trade.3) In-The Money Covered-Call Writing And Call LEAPs To Leverage Our ResultsWhat would have happened if you chose to dedicate 10% of your capital to call LEAPs? As highlighted in our step-by-step playbook on buying call LEAPs, these investment vehicles can be utilized to leverage our returns. So let's take a look at the forward one-year returns for this hybrid strategy:As always, we hypothetically put these positions on every single month (regardless of what's going on), evaluated the returns after one year and compared them to a buy-and-hold approach.(Source: Option Generator's Research)Some interesting stats:(Source: Option Generator's Research)In other words, a significantly higher risk-reward for the 90% ITM CC - 10% Call LEAP combination.In our opinion, Salesforce is a great buy-and-hold stock as its wide economic moat, cash-minting business and strategic takeover opportunities allow for above-average shareholder returns. The wide economic moat and reasonable valuation will make us embark on this long-term buying opportunity. Most importantly, aside from just buying the stock outright, there are better ways to benefit from its bright business prospects by utilizing options."

I’m saying this because of yesterday’s earnings report and what it implies.Salesforce.com, at a $165 billion market cap, is one of the largest “pure cloud players” out there. During the coronavirus crisis, these players as a group have distinguished themselves by having their stocks recover amazingly fast.For instance, this is how the Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU), a proxy for this group of stocks, did during the coronavirus epidemic:Like other stocks in this sector, CRM is priced for perfection. At that $165 billion market cap, it carries a 8.25x FY2021 Price/Sales, still far from the crazier stocks in the group.It also carries a ~62x FY2021 P/E, but this is based on highly adjusted non-GAAP earnings. If we remove just the stock-based compensation adjustment from these non-GAAP earnings (because keeping intangible amortization is fair), then we’d be looking at a ~312x FY2021 P/E.Again, these outrageous valuation metrics are typically even worse for most of the other players in the sector.The thing is, the extreme recovery seen in these players in the context of the coronavirus epidemic was based on them supposedly being immune to the epidemic’s economic effects. Yesterday, by guiding down on revenue growth (and also EPS), Salesforce.com might have put that thesis to sleep – not just for itself but also for many other cloud players.What Salesforce.com did, regarding revenue guidance, was to take its revenue guidance to ~$20 billion for FY2021. This compares to the market’s $20.77 billion expectation. FY2021 revenue growth expectations thus become +17% instead of +21.5%.Some might think “well, that’s not too bad!”. But consider the following.What Salesforce.com implies is that cloud companies don’t exist in a vacuum. Mostly, these companies sell their services to “real economy” companies (even if there’s still some other cloud company in the middle before it reaches the real economy).If the real economy has taken a severe hit because of the coronavirus lockdowns, ultimately these companies also suffer it in their businesses. Yet, they trade as if the fields are now even greener than before the coronavirus impact. Sure, there’s a story about “accelerated digitalization”, but the truth is that the impact on physical businesses has been so tremendous that nearly everyone is selling into a smaller pie. This will include even those companies that temporarily benefited from the shutdowns.Yet, even as this realization strikes, the outrageous valuation multiples are still in place. If this spreads, we will see not just a business slowdown and fundamental impact but also significant multiple contraction. The multiple contraction alone can easily cut many players (including Salesforce.com) in half or worse. Were that to happen, by and large most cloud companies still wouldn’t be cheap."

Allow us to bring you up to speed, beginning with a little history.CRM was borne of Internet 1.0 in the 1990s. Most people think of it as the first true, pureplay cloud software business. It was set up in 1999 and IPO'd in 2004.The company was founded by longtime CEO, part-time co-CEO and now CEO again (more on that later) Marc Benioff. Benioff was schooled in enterprise software sales in the 1990s at Oracle (ORCL), then the most aggressive and successful software sales machine yet developed. A rock star at ORCL, his time at the company overlapped with that of Tom Siebel, founder of Siebel Systems (then-ticker SEBL), an early Customer Relationship Management vendor Siebel sold ""on-premises"" software, meaning, Siebel mailed you an install disk and then an army of folks from its integrator partner - usually a big consulting firm like Accenture (ACN) - would arrive at your company one day to install the software you bought onto the shiny new server you had been told to buy to run the stuff. That army would live in your offices 24/7 and then leave about two or three years later having extracted from you about three times, sometimes four or five times, the amount of money on integration services that you had already decided to spend on the software license. And that software license itself would already have been terrifyingly expensive. Like, millions of dollars expensive. For the license. Then 3-5x that for the installation and integration with all your other software. Oh, then you paid 20% of the license costs annually, with a price inflator formula built in, for something called ""maintenance"". Big on-premises software companies loved maintenance. Because a synonym for ""maintenance"" is ""free money"". Mostly, maintenance involved providing updates, which sometimes also were payable on top. If the integration with other apps broke, well, that was usually your problem or the integrator partner's problem. This is why mature on-premises software was such a wonderful business model. It still is. Ask Larry Ellison.Cloud software, or ""1-800-No-Software"" as CRM first called it (no, really), appeared to many to be a dreadful idea, for a long list of reasons. Here's why most people said ""it will never work"".Investors said - what, you don't get paid upfront, no big bow wave of license cash? Monthly or annual subscriptions? Funded by equity or debt in your early years? Urgh! (Remember this was the 1990s, when the Fed thought money should cost something and didn't just send you free money with which to buy 3x levered Nasdaq ETFs).CTOs at potential customers actually laughed and said - ""put our data on the Internet? Never!"" they said. ""It won't be secure."" Then, when CRM told them that their data would live in a database shared with other companies - referred to at the time as a ""multi-tenanted"" database, actually a fantastic development by the not-often-lauded CTO Parker Harris - those CTOs would double down, send CRM packing, call Tom or Larry and then fork over millions of those juicy dollars for ORCL or SEBL on-premises apps.Salespeople, interviewed for jobs at CRM said, ""what, no enormous commission checks from selling $20m licenses?"" - and also went off to call their recruiter to call someone who worked for someone who worked for Tom or Larry and to go get a job there instead.And the SEC, in the run-up to the IPO, said ""wait, what is this subscription revenue thing of which you speak. Deferred revenue? This sounds like funny money. Come back when you have a real business model."" The IPO was much-delayed as a result, since US GAAP at the time had a hard time with the revenue recognition of this business model.So in short, it could never work.Here's why it worked.Users loved the software.The first application, sales force automation, was simple, effective, ran well in the browsers of the day, was pretty much 100% available, didn't in fact leak your data to your competitor, and at a push it worked on your not-very-smart-phone of the day, kind of, if you had reading glasses and very small fingers.CTOs still hated it. So how, you ask, did users get to use it? Because CTOs didn't buy it. Salespeople and sales managers bought it. They bought one or two or five seat licenses on their company credit card, for a few hundred bucks a seat. Sales managers could sign off on that level of spend. It was a simple app, required no integration to anything, and just worked. When the finance department got the credit card statement, they didn't know to call the CTO and say - hey - there's a leak in the Matrix, get down to that regional sales office right now and fire everyone. Because it was just a line item saying salesforce.com and it was only a few hundred bucks. Probably just a website subscription. Couldn't be software. Didn't cost ten million bucks. No army of Agents from Cap Gemini had arrived. Of course it wasn't software.Then about a year or so later that expense bill would be getting bigger and bigger and CTOs would notice that the $20m SEBL installation they had paid for was still not installed or, if it was, someone had installed it using template business processes, not the processes actually used by this particular business. So the CTOs would be walking around telling department heads that no, they couldn't run the business in the way they had been doing for the last two decades, instead they had to run the business the way Tom Siebel said it had to be run. Because otherwise the software wouldn't work. And heck, it cost $20m, it HAD to work. Front-office executives then did what front-office executives always do. They ignored head office and got back to selling stuff instead. And using CRM software to sell that stuff.Anyway, in about 2006, maybe 2007, all this reached a tipping point and after some very big companies, Cisco (CSCO) among the earliest, did in fact do big company-wide deals to use Salesforce software, CRM went mainstream, SEBL got bought by ORCL, and then everybody became a cloud expert and started calling it cloud and said they had loved cloud all along and don't anyone say they didn't always love cloud because they did. Which is where we are today. (Which also means there is a new not-cloud business model bubbling up somewhere. No, not in Redwood Shores).So, the original way to naysay CRM was to say that its data model wasn't secure, that it couldn't integrate with other apps, that the company would go under once its free equity line (remember it raised money in the post-Netscape IPO late 1990s, about $60m in VC money, a huge VC round at the time) dried up. All that proved to be bunk.The new way to denigrate CRM is to say that (1) it doesn't really grow, except by acquisitions, (2) that it doesn't generate cash and that's why it pays everyone in stock, that the founder is forever selling stock, and, lately, (3) that the founder is distracted and is spending too much time worrying about his Hawaiian island, developing his Ohana, Tweeting, and generally not spending enough time selling software, not-software, or whatever.(1) and (2) are untrue, as we shall see in a moment. (3) was true, in our view, and we have said as much. But then last quarter, the co-CEO Keith Block suddenly found himself not-Ohana, Benioff is back in the big chair, and we think we're off to the races once more.We can't say it any more clearly than that.Here's how cashflow and earnings relate to one another, as of last quarter.Net income is a lot lower than net cash generated. Note our choices of measure above. Cumulative net income from FY1/10 to FY1/20. Cumulative cash generated - as in, actual money, posted to the balance sheet - over the same period. Earnings low. Cash high. Not rocket science or strange accounting. The company does pay people with a lot more % stock vs % cash than most companies. Stock awards reduce earnings under US GAAP, but not cash. Hence the chart above.So if anyone says to you ""that company doesn't generate cash"", just show them that chart and have them take potshots at it. If they come up with a good counterargument, let us know. That's the kind of very boring discussion we're always up for.Now, you may have noticed that the real economy has stopped. Unless you are currently in North Dakota, just take a look out the window. You see anyone buying anything? So. There isn't a lot of cash flowing anywhere right now. And that means that companies who think cashflow is a thing they get from other people - shareholders, lenders, mom, whoever - are going to have some problems in the next few months. But companies who have a lot of cash, who have cautious balance sheets - well, they aren't going to worry so much.Here's a summary balance sheet for CRM for the last six years.In those six years, it has had net debt for only two of those years. Otherwise it has plenty of net cash.That's because of the SEC's old friend, deferred revenue. You can see that deferred revenue line climbing above, growing at a similar rate to total revenue each year. Deferred revenue is a confusing accounting term. It's actually a balance sheet liability item. It means ""the liability I have to customers to deliver the stuff that they have already paid me for which I haven't recognized as revenue or earnings yet because I haven't delivered it"". (Accounting students, you can thank us later for making this easy on you). The matching asset on the balance sheet is, you guessed it, the cash the customer already paid you. And THAT is why CRM generates so much money. Because when Benioff left ORCL and SEBL, although he colored it Aloha, he never forgot those sales chops and in particular that lovely perpetual license gusher of cash. You won't find the phrase ""perpetual license"" anywhere at CRM. Anyone who says those words in Salesforce Tower is escorted to the door by security. No, perpetual licenses aren't a thing at CRM. You can't give CRM money and use the software forever. You can only give them money and use the software for a year or two. Five tops. Then you have to give them more money to use it for longer. Oh and by the way they have your data and its all entangled with other apps they have sold you or integrated to so, are you really going to switch vendor? Thought not. Tom and Larry taught the boy good.In CRM's case the stuff is more or less free to actually deliver, because it involves flipping a virtual red switch in a virtual server and saying ""customer X can now access their stuff in our system"". Each month that customer X uses the software-as-a-service, CRM recognizes one month's worth of revenue and earnings in the income statement; that revenue is very high margin because it requires CRM to do very little incremental work to deliver the service. They already own the datacenters and already have to pay the air-con bill, etc.With each month that passes, as revenue is recognized, deferred revenue reduces by the same amount. When a new contract is sold, deferred revenue goes up, cash goes up. For CRM, if you want to look into the future to see what revenue growth is going to look like, always look at the deferred revenue line first. You can see that the growth rates are pretty close over a number of years.Yes, it does. The financial statements tell you it does. And it has grown at those sort of rates for a very long time. Even though it has over $17bn in revenue these days. Here's the income statement going back six years.Now, it's true that not all that growth is organic ie. it's not all from products that CRM itself has developed. Some of the growth is from acquired products. And its also true that the market tends to prefer (ie. value more highly) organic growth. But all companies with $17bn in revenue acquire growth as well as generate growth. And the important thing about acquiring growth is that you don't pay for growth that doesn't come through. CRM's balance sheet tells you that isn't happening. They raise debt to buy companies, mix those companies' revenue in with their own to keep that 25-30% growth rate going, and then use the cash generated to pay down the debt. That's fine by us. If the debt were climbing but the revenue not growing, not fine.In August 2018, CRM appointed then-COO Keith Block as co-CEO alongside Benioff. This is never a good idea in our view. We have a reductionist view of management being, there needs to be someone in charge. We have yet to see an example of co-CEOs working out well. It usually seems to us to be an arrangement to avoid a fight today that just draws the fight out down the line, the eventual victor being the one you thought would win anyway. SAP tried this in recent years and CRM went the same way. In February this year, Block stepped back and Benioff resumed the sole CEO role.No-one other than Benioff himself will ever know what actually happened in that period, however, our own view is that Benioff retaking the reins is a positive for shareholders. As co-CEO in our opinion he seemed often distracted, busy on other projects and generally not all-in on CRM. The company was rumoured to be almost sold to Microsoft (MSFT) in 2014/15 and so our view is that in the end Benioff wishes to cash in his stock. So our best guess is that CRM will now see one huge growth push from the top in order to maximize the value of the company prior to selling itself to a larger suitor, be it MSFT or someone else. This gives us some un-modellable upside, being maybe a 20-ish% stock premium at any given point should the company in fact be acquired.As we noted in an article last year, CRM usually suffers in a crisis, only to come roaring out of the gates once the world improves. Why this is, we do not know. But here's how it has performed through earlier macro crises (chart comes from our prior article).Source: YCharts, Cestrian AnalysisHere's how CRM has performed YTD through the Covid-19 crisis, vs. the market and vs. MSFT by way of comparison.Source: YCharts.comThe stock is off 13% YTD, having fallen just as hard as the market up to mid-March, despite clearly having much faster growth and much better cash generation than the market at large. It's since recovered somewhat but still lags the slower-growing MSFT by a good 14% over the period.We think the prospects for CRM's stock price appreciation are strong - better than the market at large and better than MSFT. You have faster growth and more visibility than both; and the added push from a CEO who, we believe, is looking for a full sale of the company.The stock in the 140s is too full a price for us to buy right now; at the time of writing the market is crazy-up and has forgotten that the real world has stopped spending money. But we're happy buyers in the 130s and feel that the opportunity will come soon.Cestrian Capital Research, Inc - 6 April 2020."
4335356,81836,2020-03-31T20:33:54-04:00,"CRM's patent activity/dynamics with patent scorecard, weekly and historical patent value, risk and disruptive scores in relation with competitors and stock price.A look at CRM in terms of technical analysis.Implications for CRM's stock price.","Among the nearly 6,000 companies taken into account by Innovalpha (Nasdaq, NYSE, and Amex), Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM) has been identified as one of the leaders across all industries taking into account company's patent filing activity, in particular in relation to PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) applications. From PCT patent dynamics, Innovalpha provides a weekly patent index for all the 6,000 companies from which patent scores are computed as well as buy and sell signals and recommendations.The investment thesis is that for companies like CRM:1. Filing PCT patent applications outperform the ones which don't in out of sample backtestings. Innovalpha is the first company to provide evidence of the strong intrinsic value of PCT patent applications per se. Why so? Because the PCT, administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), is used by nearly all companies worldwide whatever the industry. It is a standardized process used to facilitate patent protection on a global scale. Hence, companies use the PCT when they believe their inventions deserve extended patent protection (several countries). Further, the PCT publications are the earliest publications related to a company's innovation, with only a 6-month delay between the filing date and the publication date. These two unique features represent exceptional advantages and explain to a large extent the outperformance measured by Innovalpha. Investors shall be much more attentive to PCT publications in their investment decision. However, several thousand PCTs are published each week rendering the patent analysis impossible without using automated tools and scores as provided by Innovalpha.2. Displaying specific patent patterns/clusters, cycles of innovation, and fluctuations over time in the patent index will generate outperformance. The historical patent profile of a company, its patent dynamics, is a storyteller. Typically, a current intense patent filing activity over a defined period of time within a company, in contrast with a previous declining historical profile, will generate positive patent scores. If a company believes that it has developed a valuable invention, it will obviously try to secure such innovation with many patents, which will translate into what is called patent thickets/clusters, all detected by Innovalpha's algorithms. The models built with related outperformance have been validated by out of sample backtestings, real track, and third-party confirmation.What is essential to understand is that models relying on PCT patent applications capture forward-looking innovation (recent patent activity analyzed), new products that may or are in the process of being launched, which translate into strong market outperformance versus current methods relying on granted patents (past innovation and with inherent drawbacks, e.g. models using U.S. patents will be U.S. centric). For the above reasons, Innovalpha does not assess the value of a patent per se, which, in addition, is probably an impossible task even for a patent/field expert.As a consequence, detection of companies with PCT clusters/patterns is of particular relevance for the investor, as one can expect such companies to develop and launch new products soon which will hopefully translate into higher market valuation (detection of promising innovation-driven and patent-centric companies). At the minimum, such recent patent patterns reflect management belief that such PCT innovation deserves consideration with consequently substantial financial and human resources allocated through increased patent-filing activity over a defined period of time, a clear indication of growth within a company which makes sense for the rationale as it underlies a sustainable innovation/business (actual innovation is a core/fundamental value of a company).Indeed, alpha lies in expectations not in past innovation already part of companies' market valuation. Further, our patent models show that patent size doesn't matter (presently, the market doesn't confer a value to important patent portfolios, on the contrary). As a consequence, big patent portfolios are not indicative of future stock market increase. We believe that the combination of Patent Dynamics with financial analyst opinions will increase the likelihood of stock outperformance. An important takeaway is therefore that the number of patents held by a company is not relevant, what matters is PCT patent dynamics.Please see Innovalpha's previous articles in order to understand the methodology used.CRM is a PCT innovation-centric company as it files PCT applications with clusters/patterns identified (PCT patent dynamics), translating into positive patent scores as shown below which may materialize into new products and equity return. Here, in addition to CRM's patent dynamics analysis, writer's technical analysis is provided.Five factors are taken into account in order to reach a conclusion:Figure 1 shows CRM’s scorecard displaying the patent index, grade, overall patent score, patent value, patent risk and patent disruptive scores.CRM displays overall decent patent scores except for the disruptive score which represents evidence of the R&D/innovation activity within the company. The overall patent score of CRM is 108.6, which is above average and ranks the company seventh out of 292 (compared with companies in the same sector listed in the NYSE, NASDAQ and AMEX). The company is in Grade B, a very good grade (grades ranging from A to F, with A being the best grade).Based on the historical data used, CRM is considered an innovation star, a midstage company that is disruptive with growth. It also indicates that CRM is in relation to all companies in the technology sector:An increase in minimum values can be seen as it continues a steady trend higher. Investors shall definitively consider this company for further analysis.Figure 1 - Salesforce.com, Inc. SCORECARD - Source: InnovalphaFigure 2 displays a summary view of CRM's patent scores.Figure 2 - CRM portfolio view - Source: InnovalphaFigure 3 displays CRM's patent index and stock price over time. During the period from 2015 until Q2 of 2018, not much growth was seen for the index; however, during Q2 of 2018, it has increased substantially. Since then some further growth can be seen; however, for the past months both the price and index have remained flat indicating a period of stagnation for the company that is also reflected in its share price.Figure 3 - CRM's patent index and stock price over time - Source: InnovalphaFigure 4 shows CRM's overall patent score and its stock price over time, Figure 5 shows its patent value score and stock price over time and Figure 6 shows its patent disruptive score and stock price over time. The three graphs are very similar with steady growth in the past 2 years.A strong correlation between the stock price and the patent value score is identified for most of the 5-year period and not much deviation in the form of a large gap can be seen. Indeed, a very little positive gap is currently identified between the patent value score and the stock price. This indicates that the company trades close to its fair value and therefore leads to think that the company does not offer an outstanding investment opportunity. Current trend in patent dynamics is neutral.Figure 4 - CRM's overall patent score over time - Source: InnovalphaFigure 5 - CRM's patent value score over time - Source: InnovalphaFigure 6 - CRM's patent disruptive score over time - Source: InnovalphaWIPO indicates that CRM's principal market in terms of patent protection is the USA, with only a very minor activity seen in PCT applications followed by some activity in Canada, Australia, China, Germany and India (see Figure 7). As expected, the USA is by far the country with most patent activity.This trend of the USA being by far the leader remains constant throughout the years with other countries only accounting for very minor activity which indicates lack of diversification, but not surprising taking into account the sector of activity. Patent dynamics in the USA is in line with PCT applications, i.e., a constant increase since 2017, which is bullish.In terms of the various classes under which CRM filed patent applications, the top three classes have remained pretty much constant throughout the 5-year period. An overwhelmingly large majority of patents were filed under G06F - electric digital data processing (computer systems based on specific computational models g06n), followed by H04L - transmission of digital information, e.g. telegraphic communication (arrangements common to telegraphic and telephonic communication h04m) and G06Q- data processing systems or methods, specially adapted for administrative, commercial, financial, managerial, supervisory or forecasting purposes; systems or methods specially adapted for administrative, commercial, financial, managerial, supervisory or forecasting purposes, not otherwise provided for.A minor activity can be seen in various other related segments and has remained constant throughout the years indicating some lack of patent diversity.Figure 7 - Top patent applications by region/country for CRM since 2015 - Source: WIPOFigure 8 is a standard bubble chart showing Salesforce.com, Inc. on the left of the graph together with several other companies, with the overall patent score on the y-axis and patent index on the x-axis (in all the bubble charts below the size of the bubble is proportional to the PI index). As can be seen from this figure, the patent index, which is a measure of the size of the patent portfolio, is not the most appropriate way to identify interesting companies.Figure 8 - CRM with overall patent score vs. patent index - Source: InnovalphaIn contrast, Figures 9 and 10 display CRM's patent dynamics and clearly shows CRM as one of the industry leaders, representing useful views to immediately identify promising companies warranting further scrutiny.Figure 9 displays overall patent score on the y-axis and disruptive score on the x-axis and Figure 10 displays the overall patent score on the y-axis and risk score on the x-axis.Figures 9 and 10 clearly show as well that there are very few companies with both substantially positive patent value and disruptive scores, indicating that many companies within the field have not been able yet to put in place innovation management/strategy that creates value.Figure 9 - CRM with overall patent score vs. patent disruptive score - Source: InnovalphaFigure 10 - CRM with overall patent score vs. patent risk score - Source: InnovalphaFigure 11 shows a long-term technical analysis of CRM. The overall trend is still bullish as the price has been setting higher highs and lows for the past decade.At the beginning of this year a strong higher high was set at 195.72 USD. This was seen after several months of consolidation below the previous all-time high of 167.5 USD, however, was followed by a clear break below a several year trend line as well as previous major swing low of 140 USD.Currently, the price seems to be rejecting further downside with a very strong rejection seen in the 3rd week of May after 115 USD previous support was briefly tested.Therefore, overall CRM looks bullish and will likely provide an entry with good risk/reward potential unless further drop in the overall market is seen.Figure 11 - Technical analysis of CRM - Source: Tradingview"
4337439,35181,2020-04-14T04:49:29-04:00,93% of revenue is deferred and under long-term contracts. Short-term results should not be unduly affected by the market downturn.The company has a strong balance sheet and should not have a problem fueling growth via M&A activity. There should be plenty of opportunities for acquisition during this bear market.I am optimistic that Salesforce.com will weather the pandemic and recession without too much issue.,"Salesforce.com (CRM) is the granddaddy of SaaS and has been a guiding light in the digital transformation movement. But some critics believe that Salesforce doesn't have enough upside potential and carries too much risk. I say ""not so fast.""Certainly, government actions to shut down non-essential businesses and implement social distancing have been damaging to the economy. In all likelihood, we are in or will be in a global recession. But I am cautiously optimistic that we will lick COVID-19 and see a gradual return to economic prosperity. There are early indications of promising treatments including the use of zinc in conjunction with the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine.I am also starting to hear cautious optimism over the restarting of the economy. It isn't just President Trump doing the tweeting. There are several states including California looking to reopen their economies.Even with the economy boot started, things won't return to normal for some time. But keep in mind that the stock market is a leading economic indicator. In 2009, the stock market turned bullish one full year before the unemployment rate leveled off and started to go down.Despite the likelihood of recession, Salesforce is in good shape to weather the storm. The company has a strong balance sheet and has a strong record through the last two recessions:Salesforce will likely persevere throughout the economic downturn due to multi-year contracts and a high level of deferred revenue:The deferred revenue is already under contract and should translate into better future results than some of its peers that offer short-term subscriptions.Salesforce is growing revenue by a combination of organic growth and M&A. Critics would like to believe that M&A activity will be curtailed. But I believe the opposite. Salesforce has close to $8 billion in cash and short-term investments and also has strong free cash flow. The depressed market will result in plenty of opportunities for acquisition.Moving on to Salesforce's stock valuation, I use a custom technique to estimate the relative valuation of the stock price versus the remaining stocks that I track. The technique consists of creating a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth. The plot below illustrates Salesforce's stock valuation relative to the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red on the scatter plot and represents a typical valuation based on next year's sales growth. As can be seen from the scatter plot, Salesforce is situated below the (red) best-fit line suggesting that the company is modestly undervalued on a relative basis.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to one of my previous articles.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In Salesforce's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 29% + 22% = 51%Salesforce scores above the 40% needed to fulfill the Rule of 40. Exceeding the Rule of 40 signifies that Salesforce has a healthy balance between growth and profitability.Every investment comes with risk and usually the bigger the opportunity, the greater the risk. Salesforce is no different in this respect.Perhaps the biggest risk is that the economic downturn lasts longer than expected. The longer the economy is depressed, the more erosion is likely in Salesforce's revenue growth. Revenue growth is key to sustaining Salesforce's relatively high 5.5x EV/forward sales multiple.Salesforce has not withdrawn its guidance for 2021 yet and investors have to assume that silence is good news. But if Salesforce either withdraws or downgrades guidance, then this will likely translate into a lower stock price. Keep in mind that Salesforce has a very good record for meeting analysts' estimates as shown in the table below:(Source: Portfolio123)The sudden resignation of co-CEO Keith Block may be a signal that all is not right internally with Salesforce. His reason for departure has not been made public.Salesforce has been in business for 21 years and two previous recessions. The company is perceived as a cash machine due to its SaaS business model, a model that Salesforce introduced to the world, or at least is credited with it. The business model has been replicated by most software companies with mostly very good results.In recent years, Salesforce has bolstered its revenue growth by M&A activity. I expect that will continue as the company attempts to achieve its stated goal of doubling revenue by 2024. While some feel that the current market conditions with tightened lending conditions will stifle M&A, I believe the opposite. Salesforce has a strong balance sheet and good free cash flow margin of 21%. I expect a bearish market will result in M&A bargains that will be beneficial to Salesforce.93% of Salesforce's revenue is deferred and under contract so I expect any deterioration in results during the pandemic will be minor. The company has a great record of forward guidance and such guidance hasn't been lowered. At least not yet.I find that the stock price is modestly undervalued. Salesforce, with its strong revenue growth and free cash flow margin, handily fulfills the Rule of 40. For all of the above reasons, I am giving Salesforce a bullish rating."
4336249,69905,2020-04-07T09:37:10-04:00,"Investors erroneously expect Salesforce.com to meet its guidance targets, even though the economy is facing an unprecedented contraction.Salesforce's M&A strategy will be forced to temporarily close up.This stock carries too much risk and not enough upside potential.","Salesforce.com (CRM) is the poster child for cloud-based revenue growth. But its underlying growth brings up more questions than answers.I argue that Salesforce's acquisition-led growth is less sustainable than many believe and that its stock remains grossly overvalued, at more than 6.7x trailing sales, given its poor near-term visibility. Avoid this stock.Here's why: (source)Salesforce is a stock I've been consistently bearish for more than a year:Below is Salesforce's revenue growth trajectory:Source: author's work. *fiscal 2020 (calendar 2019), ***latest guidance for fiscal 2021 (calendar 2020)The first aspect to focus on is the unquestionable fact that even without the coronavirus pandemic, given that the above guidance was offered on the 25th of February before it was truly understood the impact that coronavirus would have on the global economy, Salesforce already was pointing toward fiscal 2021 meaningfully decelerating from fiscal 2020 (calendar 2019).The second and more critical fact is that Salesforce's revenues require growth and customer retention. Put another way, even if enterprises that had already adopted Salesforce as their chosen platform chose to remain on the platform, for Salesforce to deliver growth, it must also have new enterprises adopting Salesforce for their digital journeys.With so much economic uncertainty, and numerous companies playing for survival right now, the number of companies that are going to seek to embark on their digital transformation will abruptly decline. Indeed, some analysts already are pointing to channel checks that reinforce this thesis.Analysts and investors had all been too happy to turn a blind eye to the fact that Salesforce's growth was largely inorganic. Everyone recognized this fact, but for as long as the share price was moving up week after week, there was no necessity to look under the hood and ask challenging questions. But how different things look today?Compared with other SaaS players, Salesforce has 93% of its revenue from recurring sources. As a comparison, ServiceNow (NOW) has 97%. The difference demonstrates that companies do, in fact, migrate off Salesforce's platform, irrespective of the ""illusion"" that once the customer is on the platform, that customer is tied in and it will not leave.Moving on, founder and CEO Marc Benioff already acknowledged that Tableau's $15.7 billion acquisition was huge, and that throughout fiscal 2021 Salesforce would continue to be focused on integrating Tableau.However, we should minimally question, given that Salesforce deployed $21 billion for MuleSoft and Tableau, does this mean that Salesforce's ability to come up with innovative services has now plateaued? Will Salesforce not be forced to seek out other ""strategic"" companies with strong innovative ideas?Investors have been content to pay a large multiple for Salesforce without truly asking difficult questions from their investment.Specifically, since 2016 investors had gone from pricing Salesforce on at 6.0x times trailing sales to just over 8.4x its trailing sales. Presently, the multiple has compressed slightly to 6.7x trailing sales, but it has significantly more downside to come. Why? Because it will not be able to meet its own guidance.Consider this, Salesforce's balance sheet is undoubtedly strong, with a net cash position of $5.5 billion. However, with credit markets drying up temporarily, Salesforce will struggle to secure financial backing to make further acquisitions. Moreover, its own share price has significantly tumbled, impairing the value of using its own stock to make more acquisition.Again, without revenue growth, Salesforce will struggle to reach its own revenue target. And given that investors were pricing in Salesforce on the assumption that it had very strong visibility and predictability, all of Wall Street was singing its praises, but will now rapidly make an about-turn.Salesforce's management has a long track record for brilliant execution. If the whole of the SaaS sector was to meaningfully compress, given Salesforce's leadership it should underperform less than its peers.Similarly, when the dust settles, companies such as Salesforce, with a talented workforce and strong and compelling platform, should bounce back fastest.Salesforce has significantly less visibility than investors believe. It's highly unlikely to meet its fiscal 2021 (calendar 2020) revenue targets.Investors are still pricing in Salesforce under the premise that it will deliver strong revenue growth by paying 6.7x trailing sales. However, without inorganic growth to bolster its revenue growth rates, investors are going to be negatively surprised and face a permanent loss of capital."

But now, with decelerating growth rates, investors are going to start to look elsewhere for better opportunities.","Salesforce.com (CRM) has been a very strong investment up until now. But the tide is now changing underneath, while its valuation remains too high. In the video, I discuss what its guidance could look for H2 2020 and going into FY 2021 and why there's more here than meets the eye. Even though investors are not weighing up Salesforce as a profitable enterprise, that was when its growth rates were stable, predictable, and growing at north of 25% year-over-year. Today, its near-term prospects are very different and this stock is best avoided. Here's why:The bulk of readers of this article are Salesforce shareholders. Consequently, anyone who disagrees with their views leaves them with indigestion and are best avoided -- this is understandable. However, my hope is that someone will at least consider my points.Here's the hindsight that should be most troubling, Salesforce lowered its full-year revenue, and the market hardly moved at all. In fact, it was down just 3%.What caused this downward revision? More in the video.Salesforce is many things. A leader and visionary at the pinnacle of SaaS world. It's not supposed to be profitable too, right?Salesforce's non-GAAP adjusted metrics reminds us that the company is plowing ahead at an unstoppable speed.

4351271,104941,2020-06-01T10:47:15-04:00,"Salesforce expects to double its revenue to $35 billion by 2025, and with the accelerating force of covid-19, this should be attainable.The CRM market was valued at $40.2 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at 14% CAGR over the next 7 years.Salesforce currently has 17.3% CRM applications market share and continues to ink blockbuster deals, such as its recent deal with AT&T.Betting against Benioff has proven to be a massively losing bet, and I don't expect this trend to relent.I rate Salesforce a strong buy at $175 per share.","SourceSalesforce (CRM) is a cloud-based software company that provides a realm of customer relationship management (hereafter CRM) services. Since 1999, Salesforce has offered an automated sales process through its cloud-based platform, which has made it easy for its core product to be enhanced with new technology (i.e., through acquisitions and organic improvements).That is, Salesforce has evolved over the years and remains the premier cloud-based CRM offering in its market, which largely targets the largest and most successful corporations, universities, and governments around the world.All of this success has been predicated on the visionary leadership of one Marc Benioff. Here's some evidence of this visionary leadership borne out by a quote from him in 1999:Early on, Salesforce's software focused on marketing and sales for its customers, but Benioff, being the visionary he's proven to be, had his sights on evolving his CRM offering each and every year. By building a cloud-based platform, which is extremely compatible with innumerable sales channels, Salesforce has been able to utilize acquisitions to propel its platform such that businesses will be operating on Salesforce today and in the future.This strategy continues to prove to be a highly lucrative one, as evidenced by the company's consistently high gross margins, rapid top-line growth, and ability to continue to acquire rapidly growing companies; all of which will continue to propel the share price higher throughout the 2020s.Today, I am going to look at how Salesforce has been able to create the ultimate CRM with its cloud-based platform through acquisitions to improve its core businesses. By acquiring companies and developing its core businesses, Salesforce has been able to establish itself as a leading CRM service and has become a vital part of thousands of businesses, universities, and governments.Source: Dreamforce 2019 Investors Day Finance Review PresentationAs can be seen above, Salesforce has become something of a de facto venture capital fund that often incorporates its investments into its flagship CRM offering.In addition to the above, Salesforce acquired Tableau, the number one business data analytics platform, in 2019. In 2019, Tableau did $841M in revenues, while growing at 41% annually.This is a rapidly growing, secular growth trend that is set to explode in the 2020s (i.e., business data analytics via graphical interface and machine learning). Moreover, CRMs often manage tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of pieces of data at a time, and a visualization software enhances the users' ability to digest such large volumes of data.With Marc Benioff still at the helm, it appears Salesforce will continue on its strategic acquisition spree in the coming years. We're going to explore these acquisitions, but first, let's check out how the core platform continues to perform.Source: Dreamforce 2019 Investors Day Finance Review PresentationSalesforce is the #1 CRM company in the world. The goal of Salesforce has been to simplify business for large enterprises by making their data intuitive and accessible through its cloud-based Software as a Service (SAAS) model. By using cloud-based software, Salesforce helps a many different types of businesses, as it's easy to adapt the company's product to fit the needs of its many different customers. This also enables Salesforce to integrate applications smoothly and incorporate a variety of features into its platform with incredible efficiency and speed.Source: Dreamforce 2019 Investors Day Finance Review PresentationSalesforce reaches and impacts many different industries, i.e., universities, car manufacturers, insurance agencies, government agencies, and the list goes on and on. The number of industries it serves is expected to continue to grow through 2024, as can be seen above.For example, governments have used Salesforce to transition from on-premise data/client management to the ubiquitous and agile cloud-based environment. The company is also partnered with Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY), which owns a bevy of different powerhouse brands.VW leverages Salesforce's offering by collating all of the data from its family of brands into one cloud-based environment.The company can then analyze this massive amount of data so as to identify certain consumer trends, on which it can capitalize via one of its brand members.For example, with all of the data collated into one data ecosystem, which Salesforce provides, VW could identify the direction in which its consumers are trending, i.e., whether they're buying more luxury or economic vehicles or whether they're buying more sedans or SUVs.With the acquisition of Tableau, VW could then create graphical depictions, potentially in 3D using Nvidia graphic cards (NVDA)... just a thought... and display stunning and highly potent images of data and consumer trends at board meetings.Source: Salesforce BlogspotAs you can see, Salesforce services the largest corporations on earth.Source: Dreamforce 2019 Investors Day Finance Review PresentationSince Salesforce is capable of scaling and evolving its software as customers grow, I expect it will continue to expand its market.Tableau was the #1 data intelligence company (when it stood alone) and had a strong customer base before the acquisition (including, for example, LinkedIn (MSFT) and Verizon (VZ)). Tableau, combined with Salesforce's in-house Einstein Analytics, will enable its software to interpret the data from manufacturing, sales, marketing, and supply chains. The acquisition cements the idea that Salesforce is offering its clients the best service by which they improve their operations and ultimately serve their clients better. In sum, Tableau will play an important role in analyzing the data from Salesforce customers and providing optimal solutions, as we explored in the VW example.Tableau was viewed as a direct competitor of Salesforce's Einstein Analytics, but by making this acquisition, it effectively eliminated a competitor and enhanced the strength of Salesforce. Moreover, Salesforce has a new channel through Tableua's customer base, which will enable cross/up selling to new and existing customers.Source: Dreamforce 2019 Investors Day Finance Review PresentationAs can be seen above, Salesforce's financial wherewithal as enabled it to buy the best technology on earth in pursuit of creating the most dominant CRM platform on earth. Let's explore a couple of these acquisitions below.Now, we already have seen how these acquisitions have performed financially (the graph is a couple of paragraphs above, and if you don't feel like scrolling up, they're crushing it.) But let's examine a few use cases for these applications. The graph immediately above highlights how they have enhanced the CRM offering pictorially.MuleSoft is a software that provides a platform for building networks that connect enterprise apps, data, and devices. The acquisition of MuleSoft has enabled Salesforce to continue to transform its service as MuleSoft makes it easy to integrate different models of business into the Salesforces cloud offering. Consequently, this has made it easier for businesses to transition to SalesForce, through iPaaS (Integration Platform As a Service). This has been a key acquisition for Salesforce since it eliminated the barriers for businesses to convert to its platform.DemandWare has proved to be another beneficial acquisition for Salesforce, as it has expanded available channels for retailers to reach their customers through e-commerce. According to Salesforce, DemandWare is the global cloud leader in digital e-commerce, and this acquisition enables companies to use data analytics/visualization to better understand its customers' online shopping habits.Source: Dreamforce 2019 Investors Day Finance Review PresentationAs can be seen above, Salesforce offers a variety of B2C channels.Salesforce acquired ExactTarget in July of 2019 for $2.5 billion. ExactTarget is a leading cloud marketing company. ExactTarget specialized in powering optimal marketing campaigns by leveraging specific automation for over 6000 companies (including Coke (KO), Amazon (AMZN), and Nike (NKE)). Thus, it gives Salesforce's customers the ability to understand their markets in terms of B2C and B2B.Now, I have spoken at length about empire building being negative for companies, as has been the case for AT&T (T) and could become the case for Alphabet. But in the case of Salesforce, Marc Benioff's visionary leadership should continue to propel the company on a stable trajectory forward, and his track record heretofore speaks as much (that is, his acquisitions continue to create immediate value for his customers and enhance the value of his core platform).Source: Dreamforce 2019 Investors Day Finance Review PresentationAs seen above, Salesforce has doubled its revenue in the last four years, and it expects to double it again in 2024. Salesforce will look to continue to grow in the markets in which it's already dominant while expanding internationally, as is illustrated below.Source: Dreamforce 2019 Investors Day Finance Review PresentationSource: YChartsSalesforce has a strong gross profit margin at 75% and has been increasing its free cash flow per share over the past four years. With that being said, one might liken Salesforce's strategy to that of Amazon's strategy.That is, the company plans to aggressively reinvest so as to reach its lofty revenue targets in the coming years. Such a strategy does not portend elevated EPS, but in any analysis, there must be nuance. We understand that Marc Benioff has lofty goals for conquering domestic and international markets, and this requires his operating margins to be suppressed, while his sales teams venture into the world, selling Salesforce's sticky products.As can be seen below, the company is aggressively spending on sales and marketing, while also accelerating its R&D spend.Source: YChartSalesforce has maintained steady growth over the last 10 years, and the company will continue to reinvest in evolving its core business segments while providing its customers with the most optimal and most effective cloud-based product.Alright, so what should we pay for it?Assumptions:Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelBased on the LASV Model, Salesforce is currently undervalued by about 30%. For a company that has been steadily increasing revenues and generating a strong gross profit margin, the market seems to be unfairly discounting this incredible asset.The company's growing revenue from its variety of segments highlights how Salesforce has created a premium CRM platform that will continue to stay ahead of the development curve by utilizing new digital services.Now, a DCF illustrates how over or undervalued a company is presently, but it tells us nothing in the way of what returns we can expect in the future.To illustrate projected returns, we must implement ""step 3"" of the LASV Model, which we've neatly coded such that it takes only a moment to calculate. Here are the results below:Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelThe major risk that Salesforce faces presently is that it won't live up to the growth expectations it's set forth due to a deteriorating economic environment.But fret not, as our assumptions always include a ""margin of safety"", which we implement through conservative assumptions across the board, which we use as inputs into our LASV Model.Salesforce has become a de facto venture capital fund, in which a collection of incredible multi-billion dollar properties are growing at 30-50% annually. With Marc Benioff at the helm, the company will continue on its path of winning throughout the 2020s.As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow for more, and happy investing!Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4335229,105417,2020-03-31T11:24:41-04:00,"We are leaving our estimates and target price of $175 unchanged, given that we expect solid demand for CRM services to continue.Cloud engagements and Einstein initiatives remain key to the company's growth.In the short run, CRM committed not to lay off employees.","We published our last update on Salesforce (CRM) on December 4, 2019 (See Article). Since then, it appears that an entire millennium has passed, since the US stock market and numerous companies in the S&P 500 index have undergone tremendous negative changes and face grave uncertainty. CRM, however, was able to adroitly differentiate itself from the pack. Right now (as of March 30), its share price is down only ~4% from that point, relative to the ~16% drop of the overall S&P 500 index since early December. In the present article, we will revisit our thesis and discuss what makes it particularly strong in the times of the coronavirus crisis.Recall that Salesforce is a provider of enterprise software, delivered through the cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence technologies. CRM's service offerings are integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications, providing sales force automation, marketing automation, and digital commerce, among other services. Below, we discuss the valuation, as well as key tailwinds that still remain relevant. We end our discussion by addressing risks to our Bullish thesis. `We are greatly helped by the fact that Salesforce reported earnings when coronavirus already posed a threat to Europe and the United States, and thus provided some insights that are largely unavailable for many other names we cover. Out of all names under our coverage, we are keeping our multiple and estimates intact, unchanged from the December 4 update. This in itself says a lot about the prospects of this stock. In our bullets below, we explain why it is premature to change any of our estimates at this point. We are maintaining our 9x EV/revenue multiple, which at the annual revenue base of $13-14 billion leads to our unchanged target price of $175.Cloud Remains an Important Driver: While there are few drivers with a definite verdict these days, cloud is certainly one of them. We've been hearing from numerous players in the IT Services space, most importantly from Microsoft (MSFT), - of the aggressively rising demand. Microsoft noted on March 28th that there is a 775% increase in demand for cloud services within regions that are enforcing social distancing as a result of COVID-19. For Salesforce, we believe demand is softer but still enough to maintain a healthy revenue cushion in both the service cloud and commerce cloud segments. This is also a situation when the recent acquisition of Tableau comes in handy. There are few direct beneficiaries of COVID-19 in the tech space, with CRM and MSFT (albeit, we don't cover Microsoft, just commenting here in passing) being prime examples. Einstein AI as Key Differentiator: It is important to emphasize that the popularity of the entire Einstein product/service has been growing in double digits and is unlikely to slow down. Again and again, companies indicate in surveys the robustness of demand. Further, we believe that Einstein is built to benefit clients during the downturn times even more than during periods of economic expansion.EMEA Expansion to Continue: Despite the slowness in the EMEA region, we believe that Salesforce will reinforce each partnership on a case-by-case basis. While British Airways will now likely be on the backburner, partnerships with Algae and Siemens are likely to move forward, in our opinion. Don't Underestimate APAC: With China leading coronavirus woes since January, some analysts have been cautious of CRM's Asia strategy. However, with the company growing 28% Y/Y in that region during the last quarter, we see continued sales as sustainable at a 20%+ Y/Y sales rate. Of all regions impacted by the coronavirus, APAC is the only one thus far that demonstrated the viability of the V-curve resurgence. In the meantime, many of Salesforce's clients can benefit from cloud tailwinds. Public Engagements Growing on Both Federal and State Levels: As we have commented on this in the past, CRM continues to expand work within US government agencies, whether it's Department of Veteran Affairs on the federal level or the state of Colorado on the state level. In contrast, companies like Accenture or Cognizant have been scaling back on that front. At the same time, we believe that amidst the coronavirus recession governments will be more likely than not to encourage CRM and others with more expansive contracts.Lack of Layoffs Signals Confidence: CRM's management recently promised not to execute ""any significant layoffs over the next 90 days."" While from the bottom line perspective this is not necessarily a positive, nevertheless this step signals that the company remains confident in its revenue streams, at least in the short run. CRM does not believe that the coronavirus impact will be disruptive enough to the top line to warrant bottom line changes that are no less disruptive. Technological risks: Failure along any step in the supply chain can lead not only to business slowdown, but to a branding risk, from which CRM may struggle to recover.Pricing risks: With many companies eyeing CRM's success, we expect a meaningful number of new entrants in 2020-22, with more attractive pricing to CRM's customers.Macro risks: Economic slowdown, particularly in Europe, has a potential of meaningfully impacting the top-line."

Crucial to see if all the strategic acquisitions would realize into long-term growth for Salesforce.Cash Flow needs to be inspected more carefully. Cash expenditures for Salesforce cuts deep into its strong CFFO.,"As the world's leading provider of cloud customer relationship management (NYSE:CRM) solutions, Salesforce's stock price has undoubtedly recorded exceptionally high long-term top-line and earnings growth over the past five years.Looking back at Salesforce's stock price performance last year alone, however, despite the company's stock price rising 18% in 2019, it still lags behind the overall software industry peers by about 41%.The company's stock price has been stagnant largely due to its not-so-splendid financial performance over the last FY, a slowed growth prospects into the future, combined with additional acquisitions announcements.According to the FY20 earnings released at the end of last month, Salesforce increased revenue by 34% YoY, and Non-GAAP EPS was $0.66 (YoY-6%), which were both higher than analysts' expectations.However, at the same time Salesforce also announced:The stock price fell more than 2% after the session upon these announcements.After years of rapid growth, Salesforce has come to a stagnation shown in both its earnings and stock price. Below are some key points to consider before a bullish investment case could be made for Salesforce again. Sales from CRM services, including Subscription and Support revenues, were $4.56 billion for Q4 (Total Q4 Revenue $4.85 bn), which still accounts for majority of the company's revenue stream. Breaking down by CRM portfolio products, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud each accounted for $1.2 bn, Salesforce Platform & Other accounted for an impressive $1.4 bn (+74% YoY), and the rest came from Marketing and Commerce Cloud.Salesforce is undoubtedly the clear leader in the CRM industry right now, with a valuation of over $100 bn in market cap and a well-leveraged first mover advantage in the cloud technology. It is also worth noting that Keith Block, the company's former co-CEO, has played an important role in Salesforce's development of the cloud ecosystem even before he had risen to the management role. The announcement of Mr. Block's departure seems to have surprised the industry and even caused concerns among some investors. During his tenure, Salesforce achieved an incredibly rapid rate of growth both organically and via dozens of mile stone mergers and acquisitions of important business partners/industry players within the Salesforce ecosystem.According to Gartner's market share estimates, Salesforce dominated the global CRM market with a 19.5% market share in 2018, more than double its closest competitor SAP (8.3% share).But we also see the competition in the global CRM industry becoming increasingly fierce. Companies such as Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP), Adobe (ADBE) - which are all Salesforce's traditional, long-time competitors in the CRM field - are flexing their advancing SaaS technologies to grab market shares, and meanwhile tech giants such as Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), etc. are also putting more focus on their cloud computing businesses, also starting to squeeze market shares from Salesforce. These peers all have quite strong R&D capabilities and very mature technology platforms, which, in a sense would create an uphill battle for Salesforce going forward. Whether Salesforce can keep up its defense game to maintain its steady growth despite the increasingly more intense competition, especially post Keith Block's departure, would be an important consideration for investing in the company for the near future.Increase in short-term losses a trade-off for long term growthIn Q4, Salesforce recorded a net loss of $ 248 million versus a net loss of $109 million in Q3 and a net profit of $ 362 million in the same period last year. The net loss has worsened in recent quarters despite the company's continued top-line growth. The biggest reason for Salesforce's loss in the last two quarters is the costs associated with its series of acquisition deals last year where the company spent a lot of money to grow and strengthen its competitiveness in the CRM/SaaS field. In August 2019, Salesforce completed the $15.3 billion acquisition of Tableau, which was its largest transaction to date. Another major effort for Salesforce to increase data integration was its acquisition of MuleSoft for $6.5 billion in 2018. In addition, in 2019, Salesforce spent another $1.35 billion on ClickSoftware, an enterprise software service provider.Now this new acquisition of Vlocity at $1.33 is another strategic decision (expected to be completed in fiscal 2021) which enables Salesforce to expand its foothold in the PaaS field. Fortunately, in the FY earnings briefing conference, the management assured us that the earnings impact of the acquisition is already included in the FY2021 company guidance figures. Even with that in consideration, the company still guided a higher than expected EPS for the FY21, but the stock price still fell despite the positive company outlook, reflecting investor concerns over the losses associated with acquisition risks, among other things.Of course, all of Salesforce's recent acquisitions including Vlocity wouldn't improve its short-term performance - on the contrary it is more likely to drag the company's net profitability - and thus we are more likely to see the company continue to record quarterly net losses for some time.It seems to be generally agreed that Salesforce's ""Cash Flow"" has been steady and strong, however, this notion does not look so sound after considering various cash out items that the firm also steady spends regularly. In other words, only Cash Flow from Operations for Salesforces is consistently strong, while if we account for below items, for example, for FY2020,Source: Salesforce Q4 FY20 10-KThe FCF for the company is generally significant lower in past FYs, and investors should not be blinded by the growth of CFFOs every year and ignore the cash-out items Salesforce consistently expend to sustain its growth. Even with lackluster stock performance last year, Salesforce is still relatively overvalued at current price. Its Non-GAAP FWD P/E of ~50x vs. industry avg. of 15x-20x, FWD EV/EBITDA of 22.5x vs. industry avg. of ~12x, and other valuation metrics such as EV/CF, EV/Sales, PEG, etc. all higher than its peers across the board. Source: SeekingAlpha - Value Grade and Underlying MetricsNot yet. CRM is a field with a bright future and Salesforce certainly has a fantastic edge in the technology. However, the company also has a lot on its plate at this moment, from managing the change in management, to creating acquisition synergies/continued expansion of its cloud platform ecosystem, to generating enough CF to support its increased cash expenditures, to maintaining top-line growth while trying to return to a net profit. Therefore, it might still be a bit too early before one can make a confident investment thesis on longing the stock at current valuation."

        Sales momentum may run into headwinds in 2020 as well. The departure of co-CEO Keith Block, who was in charge of go-to-market operations, and the cancellation of sales events are big contributors.","Amid this historic coronavirus-driven selloff, it's important that investors employ extremely selective stock-picking and avoid buying into names that, prior to the selloff, were already deserving a correction. Salesforce.com (CRM), the world's first pure-play SaaS company and the undisputed leader in cloud software across a number of categories including CRM and marketing, falls squarely into this bucket. Investors' confidence in Salesforce has held up relatively well this year, at least compared to the broader market. Salesforce investors have been lucky enough to sustain only a 7% loss in value since the start of the year - beating the wider software index (BATS:IGV) by three points, and suffering less than half the loss of the S&P 500.The key question for investors: amid this stark outperformance, does Salesforce deserve such premium performance; and, moreover, can we expect Salesforce to continue outperforming? In my view, investors should steer clear of Salesforce and invest in more beaten-down software names. We'll cover a few key risks in this article that may eventually drag share prices downward.One of the main problems with Salesforce that critics have hammered on for years has been the company's attachment to M&A as a principal growth strategy. As growth in Salesforce's flagship Sales Cloud has slowed to ~15% y/y amid deep market saturation, the company has sought to prop up growth rates via M&A. This is a playbook borrowed from a much older (and arguably, struggling) software firm: Oracle (ORCL), where Salesforce founder Marc Benioff previously worked as a protege to Larry Ellison before leaving to start Salesforce. In February, Salesforce announced a $1.33 billion (paid in mostly cash) acquisition of Vlocity, a software company built on the Salesforce platform that specializes in providing verticalized software. Only a year prior to being purchased by Salesforce, Vlocity was valued at $1 billion in the private markets (which, as we know from the fall of venerated startups like WeWork, may be a bloated valuation to begin with), meaning Salesforce paid a 33% premium over Vlocity's most recent recorded valuation. Salesforce also disclosed that the company is expected to contribute ~$50 million in revenue in FY21 after closing the deal in Q2, meaning Salesforce is paying a ~10x revenue multiple for the company.While this isn't exactly a crazy or brazen purchase, especially given Salesforce's history of successfully buying companies and retaining their brands to promote uninterrupted growth (think MuleSoft, which Salesforce has essentially left alone to grow and operate) Salesforce's continued buying binge reveals the company's ethos. In 2019, Salesforce spent $15.7 billion to buy Tableau - a purchase that amounted to roughly 90% of Salesforce's revenue for that entire year. Just the year prior, Salesforce splurged $6.5 billion to buy MuleSoft. Nobody can argue that these were smart purchases meant to extend Salesforce's TAM, but in the macro recession that we're facing, this ""growth-at-all-costs"" strategy may turn investor sentiment against Salesforce, especially if the company's organic growth rates continue to slow.In particular, we must acknowledge that while Salesforce's acquisitions are accretive to revenue, they might not necessarily be accretive to profits and/or cash flow. Take MuleSoft, for example. Fantastic growth - but not so fantastic profits. In 2017, the final year that MuleSoft reported earnings independently, the company generated -$80 million in GAAP operating losses and -$52 million non-GAAP (a 62% y/y increase in pro forma losses), while free cash flow was also (marginally) negative, losses which were thereafter folded into Salesforce's financials.Salesforce has as reputation as a benevolent acquirer - that is, the company isn't out to force massive layoffs to improve its targets' profitability. So the key takeaway here: one of the main reasons why Salesforce is perennially unable to lift its operating margins (which we'll discuss in more detail in the next sections) may be due to the fact that it keeps buying unprofitable startups and absorbing their losses. As a private company, we don't have many details on Vlocity other than its expected $50 million revenue contribution for FY21, but we can be nearly certain that Vlocity is also dragging operating losses with it. Salesforce's penchant for M&A may also be pinching the company's precious liquidity while other companies are busy belt-tightening.Amid the coronavirus uncertainty, investors have generally fled to high-quality stocks with rich and defensible margins. Salesforce, however, may be the exact opposite of this - thanks in part, as previously discussed, to its tendency to buy loss-leading startups. Figure 1. Salesforce operating income trendsSource: Salesforce.com Q4 earnings releaseConsider the fact that in the fourth quarter of FY20, as shown in the chart above, pro forma operating income fell to just $32 million, down -69% y/y from $102 million in the year-ago quarter. For the full year FY21, operating income declined -10% y/y to $409 million. Operating margins, meanwhile, fell from 3.4% in FY19 to just 2.4% in FY20 - virtually nothing, especially for a company with a ~$20 billion annualized revenue run rate and a ~$130 billion market cap. Note that, by contrast, Workday (WDAY) closed out its FY20 with a pro forma operating margin of 13.4%, growing 310bps year-over-year and nearly ten points richer than Salesforce, a company that is largely five times larger than Workday by revenue. Note as well that the story for Salesforce would be much worse on a GAAP basis, thanks for the company's heavy reliance on stock comp (which rose a whopping 39% y/y in FY20, much faster than the corresponding 29% y/y revenue growth). GAAP operating income declined -44% y/y to $297 million in FY20 - which, again, should be a red flag for investors in a hyper-conservative market that is looking for safety.Salesforce's relatively stable stock price so far in 2020 may be a signal that the market believes its revenue base is stable. This assertion does contain some truth - as a subscription software company, the majority of Salesforce's revenue stream is already contractually locked in, and Salesforce will perform far better than tech giants like Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR), for whom ad spend is the biggest revenue driver and customers have the flexibility to cut their spending when macro conditions are bad.However, many Wall Street analysts believe that no company, including Salesforce, is immune; Jefferies recently cut its Salesforce price target on the basis that investors may be underestimating the virus' impact on Salesforce's growth.One potential reason this might be the case is that Salesforce employs a particularly aggressive direct sales strategy, one that relies on both a vast network of inside field sales agents as well as external resellers. The global lockdown that has now spread across the U.S. and Europe will indefinitely suspend the in-person meetings and bakeoffs that generate Salesforce's new deal signings. Customer conferences and marketing events are another major channel for Salesforce to drive sales growth. Though Salesforce's major event, Dreamforce, is always slated for November and is unlikely to be cancelled due to the coronavirus, various regional conferences that happen throughout the year will likely be suspended, hurting sales momentum.Another factor that has nothing to do with the coronavirus may be hampering sales this year: the sudden departure of Salesforce's co-CEO Keith Block, who was elevated to share the top job alongside Marc Benioff less than two years prior. As the former president/COO of Salesforce prior to his elevation, Block was primarily in charge of Salesforce's go-to-market operations, and the abrupt departure of sales leaders in large organizations almost always triggers re-organizations and other departures that results in pipeline disruptions. Salesforce's relatively strong stock performance this year may suggest that the company is relatively impervious to the troubles plaguing the rest of the stock market, but the stock is long overdue for a reality check. Salesforce's aggressive M&A strategy and persistently low profitability margins may eventually turn market sentiment against the company, especially as its valuation relative to other large-cap software peers balloons. Investors may also be in for a shock if Salesforce reports lower-than-expected growth in the near term, due to virus-related sales disruptions as well as co-CEO Block's departure. At present share prices near ~$155, Salesforce trades at a market cap of $138.5 billion. After netting off the $7.95 billion of cash and $2.61 billion of debt on Salesforce's balance sheet, its enterprise value is $133.2 billion. Free cash flows for FY20, meanwhile, clocked in at $3.69 billion. If we assume constant FCF margins in FY21 and apply the same 23% y/y growth rate implied in Salesforce's revenue guidance, we get to a FY21 FCF estimate of $4.54 billion for the company. This implies that Salesforce is currently trading at an FCF multiple of roughly 29.3x - a broad premium to the market, especially considering the current downturn. Microsoft, for example - a fellow large-cap software company with a slightly weaker mid-teens revenue growth rate - trades at a ~26x FCF multiple, suggesting Salesforce has little room for multiples expansion.Stay on the sidelines here and invest elsewhere."
4330169,102646,2020-03-05T23:18:12-05:00,"Salesforce stock has underperformed its peers in the past five years.Critics blame this on the company's many acquisitions, its valuation, and competition.In reality, Salesforce is constantly reinventing itself and building an impenetrable moat in the process.","Salesforce Tower: Business InsiderSalesforce (CRM) critics point to its long track record of “growth through acquisitions” strategy and its history of being overvalued. Some also warn about competition in its key business segments. The market has been paying attention, as the stock has underperformed its major peers in the past five years.Salesforce vs. Peers: YChartsIn fairness, Salesforce critics have valid points. On valuation, Salesforce is currently valued at more than $150 billion, which is a pricey number for a company that brought just $17.1 billion in fiscal 2020. This valuation gives the company a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 53x, which is above the S&P 500 average ratio of about 22x.On competition, it competes with big companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) and some smaller companies like Zendesk (ZEN), HubSpot (HUBS), and Zoho. On acquisitions, Salesforce has been a serial acquirer. In 2019 alone, it spent almost $20 billion to acquire nine companies, including Tableau and ClickSoftware. I am always afraid of companies that rely on acquisitions for growth, because it usually brings concerns about their core offerings. In this report, I will explain why I bought CRM stock during the current pullback.Salesforce continued its track record of earnings and revenue beat in the fourth quarter. Revenue grew by 34% to $4.85 billion, while earnings per share came in at 66 cents. This revenue growth was mostly because of the company’s acquisition of Tableau. Without Tableau, CRM grew its revenue by a modest 22%. This growth was driven by a 14% growth of Sales Cloud, 22%% growth of Service Cloud, Platform and other grew by 30%, while marketing and commerce cloud grew by 28%. This growth excludes that of acquisitions like Salesforce.org, ClickSoftware, MuleSoft, and Tableau. These numbers show that Salesforce has a modest growth rate, which is a good thing for a company that recently turned 20.In fiscal 2020, Salesforce generated annual revenue of $17.1 billion. This is a great number for a company that had annual revenue of less than $2 billion ten years ago. According to management, it now expects to grow its revenue to more than $21.1 billion this year and between $34 billion and $35 billion in 2024. This projection is highly achievable, since CRM’s management has a proven record of beating guidance. According to analysts, even if the current growth rate slows, the company will have annual revenue of more than $77 billion in 2030.(Source: Seeking Alpha)Salesforce, under the leadership of Benioff, has been on a reinvention journey since its early days. The company was started with inspiration from Amazon (AMZN), which was selling physical products through the internet. Marc believed that software too could be delivered through the internet by an easy and less expensive process. When it IPOed in 2004, CRM had about 8,000 subscribing customers. Today, the number has grown to more than 150k global customers.The Salesforce that was started 20 years ago is very different from the company we know today. The original company provided basic customer relations services to customers. Today, through internal R&D and acquisitions, it has created an invaluable platform for companies of all sizes.Salesforce has used a very simple model to achieve this growth. The first customers that come to CRM come for its customer relations services. The company then upsells other services to these customers. As it achieves this, it creates a moat that is very difficult to penetrate. For example, Salesforce is the number one CRM company in the world. It is also the number one company in customer service applications, marketing campaign management, and sales force productivity and management.There is no doubt that Salesforce tends to overpay on most of the companies it acquires. Still, criticizing it for this is short-sighted because of the value some of these companies bring. A good example of this is its ExactTarget acquisition in 2013. Salesforce paid $2.5 billion for this company, which was criticized as too expensive. Today, Pardot is an indispensable part of the company’s marketing cloud.Salesforce also paid a hefty valuation for Tableau. However, looking back, the acquisition helped diversify the company’s income by venturing into analytics and business intelligence services. Business intelligence itself is a big industry that is expected to reach $147 billion in 2025. As the industry grows, Salesforce will be at the forefront due to Tableau’s market share as shown below.(Source: Qliq)Salesforce has also reinvented itself as a big player in Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is one of the biggest players in AI, an industry that is set to grow as the amount of data produced every day continue to increase. The company offers this service through its Einstein AI platform. In the latest earnings call, the company said that Einstein processes 11 billion queries every day, up from 6 billion a year ago.In short, Salesforce has continued to reinvent itself by creating a moat that makes it difficult for many upstarts to penetrate. This includes companies like HubSpot and Zendesk. As it has built this moat, the company has made it difficult for existing customers to move to these other competitors. Indeed, I believe that most small startups start their journey using simple CRM products like HUBS and then slowly transition to CRM, which offers more and better services. This is also probably the reason why CRM is continuing to grow its market share in its core business, while companies like Microsoft and Oracle stagnate.Even with all the acquisitions, Salesforce is still in a solid financial position. It has more than $7.9 billion in cash and short-term investments, and its long-term debt has risen to just $2.7 billion. In its balance sheet, the company has shareholders’ equity of about $33.8 billion.There are two good things you see when you look at the company’s financial documents. First, Salesforce is an excellent cash flow machine. The company’s free cash flow grew by 29% to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter. It grew by 32% to $3.7 billion in the financial year. As with all SAAS companies, CRM's FCF is easy to predict because of the subscription model and the insignificant amount of churn.Second, the company’s gross margin has started to rise. It has risen from a low of 73.22% in 2017 to 75.22% in the most recent quarter. At the same time, the latest EBITDA margin of 15.04% is higher than the 2016’s 7.2%. Part of the reason the company has relatively low EBITDA and operating margin is that is has invested a lot in growth and marketing. For example, Salesforce spends about 45% of its total revenue in sales and marketing. This is significantly higher than the 29% and 14% that Adobe (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT) spends on sales and marketing respectively. Therefore, I believe that Salesforce is in good shape to increase its EBITDA and FCF by slowly reducing its marketing spending without affecting its market share. In future, I see a situation where the company is able to bring its EBITDA margin to more than 30% in line with its major peers.Salesforce has underperformed its close peers like Microsoft and Adobe in the past few years. The company has been criticized for its overreliance on acquisitions to boost its growth. Most value investors also believe that it is highly overvalued. However, there are several good things as I have explained above. Salesforce still has an annual organic growth of more than 20%, it is a market leader that is building a moat that is difficult to penetrate, and its financial statements show a company that has more room to expand its margins. While the company is overvalued, I believe that it will continue growing in its core CRM services and in other emerging industries like business intelligence and artificial intelligence."

Its Q4 result was no different.The company delivered earnings growth of 31% and raised guidance. Adjusted for the Mulesoft acquisition, Salesforce delivered revenue growth of 23%. The company raised Q1 2021 revenue guidance to between 30-31%. The company also reinforced its guidance of a 2024 revenue forecast of $34-$35B in revenue, which would imply a doubling in revenue from the $17.1B in revenue that was delivered in 2020. Salesforce is a core holding in the Sustainable Growth Large Cap portfolio.What was quite surprising about the result was that Salesforce's Sales Cloud continued to accelerate in growth. While this is the most mature of Salesforce's product suite, Sales cloud grew at an adjusted rate of 14% annualized (excluding the acquisition of Salesforce.org) compared with a growth of 11% in Q4 in 2019. A large part of this can be attributed to lower attrition within the business. For the first time, Salesforce attrition fell below 9%, indicating 91% revenue retention.Salesforce inherently benefits from a natural stickiness. Companies are loath to bring any system change or disruption to their sales people, unless they want major flow on impacts to revenue. IT teams are hesitant to recommend changeover to new systems even for systems that may be cheaper, because the retraining involved to learn a new system and potential data loss in a changeover are incredibly disruptive to a salesforce. Time training on a new system is time away from selling and that hurts revenue. This naturally reflects in a strong retention of existing customers.What Salesforce has more recently realized is that by playing a role in all of the ancillary processes around a sales transaction that they can not only increase revenue, but also do a better job with customer retention as well. Managing sales operations cases of delayed product shipments or customer call resolution need to be tracked and managed. There are also a different set of activities like running and managing marketing campaigns to move prospects through the funnel, from an initial lead through to a qualified lead to ultimately acquiring a customer. Customers benefit from having all of these tasks managed within a single instance which can be managed across all teams. These are now all value added functions that Salesforce has increasingly been playing a role in.Salesforce doubly benefits in being able to target these capabilities. Not only do the introduction of Service Cloud (helps a company manage support cases and trouble tickets) and Marketing Cloud (deals with digital campaign management and user targeting) help generate additional revenue for the business, but they also greatly help in increasing retention. Having additional users in a company trained and operational on Salesforce helps increase the retraining hurdle across many users, and also makes it less likely that a business will replace Salesforce and move to a competitive offering.Additionally, Salesforce will benefit from incremental operating margin improvements. By having existing customers increase spend with Salesforce, on various products, sales productivity increases, and Salesforce margins will additionally show improvement over time. The current quarter provided evidence that this strategy is working. Service Cloud showed revenue growth of 22% with Marketing Cloud growing 24%. Both are handily outpacing the growth in the core Sales Cloud now. Non GAAP operating margins have been benefiting from this 'land and expand strategy'. Over the last 5 years, operating margins have expanded almost 700 bps, with net margins increasing almost 1300 bps. For Salesforce, there is a large runway of opportunity to capitalize on these multiple market segments, with the combined market opportunity of nearly $140B.Source: Salesforce Investor Presentation, 2018Salesforce recently announced the acquisition of Vlocity, a provider of industry specific clouds, for approximately $1.3B. The market for industry specific cloud functionality is a significant one, as Veeva Systems (VEEV) has established in becoming a $22B business. What is interesting about the Vlocity acquisition is that it takes Salesforce from being a horizontal platform provider to one that is now more aggressively positioned to compete in specific verticals. Vlocity services Telecom, Media, Energy Healthcare, Insurance and Government. I see this as a very sensible acquisition for Salesforce. The needs of certain industries that are heavily regulated or which have industry nuances are quite specific as far as managing sales funnel and lead generation. Through the acquisition of Vlocity, Salesforce goes some way to meeting this need. While perhaps not having quite the depth in its offering that Veeva does for LifeSciences, Salesforce may now be able to meet more of the industry customization requirements which should allow it to expand further. Communications and media in particular have been areas of strength for Vlocity, so it won't be a surprise to see Salesforce make further inroads here.Salesforce also announced that Keith Block, who has been Co-CEO of Salesforce, would be departing the company and would be replaced by Gavin Patterson. I don't view the leadership change as impacting the business in any meaningful way. While Block has had lengthy tenure at Salesforce and was a very steady hand and strong on execution and Patterson very new to the organization, it's clear that Salesforce has been and will continue to be shepherded by Marc Benioff, who provides overall vision and strategic direction for the business.Salesforce continues to report strong growth and there is continuing evidence at play that its strategy of targeting adjacent segments and expanding there is paying significant dividends. Vlocity will be a good complement to the Salesforce strategy and will now take the business deeper into certain vertical segments. It will be interesting to see how that opens up Salesforce to new growth opportunities. Salesforce remains reasonably valued relative to historic valuation. A pullback on general coronavirus concerns may provide an opportunity for new investment."

Along with an outstanding quarterly result announcement, the company delivered two significant news items. First, Salesforce is acquiring Vlocity for $1.3 Billion. Salesforce also announced that its co-CEO Keith Block was stepping down from his position. Marc Benioff is back to being the sole CEO of the company.The big news of the week was Salesforce's announcement to acquire Vlocity for an estimated $1.33 billion. Last year, I had mentioned how Salesforce could benefit from the acquisition. Vlocity was set up in 2014 by former Siebel and Veeva Systems co-founders and experts Craig Ramsey, David Schmaier, James Ramsey, Mark Armenante, and Young Sohn. Vlocity was focused on the principles that best customer experiences are industry-specific and omni-channel. While Salesforce took care of the omni-channel segment of this requirement, Vlocity focused on catering to the industry-specific segment.As part of this focus, Vlocity developed vertical-specific solutions that embedded digital, omni-channel processes for customer-centric industries. It built on Salesforce.com's Force platform to build industry-specific solutions for the Communications & Media, Energy & Utilities, Health, Insurance and Financial Services, and Government and Non-profit sectors.Vlocity has been privately held so far and raised $163 million in four funding rounds from investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, Accenture, Salesforce Ventures, New York Life Investment Management, Sutter Hill Ventures, TDF Ventures, Wildcat Venture Partners, and Kennet Partners. Its last round of funding was held last year, when it raised $60 million at a valuation of over $1 billion. Vlocity does not disclose its financials. Analysts estimate that it was trending at annual revenues of $160-$170 million for the year ending January 2020.Salesforce believes that Vlocity's verticalized offerings will help it double its TAM. In my view, Vlocity's acquisition will help Salesforce deliver on a vertical-focused strategy. Salesforce has taken steps in that direction earlier when it aligned its senior management and sales strategies towards verticals.But the acquisition is also a living example of why I am so excited about the PaaS model. Like Vlocity, other platform companies can benefit from opening their cloud-based platforms to developer networks worldwide. Salesforce's PaaS has allowed companies like Vlocity to develop industry-specific solutions. Its AppExchange Marketplace has empowered them to attract customers within these industries and to build sustainable businesses that translate to billion-dollar valuations and exits.Veeva (NYSE:VEEV), now a multibillion-dollar public company is a case in point. Vlocity, in many ways, is a perfect acquisition for Salesforce - easy to integrate because it is built on the Salesforce technology, and perfectly aligned business-wise.Over the past few years, Salesforce has made some big acquisitions in the industry. It acquired Mulesoft in 2018 for an estimated $6.5 billion and followed it up with the $15.7 billion acquisition of Tableau last year. It appears to have started the new year with a promising acquisition, as it hurtles forward to achieve its goal of $20 billion in annual revenues.Salesforce's Q4 revenues grew 35% to $4.85 billion, above analyst projection of $4.75 billion. Adjusted earnings was $0.66 per share compared with $0.70 per share, but significantly ahead of the Street's forecast of $0.56.By segment, Subscription and support revenues grew 35% to $4.56 billion. Professional services and other revenues grew 26% to $288 million.Sales Cloud revenues grew 17% to $1.23 billion. Revenues from Service Cloud improved 26% to $1.22 billion. Marketing & Commerce Cloud revenues grew 28% to $690 million, and Salesforce Platform and Other revenues improved 74% to $1.43 billion.Among key metrics, its current remaining performance obligations (CRPO) bookings grew 26% to $15 billion, ahead of the market's forecast of 21% growth to $14.41 billion. CRPO bookings include deferred revenue and order backlog.Salesforce ended the year with revenues growing 29% to $17.1 billion. Subscription and support revenues for the year grew 29% to $16 billion and Professional services revenues grew 21% to $1.1 billion. Non-GAAP earnings was $0.39 per share.For the first quarter, Salesforce expects revenues of $4.875-$4.885 billion with adjusted earnings of $0.70-$0.71 per share. The market was looking for revenues of $4.84 billion with an EPS of $0.70 for the first quarter. Salesforce expects to end 2020 with revenues of $21-$21.1 billion and an EPS of $3.16-$3.18. The market was looking for revenues of $20.91 billion for the year with an EPS of $3.10.The market is still digesting the news of the leadership change at Salesforce. Block was instrumental in delivering the skyrocketing growth that Salesforce has seen in the past, and his exit was a surprise. However, there is no question that the genius behind the company's extraordinary performance is Benioff, the founder.Its stock is trading at $172.15 with a market capitalization of $158.7 billion. The stock fell 3% in the after-hours trading session in reaction to the announcement. It had touched a record high of $195.72 earlier this month. The stock hit a 52-week low of $137.87 in July last year. Of course, built into the stock price currently is the whole Coronavirus externality, so it would be unfair to attribute the gyrations entirely to business-related announcements.Photo Credit: nathanmac87/Flickr.com.Original postEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

Steve, welcome back to the podcast.Steve Wells: Thank you very much. Good afternoon.NB: Good to have you back. So, we recorded the last one of these in July, and you were at that time a little bit contrarian. In fact, you said that the headline of the story, the article that we put out accompanying the podcast was Fear & Greed Trader sees little to fear in today's market. This was dated July 1, 2019, and you had some calls here that were interesting that turned out to be quite prescient on the Alibaba (BABA), CVS (CVS), Amazon (AMZN), and some others, but the point is back then you said that you were not lightening up on your exposure which was counter to what a lot of other people who were doing at the time. So, with that in mind, maybe you can catch our readers up in the last – what you’ve done over the last six months, and more importantly, tell us what your views are on today's market.SW: Sure. That turned out to be a pretty decent call. What – my focus at that time and as the year was going by, my focus at that time was – and my thoughts and my impression was the entire trade tariff weatherwas way overstated. I never believed it was going to get to the point that many analysts/pundits were making it out to be. And so, that’s why I really did not see it coming as a big issue in the markets in 2019.In fact, if you look back, the largest drawdown we had in 2019 was 7%. That’s going to surprise a lot of people because all we heard during 2019 was, Jeez! What a difficult environment it is; and Boy!, those tariffs could really hurt and upset the global economy. Having said that, as the year went on, I thought we saw a pretty – you know [indiscernible] event take place in October 2019. There again, the fear rhetoric had ramped up pretty good. It was all of course based on tariffs, but the market really did not react to what the pundits were really saying in regard to a market drop off.In fact, pull back was contained to again less than that 7%; I believe it was 5% back in October. And then, an important technical change took place, and that the market had broke out from a level that it had been contained since the beginning of 2019. That break out turned out to be very significant. From the end of it, the market rallied 17% into 2020 with no more than a 3% pullback. In fact, I believe that's part of the issue we’re faced with today and why we’re seeing really the route that’s going on now.Sure, this coronavirus issue is out there, and I guess we could spend the entire afternoon talking about those issues and what could or could not develop, but in general terms, the – our market had just been basically on a very, very strong rally, no pull backs, and really any event that would come along if you think about it in common sense terms is going to upset that apple cart and corona is a real event, don't get me wrong, it’s a real event, and now we’re seeing that apple cart upset pretty good.We’re right now down looking at the screen today and counting yesterday. We’re down about 5%. Now, here again, my focus is a macro view, so I'm not really getting too panicky over this. I'm not getting overly concerned because the macro trends are still in place. Will they be questioned? Will they be tested? More than likely there’s a good possibility of that now, but at 5% they’re not – they are no way near being tested at this point in time, and I think we have to keep that in mind.NB: Sure. Okay, now walk us back here really quick. Fear & Greed Trader, as the name suggests, you look for elements of fear and greed in the market psychology, and to do that you have a bunch of trendlines that you follow, so maybe you can just tell us about that real quick, especially for the readers that might not – I’m sorry listeners that may not have heard the last podcast, and then give us the view of where your – what the trendlines are telling you right now?SW: Okay. The very long-term bullish primary trend is very much intact. Again, with a falling of 5% pullback from the highs, that’s kind of easy to ascertain. Right now, it’s just probably great time, you know, to talk about this stuff. The – every short-term trendline, say a 20-day moving average or a 50-day moving average if investors are familiar with that terminology on a technical front, they have been broken. So, we’ve broken down on the short-term basis, not unusually after you’ve had a 16%, 17% rally.Now, we start looking at support levels. Now, we take them one step at a time, and in doing all of this, the – what I try to impress on people is keep the macro trend and the macro view at the forefront of your mind. Once you allow the short-term trendline’s rhetoric fear take over that breeds emotion, you’re going to be then caught up and exactly what we’re seeing happening in the market today and yesterday, and that is making premature decisions which you could regret.We’ve seen that happen in the past. It’s difficult, it’s not easy. Emotion is very strong – it’s part of human nature and it’s very strong, and it will make us do things we really, you know, should not be doing when it comes to investing. Again, it could be more now as an investor. Certainly, traders have a whole different mindset when it comes to these short-term moving averages.And that basically is what sparks some of these moves, and they can actually make those moves stronger and just, you know, and continuing over time; and in essence, it would just feed on itself. The short-term views will just continue to feed on itself, and we’re seeing that happen today as I’m speaking. The market – the Dow is now down 800 points.NB: Right.SW: I think it was down 600.NB: Yes.SW: So that’s just an indication of what goes on. You’ve got to keep that macro view from 30,000 feet, as I would like to call it, in the forefront of your mind.NB: Okay. So, bottom line is macro view is still positive, still constructive, still speaks to this being a risk-on type of world, especially as it concerns shares of companies’ stocks, is that right?SW: That's correct. That's correct. And I want to also stress because it’s come up now at a different point in time, I don't profess a buy-and-hold strategy, and certainly a buy-and-hold strategy has its place for many investors, but – and we get into all different categories, of course we could spend the rest of day talking about that, but the bottom line is buy-and-hold does have its place.What I am professing is more of a primary trend following strategy. So, in that sense in simplistic terms, I will follow the primary bullish trend which has been in place, it's been tested, it’s passed every test so far. And as long as that primary bullish trend remains in place, then I will stay with the risk-on mentality. Having said that, we also know there are times when I would also like to say we play hard and then there’s sometimes we don't play so hard, meaning it is not diving in at every little 2% or 3% dip, you’re ascertaining, you’re reassessing of course your own personal situation comes into play also. That’s the key in the crux of what I'm trying to put forth as far as my strategy goes.NB: Okay. What kind of a level would you look at from a technical standpoint for this to change?SW: Okay. Let me just pull up a quick little chart if you don’t mind, give me a second. Right now, what I use in my strategy from a technical perspective, the 20-month moving average of the S&P 500.NB: Okay.SW: Now the – as you can imagine for investors that have any little bit of technical knowledge, that’s a long duration of time. You’re looking at each slice of time on a monthly basis, not a daily basis. And so, for instance, right now, if I look at that, the primary bullish trend would not come into question until about 2940, 2950. We’re right now at 3140. We’ve come a long way down. Now, trust me, just like we’ve seen in the past, at 3140 as I sit here looking at the screen right now, I believe that’s kind of where we are anyway, since you’re looking at that screen right now, we’ve already come down say 5%.NB: Yes.SW: If youhave another 200 points today, and you’re going to have pandemonium, and you’re going to have all sorts of people questioning what's going on and making really, really rash decisions, I – in my way of looking at things before that primary trend is broken, so you’ve got to have patience. This is also – it’s going to test your patience; it’s going to test your will; it’s going to test your convictions, and that’s – so keep in mind, and that’s what I have done. I kept investors invested in the market in December 2018 when that was tested. It actually broke below, but then rebounded right back.NB: Okay. Yes, 2900 on the S&P to give you an idea, the last time we were there was early October. I believe October 8, and it's now, as you said 3140 or whatever. So, that would be – to get back to 2900 that would be about 7%, 8% another drop of that much?SW: Right. And actually – yes, I’m glad you brought that up because that – then if you - let’s just say simple math, so now you add that 8% to save the 5% or 6% that were down in the last couple of days. That’s 14%.NB: Right.SW: Well, you’re in correction mode, but you’re not in bear market mode.NB: Right. But if you get another 6% on top of that, then you’re in bear market, but yes…SW: Yes, it’s correct. That’s correct. Alright, so – and again, this is where the will of investors is always tested. As I sit here today, I don't believe we’re going to get to actually test the 20-month moving average. I’d be [Indiscernible] that’s just a gut feeling, and I guess at this point and that’s all it is, and I say that because getting us to this level, we’ve seen some very, very important, strong technical signals that came out in the latter part of 2019 that in my view just don't go away overnight, overnight meaning, you know a few months or even yes, a year. Again, now the wildcard is the virus.NB: Right.SW: Unless the wildcard, this virus remains in the headlines going out another two, three months, and we can’t get this situation under control or it looks like it's not getting under control. That truly adds a wildcard to the picture, and of course, that’s why we assess the situation taking it day-by-day, week-by-week, and not guessing and speculating as to what might happen, good or bad.NB: Okay. We touched on it, coronavirus, CV-19 or something COVID-19 I believe is the clinical name. The point is this is something that neither of us professed to completely understand neither of us being medical professionals. Nevertheless, there is of course, we’ve seen how this virus has expanded into all parts – different parts of the world and just recently this – today this afternoon as we record this on February 25th, I believe that the U.S. made an announcement that they would be expecting to be more cases of the coronavirus here in the U.S.So, it doesn’t look like this is going away. The bigger question is, how bad will it be, and more importantly, how – what will – what type of an impact will this have on the global economy? The economic analysis that I’ve had so far all says that things should pick up again pretty quickly that demand – the demand pictures is okay, and then, once things stabilize, the economy will continue to hum again, but what are your views on this? And what type of concerns do you have over the big picture and over some of these fears that we’ve seen having a bit of a more permanent effect where the economy is concerned?SW: Okay, right now based on what we know, I think you’ve summarized it pretty well. I am in that same camp in the sense that we – the global economy was starting to show some green shoots. Manufacturing had started to bottom. We got some signals from not only the U.S. market, but the euro zone. The stock’s 600; the DAX, they were also rallying to new record highs. The market was telling us that things had bottomed, and that the next change was going to be positive. Of course, along comes coronavirus and now that throws somewhat of a [indiscernible] those theories.As it just laid out to the members of my service, my view today is that this potential growth picked up in the economies around the world and our earnings picture here in the United States will be deferred now, but not destroyed, and that’s the premise I’m going with right now. How long it is deferred, of course, there again, we don’t know because as you mentioned, we’re not medical experts. I take some solace in the fact that it appears and it's early yet that China has at least stabilized the number of cases that seem to have plateaued. I think it will be a good sign if they start to slowly get back to work over there and we don't get another uptick in cases.And I think if that does happen and that’s an if, and it’s a speculation, if that happens then I think that will also occur in the countries that have just picked up some cases. I believe it’s safe to say that. And so, therefore from an optimistic point of view, we get through this quarter we should – we maybe stumble into the second quarter, but again, things are deferred and not destroyed. If that changes tomorrow and the Chinese folks get back to work and all of a sudden cases ramp up because they’re now opening up the economy a little bit more, whole different scenario. And I think the market – you have to look to the market too, and the market is kind of giving us initial single. There’s an issue right now, but I – there's also other signs that we have to look at, at the market. Now, the sign a lot of people want to use is the 10-year treasury. It’s traded at 1.31% today. People say that’s the fear gauge. That’s – everyone is the flight to safety, and of course, that's true, but right now, I also look at high-yield credit spreads.SW: They’re not blowing out. If you compare high-yield credit spreads today to what we saw in 2016, when we had the global recession talk everywhere, December 2018, when we also had the scare and the big market drop, we are nowhere near those levels, not even close. Can that change in a few days? Absolutely, but that’s something right now that tells me keep the fear level subdue to some degree in my own mind as well. You know, you’ve got to talk to yourself too, and then, kind of, you know, try and put all the facts together before you let emotion just run amok. And so, those are the things that I’m going to be concentrating on as this thing progresses.We have to remember that, you know the job of the CDC and all the health organizations – that’s their job to keep everybody on edge and keep them advised of what’s going on. So that rhetoric isn’t going to help, but I understand that’s their job. And so, that’s going to add something to the narrative when we look at how the price action unfolds, but I’ll be watching the key levels, especially the long-term primary trend levels, and then, I'll do little science that may come along to warrant us getting possibly looking for – to make a change.NB: Fair enough, okay. Alright, with that in mind, are there any particular sectors that you are bullish where you might be looking to add to your position or initiate new positions now?SW: Yes. I – again, I don't see this situation extending too far into 2019. And with that said, I’m still bullish on technology, healthcare, consumer discretionary and to some degree financials and I'll tell you why. Take healthcare and technology, yes, they’ve had big runs and people are starting to get nervous about the growth and they’ve already started to come down. So, this is also a nice little [mean reversion] move we’ve had here to levels where they’re looking like they could be started to be picked up again and bought. In a low growth environment, forget about coronavirus, we were growing at 2% anyway, but we’ve been growing in that level.So, even if you toss out coronavirus, in a low growth environment, people are going to search for growth, and the growth in earnings has all been technology and healthcare, and I don't see that changing anytime overnight. And so, once we get through this panic mode, I think when the dust settles, people are going to get back into those stocks, same thing with consumer discretionary. I bring up financials because we just had a technical breakout on the XLF, which is the financial SPDR ETF that attracts the major banks here in the U.S., and we had a breakout now with this recent pullback, we’re not so sure that breakout was real.If it does turn out to be real, if we turn this around real quickly, that’s going to bode very well because that breakout was from a range that cap the XLF going all the way back to 2007. So, a breakout like that is a huge signal. And so, I am adding those in, especially as they sort to come down. But my focus is on technology and healthcare, and again, to some degree consumer discretionary. I will remain with a stock like Alibaba; I will remain with a stock like Amazon. In fact, I’ve just picked up some Amazon in this latest dip. It’s an overweight position for me. Again, fundamentally, they’re strong after their last quarter, but more importantly, the stock broke out on a technical basis, and I think that bodes well for more highs down the road.I look at a healthcare stock like AbbVie, its symbol ABBV, 5% yield. They’ve raised guidance four of the last five quarters, and once again, their stock has broken out. It’s now dropped back to just about that breakout level. To me, that’s a very, very strong signal and a strong buy. Our goal with a stock like Blackstone grew in the financial sector, excellent up trend as they just last year reclassified themselves as a C-corporation, which opens the door now for funds and ETFs to get involved with them; 3.1% yield; sells at below market value. I’m looking at CVS, a stock I believe I had in July also. That [indiscernible] nicely; made new highs; is now pulled back and is in a buy range today.Have they hit the bottom? Can it drop a little more? Any of these that I just mentioned in this fear [market] we have today, the answer would be yes, but if someone has a long-term view, these are the times when you could start to nibble at some of these stocks now. And then, the last one I had – well, I actually have two more, Fidelity National Info Services (FIS), a services technology company offering wealth management services, government payment solutions, and they just bought a company called Worldpay in 2019, and that I think opens the door for them to have very, very good growth in 2020. The technical charts on all of these companies is very, very good.And last but not least, the company I'm waiting to come back in a little bit more, salesforce.com. The company is CRM. They spent all of last year consolidating a huge move in 2018. They just broke out, and now they're going to come back and start I guess to test that breakout level. So, unless we now all of a sudden turn ourselves into a total bear market scenario, I believe all of these stocks are worth looking into. And finally, I do have one more, if someone is a little bit nervous and they want to get into gold, Newmont Mining, a gold stock, again, has a long-term consolidation pattern that goes back quite a few years and gold and Newmont Mining just broke out of that trading range. So, there is a lot of individual stocks that have given off signals that say we’re not done here. It’s going to take this event turning really, really bad and/or something else coming along that’s also a big negative, in my view, to turn this into a bear market scenario.NB: Yes. Gold has been on a massive run. Interestingly today, and I don’t know about yesterday, but Newmont Mining is also down today although a fraction of what the broader market is. It’s down $0.40 or – which is less than 1% today and I don’t know what it did – yesterday, I think it was…SW: It actually was up yesterday.NB: And so, yes, so there you go.SW: Yes. You know that’s something that I can just punch that up right now, but that's something that I may take a look at on any kind of a small pullback because I do believe we've got to run, it is not just 49 and change now.NB: Yes.SW: If this breakout is real, I kind of think it might be, that stock could easily run at 60. So, you got a nice little trade there I think. I’m not into it yet, that's the only one I don't have. Full disclosure, I own all of the stocks I mentioned with the exception of Newmont Mining, but I’m looking to possibly get involved in that one.NB: Okay. And then, CRM, Salesforce, I mean this is a stock that was at the start of the year – it ended the year at 162 and it peaked out – in just a month and I guess, yes, a month and 19 days. On February 19, it was at 192 so that's – well, I can’t do the percentage, but that’s like what? It that 20%, I don’t know it’s a huge jump in just one month.SW: Yes, 30 points on a 160, so what does average, yes, it’s close to that.NB: Yes, so that's a massive jump. Now it's come back down since then, I mean the peak was 52-week high was 195.72 it's now 179.50 as we speak here on Tuesday afternoon.SW: Correct.NB: That’s still well above the levels from January and December, so at what point would you be looking to add more into that?SW: Ideally, and actually I’d see where the break out took place. You’re exactly right, it took place around let’s say [indiscernible] 165, 167 that’s where the breakout took place early January. Ideally, if we are going to get a full retracement, which we could in this type of market, I’d be looking to be a buyer right around the 170 level. You could [indiscernible]. In fact, if you're aggressive and if you are much younger investor with a long timeframe at your disposal, you can look to add – you could sort of start to add and nibble right here.Someone like myself, I’m going to tread more cautious. I’m going to try and maybe wait, and again, you know, 5, 6 points, and there again, if I decide to turn myself into a market timeline, Nat, I may lose the opportunity. It could stop right here and just keep running, you know. In fact I missed the opportunity and I don’t know what I would've done for what I’ve sold some of at that 192. When that stock broke out at 160 to 170, I was kind of lows to buy it at like 172, 173 and like you said, it ran to 192. So, this is kind of my pull back.NB: Okay. And lastly, Baba, Alibaba, which back in – I remember you called this when we recorded the last podcast, it was trading in the 160s.SW: Yes.NB: And you said at the time that it was $200 or $220 stock and I think I laughed at you. No, I didn’t. I wouldn't do that, but it sure enough went up to – it went up to $231.SW: But many people did, yes I know, many people did.NB: Yes. It went up to – all the way up to $231 and it’s since come back, but there too it’s still above $200. So, you're not taking any profits of the table there yet?SW: I did not. I probably should have taken some off at $225, $230. I did write some calls against it. That’s a minor – you know that will give me a little bit of protection and a little bit of income. Looking back, of course, it’s easy now at looking back.NB: Sure.SW: It’s always easy, but now I’m happy with the position. It’s not consolidating that move. So now, I’m looking at – like you said, it’s like $205 today, I do believe once we get into a consolidation pattern, trying to get back, you know, trying our levels off, their economy levels off, the stock is at $250, $260 stock in my opinion. So, basically from here, you’ve got a good 25%, 30% move left. And so that's why I’ve held on. It’s a long-term position for me. It has been a long-term position for me, and it’s an overweight position for me.NB: Very good. Okay, that gave us a lot to work with.

Shareholders should consider sidestepping this investment.","Salesforce (CRM) remains a very troublesome investment. Its frequent acquisitions are needed to support its high growth strategy, yet its guidance points to the path to 2024 growing at just 20% compounded.This hugely overvalued stock leaves its investors primed for disappointment. Shareholders should avoid this investment. Here's why:The most important game in town: Salesforce raises guidance full year 2021 guidance to $21.1 Billion.Source: author's calculationsNonetheless, despite the announcement making the very first bullet point of its highly anticipated press statement, we are left with the unavoidable fact that Salesforce's revenue growth rate is pointed towards a marked deceleration.Bulls contend that Salesforce will continue to raise guidance as the year progresses and that it will fill the airways full of positive surprises.However, that's exactly what everyone else is hoping for too! And the reality is that when investors price in 'hope', investors are ultimately priming themselves for disappointment and a loss of capital.Believe that I'm being overly bearish? Consider this, Salesforce reiterates its 2024 (fiscal 2025) revenue target to reach at the top end of the range $35 billion.This implies that between growing at 23% in fiscal 2021, it will decelerate on the approach into 2024 so that Salesforce posts a double over four years.Put another way, Salesforce is likely to continue growing with a compounded annual growth rate of 20%. How does this compare with the graph above? There will be a clear path of revenue growth deceleration.This will be particularly noticeable as Salesforce reaches the final two years of this four-year guidance since it is starting off this journey growing at 23% and is guided to average 20%, thus this must mean that towards the latter part of this journey Salesforce is envisioning growing its revenues at less than 20%.We now get into the highly contentious argument: it depends on what we refer to strong cash flow?Does strong cash flow mean cash flow before:Then, sure, Salesforce, in that case, does indeed make strong cash flow.Moving on, Salesforce acquires Vlocity for $1.33 billion in cash net of Salesforce's ownership in the company. The deal is expected to complete in Q2 2021 adding approximately $50 million in revenues to Salesforce in fiscal 2021.Further details are not given apart from Vlocity being dilutive to Salesforce's bottom line. And even without knowing how big Salesforce's ownership in the company was prior to the acquisition, its annualized run rate revenue should approximate $80 million. By my estimates, this implies that Salesforce paid very roughly 16x forward sales for Vlocity.The main issue I have with Salesforce is its obvious overvaluation.How does a rational investor value this sort of stock? At the most superficial level, it trades for 7.5x forward sales, which is not expensive whatsoever. Particularly for a SaaS company with strong visibility into its revenue stream -- Salesforce has 93% of its revenue from recurring sources.However, once we get beyond its top-line 'high growth' narrative, as soon as we step down from this revenue growth spiel, its level of overvalued becomes further apparent.For example, Salesforce GAAP EPS for fiscal 2020 finished at $0.15, down from $1.43 in fiscal 2019. Then, looking ahead its guidance points to fiscal 2021 finishing with GAAP EPS of $0.14.Shareholders positively declare that investors should value Salesforce off its guided non-GAAP EPS figures which include its mark-to-market accounting for its strategic investments. Hence, in that case, Salesforce guides for non-GAAP EPS of $3.18 for fiscal 2021, put its stock trading at 53x forward earnings.On the other hand, a positive aspect that surfaced during the earnings call was that Q4 2020 marked the lowest revenue attrition in Salesforce's history, at less than 9%. This low-level attrition is being driven by Salesforce's mix of customers shifting towards enterprises.Salesforce is an incredibly challenging investment to find any sort of edge that is not already being priced in by overly bullish shareholders.With decelerating growth rates, expensive and frequent acquisitions, and an overvalued stock, investors are best to take profits now and sidestep this investment."

Any opinions or probabilities expressed in this report are those of the author as of the article date of publication and are subject to change without notice.We've covered Salesforce (CRM) extensively on Seeking Alpha - you can find our notes on the company here. This is a very compelling long-run growth story, a successful growth equity play despite its $153bn enterprise value.Fans of the stock like the cloud focus (they almost but not quite invented it), the growth and the recurring nature of the revenue.Denigrators, and there are many, cite the notion that the company acquires all its growth by raising debt to pay for overpriced acquisitions, and that it just pays the bills with stock awards not cash. And therefore that it doesn't really generate much cash at all, and therefore it's not a good business.This is not true.It generates plenty of cash, is growing revenue at 29% per annum - despite having revenue of over $17bn now! - and has over $5bn of net cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet despite raising that all that acquisition debt for all those overpriced acquisitions.Let's dispel the Salesforce ""it's all smoke and mirrors"" myth by taking a look at the numbers.First up, the income statement for the last five years.Big, sustained revenue growth over a long period of time on top of already-sizeable revenues. Share count up for sure - that's all the stock-based incentive payments and those acquisitions.Now let's look at the cashflow statement.Big lumps of cash added to the balance sheet every year. $1.5bn this year alone. After the company paid down $500m of acquisition debt.Finally, the balance sheet.Net cash every year for the last three years, despite a series of very material acquisitions.And look at the ""deferred revenue"" line - that's a liability item in the balance sheet. It represents ""software services that we owe to customers in exchange for the money they have paid us upfront"" (which is a cash asset on the balance sheet). Deferred revenue tells you whether long run revenue growth is intact. Here you have +24% growth in deferred revenue in FY20, which is less than the +29% growth in recognized revenue, but it remains a very strong rate of growth which bodes well for the future.So - high growth revenue, generating a lot of cash, keeping that cash in a growing pile on the balance sheet. What's not to like?Oh yes - stock based comp.Well, there's some truth to that, as we've noted before. Stock enters a long downward cycle, people start to walk away. But here's the benefit of paying folks in stock not cash. It means that your cashflow beats your profit by quite some margin. Which means your profit is very high quality.Here's a chart of cumulative net income (profit) vs cash, over a long period.Good, right? At the time of writing, CRM sits here:Were it not for the current market correction, accelerated but in truth not entirely caused by Coronavirus, we would be at Buy on this stock right now. We'd be saying that it could compound value at 20% p.a. based on revenue growth and cash generation.But in the current environment, we think sit back for a moment and see where the market settles. There may be a better point to open a new position or to add to an existing position.So for now we are at Neutral. But as we have previously noted, CRM has been a particularly good stock to buy during times like this. And we suspect this time around is no different.

4321265,104412,2020-02-04T13:22:35-05:00,"Cloud software and platforms are evolving and Salesforce must also if the company is to take more of the addressable market.Valuations are high for a cloud company of Salesforce's tenure. The company will need to do more than pursue acquisitions to earn these valuations.Salesforce recently broke $186 and could see more upward movement for now. Long term, Salesforce will need to look at its product road map more closely to grow.","Last month, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) lowered its guidance on EPS from a Q4 consensus of $0.61 down to $0.54-$0.55. Although the company beat on revenue, the growth is slowing from 28% in FY 2020 to an estimated 23.5% in FY 2021 on estimates of $20.9 billion in annual revenue.Slowing growth and lowered EPS guidance could become the new norm if the company does not diversify its software-as-a-service strategy to meet the on-premise needs of high-spending enterprise companies.The question Salesforce must answer, especially in the aftermath of large acquisitions, is if the company can reinvent itself to capture more of the addressable market — or, will the company continue to enhance its current software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) cloud offerings for future growth?The latter may not be enough to stave off competitors as cloud software and platforms evolve to meet the needs of on-premise enterprises.Previously, Salesforce has demonstrated a singular focus on cloud. Similar to an over-developed muscle, this may become its weakness. According to the 2019 State of Servers survey by Spiceworks of more than 500 IT decision makers, 98% of enterprises run on-premise server hardware.Market research firm IHS Markit reported “a growth phase” was coming for on-premise servers and hybrid strategies, with 151 North American organizations planning to double their physical servers in 2019. According to IHS, a good portion of on-premise data center capacity is going to productivity apps, collaboration tools and unified communications — which is Salesforce’s sweet spot.source: SalesforceBusiness intelligence shares many of the same functions as customer relationship management. As stated in the 2019 State of Cloud Business Intelligence, small organizations of 100 employees or less are the most enthusiastic, perennial adopters and supporters of business intelligence.Smaller companies being a main driver for cloud could be one reason we see a divergence between statistics on cloud software penetration and overall IT budgets. For instance, 83% of enterprise workloads will be in the cloud by 2020, 91% of businesses use the public cloud and 72% use a private one. However, only 30% of IT budgets were allocated to cloud computing in 2018.According to these studies, nearly half of enterprises are either using hybrid cloud computing or are using on-premise servers. Therefore, Salesforce may need to expand beyond cloud to capture the remainder of IT budgets.Examples of industries that may never rely fully on the public cloud or private cloud (and will retain some data on-premise) include the government, energy companies, gaming companies with valuable IP, healthcare companies and pharmaceuticals, and many others who have sensitive information and are held back from sending data to a vendor.The best SaaS and PaaS solutions for these companies can work across data no matter where it resides rather than forcing the data into a public or private cloud.Salesforce has been on an acquisition spree lately, yet two, in particular, stand out for the potential to diversify Salesforce’s overweight in SaaS.Tableau was acquired by Salesforce for a large price tag of $15.7 billion. The data visualization company helps non-technical people make sense of data. The company was founded in 2003, the same era as Salesforce, with a focus on desktop software, which seemed counterintuitive to the cloud-hungry tech space of the early 2000s.Tableau illustrates the importance of on-premise tools as more than two thirds of its 86,000 customer base are on-premise customers. Most certainly, this acquisition could help diversify Salesforce to serve broader customer needs.MuleSoft supplies back-end data through an API network. API networks connect applications across the cloud/software-as-a-service, on-premise software and also legacy systems. Inherently, APIs are able to collect data as they connect enterprise applications, databases, and IT infrastructure.Ideally, Salesforce makes the most of this acquisition by leveraging the on-premise software and legacy systems client base rather than forcing a cloud-only narrative.Similar to Tableau, Salesforce stock dropped 5% when the news was announced in March of 2018. Thus far, MuleSoft has contributed $451M in revenue over the past year and $181M in revenue in the most recent quarter.Over the past decade, Salesforce has been a 10-bagger and continues to exceed 20% revenue growth over the past two years. Salesforce gains seesawed for most of 2019 with little to no gains, yet the stock has risen nearly 20% over the past three weeks.Current year revenue is expected to come in at $17 billion with forward guidance for next fiscal year at $20.9 billion. EPS is expected to grow from $2.90 in fiscal year 2020 to $3.11 in fiscal year 2021.These valuations require some level of confidence in the company’s ability to grow despite a thriving cloud software market with many new software companies going public that are valued at more than $10 billion. The current PE ratio is at 196 while the forward PE ratio is at 63, which is quite high for a company that has been public for 15 years and has been profitable for over the past five years.These PE ratios are 400 higher than Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and nearly 700% higher than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Prior the lowered guidance and stock price rally in early 2019, Salesforce had a 200% higher PE ratio than Adobe.Salesforce has broken out from the $162 price range, which has been a significant zone of resistance since 2018. This move is confirmed with the internal momentum indicators breaking out, as shown by the MACD and RSI. Further strength is shown by Salesforce being well above its 50-day and 200-day SMA, as well as above the more short-term 10-day EMA.The stock needs to be further monitored to determine if this is the extent of the breakout, if this is a bull trap, or is this the real thing.If CRM can close above $186 (which it recently did), this will help solidify the thesis of a breakout and the stock will be looking up toward the $218-$220 price cluster as the next zone of resistance to watch. If Salesforce returns to the $151 support, then there could be a retesting of $135."
4319816,69905,2020-01-29T12:13:26-05:00,Salesforce is attempting to adjust shareholders expectations for its slowing revenue growth rates.Dissecting in detail Salesforce's profitability profile.This stock is overvalued and best avoided.,"Salesforce (CRM) supports its growth rate through expensive and high-risk M&A. Meanwhile, Salesforce itself attempts to adjust investors' expectations that its top-line growth rate is expected to decelerate.If at one point Salesforce was an incontestable leader in the SaaS world, today a markedly different landscape surrounds it, with a plethora of competition having recognized this promising opportunity looking to take market share.Meanwhile, its stock remains exuberantly overpriced and shareholders are primed for disappointment and better off sidestepping this investment for now. Here's why:(source)Although Q3 2019 results were red hot, with Salesforce's revenues growing by 34% year-over-year, looking further ahead the signs are pointing towards a clear deceleration.Source: Press Statement, *FY 2020 guide; ***FY 2021 guideSurely, guided FY 2020 growth rates of 28% are nothing to sneer at?True, but looking further ahead to fiscal 2021 (note: fiscal, not calendar, fiscal starts 2021 starts in roughly 80 days), expected revenue growth is guided to come in at the top end of its range at 23% - not only is this the slowest growth rate over the past several years, but it is a substantial drop from fiscal 2020.Nobody questions whether Salesforce historically was a highly rewarding stock - what we are discussing here is how the future plays out.The problem for Salesforce is that for a considerable amount of time, it was one of just a dozen companies promoting the benefits of customer relationship management as a means of enhancing interactions with customers and within the workplace. However, success attracts competition.Customers' need for marketing automation, digital commerce, and community management are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly fragmented with time.This prevents Salesforce from being a one-stop shop and selling each customer its own customized platform, as this would become prohibitively expensive and time-draining on its operation.(source)Moreover, smaller players such as Zoho CRM (private) or Infor CRM (private) are determined to take market share and would be happy to sell customers their own platforms at rock bottom prices in the hopes of retaining those customers for subsequent years. Of course, bigger players are attracted too, these include heavyweights such as Microsoft's (MSFT) Dynamics and SAP (SAP) to name a few.Further confounding shareholders' path to glory, Salesforce's lavish stock-based compensation dampens its profitability.According to its own guidance for fiscal 2020, Salesforce's GAAP EPS numbers should approximate $0.45, putting the stock trading on a P/E of +400x.Most shareholders would retort that 'rapidly growing companies are not priced on an earnings multiple' and that growth is significantly more important at this stage.The problem with this line of thinking is that Salesforce's growth rates are slowing. As Salesforce's growth starts to taper, it will be increasingly perceived as a mature company that will get priced on an earnings basis.Salesforce's cash flows are strong, there is no argument, is there?Again, I urge you to look further down the cash flow statement. For its trailing nine months of fiscal 2020, Salesforce's acquisitions totaled $339 million, while its financing obligations reached $159, and capex was $507 - hence a better figure would be its free cash flow of $1.6 billion.Lastly, I commend you to consider Salesforce's substantial stock-based compensation as 'real cash-cost' and back this number out ($1.3 billion), hence Salesforce's actual 'cleaner' free cash flow figure would approximate just $300 million for its trailing nine months of fiscal 2020.Of course, pendants might go further and question whether 'costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts' should be accounted too?Some things are clearly obvious. Most shareholders would admit that they believe at the back of their minds that maybe Salesforce is overvalued, but that they hope they'll see the signs before it's too late. And that is the same game everyone else is hoping to win at too."
4319247,103480,2020-01-27T11:10:45-05:00,"Salesforce shares have risen 35% since the beginning of 2019, despite only showing acquisition-driven revenue growth and virtually no improvement in GAAP profit metrics.Headcount has risen ~40% in the year-to-date, reflecting an empire-building mindset that thwarts efficiency and may prevent long-term profits.Salesforce has effectively ""hidden"" these expenses by massively utilizing stock-based compensation.Trading at a ~9x forward revenue multiple despite organic growth in the low 20s, Salesforce is at risk of surrendering much of its 2019 gains in a downside market scenario.Recent market sensitivity to loss-leading tech companies will push Salesforce out of favor in 2020.","Ever since the beginning of 2019, I've become quite skeptical of Salesforce.com's (CRM) fundamental story. The original cloud company, long the dominant player in the customer relationship management (NYSE:CRM) software market, has seen growth rates in its flagship product fall dramatically from its heyday, so it has turned to Oracle's (ORCL) playbook of acquiring smaller companies for growth.There's no doubt that Salesforce has a penchant for splashy M&A deals. The table below, taken from Crunchbase, showcases a small list of companies that Salesforce has acquired over the past few years. Figure 1. Salesforce recent acquisitionsSource: CrunchbaseFresh off its landmark $6.5 billion purchase of MuleSoft at a valuation multiple in the high-teens, Salesforce splurged an additional $15.7 billion to buy Tableau (DATA) in 2019, marking its entry into the BI space. And throughout the year, Salesforce's M&A team has remained incredibly busy, picking up bolt-in acquisitions here and there. My last article on Salesforce deals with the company's spending spree and how it's masking lower organic growth rates via M&A. In a nutshell, I believe that Salesforce's current ~30% revenue growth rates (helped by the inclusion of Tableau's revenue stream) is currently pumping up Salesforce's valuation. When Salesforce enters a more normalized FY21 (the year that begins in February 2020), where guided growth rates fall to 22-23% y/y (barring the very likely scenario that Salesforce buys another large company, of course), its valuation multiples will take a hit. Figure 2. Salesforce's current FY21 guidanceSource: Salesforce Q3 earnings releaseIn this article, however, I'll explore something that is of far more interest to bearish investors: Salesforce's seeming inability to ever produce meaningful GAAP profits. In my view, the market has taken an extremely defensive pivot over the past couple of months, sparked by the failure of the WeWork (WE) IPO and the subsequent fallout that led to mass layoffs across the tech sector in a re-invigorated push for profitability. Salesforce has long been a poster company for ""growth at all costs,"" having ballooned to a ~$20 billion annual revenue scale without generating meaningful profits. The recent shift in market sentiment toward these kinds of companies, in addition to declining organic growth and over-reliance on M&A, will work against Salesforce's favor in 2020.The hallmark promise of a cloud software company is that it will spend gobs of cash on sales and marketing to attract long-term clients in its early days; but as it grows larger, its expense ratio as a percentage of total revenues will decline and the company's stream of subscription revenues will eventually push it to profitability.Salesforce is, hands down, the largest pure-play cloud software company. Yet despite its ~$20 billion scale, it has continually deferred its promise of profits into the future. To frame the argument around Salesforce's declining profits, we need only look at the chart below.Figure 2. Salesforce margin trendsSource: Salesforce.com Q3 earnings deckIn Q3, Salesforce's GAAP operating margin sunk by 126bps y/y to just 1.4%. This is also one-third of the margin that Salesforce was capable of generating in 3Q18.Yet there exists a quandary here: even as GAAP profits decline, Salesforce has tended to show stable pro forma margin metrics. The factor bridging the difference is Salesforce's growth in stock-based compensation.Now, stock comp is a common element of pay across the tech sector. But Salesforce, in particular, has been tremendously generous in handing out stock-based comp. Its growth in stock comp expenses mirrors that of a mid-cap company much smaller than itself.Figure 3. Salesforce stock comp trendsSource: Salesforce Q3 earnings releaseIn Salesforce's most recent quarter, the company grew stock-based comp by 55% y/y; year-to-date in FY20, stock comp has risen 34% y/y (much faster, by the way, than year-to-date revenue growth of 27% y/y). In effect, unsuspecting Salesforce investors are being subjected to tremendous dilution in their shares, year after year.Equally frightening to note is how quickly Salesforce has grown its headcount, primarily from its acquired companies (Salesforce has the reputation of a rather benevolent acquirer; it doesn't immediately raze the staffs of its targets post-acquisition). In Q3 alone, thanks to the additional Tableau headcount, Salesforce's headcount grew 39% y/y, again much faster than the corresponding Q3 revenue growth rate of 33% y/y:Figure 4. Salesforce headcount growthSource: Salesforce.com Q3 earnings deckYet Salesforce appears to be masking the true cost of this headcount expansion by paying generously in stock, and not in cash. By focusing solely on Salesforce's pro forma margin metrics, we ignore the fact that investors are essentially subsidizing Salesforce's empire-building through dilution. Shares of Salesforce have risen about 35% since the start of 2019, edging out gains in the broader S&P500. At the same time, the company has seen its valuation multiples expand. The below charts show a two-year view of Salesforce's valuation multiples over time. A cursory glance at these charts shows that Salesforce tends to trade at a ~7x forward revenue multiple. Today, however, Salesforce's valuation has expanded more than two turns higher, to 9.3x forward revenues. Data by YChartsIs it worth paying nearly a double-digit valuation multiple for a company whose organic growth, as implied by FY21's guidance of 22-23% y/y growth, has fallen to the low 20s? Fewer investors look at Salesforce's P/E ratio, but the takeaway is the same. A >60x forward P/E implies that Salesforce bears the promise of strong future profit growth, but as we've just discussed, this is far from the truth. Even Salesforce's pro forma EPS, which is helped by the exclusion of stock-based comp, has seen only meager 14% growth in the year-to-date, while the GAAP earnings picture is noticeably far worse.Figure 5. Salesforce EPS trendsSource: Salesforce Q3 earnings releaseSalesforce's aggressive M&A playbook and its continual lack of meaningful profit growth might be excusable in a more bullish market environment, but as it currently stands, most investors have become incredibly cagey about loss-leaders like Salesforce.A two-turn reversion of Salesforce's current revenue-based valuation, back to a historical ~7x multiple, would imply a disastrous ~$40 billion wipeout in Salesforce's market cap and a 25% drop from current levels, down to ~$137 (my one-year price target on the stock). The stock's tremendous gains since 2019 are heavily at risk, and investors should heavily consider pivoting to other positions."

It's now a $160bn market cap stock - that is truly astounding to those of us who witnessed the early days of the company back in 2000-2003, when it struggled to gain general legitimacy amongst reactionary claims of ""but shared software isn't secure"", ""big companies will never use this"", ""there's not enough bandwidth"", and so on. Well, this $160bn market cap stock is still delivering revenue growth of over 20% per year, every year, making money - meaning real money - net cashflow - and continues to generate capital wealth for its shareholders. That's because in truth, cloud is still young. There are still plenty of companies using on-premises software, meaning plenty of market to go for. And CRM is now the daddy of them all - it's the safe choice, the most legitimate player in its core app, salesforce automation.The company has to make acquisitions now in order to maintain that growth level. And it's old enough to have seen its stock suffer through a number of macro crises.This is the topic we address today. Our thesis, as operated over the last twelve months, remains: it's a perfectly good stock to just buy and hold. But it's a great stock to buy on dips. And trust us: we do not adhere to the general ""Buy The Dip"" investment strategy. We are old enough to remember when that was a very damaging strategy, and cynical enough to believe that it will one day become so once more. Not all dips are dips to be bought. But CRM dips? Those, one has to take seriously.We'll walk you through our logic.We initiated coverage of Salesforce (CRM) in July, initially at Neutral, then moved to Buy. Since then we called Buy here on SeekingAlpha on a further three occasions (see links below for those articles).Our Buys have worked out well for us. It's worth reviewing why, because we think there are clues as to when to buy CRM in the future too.First up, here's our ratings history on the stock.Source: SeekingAlphaIf you'd followed each rating, here's what your position would be - assuming $10k investment on each Buy, and rounding DOWN the number of shares purchased to the nearest integer (which reduces the calculated return a little).Source: SeekingAlpha, Cestrian AnalysisSo you'd be 20% up on an absolute basis, having achieved a 54% IRR on an unlevered basis (ie. you invested pure cash money, you didn't use a leveraged facility to buy the stock - of course borrowed money costs something so your returns would be down a little in that event).Each of our individual Buy calls have outperformed the S&P, as you can see from the relevant SeekingAlpha articles - cumulatively, you can do the math but in essence you'd be a good deal ahead of the market.OK - so far so good. What now?We think the company is set to grow for the forseeable future. It remains the largest pureplay cloud software business and it remains a 25%+ p.a. revenue grower, although it now requires acquisitions to maintain that growth rate. Contrary to popular opinion, those acquisitions tend to work out pretty well. And contrary to popular opinion, the company generates pretty good cashflow too. In confirmation of popular opinion, it also generates a pretty high level of dilutive stock based comp, which isn't going away any time soon - it's part of the business model.So if you want or need to buy stocks right now, we believe the case for buying Salesforce even at this extended level is sound. We think the company will continue to outperform the market in the medium to long term.But if you don't mind being patient, you might - just might - get a couple of meaningful dips to buy.Let's walk you through our Buys above in a little more detail. Specifically the dip Buys - after our initial move to Buy - Long Term Hold.We noted in August that CRM tended to over-react to at least two types of events; macro crises, and its own large acquisitions. Both such events have to date provided excellent buy-the-dip opportunities - over many years, as you can see from that August article - this isn't just a 2019 phenomenon.At the time of writing in August the push and pull of trade news was the primary macro concern. CRM dipped to $142 and we said this was a great opportunity to add. So it turned out to be - the stock is up 26% since then, about double the growth of the S&P in the same period.Just a week later, CRM made a modest (c.$1bn EV) acquisition, Click Software. The market over-reacted again. ""So soon after Tableau"" was the naysayers' cry. ""And we didn't much like Tableau either"", they added.We re-iterated our Buy. Again this worked out well - since then, up 28% vs. 13% for the S&P.Later in August, the company posted its Q3, and although the stock had moved up, we felt that value remained. We repeated - Buy - but we suggested caution on position size, as the market itself had moved up considerably. Since that final August note, CRM is up 16% and the S&P up 13%. Still good. But you see that the biggest gains came during periods of over-reaction.So here's two ideas if you want to time your buys in this stock.First, wait for its next big acquisition. You as good as know there's going to be one, because without it the company can't meet its stated growth rate. And if headline growth at this company starts to wind down, the stock is likely to hit the skids, because despite its $160bn market cap this remains in essence a growth equity play. And if the stock hits the skids, the stock-based-comp model starts to unwind. And then the wheels can really start to come off. (For an explanation of this, see our note here on the topic). And given the high level of insider ownership, no-one at the company wants this.So - big deals are coming this way. And we guess the market won't like them any more than the market liked the Tableau deal or the Click deal. So expect some gloom around ability to integrate, product fit, management distraction, price paid, dilution, all those things. But assess the opportunity using the filter that pretty much all these acquisitions have worked out for the stock. So stay positive when all around you go negative and see if you like what you find. (That's not a bad epithet for how to approach growth equity investing by the way).Second, wait for the world to hit the skids. Pick a topic. Trade, Iran, impeachment, QT or at least less committed QE, repo market, European crisis, the list goes on. Any one of these can spook markets at any time. And when markets are really spooked - check what's happening with CRM. There's a good chance it over-corrects. And there's a very good chance, based on history, that that is a good dip to buy.Now obviously the future is not the past, as everybody knows. You still have to do your work. And of course we aren't saying that buy-the-dip is a good overall investing strategy. It used to be an insult by the way, before the world decided that equity markets are only allowed to go up. But we are saying that over a nearly two-decade period, Salesforce has outperformed, and that every time it over-reacts, bravery has been rewarded.So armed - go forward! And good luck to all our readers.Cestrian Capital Research, Inc - 12 January 2020."
4315185,101927,2020-01-03T20:17:10-05:00,"Over the past 18 months, Salesforce.com has deployed roughly $24 billion to gobble up niche software firms.It has issued stock to fund many of these purchases, which indicates overvaluation.The stock is also overvalued by all other traditional metrics.","How do you measure a company's value when its growth and fundamentals rely on external acquisitions rather than internal innovations? That's the key question for investors in the enterprise software space. Market leaders like Salesforce.com (CRM) spend plenty of money on research and development (17% in the latest quarter), but their growth is primarily driven by absorbing smaller companies with business models that enhance the core platform.Over the past 18 months, Salesforce has deployed roughly $24 billion to gobble up niche software firms like ClickSoftware, Datorama, and MuleSoft. The largest of these acquisitions, Tableau, was closed earlier this year for an astounding $15.7 billion. Tableau alone added $327 million in revenue to the company's total $4.5 billion for the third quarter.Driven by this acquisition strategy, Salesforce intends to hit $20.9 billion in revenue for fiscal 2021 and $35 billion by the year 2024. Whether or not the company can achieve that target while maintaining or expanding margins depends on the price and fundamentals of the investment opportunities the team comes across over the next few years. All of which are unpredictable, which makes valuation difficult.Nevertheless, here are three ways I think investors can pin down this tech giant's valuation and make an investment decision.Perhaps, the most basic way to value any company is to compare it to its peers. Fortunately, Salesforce seems to have plenty of peers in the software-as-a-service and enterprise cloud industry. The benchmark comparable for these firms is their enterprise value to operating earnings (EV/EBITDA) ratio. Here's how Salesforce stacks up against the competition:At first glance, Salesforce seems to be trading at a hefty premium to other well-established enterprise software giants. The company's market cap is comparable to these IT giants, but the valuation seems more aligned with smaller tech startups that are just emerging.There's a key reason for this disparity in valuation - growth. The company's EBITDA doubled between full year 2017 and 2018. This year seems to be on track for phenomenal growth as well. Revenue expanded 33% year over year in the most recent quarter, while cash flows from operations were up 108% year over year. Oracle and SAP are not growing anywhere near this rate.So, investors need to adjust the valuation for expected growth to see if the price is fair.I'll use free cash flow as a proxy for earnings since the company has reported a net loss for the year. Estimates suggest free cash flow for full year 2020 could reach $3.3 billion. Which implies that the stock is currently trading at 43.4 times forward FCF.To justify that ratio, Salesforce will need to expand cash flow by 40% or more over the next year. However, the company is on target for growth in the mid to high-20s over the next year. Which means the stock is overpriced on a growth-adjusted basis as well.The company's target of $34 billion in revenue and 20% in net margin by 2024 is the best case scenario. Assuming the company generates $7 billion in net profit that year and trades at a 25x price-to-earnings ratio like any other mature software firm, the market value could touch $175 billion in five years.The current market value is $143 billion, which means the stock is priced-to-perfection when you adjust for present value based on the company's forecasts.However, there are plenty of risks looming over the next half-decade. A recession could compel enterprises to cut back on cloud investment or competition could intensify and squeeze Salesforce's margins. In other words, unless everything goes to plan for the next five years, the company's stock is overpriced.It seems like management recognizes this overvaluation. In recent years, the company has issued more shares to compensate staff and acquire other companies. The most recent acquisition of Tableau, the largest in the company's history was an all-stock deal. A significant portion of the $6.5 billion it paid for MuleSoft last year was also funded by issuing new shares.As a result of this steady dilution, the company's outstanding shares have expanded by roughly 66% over the past ten years. The fact that dilution has picked up pace in recent years could indicate that management thinks they're overbought at the moment.Data by YChartsI should probably say that any future acquisition that turns out better than expected could quickly change the intrinsic value of Salesforce. Even a deal that is dilutive to shareholders or seemingly overpriced could add substantial value to the overall company in the long run.That unpredictability is, in some ways, the beauty of the software company consolidator model.Salesforce has been a phenomenal stock for long-term shareholders. It's not easy to generate a 1000% return in less than 10 years. However, now, the stock price seems to have finally overshot the company's immense potential. At the moment, it seems priced to perfection, which means I'll be waiting for a correction to add some exposure here."

Its closest rival SAP (NYSE:SAP) was a distant second with 8.3% market share. Analysts believe that 75% of the global spending on CRM in 2019 will be on SaaS-based products, compared with 73% last year. Earlier this week, Salesforce announced its third quarter results that surpassed market expectations. The market was not too pleased with the outlook though.Salesforce's revenues grew 33% over the year to $4.51 billion, above analyst projection of $4.45 billion. Net loss was $109 million, or $0.12 a share, compared with a net income of $105 million, or $0.13 a share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.75, again better than the Street's forecast of $0.67.By segment, Subscription and support revenues grew 34% over the year to $4.24 billion. Professional services and other revenues grew 22% to $274 million. Revenue growth was led by Service Cloud which grew 24% to $1.14 billion and Sales Cloud, which grew 15% to $1.17 billion.For the fourth quarter, Salesforce expects revenues of $4.74-$4.75 billion with adjusted earnings of $0.54-$0.55 per share. The market was looking for revenues of $4.74 billion with an EPS of $0.61 for the quarter.Salesforce expects to end the year with revenues of $16.99-$17 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.89-$2.90. The Street had forecast revenues of $16.92 billion for the year with an EPS of $2.86.For the first quarter of the next fiscal, Salesforce forecast revenues of $4.8-$4.84 billion, falling short of the market's expected revenues of $4.85 billion. Salesforce's expectations of $20.9 billion in revenues for fiscal 2021 were also short of the market's expectations of $20.95 billion.During the quarter, Salesforce continued to upgrade its AI offering - Einstein. It is embedding Einstein in all customer experiences spanning its Salesforce Customer 360 Platform, especially the voice feature. It is also including new solutions for service and sales teams that will apply natural language processing to voice conversations to drive more personalized customer engagement.Salesforce had introduced Einstein Voice Assistant nearly a year ago. The assistant allowed sales reps to communicate with Salesforce through a conversation. It is now expanding the abilities of this assistant beyond the salesforce to cover any role in the industry. Additionally, by simplifying the process of app development using Einstein Voice Skills, Salesforce will allow organizations to reimagine workflows and processes to drive productivity.Salesforce has also included Service Cloud Voice in Service Cloud, thus creating an integrated offering of phone, digital channels, and CRM data available real-time to users on a single centralized console. Service Cloud Voice can also integrate with transcription services to convert voice to text in real-time.For the sales team, it introduced the Einstein Call Coaching feature that is included in the Sales Cloud and will help managers by providing them with insights and trends within conversational data. It will be able to identify keywords and alert managers about trends such as a spike in competitor mentions, or best practices or pricing discussions. Organizations can use these insights to deliver customized coaching to its sales reps.Salesforce also expanded its tie-ups with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) recently. It introduced Service Cloud Voice that integrates Amazon Connect with the Service cloud. Traditionally, service agents rely on information from multiple sources to address customer needs. With the new integration, customer assets, orders, support history, and other details will be available at a single place for agents. The integration will also allow Amazon Connect to provide AI-powered speech analytics to agents through Service Cloud Voice. Salesforce Einstein can then leverage this information to give recommended answers to agents, provide contextual knowledge articles, and suggest next best actions for the customer within the Service Cloud console.Salesforce is targeting revenues of $35 billion by the year 2024. It hopes to achieve that by both acquisitions and product enhancement. In the last 18 months, Salesforce has spent over $24 billion in acquisitions of companies including Tableau, ClickSoftware, Datorama, and Mulesoft. Its acquisition spree is likely to continue in the coming quarters. It could look at adding more content-focused vendors such as DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) to compete with the likes of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) in that space.Salesforce already has close ties with DocuSign. DocuSign offers DocuSign eSignature for Salesforce that allows organizations to send agreements for signature, capture information, tracking, and storing without leaving the Salesforce platform. According to reports, 90% of Salesforce's contracts using DocuSign are signed and completed the same day. DocuSign has also been investing in growth. Last year, it acquired SpringCM in a bid to take on Adobe. DocuSign is currently trading at $70 a share with a market capitalization of $12.3 billion. It expects to end the current year with revenues of $947-$951 million and billings of $1.063-$1.083 billion.Salesforce's stock is trading at $161 with a market capitalization of $141.7 billion. It had touched a record high of $167.57 earlier this April. The stock has climbed from its 52-week low of $120.16 that it had fallen to in December last year.Photo Credit: Open Grid Scheduler/Grid Engine/Flickr.comOriginal PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

CRM's service offerings are integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications, providing sales force automation, marketing automation, and digital commerce, among other services. The cloud service offerings include Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, Community Cloud, and Salesforce Platform.We are approaching 9x EV/revenue multiple with our valuation, which at the annual revenue base of $13-14 billion is already pushing its limits. With a fairly tepid market response to what was, in our view, a solid earnings report, we believe that the Street also continues to be cautious on valuation. Our target price remains at $175. Solid Quarter Results: The company beat both bottom and top line consensus estimates, with Q3 Non-GAAP EPS coming in at $0.75, higher by 9 cents and revenue of $4.5 billion higher by $60 MM. We note that the 33% Y/Y revenue growth (34% Y/Y growth in constant currency) is supportive of the recent annual top-line FY20 guidance raise to $17 billion, which is at the high end of the company range. We also note that the most recent FY21 revenue guidance is $20.9 billion, representing 23% Y/Y growth.Cloud Demand Remains Strong: There is solid subscription and support revenue growth, with cloud sales growth at 15 Y/Y%. Meanwhile, service cloud grew 24% Y/Y, while commerce cloud increased 32% Y/Y, with platform and other growing 73% Y/Y. Acquisition of Tableau added approximately $308 MM to platform, while MuleSoft grew 77% Y/Y. Margin Improvement Expectations: While margin forecasts have been tempered recently by about 50 bps, at around 16.5%, we believe that an improvement to approximately 18% within the next several quarters is entirely possible. This would have to exclude the impact of most recent acquisitions, however. Powerful Cyber Week: Commerce Cloud registered 30 MM+ orders, with growth at 27% Y/Y. There were more than 614 MM retail site visits, or 17% Y/Y growth. Meanwhile, Commerce Cloud digital sales grew 13% Y/Y, while Marketing Cloud increased 13% Y/Y. We note that 9% of digital orders during Cyber Week were driven by the Einstein product. Finally, Service Cloud processed more than 428 million agent interactions. International Expansion Remains Key Growth Lever: In the EMEA region, the company expanded partnership with Algae, British Airways, and Siemens, particularly in the context of the overall digital innovation. In the APAC, there were wins with Panasonic, EON, and the ANZ Bank. In Latin America, there was a new partnership signed in Columbia, a leading insurance company. We note that such partnerships expansions are certainly above what you would expect during an average quarter, particularly amidst talks of overall macro slowdown.Public Engagements Growing on Both Federal and State Levels: Whereas other companies within cloud and IT Services, such as Accenture, have been scaling down their public service activities, we see CRM expanding work within US government agencies. For instance, one such example has been in the Department of Veteran Affairs. On a state level, the company is now more deeply involved with Colorado via MuleSoft engagement.Macro risks: Economic slowdown, particularly in Europe, has a potential of meaningfully impacting the top-line.Technological risks: Failure along any step in the supply chain can lead not only to business slowdown, but to a branding risk, from which CRM may struggle to recover.Pricing risks: With many companies eyeing CRM's success, we expect a meaningful number of new entrants in 2020-22, with more attractive pricing to CRM's customers."

        The company has massive growth opportunities in the long term, and it is in a position of strength to capitalize on such opportunities.
        The stock is not overvalued at all if the company continues outperforming expectations in the years ahead.
        Overall, the risk and reward trade-off in Salesforce looks clearly attractive going forward.","Salesforce (CRM) announced solid earnings numbers on Tuesday, outperforming expectations and delivering vigorous growth rates across the board. The company has abundant room for sustained growth in the years ahead, and the stock price still offers attractive upside potential from current valuation levels.Salesforce reported both sales and earnings numbers above market expectations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. Total revenue was $4.5 billion, an increase of 33% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.75, increasing by 23% year over year and beating the consensus expectation of $0.67 per shareSalesforce also raised its earnings guidance for the current year to the range of $2.89 to $2.90 per share, surpassing the $2.86 per share expected by analysts. Full-year operating cash flow growth was also increased to the range of 22% to 23% versus a prior range of 21% to 22%.Guidance for the fourth quarter was above expectations at the top line, but below forecasts in terms of earnings. The company is expecting sales in the range of $4.743 billion to $4.753 billion, an annual increase of 32% and better than the $4.74 billion expected by Wall Street. On the other hand, the adjusted earnings guidance of $0.54 to $0.55 per share was below the $0.61 per share expected by the analysts following the stock.The fact that earnings guidance for next quarter was below expectations is the main weak spot in the report. Nevertheless, revenue guidance is more than healthy, and this is arguably much more important for a high growth business such as Salesforce. As long as the company keeps growing at full speed, the market can easily tolerate the volatility in profit margins.Management is expecting $34 billion to $35 billion in revenue by fiscal year 2024. If the company can deliver on such a target, it would mean doubling revenue versus the fiscal year 2020 and generating a compounded annual growth rate of 20% over 4 years.Source: SalesforceThis target is clearly ambitious, but not unachievable at all considering the company's current performance and its future growth prospects. Corporate spending tends to be fickle and depending on economic conditions, but digital transformation is a key strategic area for companies all over the world, and Salesforce is the undisputed leader in customer relationship management.During the Dreamforce conference in November, management shared some impressive statistics:Considering these statistics, Salesforce is creating a lot of value for its customers. These customers should arguably be quite reluctant to cut spending in CRM solutions from Salesforce, so maybe the business is far more resilient to tough economic times than what the market is giving it credit for.The company also has a solid track record of successful acquisitions, management showed how revenue growth rates at Mulesoft have accelerated from 38% before the acquisition to 52% now. Investors have been concerned about the recent acquisition of Tableau for $16 billion, so it's good to know that the company knows how to potentiate its acquisitions and accelerate value creation.Source: SalesforceSalesforce is a market leader across the different markets where it operates, and those markets are tightly integrated, this creates attractive cross-selling opportunities, and the company can materially benefit from up-selling superior features to existing customers.Management calculates that the total addressable market is worth around $168 billion, and Salesforce is in a position of strength to capitalize on such a massive opportunity in the years ahead.Source: SalesforceSalesforce is not a cheap stock, it never has been, and it probably never will be as long as the business keeps growing rapidly. However, only because valuation ratios are elevated in comparison to the broad market, this does not mean that the stock is overvalued.In simple terms, the higher the expected growth rate in revenue, the more valuable each dollar of current revenue is for investors, so companies with superior growth potential obviously trade at higher valuation levels. The table below compares Salesforce versus Adobe (ADBE), Intuit (INTU), Workday (WDAY) and Autodesk (ADSK) in terms of revenue growth and valuation levels. These companies have different markets, and their own weaknesses and strengths, so the comparison is not entirely straightforward.However, it can be good to compare valuation ratios and growth rates in order to get a broad reference on how Salesforce is priced in comparison to industry standards. Salesforce is the cheapest company in the group in terms of the enterprise value to sales ratios, but it comes in second place behind Workday in terms of revenue growth and expected revenue growth. When considering valuation and growth together, Salesforce looks like an attractive bet in the sector.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123Looking at projections, the table below shows revenue estimates, the expected growth rate each year and the implied forward price to sales ratio for Salesforce. The stock is not too expensive at all if the company can deliver in accordance with expectations.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialSpeaking of which, Salesforce has an outstanding track record of reporting revenue numbers not only in line but also above Wall Street expectations. The company has delivered revenue figures above forecasts in each of the past 16 consecutive quarters.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialValuation is a dynamic as opposed to a static concept. Current prices are reflecting a particular set of expectations about the company's future performance. If revenue outperforms those expectations, then the stock price needs to increase in order for the price to sales ratio to remain constant.The fact that Salesforce has consistently beaten expectations in the past does not guarantee that it will continue doing so in the future. But there is a clear pattern going on, management tends to make conservative assumptions and outperform expectations over time.In simple terms, Salesforce is reasonably priced based on the company's growth potential, and it's not unreasonable at all to say that the company could outperform market expectations in the years ahead.Growth tends to naturally slow down as a company gains size over time, because it's obviously easier to generate rapid growth from a smaller revenue base. Salesforce has proven its ability to sustain vigorous growth in spite of being one of the largest players in the sector, but this is still a relevant risk factor to keep in mind going forward.Salesforce is focused on long term growth, prioritizing growth investments and acquisitions above current profit margins. This can be a source of uncertainty for investors, and Salesforce is clearly not the best choice for those who like to invest in companies with predictable and consistent profit margins.In spite of those risks, Salesforce is the top player in a mission-critical software category, and the company stands to benefit from massive growth opportunities in an expanding market through cross-selling and up-selling, international growth, and continued acquisitions. At current prices, the stock is offering attractive potential if the company delivers in accordance with expectations or, even better, if Salesforce continues outperforming expectations like it has done in the past."
4310482,69905,2019-12-04T11:41:17-05:00,"Salesforce's future guidance is discussed.Cash flow got a non-recurring bump. For the year, cash flows will reach 22%-23%.Why investors should sidestep this investment sooner rather than later.","Salesforce's (CRM) Q3 2020 results and call delivered a very positive narrative, even though the facts point to a company with slowing revenue growth.The reaction after-hours was largely muted as investors embraced the strong beats, but hoped for more positive surprises.When a stock is already pricing in several years of strong growth ahead and is now starting to decelerate, investors would do well to consider sidestepping this investment.Salesforce's fiscal 2021 (calendar 2020) guidance was unchanged from the one provided at Dreamforce:Source: author's calculations, includes Q4 2020 guidance (*) & fiscal 2021 guidance (***)Assuming that Salesforce is attempting to sandbag results, even at the high end of its guidance of 23%, there is a marked slowdown from fiscal 2020 at 28%.And that's to be expected when a company reaches a certain size.What I believe investors are paying undue attention to, is just how volatile its performance is expected to be throughout fiscal 2021. Specifically, for Q1 2021, the guidance points to 28%-29% revenue growth rates, but by year-end, its total growth rate is only expected to be 23%.In other words, there is likely to be one or more quarters at 18%-20% as Salesforce comes up against tough comparisons in H2 2021 from its Tableau acquisition.Salesforce's Chairman and co-Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff delivered a very exciting investment call - as expected.(source)The narrative was very carefully tailored towards guiding investors' expectations towards the next leg of Salesforce's journey.In essence, as discussed during Dreamforce, investors should expect Salesforce's post fiscal 2021 growth rates to hover around 20%. One thing was clear, Salesforce's high 20s% growth rates will start to come down after its next fiscal year.On a positive note, Salesforce's cash flows from operations were impressively strong, and up 108% year-over-year. Digging into details, we can see that this unexpected bump was driven by earlier cash collection from customers, as well as Tableau's cash from operations.On a trailing twelve months, cash flows from operations were up 30%. Moreover, Salesforce's full-year fiscal 2020 (this calendar year) cash flows from operations (before capex) are expected to be up 22%-23%. Consequently, it is entirely possible that Salesforce's full-year fiscal 2020 free cash flow will reach $3.3 billion (after capex, but before recurring acquisitions).Altogether, Salesforce's balance sheet remains incredibly strong with a net cash position of $3.7 billion. Again, given Salesforce's ability to generate more than $3 billion of free cash flow per year, this reinforces just how strong its balance sheet is.On the other hand, notwithstanding posting mid-20% growth, Salesforce's stock-based compensation was up a whopping 55% compared with the same period a year ago.For 2019, Salesforce's share price has been an underperformer compared with the S&P 500 (SPY), trailing the index by 4% points.Source: author's calculationsInvestors that follow the cloud space will undoubtedly know that for a few years now, the sector is being richly valued, with very few reasonable pockets of compelling opportunities.The table reminds readers that presently investors are paying a premium for Salesforce's sales at 8.2x compared with its historical valuation of 7.8x. Bullish shareholders would retort that investors are ''expected'' to pay up for high-quality growth.Personally, I struggle to uncover a positively skewed risk-reward balance in Salesforce's valuation.(source)When the facts look different from our initial hypothesis, it is easier to get frustrated and entrenched than it is to change our minds. The facts point to Salesforce being an overvalued stock, with a decelerating growth rate.For a considerable amount of time, momentum and belief will propel the stock forward towards new heights, but at some point, investors will start to question what is the correct metric to value this growth stock, which is now starting to slow down."

(NYSE:CRM) stock price has fallen roughly 14% from its 52-week high, mostly due to the rotation away from software companies. Despite the drop in share price, I believe that Salesforce is a leader in its space with growing switching costs. At $144, it is undervalued by roughly 9% based on my base-case assumptions. (Source: Google)Salesforce pioneered the software-as-a-service model, with sales automation as their first solution. Since then, it has expanded into the service cloud, marketing cloud, and the Salesforce platform. By focusing intensely on the customer, Salesforce has managed to lead in its key markets. Having a tight integration among these solutions also enables Salesforce to cross-sell its solutions among its customers, which reduces customer acquisition costs. (Source: Salesforce Q2 FY2020 Update) By being a leader in almost all its markets, Salesforce has managed to keep revenue growth above 24% since 2011. Revenues have grown from $1.6B to $13.2B from 2011 to 2019. Even though it has grown revenues beyond $13B, Salesforce still has a large total addressable market (NYSE:TAM). According to its estimates among all its markets, Salesforce has a TAM of $154B. This means it still has a long runway for growth given that its current revenues are only 8.4% of the total addressable market. Moreover, chief information officers have mentioned that digital transformation is currently one of the top priorities. With Salesforce being a leader in many of the mission-critical workflow automation tools, it is likely to capture most of the upcoming growth. By being a leader in almost every market it serves, Salesforce has managed to carve out a moat mainly in the form of switching costs. Its sales cloud is a mission-critical software that helps drive revenue for users. The service cloud also helps Salesforce retain customers so it indirectly contributes to revenue generation. As such, IT managers are unlikely to switch away from sales and service Cloud because of the risk of implementing a new solution. Even if other solutions appear cheaper, they are unlikely to risk lost productively to try new sales automation software. Marketing and commerce cloud are newer additions to Salesforce's offerings and they are likelier to have originated from the company's sales cloud. These additions were a result of acquisitions so the leadership position is not as strong its core sales cloud offering. However, once customers use the marketing and commerce solutions by Salesforce, it is less likely they will switch to competing offerings. Even though the switching costs are weaker for these solutions, it exists in a less elaborate form. The salesforce platform also enjoys high switching costs and network effects. Once customers integrate their applications and data onto the Salesforce platform, it becomes even more difficult for them to switch. As more developers build apps on Salesforce's AppExchange, it creates a cycle of expanding users and developers. This combination of standalone clouds that are highly complementary and integrated have strengthened Salesforce's moat in the enterprise software space. The recent $15.7B acquisition of Tableau, along with many other acquisitions in the recent past is a sign of the drivers for future revenue growth. The key concerns here will be whether Salesforce is overpaying for these acquisitions and whether they could be integrated well into the company. Investors who do not prefer inorganic growth might want to stay away from investing in Salesforce.Marketing and commerce clouds are newer markets that Salesforce entered through acquisitions. Given the acquisitions, it appears that revenue growth is the priority now and not optimizing for profitability. As these are areas with new competitors, it might put some downward pressure on margins as Salesforce incurs acquisition, integration, and marketing costs. To value Salesforce, I used a DCF model with the following assumptions:1) Revenue growth at 20% for the next five years, then dropping to 2% in perpetuity starting from the year 2025. The high growth rates in the first five years reflect Salesforce's lead in its key markets as well as its ability to cross-sell its solutions. Coupled with a large total addressable market, Salesforce should be able to execute high sales growth for at least the next five years. However, inorganic growth through acquisitions is usually of lower quality so this is one area to watch in Salesforce's future. 2) Operating margin of 30% from 2024 onwards. Enterprise software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. Operating margin of 30% is considered high but it is lower than Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) current margins. Salesforce's gross margins have hovered between 75% to 80% in recent years. Once Salesforce scales further and profitability becomes a priority, the company should experience a high level of operating margin expansion through operating leverage. However, if Salesforce overpays for acquisitions or faces integration issues, there could be some downward pressure on its margins in the near term.3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate Salesforce will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) Salesforce has a weighted cost of capital of 8%, which is in line with similar large software companies.(Source: Author creation using Salesforce financials)The value I derived for Salesforce is roughly $121B for the entire company. This represents an 8.8% upside from its current price. As with all DCFs for high-growth companies, my point estimate valuation of $156.60 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against similar software companies. (Source: Author creation using data from Seeking Alpha)Compared to other high-growth peers, Salesforce looks fairly priced in terms of price/sales and EV/sales ratios. Salesforce is more expensive than Oracle which has lower growth but cheaper than Adobe and Workday which have higher profitability or growth. However, Salesforce is priced much cheaper than Adobe even though it has similar growth rates. Once operating leverage kicks in while maintaining high growth rates, Salesforce might experience a multiple expansion. If Salesforce's sales multiples become similar to Adobe, there could be a 50-60% upside in Salesforce's stock price. (Source: Author creation using Salesforce financials)Assuming a conservative 8% growth rate in Salesforce total addressable market, Salesforce's TAM should grow to roughly $330B in 2029. A 20% growth rate for the next 5 years implies that Salesforce will capture roughly 35% of its TAM by 2029. However, bigger-than-expected market expansion or larger market share capture by Salesforce would provide an even greater upside to its valuation. Potential investors have to decide if they believe in the strong growth of the cloud SaaS space and Salesforce's leadership in this space. If the underlying trends remain intact, Salesforce is likely a good buy now."
4310015,105334,2019-12-02T09:14:30-05:00,Salesforce ups the bar to $35 billion in revenue by FY24.But question marks remain over the Tableau integration.Shares are priced to perfection at ~8x revenue; exercise caution.,"Sentiment on Salesforce.com (CRM) shares has clearly turned over the last month, with shares making a notable move upward. Part of the optimism is likely related to the fact that software growth stories seem to have come back in vogue; the company's lofty $35 billion target for FY24 (doubling from FY20-FY24) probably helped as well. Salesforce shares are certainly not cheap at ~8x forward revs and almost 40x CF, leaving little room for error, in my view. On the whole, I see plenty of risks ahead and limited room to grow into current valuations; thus, I would exercise caution.This year's Dreamforce event was notable not just for Salesforce's raised FY20 revenue target (to $17.0bn vs. $16.75-$16.90bn prior), but also its FY24 target of $35 billion, which would entail a doubling of the revenue base over the next four years.Source: Investor Day SlidesFor some context, recall that on its Q2 earnings call, guidance had been for acquisitions to add roughly 5%pts of growth in FY20.FY21 guidance was also pegged at $20.8-$20.9bn (including completed acquisitions), which implies a 23% growth rate from FY20 guidance, while the FY24 target implies a highly ambitious 19%-20% CAGR from FY20 to FY24.Perhaps unsurprisingly, revenue growth continues to take priority over margins going into FY24. While there was little guidance on margins, revenue growth drivers covered multi-cloud adoption and a growing addressable market (TAM), set to reach $168 billion per Salesforce.Source: Investor Day SlidesWith all the talk about 20+% growth rates, however, the fact that the 20% CAGR guidance has remained the same since last year, implies no revenue growth accretion from the $15.7 billion Tableau acquisition. This either means Salesforce is being conservative with its estimates of post-merger synergies, or that synergies are limited at this point.One of the biggest knocks on Salesforce over the years, is its inability to grow margins. FY21 looks to be more of the same -- the company is guiding toward a low-18% operating margin, primarily driven by 125-150bp worth of organic expansion (though part of this is attributable to the company lapping $166 million of one-time expenses related to the Salesforce.org acquisition). Source: Investor Day SlidesIt is hard to get a true picture of Salesforce's long-term margin expansion trajectory given the company's acquisitive streak. Nonetheless, the migration to multi-cloud, coupled with the promise of improving attrition and unit economic margins should, in theory, improve unit economic margins to ~40% (vs. 35% prior), which should drive margin expansion in line with revenue growth.Source: Investor Day SlidesA key bright spot for Salesforce bulls was in Customer 360, which saw the introduction of Customer 360 Truth, Data Manager, and Audiences. The platform is powered by the new Cloud Information Model, an open-source data model that leverages MuleSoft to standardize data interoperability across various cloud applications. Features such as Service Cloud Voice, interactive email, and Einstein Designer leverage the power of Einstein AI to serve up recommendations to help enterprises build personalized customer experiences.Source: Salesforce Product AnnouncementsThe Customer 360 line will be crucial in expanding upon the company's leadership in customer data platforms (CDP), offering a compelling alternative to the Open Data Initiative (an alliance comprising Adobe, Microsoft, and SAP) to connect siloed customer data and deliver better experiences.Tableau was on hand for a demonstration as well, focusing on how their software helps enhance and scale analytics capabilities throughout an enterprise, enabling users to see and gather more insights from interacting with data. Tableau noted that they continue to plan to build out more end-to-end capabilities beyond data analytics and visualization, citing Tableau Prep, for instance, which was built in response to customers spending most of their time cleaning data, instead of focusing on running analytics.Source: TableauWith respect to software integrations, Salesforce has had a strong track record -- Demandware (acquired in July 2016) doubled its revenues in three years and currently has a revenue growth rate of ~23% (~27% prior). Since being acquired in May 2018, MuleSoft has accelerated its revenue growth rate from ~38% to ~52% YoY.Source: Investor Day SlidesGiven Salesforce has just started to integrate Tableau, details on integration and go forward strategy were scarce, though Salesforce is focused on investing in Tableau. The lack of revenue synergies baked into revenue guidance is a concern, and Salesforce will eventually need to address investor concerns surrounding the efficacy of its latest mega deal; though for now, Salesforce gets the benefit of the doubt given its M&A track record with the likes of MuleSoft and Demandware.The bear case on Salesforce has generally revolved around the risk involved with M&A, which has some merit, in my view. The problem with this narrative, however, is that it misses the fact that selling a v1.0 software module is orders of magnitude harder than selling an acquired product that already has some reference customers.That said, the constant shopping sprees have the side effect of introducing noise into the Salesforce numbers, with portions of revenue shifting from one year to the next, a dynamic which clearly filters through to margins. Additionally, the initial phase of integration also entails cash flow turbulence as new hiring and firing decisions are made, for instance.For now, at least, the probability of another material acquisition by Salesforce seems quite unlikely given the Tableau acquisition only received final clearance recently.The feasibility of Salesforce's valuation is mostly predicated on its revenue targets -- at an implied ~20% revenue CAGR targeted to $35 billion in fiscal 2024, I'd be inclined to give the company the benefit of doubt. Maintaining a 20% growth target off the company's already massive scale is no mean feat, however, and strong enterprise adoption, steady commercial market adoption win rates, and continued partner ecosystem support will be crucial to hitting the target.Even with these generous assumptions in mind, I struggle to see a path upward -- even if shares can sustain the ~8x revenue multiple it commands today, shares would only be worth ~$170 if it hits FY21 guidance. Though CRM does offer a recurring revenue stream, management has struggled to convert this into operating margin expansion. Coupled with the uncertainties related to the Tableau integration, I struggle to buy into the bull case at this point."
4309552,20715,2019-11-27T15:21:23-05:00,"Salesforce.com is expected to report fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings on Tuesday.The company has solid fundamental indicators, but the stock has struggled to keep up with the market for most of the year.Sentiment toward the stock has shifted a little, but analysts are still extremely bullish on the stock.","Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is known for its customer relations management software. So much so that it chose the ticker symbol CRM. The company has performed really well in the last few years from a fundamental perspective, and it is set to report fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings results on Tuesday.Analysts expect Salesforce to report earnings of $0.66 per share on revenue of $4.45 billion. The company earned $0.61 per share in 2019, meaning the expected earnings growth is 8.2%. This growth rate is considerably lower than the past three years which have averaged annual growth of 57%, but it compares favorably to the 7% earnings decline we saw in the second quarter.The revenue estimate from analysts is 31.1% higher than the $3.39 billion the company reported in the third quarter of last year. Revenue was up 22% in the second quarter and has averaged growth of 26% annually for the last three years.Salesforce’s management efficiency measurements are better than average, but not by much. The return on equity is at 15.3%, and the profit margin is at 18.3%.I also wrote an earnings preview on Salesforce back in May, and not much has changed since then. The ROE is a little higher (15.3% vs. 12.8%), and the profit margin is up a little as well (18.3% vs. 16.9%). I was neutral on the stock when I posted that article in May, and the stock is up just shy of 7% since it was published while the S&P is up 14.4% during the same time period.My neutral stance was based primarily on the stock trading in a range and the extreme bullish sentiment toward the stock. The high end of the range was in the $167 area and the low end was at $150.The $167.56 mark is the all-time high for Salesforce, and it hit that mark back in March. Since then, the stock hasn’t really challenged the possible resistance until two weeks ago when it hit a high of $166.34. The stock did break below the $150 mark that was serving as support, and it seems to have established support in the $140 to $142 range now.Salesforce has jumped in the last month, and that has caused the weekly stochastic readings to move in to overbought territory. After falling a little last week and down so far this week, it looks as though the indicators will make a bearish crossover this week.If the stock does pull back, it has two layers of support in the $140 to $142 range. As I stated before the lows in August and October were in this range, but you also have the 104-week moving average at $141.68 currently. A 104-week moving average may seem unorthodox, but it represents two years' worth of data. Salesforce hasn’t closed below its 104-week since the last week of 2016. The stock is up over 130% since then.In the article in May, I pointed to the 52-week moving average as potential support, and initially, the trend line did act as support. Unfortunately, the stock blew right through the moving average in July, and it has waffled back and forth across it several times since.The sentiment toward Salesforce has changed a little in the last six months. Back in May, there were 40 “buy” ratings and three “hold” ratings on the stock, and now, there are 39 “buy” ratings and three “hold” ratings. This puts the overall buy percentage at 92.9%, which is extremely high and reflects extreme optimism from analysts. I have had readers ask why we should care about what analysts think, and I don’t really care on an individual basis, but the totals matter to me. With 39 of 42 analysts rating the stock as a buy already, there is very little chance of an upgrade, and there are far greater chances for a downgrade. And whether we care or not about what analysts rate the stock, a downgrade or multiple downgrades can move a stock lower.The short interest ratio is at 3.3, which is in the average range. This reading is slightly above the average reading, but more importantly, it has increased from 2.1 since May. While the reading is far from indicating extreme bearish sentiment, it does indicate a bit of a shift to the pessimistic side.The put/call ratio is at 0.922 at this time and that has also increased from where it was in May (0.818). There are 138,406 puts open at this time and 150,152 calls open. This reading is a little below average, but not enough to call it bullishly skewed. In addition to the overall put/call ratio for options that expire in the next nine months, I looked specifically at the options that will expire on December 6. In that option series, there are 8,801 puts open and 10,564 calls open. That puts the ratio at 0.833, and that is a little more indicative of optimism.The fundamentals for Salesforce are still well above average as a whole, that hasn’t changed. The issues for me are the chart and the sentiment. The all-time high at $167.56 is still looming as resistance and the analysts are still extremely bullish.Obviously, if the company issued a blowout earnings report the stock get breakout above the old high, but once again, is there enough money on the sidelines looking to jump into bullish positions? The short interest ratio isn’t high enough to cause a short squeeze rally, and there aren’t enough bearish analysts to get very many upgrades. The bullish analysts could increase their target for the stock, but it would take a huge change in the target to get the attention of investors.Salesforce does have a history of beating its earnings estimates and has done so in each of the last four earnings reports. Unfortunately, the stock hasn’t always reacted in a positive manner when the company has beaten estimates. Out of the last four instances, the stock has moved up on two occasions and down on two occasions.I know my stance will be unpopular with Salesforce investors, but I have to remain neutral on the stock for now. If it pulls back down to the $140 area and bounces off its 104-week moving average, that might be a better entry point and could change my stance. Even with that, there is still the matter of the extreme bullish sentiment, and I don’t see that changing drastically in the next few months."
4308906,41961,2019-11-25T04:45:11-05:00,"Salesforce is a high quality business delivering a mission-critical customer relationship management function to enterprises.The business has progressively expanded its foothold into adjacent markets, which will increase customer retention and contribute significantly to revenue.Salesforce is attractively priced and should be bought at these levels.","Salesforce (CRM) pioneered cloud-based, customer relationship management, and has since added a suite of ancillary services including a Service Cloud, a Commerce Cloud and a Marketing Cloud for digital marketing campaigns. Salesforce has a market capitalization of almost $135B, and generates close to $13B in annual revenue. The company's flagship product is used by sales and marketing teams to manage sales prospects through a funnel from initial lead all the way to customer and to run campaigns against a prospect database. Salesforce has been a standout for high growth investors over the last 10 years and has delivered investor returns of nearly 27% p.a over this period. Salesforce is a core holding for the Project $1M portfolio.Core product is very stickySalesforce is part of the revolution away from on-premise customer management to consumption of services in the cloud. In this model, customers aren't paying for a perpetual license, they are just paying for what they consume. The advantage for customers is the avoidance of cumbersome updates of difficult on-premise installations and lengthy upgrade cycles as well as high upfront costs.However, the beauty here is that for really sticky, mission-critical services, the lifetime customer value is potentially much higher, as retention rates for subscriptions are incredibly high. The offering that Salesforce has fits squarely into this category. Sales prospects and sales leads are the lifeblood of a company. Companies are loath to bring any system change or disruption to their sales people, unless they want major flow on impacts to revenue. IT teams are hesitant to recommend changeover to new systems even for systems that may be cheaper, because the retraining involved to learn a new system and potential data loss in a changeover is incredibly disruptive to a salesforce. Time training on a new system is time away from selling and that hurts revenue. This is reflected in Salesforce retention rates which are in excess of 90%.Successful Penetration of adjacent marketsThe value chain that is involved in managing a customer creates core activities in acquiring, managing and closing a prospect, which is the core salesforce functionality. Additionally, there are then a number of related activities that stem from this process as well. They include things like managing support cases and trouble tickets, and tracking resolution of these items. There are also a different set of activities like running and managing marketing campaigns to move prospects through the funnel, from an initial lead through to a qualified lead to ultimately acquire a customer.With its best of breed customer relationship management tool, Salesforce has been able to successfully expand its core service to these adjacent services as well. Service Cloud helps a company manage support cases and trouble tickets, while Marketing Cloud deals with digital campaign management and user targeting. Salesforce has successfully managed to grab a much larger share of the customer management value chain and significantly increase revenues by using its core sales portal as a beachhead. Enterprises are beginning to embrace the idea of system and platform consolidation to better track system and license spending, and thus the idea of a core platform that can execute multiple mission-critical functions well is something that is gaining significant traction in mid market and large enterprise alike.Exceptional Network Effect I have a particular focus on investing in growing businesses with really strong network effects, and Salesforce is a business that has these network effects in spades. The network effect in Salesforce's case really stems from 2 distinct sources. One is that as the dominant CRM portal with strong market share, Salesforce usage is exceptionally high in the industry. There are an army of salesforce consultants whose job it is to just customize and implement Salesforce. More importantly, there are millions of users of Salesforce products, including sales coordinators and sales professionals that have grown accustomed to using salesforce to manage their funnels and activity to maximize their productivity. This ""training moat"" represents a huge barrier for a competing product to overcome. Each incremental sales professional that starts their career using Salesforce is yet another user that needs to be retrained and be made productive on a new system, further widening the Salesforce network effect.The other part of the network effect that Salesforce has is an internal network effect. As an enterprise standardizes on Salesforce to managing its sales pipeline, the customer support problems and prospect marketing very quickly emerge as pain points that also require standardization and management. Rather than have the hassle of investing in multiple systems and moving data back and forth between them, other teams in an organization start to see the value of having all aspects of customer management standardized on Salesforce.Soon the Operations support team, and the Marketing team have been trained and have users on Salesforce, and are requesting additional licenses. Over time, many parts of the business have been trained and are using Salesforce to the overall productivity benefit of the company. Any proposed change to an alternate system by any one division not only potentially impacts the productivity of that division but the company more broadly.Thus, Salesforce's adjacent offerings are critical to the longevity of its customer retention. Not only do they bring in additional revenue for the Company, but they also make it virtually impossible for the company to leave Salesforce's grip, without significant productivity loss. This is borne out in Salesforce's metrics. More than 50% of its enterprise customers use multiple clouds, and customer retention is above 90%, something that will probably trend higher with increased adjacent offerings.Massive markets with long term runway Salesforce will generate close to $17B in revenue for 2019, with a market for its products and services that the company previously estimated last year was more than $140B, which subsequently increased to $160B with the acquisition of Tableau. This means that the company has a substantially long runway to capitalize and ride industry tailwinds which favor consumption of cloud applications, and has captured barely more than 10% of what it anticipates its market potential to be. Just as significantly, many of its addressable markets are growing at rates well into the double digits.Salesforce Investor Presentation, 2018There was much positive news for Salesforce coming out of Dreamforce, Salesforce's annual conference, which was held recently. Salesforce increased 2019 revenue guidance to $17B and more significantly increased its 2024 revenue target to $34-35B. This is significant, as it implies the company sees still strong growth in its core segments, with revenue doubling over the next 5 years.While Salesforce trades at a forward P/E of almost 60x earnings, this is not an accurate reflection of the earning potential of the business given that it continues reinvesting in the business and that earnings are artificially lower than where they could be if the levels of investment in marketing and sales were decreased. Given CRM's strategy is to acquire as much market share as possible, sales and marketing expense is high, with no converse upfront recognition of revenue (revenue being recognized over customer lifetime), artificially depressing profitability. CRM also produces copious amounts of cash, with 20% of revenue being converted into free cash flow by the company.Price/Sales is arguably the better way to value this business, and at 9x sales, this business is significantly cheaper than Adobe (ADBE) and Workday (WDAY) which trade at 14x sales and 12x sales respectively. This is a business that still expects a very high rate of revenue growth in the near term and isn't materially slowing down.CRM has a meaningfully advantaged position in large markets which are growing at double digits, and will continue to do so for some time to come. It is providing mission-critical software to enterprises, where it has a core foothold as the best in class point solutions for sales management. The current valuation is attractive, given stickiness of the service and opportunities for growth still available in very large markets."

Because its shareholders have become accustomed to +25% revenue growth rates, and any deceleration will see the multiple investors are willing to pay compress.Looking further ahead, we see this effect repeated, but this time to a larger extent:Salesforce is subtly priming the investment community that its current 26%-28% revenue growth rates are going to come down to 20% growth rates in the very near term.Thus, we are presented with a quandary.Source: author's calculationsAs we can see in the graph above, investors have been all too happy to throw caution to the wind and pay an ever-increasing P/Sales multiple to participate in this high growth story.I surmise that many shareholders have failed to ask the challenging (albeit necessary) fundamental question of when Salesforce's growth rates would slow down from north of 26%? And if so, by how much? Never mind asking how soon.I have one final graph which I believe puts forward the bearish thesis and the bullish thesis together succinctly:Source: Dreamforce 2019Bulls point towards Salesforce's rapidly growing revenues, backed by its stable and predictable non-GAAP operating margins, which is expected to finish fiscal 2020 at 16.6%.Whereas bears would start off the discussion focused on the fact that Salesforce's FY 2020 GAAP operating margins are expected to compress all the way down to 3.8% and that for a cloud-based enterprise is a very tight profit margin.Next, the fact that Salesforce's GAAP operating margins are compressing and its revenue growth is declining, doesn't that imply that Salesforce is not getting a return on invested capital commensurate with that of a more mature SaaS company?I have attempted to put forward an evidence-based discussion of Salesforce's near-term potential.Shareholders are presented with a rare combination of decelerating growth rates, compressing GAAP profit margins and an elevated share price. I strongly contend investors would do well to sidestep this investment.Salesforce is days away from reporting its Q3 2020 results. Stay tuned!"

The growth aspirations of doubling its revenue to $27B by 2023 imply a revenue growth rate of 17% from here, but on past performance looks achievable. Valuation and stock performance-wise, there is no distinct story here – neither do valuations suggest that the stock is cheap (or expensive), nor has the share price that has tracked the broader S&P500 shown any significant underperformance versus peers. Hence, I am “Neutral” on the stock over the next 12-month period, with the belief that the growth story is priced in at the current stock prices.Company CommentarySalesforce is an early mover in the cloud applications business. It has a diverse range of products and has built up its reputation as a leader in the CRM space where it commands ~20% of the market (2x of SAP revenues and 3x of Oracle revenues). As of June 2019, the market stands at $48B (Source: Forbes), up 15% y-o-y, and is expected to continue growing similarly in the foreseeable future. To double on its growth, Salesforce has been acquiring sensibly. Of the 88 acquisitions that the company concluded since 2006, the two large deals over the last couple of years have been those of MuleSoft Inc. and Tableau Software for $5.7B and $13.9B, respectively.MuleSoft allows Salesforce to compete in the data-integrations product space where the demand for products that would enable firms to uncover hidden data sets from their legacy systems to power analytics is exploding (expected to rise by 25% according to IDC). Salesforce will be looking to garner most from this market on the back of MuleSoft. Tableau, on the other hand, allows Salesforce to be a force to reckon with in the data visualization space, and with an existing revenue of about $1B, the acquisition fits well with Salesforce’s ambitious goal of doubling its revenue to $27 billion by 2023. From a growth perspective, Salesforce looks set to beat any upcoming market slowdown by doubling down on its bets on the most attractive segments of the market.ValuationsOn valuation, growth, and profitability metrics, there is a mixed story for Salesforce. While on metrics like Price/Sales and EV/Sales, Salesforce seems to be trading cheaper than peers, while on other parameters like margins and return on equity, it lags the competition. Given its size, revenue growth is impressive (Workday has a lower base), and combined with the acquisitions of fast-growing firms like Tableau and MuleSoft; revenue growth is likely to be maintained. Doubling of revenue by 2023 implies a target growth of 17%, which on a base sales of $13.5B is ambitious, to say the least, but on current run-rate, looks achievable.Source: SeekingAlpha.comComparative ChartOver the last 12 months, Salesforce has returned 6%, broadly in-line with SPX returns of 5.4% while underperforming Adobe significantly (15% returns over the past 12 months) but out-performing its nearest CRM competitor SAP (1.6% return).On the macro-economic front, the easing of US-China trade tensions and China opening up its cloud services to US companies could lead to a potential windfall for tech firms like salesforce.com, as they gain a foothold in one of the world’s largest markets. Currently, salesforce.com is in partnership with Alibaba to market its cloud-based products in China.According to my Lead-Lag Report, while the US tech sector was all spruced to expand, it was trapped in the crossfire of the Sino-US trade war. Although the industry has massive potential in the backdrop of enormous growth in the artificial intelligence space and the worldwide launch of the 5G network in the next few months, the sector is currently in a tailspin due to the ongoing uncertainty surrounding global trade.Source: tradingview.comTo conclude, even though Salesforce.com has a CAGR of more than 25 percent and a 14 percent EBITDA margin, stock prices of the world’s #1 CRM firm is likely to remain capped around $155, at least until the global macro-economic situation improves."

Organic deceleration is chief among these issues: it's no secret that Sales Cloud is getting long in the tooth, and its high levels of penetration into its TAM make the opportunity for growth far more limited.

Salesforce's $6.5 billion purchase of MuleSoft gave a huge kick to growth rates, making it look like Salesforce's platform growth is sufficient to counteract deceleration in Sales Cloud and to a lesser extent, Service Cloud. But in reality, Salesforce just paid a lot of money to acquire that growth.And then Salesforce did it again with Tableau (DATA). Salesforce's bid for Tableau was more than twice that of MuleSoft, paying out $15.7 billion for the data visualization company (albeit in all stock). There's no doubt that these acquisitions are highly strategic. Salesforce's purchase of Tableau extends its capabilities into data visualization and dashboarding, a high-growth area of enterprise software in which Salesforce previously had no reach.The issue, however, is that Salesforce is essentially becoming another Oracle (ORCL). Even at its size, Salesforce has adopted a ""growth at all costs"" mentality - it's indiscriminately chasing revenues while potentially growing outside of its comfort zone. Many investors have clamored for Salesforce to produce greater profits, but as long as the company's M&A-fueled megalomania continues, it's unlikely that Salesforce will ever turn a decent enough margin - even at its long-term revenue scale of $26-$28 billion.In a nutshell, it's unwise to buy Salesforce near ~8x forward revenues, especially at a time that the market is showing fading enthusiasm for growth stocks with thin profits. While Salesforce remains a staple of the enterprise software sector, I believe its best days of growth are behind it, and what now remains is an aggressive M&A-driven push to double its revenues within four years - but only a small portion of that growth will be organic, and the rest will be acquired. Steer clear of this name and invest elsewhere.Let's now dive into the results of Salesforce's second quarter:Figure 1. Salesforce 2Q20 resultsSource: Salesforce 2Q20 earnings releaseRevenues grew 22% y/y this quarter to $4.0 billion, beating Wall Street's expectations of $3.96 billion (+21% y/y) by a 120bps margin. We note, however, that revenue growth decelerated two points from last quarter's growth rate of 24% y/y.Salesforce's ""story"" by product remains largely the same. Sales Cloud, at 13% y/y growth, remains the weakest-growing product, while Platform is up 28% y/y, helped largely by the MuleSoft acquisition, which is now included in the prior-year compare, but is still growing faster than Salesforce's organic products. Note that Tableau has not yet been folded into Salesforce's results.Figure 2. Salesforce growth by cloudSource: Salesforce 2Q20 earnings presentationNote that during the quarter, Salesforce ""acquired"" Salesforce.org - which previously had been a reseller partner of Salesforce software - and turned it into a new vertical solution focused on the non-profit and education sector. Salesforce paid $300 million in cash for Salesforce.org, which contributed to growth across Salesforce's four product categories. CFO Mark Hawkins noted that excluding Salesforce.org, the company's revenue growth would have been 20% y/y. So although Salesforce's growth decelerated sequentially in part due to lapping the contribution from MuleSoft in the prior year, this was also offset by the contribution from Salesforce.org.Here's some further color from co-CEO Keith Block on the Q2 earnings call, covering the company's momentum with reseller partners as well as Salesforce.org:Unfortunately, Salesforce's growth and acquisitions have done little to expand its bottom line. Sales and marketing costs have remained a disproportionately high percentage of Salesforce's revenues. On a GAAP basis, Salesforce spends 46% of its revenues on sales and marketing:Figure 3. Salesforce margin trendsSource: Salesforce 2Q20 earnings releaseInvestors would hope that Salesforce would gradually scale this down and gain operating efficiencies as the company grows larger, but Salesforce has continued to grow at the expense of profits. A one-time expense relating to Salesforce.org also drove Salesforce's operating margin down to 2% (down one point from 3% in the year-ago quarter), while net margins lost seven points to 2% from 9% in the year-ago quarter.Salesforce also noted that M&A-driven expenses have impacted cash flows. OCF is down 5% y/y this quarter to $436 million:Figure 4. Salesforce cash flow trendsSource: Salesforce 2Q20 earnings presentationYes, Salesforce is still holding onto its promise of growing >20% y/y per quarter and affirming its long-term revenue goal of $26-$28 billion, but without its aggressive pattern of acquisitions, Salesforce wouldn't be able to get there. I fear that Salesforce's own organic growth and innovation is being stifled in favor of ""get big at all costs"" mentality that will eventually make it look like a jumbled portfolio of software products with mixed performance, like Oracle.Stay on the sidelines here for now."
4295818,103373,2019-10-09T19:24:50-04:00,Price movement for the past three years has been disproportionate to revenue and earnings growth at Salesforce.com.Other stocks like NVIDIA and Netflix seem to be going through the same prolonged and cautious price correction.We might be seeing the 'new normal' in terms of how companies like Salesforce.com are valued.,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is every investor’s dilemma - until you know what makes the company tick. CRM is a company that invests more than half its revenues into marketing its products and services, spends a lot of cash doing acquisitions that grow its top line, and has never dropped below the +20% level in terms of annual revenue growth rate over the past decade or more. Right now, I believe the market is adjusting CRM’s price due to bloated valuations over the past few years. That makes CRM an attractive long-term buy as the price continues to slide. But there's also an interesting trend that's playing out at CRM and other growth companies in the tech space that I'd like to explore.So, why are the shares of a company with such stellar performance metrics moving gradually lower for the better part of the past year? In my opinion, there’s been so much upward momentum in the past that the market is finally catching its breath and allowing the stock to settle down to more realistic levels that match its growth rates.To validate that, let’s look at price movement over multiple periods and compare that with revenue and earnings growth:Over FY 2017 (year ended January 31, 2017), the stock appreciated 22%, while revenue grew by 26%; in fiscal 2018, the stock went up by nearly 45%, while revenue grew by 25%; in FY 2019, the stock went up by nearly 35% and revenue was up by 27%.Over the three-year period under discussion, normalized diluted earnings per share grew 76% and revenue grew 57%, but share price grew by a disproportionate 136%.I believe we’re seeing the after-effects of the market’s enthusiasm during the FY 2018 to FY 2019 period. Since the last annual report period ended January 31, 2019, the stock is down by 6%, and we could see a further downward movement as the market continues to gradually adjust CRM’s price. But don’t wait for it to go much lower than this, because revenue growth moment isn’t going to slow down for the foreseeable future. As it stands, the market still seems ‘hyped’ about CRM’s growth prospects, but the sentiment doesn’t appear to be strong enough to support such high valuations.From a forward (non-GAAP) earnings point of view, CRM’s current ratios are still at +50 levels, but the chances of those ratios coming down to much lower levels are quite slim. It’s almost as if the market knows that the stock is pricey, but, to a great extent, the continued growth momentum seems to be offering support to the current high valuations. There’s some ‘give’ here, but not enough to make the stock plummet. It’s more of a gentle price reduction until some sort of equilibrium is reached.The really interesting thing here is that Salesforce.com isn’t the only company where we can see this phenomenon at play. Just look at the one-year price movements of Netflix (NFLX) and NVIDIA (NVDA).All three stocks have lost ground over the past year, but if you look at the past five-year period, you can see how stock prices have largely appreciated out of proportion to revenue and earnings.It’s an intriguing trend if you think about it. All three companies are strong growers in terms of revenue and earnings, but all of them have finally arrived at a plateau of sorts in terms of their respective stock prices. I believe these are just temporary plateaux, to be clear, but it represents a significant change in the way the market looks at these stocks.The key takeaway is that it looks like we have a ‘new normal’ when it comes to how these stocks are valued. A forward earnings multiple of 30+ or 40+ might not necessarily mean the stock is overpriced, especially if it operates in the disruptive technology space and dominates its market segments. That’s certainly the case with Salesforce.com, Netflix, and NVIDIA, all of which are trading at those elevated levels but are now seeing nominal - even cautious, one might say - corrections to their prices. Once the market believes it has achieved the proper quantum of correction for each of these stocks, the prices are likely to continue their climb, but, this time, they’ll hopefully be more accurate reflections of growth in core metrics.And, that creates an ideal window of opportunity for long-term investors. This article primarily focuses on CRM, but I hope to show similar trends in other growth companies in the tech space over the course of this month. The advantage for investors is that these corrections are prolonged rather than sudden, giving you ample opportunity to get in at the right price. The only thing to keep in mind is that the ‘right price’ might still reflect a higher valuation multiple than ‘normal.’ Despite this, CRM is still worthy of consideration as a permanent member of any long-term holding."
4292690,71685,2019-09-20T12:12:18-04:00,Momentum appears to be turning more favorable for the stock.There have been some bullish bets in shares recently.The stocks valuation is very high.,"Salesforces.com (CRM) could be ready to test its all-time highs. The stock has been in a range of around $155 since the beginning of September. However, some signs suggest that maybe all are about to change, as the stock readies itself for a move higher.The technical chart shows that the stock has been consolidating near a level of technical support at $153. There are signs that the stock may soon begin to turn higher. The relative strength index for the stock is breaking out and is once again beginning to rise, a symbol of bullish momentum entering the shares. The next significant level of technical resistance comes around at $161.There are signs that the stock could push even higher, though. That is because the $165 call options on the expiration date for October 18 have seen their open interest rise by nearly 6,500 contracts on September 20. For a buyer of those calls to earn a profit, the stock would need to rise to around $166.30, if holding the options until the expiration date.The total number of open contracts at the strike price is about 12,600 contracts. The contracts trade for roughly $1.25 per contract. It means that the total dollar value for the contracts is $1.6 million. It is a modest size bet, considering the stock would need to rise to about 7% from the current price of approximately $156.The stock valuation isn't cheap trading at 50 times fiscal 2021 earnings estimates of $3.11 per share. Based on consensus analysts' estimates, those earnings are expected to grow by just 9% from fiscal 2020 earnings estimates of $2.85. An elevated level when adjusting for growth and versus the broader S&P 500, which trades around 16.5 times one-year forward estimates.Starting in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, earnings are expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of just 12.65%. When adjusting that three-year growth rate by the stocks one-year forward PE ratio, the stock has a growth-adjusted PEG ratio of 3.95. Typically, a stock is considered to be reasonably valued when it trades with a PEG ratio between 1.0 and 1.5.The company has been made a series of acquisitions over the past few years buying MuleSoft in 2018 for $6.5 billion. Now, this year, it purchased Tableau for nearly $16 billion, in a move to keep helping to push growth forward. These deals have been done through a combination of cash and stock. The stock component can be dilutive to shareholders and also weighs on earnings growth as the share count expands. Should the company continue to make more acquisitions in the future, one should worry about future dilution.Overall, the stock has mostly gone nowhere since September 2018. It isn't clear if the stock will have the momentum to make new highs. But it does seem momentum is building to, at the very least, challenge those all-time highs.Make sure you check out my Google spreadsheet where you can track all of my articles on SA."
4296025,102661,2019-10-10T23:43:13-04:00,"Service Cloud is a fast-growing segment within Salesforce.com business, presently generating over $3.5 BB in revenue and could overtake the CRM business in the future.A recent Evercore ISI interview provides insight into the segment's market opportunity, competitive landscape, and direction.Service Cloud might offer an opportunity for sideline investors who are seeking to make an argument to go long on the company.","Service Cloud, introduced as a distinct business segment in FY ’10, is a fast-growing category within Salesforce.com’s (CRM) overall software portfolio, with the potential to overtake the company’s “bread-and-butter” Sales Cloud category in the future, in terms of annual revenue.Figure 1: Salesforce.com Business Segment Revenues and Growth RatesSource: Salesforce.com Financial Update Q4 FY ‘19With Dreamforce right around the corner, I thought to analyze this business via an interview on September 18, 2019 between Mr. Bill Patterson, Executive Vice President and General Manager for Service Cloud, and Mr. Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Service management is a very competitive area within the IT landscape, and using Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Field Service Management as a proxy for the broader service management ecosystem, we see that Salesforce has no shortage of challengers, including Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), and SAP (SAP):Figure 2: Gartner Field Service Management Magic QuadrantSource: GartnerIn writing this article, I was eager to review the interview to understand how the company differentiates itself against the various players above. (Note that Salesforce announced its acquisition of ClickSoftware earlier this year.) Because, given the segment’s performance, we have strong evidence that the company has evolved far beyond its legacy CRM solution. Service Cloud may offer support to investors who have, thus far, stayed on the sidelines of the company, but are seeking to evaluate an argument to go long. I happen to be one such investor, and I have admittedly approached Salesforce with a certain hesitation. I feel much of the run in the stock has been based on market mania and media hype; and that many analysts have failed to objectively analyze the company’s numbers, technologies, and strategies. I always assumed Salesforce was just one or two quarters away from a big correction once the market finally “figured out” that the business had its flaws.Nonetheless, the interview provides a basis from which to gauge the unique capabilities (if any) of this business, along with the dynamics driving/impacting its continued growth. The transcript of the interview is available on Seeking Alpha, and I am including it as an embedded document at the end of this article. I would like to stress upfront that I attempt to summarize the interview for the reader. Accordingly, I am injecting subjectivity as I interpret and arrange different parts of the conversation into what I think are logical relations. While I attempt to cover most of the content of the interview, there may be some mentioned points that I have chosen not to address. I strongly encourage readers to review the actual interview transcript for their own reference.Before jumping into the analysis, it is worthwhile to note the popularity of Salesforce.com among the investing community is undeniable and it’s difficult to find an analyst today who is not a cheerleader. In fact, using the data found at Marketbeat (NYSE:CRM - Price Target & Analyst Ratings for salesforce.com), not a single analyst has issued a “sell” rating over the last 180 days, and the consensus price target stands at $185.15 (as of the time I am writing this). That represents a nearly 26% upside given today’s close of $147.05. Despite the broad enthusiasm for the company, I attempt to analyze the Service Cloud business dispassionately.A review of some basic data on the Service Cloud segment offers a useful background in discussing Mr. Patterson’s/Mr. Materne’s interview. As a bit of a Salesforce skeptic, I was curious to examine the annual report description of the business when it was first introduced in FY ’10 versus “today”:Source: Salesforce.com Annual Report FY ‘10Source: Salesforce.com Annual Report FY ‘19I was pleased to note there is good consistency between these definitions, implying the company has maintained a clear strategy for the segment. While that might sound trivial, I would argue that in the world of tech, we (investors) all too often find companies adjusting strategies to fit the moment rather than holding course in a specific direction. One word that appears in the FY ’19 definition versus the FY ’10 definition is “smarter”, hinting at Salesforce’s incorporation of its Einstein artificial intelligence platform into Service Cloud. We see Einstein as a component of the segment, as illustrated in the following diagram at the bottom of the blue box:Figure 3: Service Cloud Segment ComponentsSource: Salesforce.com Financial Update Q4 FY ‘19Einstein is worth discussing more, and I will revisit the topic in the next section. The market opportunity for Service Cloud, and the company’s stated position as #1 within the service management ecosystem, certainly appears compelling, as highlighted in the following two slides:Figure 4: Service Cloud Total Addressable Market SlideSource: Salesforce.com Financial Update Q4 FY ‘19Figure 5: Service Cloud Market Share, Rank, and Growth RatesSource: Salesforce.com Financial Update Q4 FY ‘19Recall from Figure 1 that Service Cloud revenues grew a substantial 26% from FY ’18 to FY ‘19 to $3.6 BB. If the segment grows only at the estimated market CAGR of 13% from Figure 4 through FY ’22, the business would generate in excess of $5 BB by the end of FY ’22:Figure 6: Service Cloud Forecasted Revenues at a 13% CAGR.Table Source: Yves SukhuThat would make the Service Cloud business of FY ’22 larger than the Sales Cloud business is today, which generated $4.0 BB in FY ’19. Obviously, if Salesforce can exceed the average 13% CAGR mentioned on Figure 4, Service Cloud could conceivably overtake Sales Cloud to become the largest revenue-producing segment. Can they do it? The company has, in fact, exceeded the broader service market CAGR since FY ’15, although growth is slowing:Figure 7: Salesforce.com Business Segment Revenues FY ’15 – FY ‘19Data Source: Salesforce.com Annual Reports FY ’15 – FY ‘19Table Source: Yves SukhuStill, using the market growth estimates from Figure 5, it is easy enough to model a complete forecast through FY ’22. Although, in the table below, I used estimated market CAGR’s for all segments except Service Cloud where I increased the growth rate from the estimated average rate of 13% to 16%. We see that the segment would be roughly on par – in terms of revenue – with the Sales Cloud business by FY ’22:Figure 8: Salesforce.com Complete Business Segment Revenue Forecast FY ’20 – FY ‘22Note(s): Table Source: Yves SukhuGiven that Salesforce.com has managed a Service Cloud CAGR greater than 20% for the last couple fiscal years, it would seem plausible that the company could exceed the forecasted market CAGR through FY ’22. Also, Salesforce expects overall above-average market rate growth of 20% to 21% for FY ’20 as per the following slide:Figure 9: FY ’19 Results and FY ’20 GuidanceSource: Salesforce.com Financial Update Q4 FY ‘19Moreover, with a stated TAM of $29 BB for the service management market from Figure 4, which is the largest of all non-platform TAMs, it would seem – on the surface – the growth opportunity for Service Cloud is very good. All of this should get the attention of investors – bears and bulls alike – as it could suggest an even stronger service management focus for the company over the long-term, perhaps shifting Salesforce from historically being the “CRM” company of the past to the “Service” company of the future.I would like to state, however, there is another interpretation of the data provided by the company in Figure 9 and Figure 5. If, in fact, Salesforce’s growth will ultimately mirror those estimated across its markets, then expected growth may be “front-loaded” in that growth may start to slow – significantly – after FY ’20. I have no idea if this will be the case; only that it is possible if my previous statement winds up being true (i.e. Salesforce’s growth will ultimately mirror those estimated across its markets). Of course, it is also possible Salesforce will exceed growth rates in all its markets for years to come.I should also state here that Salesforce does not provide earnings data for its individual business segments. Accordingly, the impressive revenue growth discussed thus far may mask a consistently unprofitable operation. Obviously, without the data, it is not possible to know.With our background on Service Cloud from the previous section, we can now better analyze the points discussed in the Salesforce-Evercore ISI interview, which is the main interest of this analysis. To reiterate from the Introduction, the interview occurred between Mr. Bill Patterson, Executive Vice President and General Manager for Service Cloud at Salesforce.com, and Mr. Kirk Materne, Senior Managing Director/Fundamental Research Analyst at Evercore ISI.Broadly speaking, the interview questions dwell in three areas: (1) dynamics driving demand for Service Cloud; (2) the competitive landscape; and (3) platform innovations. Below, I attempt to organize the key points discussed during the interview within each of these 3 areas, even when those points might have been mentioned at different times during the interview itself. To reiterate, I strongly encourage readers to review the actual interview transcript for their own reference.With that said, let us dive into each area and discuss the responses provided by Mr. Patterson.3.1 Demand DynamicsMr. Patterson highlights a variety of points driving Service Cloud demand:a. Companies (i.e. Salesforce customers) seeking to differentiate themselves on the basis of superior customer service, particularly as the products/services they provide become increasingly commoditized. Mr. Patterson makes particular note of field service management and Salesforce’s acquisition of ClickSoftware when elaborating on this point.b. Companies seeking growth (revenue/profits) via improved customer service.c. Companies attempting to lower costs/expenses via improved/streamlined customer service.d. The introduction of new 5G-enabled devices which may drive increased demand for field service solutions.These trends are logical, if a bit high-level. Mr. Materne does ask Mr. Patterson to provide some narrower (i.e. drill-down) commentary around demand dynamics, alongside the higher-level macro trends, but the discussion does not quite get there. Mr. Patterson notes at the end of one of his responses that:In regard to the reference of cost savings, it would be useful to have Salesforce expand on how its price-point-to-feature-set value proposition may be/is superior to the competition. I do think Mr. Patterson possibly hints at this later in the interview, without stating it directly, when he notes:I think one of the things Salesforce has done well over its life is to capture the long-tail of enterprise business – i.e. those business opportunities much smaller in size, but greater in number than the “traditional” enterprise business sought by larger competitors such as Oracle and SAP. I, for one, would be eager to know if the company believes itself to have some kind of sustainable competitive advantage here, as well as the higher end of the tail, given that they are hardly alone in either area of the market.Overall, the macro demands for service management seem quite good moving forward, but I’m not clear on demand drivers for Service Cloud specifically.3.2 Competitive LandscapeAs with the discussion around demand, Mr. Patterson makes a few different points on the competitive landscape:a. “Pen-and-paper” customers (i.e. lack of digitization) still represents a barrier-to-entry for service management solutions.b. Competitive solutions are more focused on the transactional nature of service management (e.g. scheduling a resource or service appointment), as opposed to creating a favorable customer service experience via the aggregation and analysis of the whole of customer data.c. Service management is both a horizontal and vertical “game”. There are opportunities to innovate/compete in (narrow) verticals, as well as opportunities to pollinate similar capabilities across multiple verticals.d. Salesforce is seeing varied competitive dynamics across geographies, with commerce-centric service management needs dominating in North America, field-service management dominating in Europe, and more broad service management needs growing in Asia-Pacific as a result of new(er) digital consumer channels.As is often the case, the competitive landscape appears to offer good opportunities, but no “layups” for Salesforce and Service Cloud. With respect to the “pen-and-paper” aspect of the competitive landscape, Mr. Patterson offers:My impression from his comments is that he believes a significant amount of white-space still exists within the broader service management market. If the TAM estimate of $29 BB from Figure 4 is accurate, then there could be billions of untapped service management market opportunity for Salesforce to capture. Of course, all of Salesforce’s competitors will be chasing after those opportunities as well, and I would expect competitors like Oracle and SAP – who have traditionally chased larger enterprise opportunities – to push deeper into Salesforce’s domain of mid-size and small transactions (as, for example, with Oracle NetSuite). Again, Mr. Patterson does not say it directly, but his comments around the transactional-nature of Salesforce’s competition (see point “b” above) suggest how the company believes it can attack and win against its competitors within these white-space opportunities, as well as displacement opportunities. He states:I understand what Mr. Patterson is saying, but I’m fuzzy on Salesforce/Service Cloud’s particular advantage here. In my (humble) opinion, the notion of the “360-degree” customer view is a tired cliché in enterprise software. The idea has been around for ages, and everyone uses it. Consider the following from Oracle NetSuite’s webpage on their competing service management solution:Figure 9: Oracle NetSuite Customer Service ManagementSource: www.netsuite.comHere is a page from Informatica, who uses the concept of a 360-degree customer view for its Master Data Management offering:Figure 10: Informatica Master Data ManagementSource: www.informatica.comOf course, I could go on and on. But my point is that Salesforce’s claims of providing a superior platform to aggregate, manage and exploit multiple sources of customer data seems a bit light, at least in the context of this interview. With that said, perhaps customers can build out more comprehensive customer engagement platforms faster, easier, and more cost effectively with Service Cloud for any number of reasons; but it would be helpful to have Salesforce make such statements clearly and directly, with both quantitative and qualitative evidence based on experience. I should mention the Salesforce Customer 360 initiative is a key part of its broader business strategy, and I discuss it more in Section 3.3.Mr. Patterson rightly points out the opportunity for the company to innovate both horizontally and vertically with Service Cloud. He notes the company has 4 vertical solutions today:Again, all of Salesforce’s competitors are following the same playbook here, and some – such as Oracle and SAP – have many more years of industry-specific experience/technology, along with an arguably more granular set of industry verticals. My personal belief is that the most successful software application providers of tomorrow will be those that can efficiently and effectively tailor their offerings to increasingly narrow vertical segments, as customers seek out greater specializations to differentiate their own businesses from their competitors. I do think Salesforce has had some historical advantages here given how the original CRM platform was designed and delivered – it was purposely designed to be fast and easy to customize. So, theoretically, Salesforce should be able to continue to take advantage of this competitive dynamic moving forward. That being said, I suspect that Service Cloud may lack substantial moats against competing solutions and we are not offered any specific features/data in the interview to suggest otherwise.3.3 Platform InnovationsI remarked in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 that I find the interview lacking in specificity, for example, around the demand drivers distinctive to Service Cloud or those features providing a unique advantage for its vertical industry solutions. Perhaps we can find some of that detail in a review of the areas where Salesforce is concentrating its innovation effort for the platform. Broadly, Mr. Patterson touches upon 4 topics: artificial intelligence (Einstein), Mulesoft, Tableau, and the company’s Customer 360 initiative.In regard to artificial intelligence, Mr. Patterson is asked to elaborate on those “opportunities to go deeper in AI”. He responds that Salesforce “[centers their] innovation thoughts” around 3 areas when it comes to artificial intelligence: (1) deflection technology, (2) routine systems technology, and (3) call optimization and prediction. I generalize each of these drawing upon Mr. Patterson’s commentary:In a sense, all three of these areas could be considered variations of the same theme, namely recommender systems. Thus, they are not purely separate from one another. Mr. Patterson provides “time” as one of the distinctions between implementing a call optimization solution versus a routine systems technology solution, meaning the former involves more design, setup and implementation work.So, what makes Salesforce different/better here? Surely, none of what is mentioned above is unique to the company. Mr. Patterson suggests that some Einstein-related capabilities are “very easy to get up and going and get up and running”. That may be true, especially for those customers who are deeply invested in a Salesforce.com stack, and may thus benefit from some kind of “plug-and-play” advantages. In the case of routine systems technology, Mr. Patterson notes:While this makes for a good soundbite, I am a bit skeptical of this claim. Good recommendation systems require expertise, training and tuning. Consider that while writing this article, I decided to engage with Salesforce.com’s Einstein-enabled service bot on the main website. Here is a set of screenshots which capture my interaction, with the Einstein service bot messages in grey and my message in blue:Figure 11: My Interaction With Salesforce.com’s Einstein-Enabled Service Bot – Part 1Source: Yves SukhuFigure 12: My Interaction With Salesforce.com's Einstein-Enabled Service Bot – Part 2Source: Yves SukhuAs you can see, I made one request which was to get more information on Service Cloud, to which the automated bot was unable to respond effectively. You don’t have to be an expert in recommender systems to know that the bot should have been able to parse “Service Cloud” from my message and at least “guess” that I am asking about that specific subject, at which point it could have suggested some related web links, articles, Salesforce.com resources, etc. To reiterate, Mr. Patterson claimed above that this kind of “intelligence” is available out-of-box with Service Cloud, but yet the Einstein-related offering doesn’t seem to be very effective here.Mr. Patterson also discusses the value of MuleSoft, which Salesforce.com acquired last year, in the context of Service Cloud. He explains:The scenario is valid, but hardly anything new. The case that he describes is one of the most common for any middleware stack, whether that be MuleSoft, Oracle Fusion Middleware, IBM WebSphere, Microsoft BizSpark, Red Hat Middleware, etc. My point in mentioning so many stacks is to emphasize that the scenario on its own is not representative of any real differentiation – or innovation for that matter – that Salesforce/Service Cloud has.Mr. Patterson ties the general themes above to the company’s Customer 360 initiative. An unidentified analyst who participated in the interview, aside from Mr. Materne, made a request to understand the “key pieces of the initiative”, to which Mr. Patterson offered 3 areas of focus:I would stress that there is nothing original or special in these descriptions; and, at the risk of further repeating myself, these kinds of use case descriptions have been around for so long and are so overused, I am a little disappointed as an investor that Salesforce seems to struggle to describe their business value in novel ways. There may be something original or special in the underlying technology, but we are given nothing in that regard in this interview. Given my “little” experiment with the Salesforce.com website bot mentioned earlier, I am increasingly flustered in regard to what exactly Salesforce brings to the table.Tableau, which the company just acquired in July, is mentioned only briefly toward the end of the interview. Mr. Patterson indicates that he is unable to discuss Tableau-Service Cloud innovations in any detail given that the acquisition is so new. He offers a simple use case exploiting Tableau to visualize service-related data, but I do not feel it offered anything compelling to mention it here. I leave it to the reader to review Mr. Patterson’s response.The interview questions posed by Mr. Materne were not exactly challenging, and I recognize they were not meant to be – it was a cordial, friendly interview. However, the result was a discussion that offers investors superficial answers as to the unique value proposition offered by Service Cloud.As an investor contemplating the prospects of this segment, my main takeaways – which are really personal inferences – are:The last bullet is, of course, quite concerning -- and I’m sure the company disagrees wholeheartedly with my assessment. But, I reiterate something I said earlier and pose it here as a question: if Salesforce is seemingly struggling to describe their business in unique and novel ways, is it unique and novel? I concede that with Dreamforce around the corner, perhaps good answers to this question are forthcoming.Despite what I just said, some sideline investors might be encouraged sufficiently by Service Cloud's impressive revenue growth, and the possibility that the business might overtake the CRM segment in the next few years as I modeled in Section 2.0. I, personally, would like to explore additional data on the business, with the hope that the company may also consider the provision of segment-specific earnings data.crm_q3_fy2020_analyst_interview_with_evercore_isi.pdfcrm_q4_fy2019_earnings_presentation.pdf"
4291773,69905,2019-09-16T11:05:42-04:00,"Discussing Salesforce's management.Salesforce is acquisition hungry, but so are others.Shareholders will be better off to call it a day here.","Salesforce (CRM) was once a stock market darling which could do no wrong.In fact, countless times, I would see in the comments section of my articles that I was a great contrarian indicator: read my articles and do the opposite, was often stated.It is possible, that once again this is yet another contrarian indicator. But I felt it worthwhile reporting my point of view nonetheless.Because even though I was (with the very helpful benefit of hindsight), too early calling a top to Salesforce, it appears to me, notwithstanding this past week's rally, that Salesforce's shares are unchanged over the past year. Also, that Salesforce has underperformed the S&P 500 (SPY) over the same period.Overall, I posit that the risk-reward balance has turned negative and that investors are better off to sidestep this investment, for now.(Source)There was a time that whenever Salesforce would make an acquisition, co-CEO Marc Benioff would go off on some financial media outlet and pronounce his clear vision, and the stock would jump. Time and time again, fanatic (and often emotional) shareholders would then proceed to exult praises over this company.The problem, however, is that acquisition-led growth is a very challenging game.First off, common sense. You are having to make continuously bigger acquisitions to move the needle.Secondly, you are less and less likely to find bargains the bigger the acquisitions become. These bigger companies, for instance, Tableau, which was acquired for just under $16 billion, are much more likely to be fairly priced.Thirdly, the vast majority of acquisitions fail to be deemed a success. Why? Because you have corporate cultures which often don't get along. You have a very aggressive entrepreneurial company, which is the reason it got acquired in the first instance, and then, they are asked to take a back seat to the acquiring company? No wonder why most acquisitions fail. Of course, this is not to mention, that many times, synergies between the two are close to nonexistent.Fourthly, when numerous companies are essentially playing in the same pond, as other players have been doing for a while, the fish become quite scarce.All in all, this sort of growth-led inorganic growth is a strategy which works well, until it doesn't.The game for Salesforce is singularly focused on one crucial aspect: revenue growth. Anything after that is up for grabs. But at all costs revenue growth must continue.Does it matter that shareholders are getting heavily diluted? Not really. For as long as its top line continues to grow by approximately 26%, little else matters. What about non-GAAP adjusted EPS? And the fact that this is only looking to grow at the top end by 3% year-over-year in fiscal 2020? No, that doesn't matter either.Furthermore, Salesforce will continue to recommend that investors focus on its strong operating cash flow because this does not account for its main cost, which is payment in stock, and also it does not factor in its expensive acquisitions.Source: SEC filings, author's calculationsIn the above graph, I have assumed that stock-based acquisitions are a 'real' cost to shareholders, and I've also netted out strategic investments.Even if this sounds a little complicated, don't worry. If readers simply have a vague understanding of the overall trend is, that the bigger Salesforce becomes, the bigger the loops it has to jump through to grow its top line, that's enough.As I've highlighted several times throughout, it's not only Salesforce which is playing this game. Many of its peers, for example, Cloudera (CLDR) are involved in this same endeavor of using M&A to bolster their top-lines.So it is perhaps understandable why, when looking at the above table, Salesforce does not stick out as particularly outlandishly overvalued.To be absolutely clear, I'm in no way arguing that Salesforce is anything less than an amazing company.My whole assertion revolves around the fact that even though Salesforce has been a very good investment over the past several years, and has amply rewarded shareholders, that going forward from this point it will offer investors an increasingly negative risk-reward profile.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive emails of my latest research, please click ""Follow"" at the top of this article."
4291084,20521,2019-09-11T19:31:22-04:00,"Salesforce.com recently closed the $15.3 billion acquisition of Tableau in an all stock deal, the largest deal in its history.Early last month, Salesforce.com announced plans to acquire field service company ClickSoftware for $1.35 billion in a cash and stock deal.Last year, it had acquired MuleSoft, a hybrid API management service provider, for $6.5 billion.","According to Gartner, worldwide spending on customer experience and relationship management software grew 15.6% to reach $48.2 billion in 2018. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), which is the leader in the CRM market with 19.5% share, recently reported a strong quarter and raised its forecast following its recent acquisitions.Salesforce's second quarter revenues grew 22% over the year to $4 billion, ahead of analyst estimates of $3.95 billion. Adjusted EPS was $0.66, compared with the Street's forecast of $0.47 for the quarter.By segment, Subscription and Support revenues grew 22% to $3.75 billion. Professional Services and Other revenues grew 14% to $2552 million.Within the Subscription segment, revenue from Sales Cloud grew 12.5% to $1.13 billion, Service Cloud grew 22% to $1.09 billion and Marketing and Commerce Cloud grew 36% to $616 million.By region, revenue from Americas grew 20.4% to $2.82 billion, Europe grew 25% to 786 million, and Asia Pacific grew 25.8% to $395 million.Cash generated from operations for the second quarter was $436 million, down 5%. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the second quarter was $6.04 billion.For the third quarter, Salesforce forecast revenues of $4.44-$4.45 billion with an adjusted EPS of $0.65-$0.66. The market was looking for revenues of $3.93 billion with an adjusted EPS of $0.63. Salesforce raised its FY2020 guidance to revenue of $16.75-$16.9 billion from a range of $16.1-$16.25 billion. This raised estimate includes revenue of $550 million to $600 million from the acquisition of Tableau, $200 million from the purchase of Salesforce.org earlier this year and $25 million from the most recent acquisition of ClickSoftware. Adjusted EPS for the full year is expected to be $2.82-$2.84, down from the previous guidance of $2.88-$2.90. The Street has forecast revenues of $16.86 billion with an EPS of $2.85 for the year.Early last month, Salesforce announced plans to acquire field service company ClickSoftware for $1.35 billion in a cash and stock deal. The acquisition is expected to improve the Salesforce Field Service Lightning offering for mobile workforces launched in 2016. Founded in 1997, Israel-based ClickSoftware has over 15,400 customers including Bosch, Deutsche Telecom, Ericsson, and Unisys. It has an estimated annual revenue of $213 million.Salesforce recently closed the $15.3 billion acquisition of Tableau in an all stock deal, the largest deal in its history. Founded in 2003, Tableau had recently reported quarterly revenues of $282.5 million and non-GAAP net income of $2 million. Tableau had forecast revenues of $1.34-$1.40 billion for the year with an EPS of $1.58-$1.85.Tableau, with a healthy portfolio of 86,000 customers, is expected to improve the analytics capabilities of Salesforce Customer 360, enabling its customers to accelerate innovation and make smarter decisions across every part of their business. By including Tableau's capabilities in Customer 360, Salesforce believes that it will be able to provide companies with a complete view of customers across every touchpoint including sales, service, and marketing. Together with Einstein, the Tableau acquisition is expected to enable Salesforce to offer a complete AI-powered analytics platform.I think this is a bold addition by Salesforce to mark its emphasis on the Analytics segment. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and SAP (NYSE:SAP) sell their BI offerings to the enterprise customer as part of a bundle and have managed to make deep inroads into the market. Tableau has been a fast growing threat to them, and with Salesforce's might, it becomes a bigger competitor.Additionally, Salesforce also acknowledges the importance of a hybrid offering and Tableau's addition will help it build its presence into that environment. This is not the first hybrid player that Salesforce has acquired in the recent past. Last year, it had acquired MuleSoft, a hybrid API management service provider, for $6.5 billion.Its stock is trading at $151.07 with a market capitalization of $132.5 billion. It had touched a record high of $167.57 earlier in April. It hit a 52-week low of $113.60 in December last year."

        The numbers were solid.  Guidance was raised albeit inclusive of the Tableau acquisition.
        The stock was a green dot in a sea of tariff-inspired red.
        Market risk is increasing - Salesforce is holding its value - we're still at Buy - Long Term Hold - but again be careful with position sizes.","DISCLAIMER: This article is not directed at, nor intended to be relied upon by any UK recipients.

Cestrian Capital Research Inc or its employees or the author of this article or related persons may have a position in any investments mentioned in this article. Any opinions or probabilities expressed in this report are those of the author as of the article date of publication and are subject to change without notice.We posted a susbcriber-only earnings preview on Salesforce (CRM) last Wednesday, heading into earnings. We said that we expected Salesforce to hit or beat earnings (historically they almost always do) and that whilst still at Buy - Long Term Hold, we felt no need to add to our position pre earnings because the stock is rangebound, reluctant to cross $160 at the top end and undecided whether it can stay above $145 or whether it wants to drop to the $130/share support-resistance level.Naturally we're not always right - but we're happy with our call on this one. Announcing Thursday after the close, CRM beat and raised (although the raised guidance was net of the Tableau (DATA) acquisition - so really it ought to have raised, anything less would be a poor outlook), and the stock flirted with $158/share but didn't trouble $160. On Friday the stock was holding up fairly well until the tariff tweeting caused all screens everywhere to turn various shades of red. It settled at around $152/share on Friday.Now, the quarter was a good one. Revenue in the quarter grew 22% vs. the same quarter last year (23% at constant currency). EBITDA before stock-based comp, similar growth rate. Net debt much improved.Here's the movements versus the same time last year.So far so good.Now, as our regular readers know, we like to look at the slow-burn effect of each quarter. And one of our favorite ways to do so is to look at the change in TTM revenues and earnings.Here's CRM's movement in its TTMs.We've attempted a little ad-hoc color coding here. There's no science to it. Yellow means - growth looking slower; green means - growth looking better.This quarter there are only yellow boxes. So we're going to keep a close eye on these TTMs. They don't move quickly of course - that's the benefit of TTM, it's a flywheel kind of measure. But you know how flywheels are. Once they slow down they take a whole lot of effort to speed up again.The beauty of CRM's business model is its flywheel nature. Upfront orders, cash, recognize earnings over the longer term. But that means there are no heroic quarters to save an ailing year. So we don't want to see a slowdown here. We think the raised guidance is a wash - it includes a big acquisition so it very much should have been raised, because the company - ie. shareholders - have paid for that raise by making the acquisition.So. Good quarter. Not brilliant quarter. A little yellow flag here or there. We still feel good but we're keeping watch on that flywheel.Together with a modest improvement in its net debt position, and the fall in its share price even net of the Q2 impact, this means CRM's valuation is in-line with its position when we went to Buy - Long Term Hold on 25 July, yellow flags notwithstanding - and that's before the acquisitions of Click and DATA are pro-forma'd in.Here's how the valuation has moved since our move to Buy, using reported numbers, not pro forma.On a TTM revenue or TTM EBITDA (pre stock-based comp) basis, the multiples are up a touch due to the big step up in share count resulting from recent acquisitions. But again, we've only used reported numbers here - once the acquisitions are pro forma'd in, these multiples will look a little better. And our confidence in the business is little changed - we remain positive on its outlook. Our next note will work through the pro formas for you and look at what that increased share count has bought. That note will be with you in a day or two.We still rate CRM very highly and we're still at Buy - Long Term Hold. We think the performance is going to hold up and we think the stock can break out given a stable market once worries about the DATA deal subside (which they will, if CRM keeps hitting or beating its quarters).But the market is extremely jittery right now. We've commented a lot of late about the push & pull factors affecting the market. You have the Administration pursuing a short-term-harmful trade policy (perhaps it will be long-term-beneficial, who knows) and doing its best to compensate for that with a short-term-beneficial monetary policy of rate cuts. The Fed is kind of tagging along but not really playing ball. One rate cut does not make a supportive monetary policy given the trade offensive. The Administration has said that it is envious of Germany's practice of issuing sovereign bonds at negative interest rates. That tells you that the Administration would prefer negative interest rate bonds itself, in order to play the trade war with China longer. Whether this happens or not, we suspect neither the Administration, the Fed or China knows right now. But this is the market game at present, and any individual stock is just caught in the jetwash.We think if you want to add to CRM at this price it's a good bet vs. other stocks out there. We think the growth will hold up and over a multi-year period it can be a big winner. But market conditions say to us - go easy on position size. Keep plenty of cash on hand. Wait before you go all-in. In our view better to miss a short-term dip than to go in big and find that you're staring down into the abyss.

        We remain at Buy - Long Term Hold.","DISCLAIMER: This article is not directed at, nor intended to be relied upon by any UK recipients.

Any opinions or probabilities expressed in this report are those of the author as of the article date of publication and are subject to change without notice.We initiated on Salesforce (CRM) in July in our note here. We observed that the market tends to dislike CRM's large acquisitions and the stock often sits in the doldrums for a while as a result. These were the charts we used to show this. They cover CRM's 2018 acquisition of Mulesoft (MULE) and 2019 acquisition of Tableau (DATA). Click Software is a much smaller acquisition than MULE or DATA. It's a $1.3bn acquisition of a private equity-backed field service management software business that sells into the major enterprise verticals such as utilities, communications, healthcare and so on. Being a private US / Israeli company, financials aren't published. But we would expect 2019 revenues of somewhere between $130-260m based on the acquisition price - that would mean the purchase price was struck in the range 5-10x current year revenue. Salesforce itself has guided to 2019 revenue of around $16-17bn, so Click's revenues won't move the needle all that much. We'd expect that at scale, Click could generate operating margins in the 20-30% range, meaning contribution to CRM of $26m - $78m once the target has been properly integrated, in say a year.So this acquisition is business as usual and shouldn't take a great deal of management diversion to integrate. Despite which, we think it will continue to act to suppress CRM's stock price.We remain at Buy - Long Term Hold on CRM. We think the sustained 20-25% revenue growth at this size of company is remarkable, and we see no sign that growth will slow materially.A word on position size. We're proposing caution on any buys right now. The market is choppy for large, difficult, geopolitical reasons and in truth it could go any way at any day. We think that support-resistance lines in individual stocks can provide a guide to position building. Right now, CRM's stock can't decide whether it wants to head up above the $145/share support/resist line, or down to the $130/share line. At the time of writing, the stock is sat at around $140/share. At that price we're confident to apply the Buy rating but again we say - don't pile in all in one go. Our horizon here is long-term, 3+ year hold - we're not trying to make a quick turn on the stock, we want to build a position at opportune moments and then ride the upside from what we think will be continued sound growth.Cestrian Capital Research, Inc - 12 August 2019.Salesforce.com: More Cash In The Cloud Than You Might Think"
4286388,103711,2019-08-22T11:00:00-04:00,CRM is best of breed in the management of customer relationships.I expect operating leverage to lead to massive earnings growth over the next decade.CRM is a strong buy.,"Salesforce (CRM) is a titan among ""Cloud"" plays and for good reason: it's a best-of-breed operator in a critically important industry. This is a company which has done well to steal the ""CRM"" market from incumbents and never looked back. I rate shares a strong buy on the basis of anticipated operating leverage and their attractive valuation.CRM is in the customer relationship management (""CRM"") market. Customer relationship management has been the fastest growing segment in enterprise software (enterprise software is just software used by companies as opposed to individuals):(2018 Investor Day)Customer relationship management is just what it sounds like - CRM helps its clients improve their sales relationships with prospective customers, manage relationships with existing customers, manage their marketing strategies with their customers, manage and analyze the commerce experience for their customers and much more. Salesforce has sought to provide ""the most complete"" CRM offerings by creating a very complete portfolio of various product offerings for pretty much every CRM-related use case:(2018 Investor Day)Salesforce is a ""cloud"" company, which means that its customers access CRM products over the internet instead of having to download or install software. This is hugely advantageous because it means that Salesforce is able to deliver product upgrades seamlessly to customers and further charge its customers on a recurring subscription basis. Salesforce has used this as well as its strong portfolio offerings to become the runaway market leader in the customer relationship management space:(2019 Q1 Presentation)We can see its market share breakdown by product platform below. Sales and service are its more mature platforms, and CRM currently sees the most rapid growth from marketing and commerce:(2019 Q1 Presentation)To no surprise, CRM has been able to grow revenues at a remarkable pace and continues to guide for 20% CAGR moving forward:(2018 Investor Day)Its strong growth looks set to continue as the total addressable market is very large at $142 billion and growing:(2019 Q1 Presentation)CRM reported strong earnings recently with revenues growing 24% year over year (""YOY""):(2019 Q1 Presentation)CRM has guided for around 21% revenue growth this year, which is remarkable for a company of this size. Investors should be optimistic about operating leverage as CRM is actually already profitable on a GAAP basis with $1.43 in GAAP EPS for 2018, though I note that gains on investments accounted for $542 million or $0.70 of that. Its high ~75% gross margins makes it promising to hope for significant operating leverage as increases in gross profits should eventually begin to outpace increases in operating expenses. CRM appears to offer the best of both worlds in a rapidly growing tech company with actual profits.CRM has a solid balance sheet with $4.1 billion in cash and equivalents versus $3.2 billion in long-term debt. Furthermore, on a non-GAAP basis, CRM is highly free cash flow positive, so I do not see any red flags from its balance sheet. Note that the recently closed acquisition of Tableau (DATA) was an all-stock deal and thus I don't expect it to materially change these numbers beyond the cash from DATA's balance sheet. As of its latest quarterly filing, DATA had about $1 billion in cash and equivalents on the balance sheet so perhaps it would have about $5 billion in cash and equivalents on a pro-forma basis.For the current 2020 fiscal year, CRM is guiding for $16.18 billion in revenues at the midpoint, $2.99 in non-GAAP EPS, and $0.79 in GAAP EPS. As we saw before, however, GAAP EPS includes unrealized gains on strategic investments, and non-GAAP EPS adds back share-based compensation - so the ""real EPS"" is something slightly below GAAP EPS. This sales number also does not appear to break out how much is ""subscription and support"" versus ""professional services and other,"" which is important because as we can see below, the former has high gross margins around 80% and the latter doesn't really make money:(2018 10-K)This makes calculating a valuation based on revenues a little muddier, and I am surprised that management didn't directly give guidance for software and subscription revenue directly. Nonetheless, as we will see below, the level of undervaluation at CRM is so pronounced that it doesn't really matter.Based on a projected 809 million shares outstanding and the aforementioned guidance, CRM has $16.19 in trailing sales per share (counting only subscription and support revenues) and $20.0 in forward sales per share (including professional services and other). CRM trades at around 8.8 times trailing sales and 7.1 times forward sales. That's quite cheap for a stock still seeing 20% revenue growth.Salesforce has given a long-term revenue target of $21 to $23 billion in FY22 and $26 to $28 billion in FY23. To be clear, FY23 would mean the year 2022. That represents roughly a 20% revenue CAGR for the next three years. I anticipate CRM to achieve 30% operating margins in the future due to its high gross margins. Based on this assumption, my fair value range is a price to sales of somewhere between 11 and 25 (equivalent to roughly 37 to 83 times ""earnings,"" based on 30% operating margins). At the midpoint of around 18 times sales, CRM has tremendous upside from its 8.8 times trailing revenue base from multiple expansion alone, and this is before factoring in its guidance for 20% revenue growth. 18 times sales would reflect a price to earnings multiple of 60 times assuming 30% operating margins, which is arguably reasonable considering that 20% revenue growth at 80% gross margins and full operating leverage (no increase in operating expenses) would lead to earnings growth of greater than 100% based on 2018 numbers. An investment in CRM thus requires conviction that its best-of-breed model will lead to operating leverage through high sustained revenue growth for years to come - if it can do that, then shares look just too cheap at 8.8 times trailing sales. At 18 times trailing sales CRM would trade at $291, or more than 100% higher than where shares currently trade. Even at 11 times sales, the lower limit of what I consider reasonable valuations for CRM, shares would trade at $178, about 24% higher than current prices.Marc Benioff is the founder and co-CEO of CRM, and is considered a real visionary. He owns a considerable stake in CRM at 4.7% of shares outstanding:(2019 Proxy)I like seeing companies led by leaders with large share ownership because it means that management is incentivized to act on behalf of shareholders.CRM does derive a significant amount of revenues from overseas, which lends itself to currency risk:(2018 10-K)That said CRM has noted very little direct exposure to China, so at the very least it is not directly exposed to trade war risk.A huge assumption in my valuation is future operating leverage - if CRM's TAM is overstated, then it is possible that revenue growth cannot outpace operating expense growth fast enough to make the big difference to the bottom line that I am projecting. That said, given that CRM is already GAAP profitable, I feel that the risk here is much less than with other high-flying tech names as the ""break even"" point has already arrived and what's left looks like just lots of profit for shareholders.CRM operates in a competitive space among competitors with deep wallets. If competition were to catch up in product offerings or be able to effectively compete on price, then CRM might see pricing pressures and pressured revenue growth. This hasn't been the case so far, however, and due to CRM's cloud software model, its software is upgraded continuously so customers always have the up-to-date version of their product. Furthermore, CRM arguably has very high switching costs as customers typically build applications using the CRM platform, making themselves quite entrenched in the CRM ecosystem.CRM is best of breed in the customer relationship management space and looks poised to see strong earnings growth in the coming years from the fruits of operating leverage. If this thesis is correct, then CRM could see significant upside as it does not appear that operating leverage has been priced into the stock. I rate shares a strong buy.(TipRanks: Buy CRM)"

The current correction isn’t really a surprise – we’ve seen material pullbacks after every market all-time-high over the last couple of years. The speed and magnitude of this correction is significant, however, and the factors at work are serious and geopolitical in nature. It's not a nothingburger.On the one hand, in the bull corner, you have a US Administration which surely desires an up market in the approach to the 2020 election. Hence their desire for low interest rates, low corporate taxes, and so forth. The downward pressure on the Fed is political in nature, as always - such pressure is not unique to this Administration.On the other hand, in the bear corner, you have a Chinese Administration which is settling in for the long haul. They have their own challenges in Hong Kong and we assume they want to demonstrate resolve on that front and resolve on the US trade war front too. The headlines are all about currency devaluation (in truth – a lessening of currency support). The big deal which folks aren’t paying enough attention to in our view is the decision to halt US agricultural purchases. That’s going to hurt the US economy and it’s going to hurt the US Administration.So the New World is going to be in a tussle with the New New World for a while yet. This is a struggle which in our view is going to play out over decades, not months or years. The US has held sway in the world order since 1945 and particularly since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989. China has designs on world leadership; in its favor is sheer size, population growth, the growth of the middle class, its credit position, and its political system which means it isn’t tied to electoral cycles and short-term behavior. That said, China’s political system is also its biggest hindrance - historically it isn’t a system that has achieved sustainable geopolitical supremacy, for reasons that could fill a library.Nobody knows how this is going to play out. Generally speaking, democratic capitalist economies have been the horse to ride for a while now and our guess is that will continue to be the case for at least our own lifetime. So our own view is this current episode is une crise du jour rather than the beginning of the end. With that context in mind let’s now turn to more immediate concerns.We Don’t Love Blanket “Buy The Dip”Blanket “Buy The Dip” is a good strategy only if you have blind faith in a positive outcome from the long- and near-term future, unlimited liquidity and exceptional psychological resilience. If you fall into that category, we salute you. You could well be stupendously rich as a result of it.Speaking for ourselves we like to get a little more granular in our analysis. We go stock by stock at times like these. And we use the fundamentals as our touchstone.Fast Twitch, Slow BurnWe’re long-term, fundamentals driven in nature. Our approach to investing is slow burn, not fast twitch. We make no claims for the supremacy of this method, there are many ways to make money from stocks and if you’re winning by any (legal) method at all, kudos to you.If you want to win by trading, we believe you need to be fast-twitch in your approach. That means paying attention at all times. It’s a full time always-on job. Even if you only trade US equities, with today’s premarket and after-hours trading, that’s a long and intense working day.Most folks can’t be always-on – they have other things they need do during the day or night. It could be work for an employer, it could be pick up the kids from school, it could be sweep the yard. Anything that takes you away from a screen is a challenge if your moneymaking method is trading.The reason we adopt a slow-burn method is because we think that’s more compatible with most people’s lives. In the absence of being always-on, we think a good strategy is to pick fundamentally strong companies, buy in at opportune moments, take it stepwise with position sizes, and hold for the long term until such time as you want or need the liquidity.Turning now to Salesforce.Salesforce Has Been A Successful Growth Play For 20 YearsHere’s CRM’s chart since its IPO in 2004. No surprise, up and to the right in a fairly remarkable fashion. You know this already. We said in our initiating coverage note (Salesforce.com: More Cash In The Cloud Than You Might Think) that this company is basically a giant growth equity play even beyond $100bn market cap.What we think is very interesting at this time is the stock’s performance vs. its own 200-day simple moving average. It has rarely stayed below the 200-day SMA for very long, and when it has been down below that line, it usually corresponds with macro crises. We aren’t saying the company is perfect, every business has its issues and can miss on any given earnings day or year. We are saying that over the last fifteen years the stock has swooned when the world turns ugly, only to recover and continue its trajectory of direct ascent. So whilst none of us can know the future, we think it’s a good bet that the stock will do the same in response to the current macro crisis.Source: Ycharts.com, Cestrian AnalysisCRM’s Support-Resistance LinesIf you’re a follower or member of ours, you know that we like to use very simple charts to support our analysis. You know that we respect all manner of more complex tools. But here’s the simple support-resistance lines for CRM. (As we said yesterday in our note on Iridium (IRDM), this simplistic approach is not sufficiently granular for complex trading strategies, but it’s a useful guide for slow-burn long-term investing).Over the last three years, the market’s muscle memory seems to kick in at c.$145/share, c.$130/share, and c.$115/share. Those are the rough support/resistance levels where reversals seem to take place.Source: Ycharts.com, Cestrian AnalysisSo if you want to take a slow-burn approach, don’t mind riding out a little pain, and if you entered the stock lately at a higher price and can stomach averaging down rather then selling out, wearing the loss and planning to enter at a lower price in the future, then you might think about adding at or around these muscle-memory points. We ourselves plan to do so on a personal account basis.History as we all know is no guide to the future. But the 200-day SMA chart above tells us that CRM has ridden out some pretty tough spells. We’re old enough to remember the 2008 crisis as an adult and if you’re not, we can tell you, that was pretty worrying for any self-respecting capitalist. We think China vs. the US is a big deal and we think it can play longer and harder than most folks in the US realize. But we still think CRM can succeed and we think an opportune moment may be upon us. As we write, the stock is sat at $138 in premarket. $130 or $145 may be next – more likely $130 in our view.We remain at Buy – Long Term Hold but suggest you watch the stock’s performance vs those resistance lines carefully. And if it’s not clear from the above, we would urge caution as regards position sizes. If you’re playing a long game you have to keep your resources available to you – it’s not wise to bet the farm on any one purchase, no matter how appealing a dip you think it might be. What looks like a dip can be an abyss – nobody knows. So we believe in taking it stepwise.

Other SaaS companies can only dream of the success that Salesforce.com has had over its 20 years of life. Salesforce.com still achieves 20+% annual revenue growth and this level of performance is expected to continue for several years to come.(Source: Salesforce.com)According to Morningstar.com, Salesforce.com has a wide economic moat and is a powerful value proposition.In my opinion, Salesforce.com stock is fairly valued on a relative basis and the company meets the software Rule of 40. And the company has the most complete enterprise software portfolio in the industry. For these reasons, I give Salesforce.com a buy rating as a growth-as-a-reasonable-price (GARP) investment.(Source: Salesforce.com)According to Salesforce.com management, the company has “gained more CRM market share than the other top vendors combined, 15 top vendors combined.”(Source: Salesforce.com)It seems logical to me that high-growth companies should be valued more highly than slow-growth companies. To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value (EV)/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 82 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"" also provided by Portfolio123.The reason for using analysts' estimates is because SaaS stocks tend to make a lot of acquisitions which can muddy the results of the scatter plot. The analyst estimates account for these acquisitions, and the estimates are updated frequently. This makes for a cleaner chart. The sales estimates, unlike EPS estimates, are usually quite accurate for most SaaS companies, except that they tend to be a little on the conservative side.I use an exponential best-fit trendline as it appears to be more appropriate than a linear trend line for this application. As sales growth goes up, the valuation goes up exponentially. The trendline was calculated using MS Excel. I consider the stocks sitting above the trendline to be overvalued, while stocks lying under the trendline are undervalued.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Salesforce.com is sitting on the trendline, suggesting that its EV/forward sales are similar to its peers on average, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Salesforce.com is fairly valued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the ""Rule of 40,"" free cash flow margin and cash burn.A rule of thumb often applied to software companies is the Rule of 40. This metric helps SaaS companies balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40;Growth: The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40 calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available, (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition, and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit: I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin, others use operational cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus profit adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.Salesforce.com had trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue growth of more than 25.7%. Revenue growth has been consistently around 25% since 2016.(Source: Portfolio123)Salesforce.com has a free cash flow margin TTM of 23.3% and consistently around 20% for several years.(Source: Portfolio123)Salesforce.com's YoY revenue growth was 25.7%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing twelve months was 23.3%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 25.7% + 23.3% = 49%Since the Rule of 40 calculation comes out higher than 40%, I conclude that Salesforce.com has a good balance between growth and profits and financially healthy.Normally, when a company fulfills the Rule of 40, I don’t analyze cash burn. But I am providing the SG&A expense here for reference. In the case of Salesforce.com, the SG&A expense is 68.3% of the total revenues. SG&A has been declining since 2014. Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)I have developed a new scatterplot showing forward annual sales growth estimate versus SG&A expense to sales for the stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. From the chart below it can be seen that there is some correlation between the two parameters. Based on where Salesforce.com sits on the scatterplot, I conclude that the company’s SG&A expense is quite normal given it’s expected future sales growth.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)I have added this section on the gross margin because of several comments on Zscaler Is A Stock To Watch where readers indicated that gross margin is one of the most important fundamental parameters and should have been covered.The scatterplot below shows a very weak correlation between gross margin and EV/forward sales growth. In general, gross margin does not explain why some SaaS stocks have extremely high valuations contrary to what some readers believe. In any case, Salesforce.com’s gross margin TTM of 81% is typical to slightly higher than average. (Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)There are many SaaS stocks with extremely high valuations, and it is possible that we could have a dot-com-like crash in the future. While I believe that Salesforce.com stock is fairly valued, it is relative valuation. If there is a market crash, I expect that Salesforce.com would crash as well.Stock-based compensation is somewhat obscene, with up to $1.44 billion worth of stock handed out to employees and the board of directors in 2019 alone.While the stock compensation is small compared to the company’s market capitalization, it is sizable compared to revenues and profits. This will become a problem during the next bear market as described in this excellent article.Please note the following legal action against the board of directors:Salesforce.com is the original SaaS after which all other SaaS companies are modeled after. The company has been in business for 20 years and is still growing more than 20% annually. This level of performance is expected to continue for the next few years, given the company has the most complete enterprise software portfolio in the industry. Salesforce.com has captured more market share than the other top 15 vendors combined.According to my unique valuation method, Salesforce.com is fairly valued relative to other SaaS companies. Salesforce.com also scores well on the Rule of 40 with a good combination of revenue growth and free cash flow. For these reasons, I give Salesforce.com a buy rating. This investment comes with risks, including the possibility of a dot-com-like market crash."
4277416,103639,2019-07-25T07:26:43-04:00,"We initiated coverage on Salesforce.com on 18 July.We said we thought the stock was a safe buy at the then-current price ($158 at the time of publication).We said that we would look for $150 to go to Buy, because we felt any adverse market reaction to Q2 earnings season could hand us that opportunity.The market has responded well to Q2 tech earnings and the incremental investment return in our model from waiting for a $150/share opportunity isn't sufficiently material to risk missing a move upwards.So we're now moving to Buy-Long Term Hold at market open on Thursday 25 July.","DISCLAIMER: This article is not directed at, nor intended to be relied upon by any UK recipients.

If you haven't seen it, we'd encourage you to read it. We're big believers in the future of CRM. There are risks of course - principally that if growth falters we think the stock has material downside, because this is in essence a giant growth equity play. But we think there's enough road ahead for the revenue to keep going at plus or minus the current rate of growth over our 3 year investment horizon. In our note we said ""If you want or need to put some cash to work, there are plenty worse places to put it than CRM stock today, as we show below. But the patient investor may find themselves rewarded if they hold fire"". We said we would go to Buy at $150/share. We said that any volatility resulting from the current Q2 tech earnings season might get the stock there. Here's the returns table from our investment model.Source: Cestrian Analysis - extract from our Jul 18 noteAt $150/share entry we have a 2.5yr return of 38% (base case), 74% (bull case) and a loss of 3% (bear case). At $160/share entry those numbers move down to 30% / 63% / -9%. As you can see the difference in each case isn't all that material. This is because the company is a growth equity play. There are no dividends which could be cut and no leverage which could bite. So a small increase in entry ticket leads to a small reduction in exit returns.The market has responded positively to tech Q2 earnings. For the period from 1 July (the first day after the end of calendar Q2) to date, the NASDAQ proxy QQQ is up 2.8%, the largest pure tech company, MSFT, is up 3.4% (NB - we went to Buy on MSFT on 24 June), and CRM itself is up 2.6%.  This chart runs through market closing on 24 July - the day after the federal government said it would investigate Big Tech for all manner of possible errant practices including antitrust and antidumping. We held off going to Buy on CRM last night because we wanted to see whether all of tech - even companies unlikely to be affected, like CRM - would sell off on that news. It didn't. Even AMZN, the likely target of the investigations, regained its initial sell-off (which was only 1.5% in any event).Let's be clear. Nobody likes to chase a stock up. It tends to lead to disappointment. But we've mulled this over a lot in the last couple days and we're now going to Buy - Long Term Hold on CRM, as of the market opening price on July 25.We're going to Buy because the market is moving up on tech earnings despite the specter of the federal government looking into Big Tech. We don't think CRM will be a target of the investigation. And we noted in our initiating coverage piece that the current entry multiple for CRM (on an EV/TTM Revenue basis, which we think is the right measure given that this is a growth equity investment) is in the midrange of its normal span. So valuation is not particularly stretched; it doesn't look like the market is going to help us buy cheaper in the near term; and we think CRM is a high reliability investment with a favorable risk/reward balance. So we say - let's not stand on ceremony - let's go to Buy - Long Term Hold.We'll report back on CRM's Q2 numbers after their 29 August publication and earnings call.Cestrian Capital Research, Inc - 24 July 2019."

Any opinions or probabilities expressed in this report are those of the author as of the article date of publication and are subject to change without notice.This is the second of the “Fundamentals of Software” series of articles from Cestrian Capital Research, Inc. This series covers a range of expert topics that impact software companies and those that invest in them. Over the course of the series, we will be covering technology, finance, marketing and sales topics. We’ll focus on a specific single-stock thesis each time to illustrate the point, so that these notes are helpful to those considering that stock. We will publish each article as they are completed, so always check in with us to see if the latest is available yet.Our aim with the “Fundamentals of Software” series is to help our readers understand software companies and the software market in more detail, so that they can make better investment decisions as a result. The work is a result of our own reflections on 20+ years of investing in the software sector and our direct experience as a board member of software companies dealing with these topics.The first article in the series, which you can find here - Beating The Fade - Why Product Cycle Innovation Has Kept Microsoft On Top - covered a technology topic – specifically, product cycle innovation and why it matters to investors. We illustrated this potentially boring subject with a specific long thesis on Microsoft (MSFT), and an implied bearish thesis on IBM and Oracle (ORCL). We’d encourage you to read it if you invest in software companies, or are thinking of doing so.Turning now to the topic at hand. We’re talking today about cashflow and earnings. As in our first note in the series, we’re using a single-stock thesis to illustrate this concept. Here we’re covering Salesforce.com (CRM). This is a very high quality business as we shall see below. Indeed its sustained growth rate and revenue predictability means that even at this lofty point in the market, with all indices at or close to all-time highs, we believe that you could buy CRM stock today and still achieve a good return if you’re prepared to hold for 3-4 years. But the patient investor would, we think, be wise to wait for a little pullback in the market and the stock. We set out our return analysis below. For now we are at Neutral – we expect to go to Buy – Long Term Hold if presented with only a modest drop in the current stock price.This second article is focused on another soporific matter, which is to say the importance of cashflow over the long term vs. earnings in the short term. We readily admit this sounds dull. Accounting 101, right? Also, irrelevant for public companies which trade on EPS – right?Well, no.The advent of cloud software companies and, in particular, the subscription business model that virtually all of them have adopted, makes understanding cashflow critical to good long-term stock selections – yet it’s a topic you will see dealt with rarely, even among tier-1 Wall Street analysts.High growth cloud software companies, which everyone’s market data screen tells them are lossmaking or barely profitable, can be very cash generative even while reporting significant losses. That’s not particularly odd in any way, it’s just a function of accounting rules and in particular the definition of revenue and earnings, and the degree to which they use stock-based compensation. But the fact that a company can be making heavy accounting losses whilst generating plentiful cashflow, means that if you want to succeed as a software investor – a long-term investor – you should spend time getting to grips with what the cashflow looks like, not just what your EPS alert emails tell you. Bottom line – if you look beyond earnings to cashflow, you can start to find the pearls and avoid the rocks – because the cashflow statement tells you whether the fundamentals of the business are truly strong. And to mangle a quote oft-attributed to Warren Buffett, “it is better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price than a fair business at a wonderful price”. It’s the cashflow statement that tells you whether a business can be wonderful or not.Now, very often this stuff doesn’t matter day to day, week to week. If you want to buy short-term dips, or play the swing trade game on earnings day, cashflow is usually a tertiary issue. Indeed the quality of business is a tertiary issue in the very short term. For short term trading in cloud stocks in the current environment, stock prices are driven by revenue growth rates, quarterly EPS vs. prior guidance, and the guidance given each quarter. The beat-and-raise game. If you can make an educated guess at earnings ahead of time, and be right vs. the consensus more often than you are wrong, you will make good money trading. If you layer in technical analysis skills, you’ll make even more money because your reading of the charts will help you see what the rest of the market is thinking. This is a good thing. Nothing wrong with it.But if you want to invest, rather than trade, buying and holding over the long term – a number of years – then cashflow really, really matters, because quality of business really, really matters. Stocks can go up and go down, they can boom and crash. But over the long term it is usually the case that the highest quality businesses deliver very good returns to the patient investor – and the highest quality businesses are those generating sustainably strong cashflows.Why is it that cashflow is more important than earnings in the long run? Well, the clue is in the name. “Earnings” aren’t a real thing, they’re an accounting construct. What counts as earnings depends on the accounting treatment used; GAAP, non-GAAP, IFRS, and so on. When accounting standards change, earnings change. You may have seen many companies make changes to their revenue and earnings this last year as a result of a new revenue recognition standard, ASC606. We won’t bore you further with this. Suffice to say that “earnings” as a concept is a well-intentioned attempt by financial regulators to allow investors to compare the financial performance of one business with another by forcing companies to comply with a particular set of reporting rules.We like reporting rules and we like forced transparency. Such things are investor-friendly. But because earnings are a concept, not a real thing, they can be rather fuzzy. If you want to really understand a business – which we believe is essential for a long-term investor – then the income statement is interesting for sure, you have to read it – but the real goodies can be found in the cashflow statement.We know that a lot of folks probably just stopped reading. Accounting, urgh. Too hard and too boring. Well, that’s a myth perpetuated by accountants so that you keep paying them. In fact just a modicum of understanding of accounting can sharpen your investment insight no end.Let’s get back to earnings and cashflow.So: earnings are a concept. But cash is a real thing. Cash either came in the door, or it went out of the door. You can’t do grown-up things with earnings. You can’t pay a dividend with earnings. You can’t pay down debt with earnings. You can’t conduct a share buyback with earnings. You need cashflow to do all these things. Most starkly, you can go bankrupt if you have plentiful earnings but insufficient cashflow, but not vice versa.We now turn to CRM, the original poster child of the cloud era, to illustrate our point.As everybody knows, CRM was an early mover in Software as a Service. Founder Marc Benioff learned sales skills and the CRM market when at Oracle (ORCL) and then Siebel (former ticker SEBL – it was acquired by its alma mater ORCL in a deal completing in 2006. SEBL sold out to ORCL largely as a result of the damage that Benioff did to SEBL’s prospects). These skills, together with Benioff’s prescient insight into the shift away from on-premises software, all fuelled by cheap money in the first Internet boom, led to the early growth of the company. It’s never looked back. It is popular with users and popular with investors. Many have heralded its impending slowdown or demise but it keeps on growing.CRM, even at its current enterprise valuation of $123bn, remains the very essence of a growth company. It has to keep running fast in order to keep growing. The Benioff founder DNA, which from personal experience we can say pervades the company, is growth, growth, growth, work, work, work - and that shows in the revenue growth rate and the bold moves into new markets. For as long as the company is expanding in this way, we believe it will keep its momentum. But if the company runs out of ideas, runs out of acquisitions, its market becomes saturated, or, cloud becomes the old thing and the new new thing starts devouring cloud stocks, watch out below, because the company doesn’t at present have the DNA to cut back and max out cashflows to protect itself while it thinks of another plan.If growth slows, we would expect the stock to fall back to Earth. And if the stock remains Earthbound for a few quarters, we would expect the key talent in Salesforce to start polishing their resumes and looking around for someplace else to go at 7am every morning. Because the bulk of the top folks’ wealth comes not from their paycheck, but from their equity awards, as we discuss below. And if the stock falls off a cliff, those equity awards won’t be worth very much – and neither is the company likely to get away with simply printing new low priced equity for the folks who are under water – that would invite institutional shareholder fury. So – the risk is that top staff walk, making it harder to hire top new talent. And in the Bay Area where CRM is headquartered, that is a doom loop which is very hard for any company to escape.For now though we think CRM has plenty of room to run. Recent commentary in Forbes (Salesforce Now Has Over 19% Of The CRM Market) suggests it holds less than 20% of its core market. Although that sounds a lot, in the software world temporary monopolies abound, and 20% isn’t a particularly big market share and we would expect it to expand. The insurgent cloud creed preached by Benioff in the late 1990s is now orthodox – the same Forbes article indicates that 75% of the CRM market uses cloud delivery – it was virtually zero in 1999 and it has changed almost entirely due to Benioff’s messianic demeanor. So we think CRM can gain share in its core market as well as in new markets – meaning we think revenue can continue to achieve strong growth.This “Fundamentals of Software” article is about the cashflow statement, so unfortunately we have to dive into the topic now.Let’s look first at CRM’s income statement. We don’t need to worry so much right now about quarterly numbers because here we are considering CRM as a long-term investment. This isn’t a quarterly update note and we aren’t trying to guess their Q2 earnings.So let’s look over the long term – the last ten years, which is about half the company’s lifetime.Here’s what we see.So if you were to look at the income statement alone you might conclude – well, that company grows a lot but it barely makes any money, they keep handing out shares or raising equity or something which is why the share count keeps rising, and I don’t think it can be a good business model as a result, and surely they’re going to have a cash crisis sometime?Which is a view you could reach on pretty much all cloud stocks if you only considered the income statement.Now to get a better picture, let’s take a look at the cashflow statement.OK - now this is looking better. Here we have a company achieving 25%+ revenue growth at c.75%+ gross margins over ten years, which has generated positive cash in all but one of those ten years – even after making a number of very large acquisitions. (We like the fact that CRM is bold on the acquisition front. It tends to buy its way into markets which are new to CRM but which are proven markets already. So it is expanding its addressable revenue base but not taking high risk bets on markets or technology. They sometimes pay big for this – the MULE and DATA acquisitions of late are pricey – but as we explained is the case for MSFT (Beating The Fade - Why Product Cycle Innovation Has Kept Microsoft On Top) , these bold bets mean the company can keep growing even at this kind of scale. Again, 25% revenue growth at $13bn annual revenues is really not an easy thing to do).Turning now to the balance sheet. Perhaps this company grows quickly, generates cash, but has ended up woefully overlevered what with all these big acquisitions?Source: Author based on company dataNope.So now we get happier still. It’s been in a net cash position for seven of the last ten years (let’s call FY1/11 cash neutral at a negative $1m balance). It has raised debt repeatedly, and paid it down repeatedly. We know from the income statement that the company makes material equity awards as part of staff compensation – far more than would say an industrials business – but we’ve seen on the cashflow statement that it gets a lot of money in from those staff when they exercise their stock options (this works well from a tax perspective too). And yes, there’s equity dilution as a result of the stock awards and equity-funded acquisitions, but the compound rate of growth of diluted shares outstanding is 5% per annum over these last ten years. Material, but not a killer given the revenue growth rate.The best way we can sum all of this up is to show you a chart of cumulative net income vs. cumulative net cash generation over the last 10 years.Source: Author based on company data.The red line is the cash. Again, this is a 25% revenue growth business that is generating substantial amounts of cash – more as it reaches scale. Earnings have been so-so (due mainly to the stock based compensation being accounted for as equivalent to cash expenses as required by GAAP). Cash generation has been very clean and simple. Our own view is that stock-based compensation is a good thing for shareholders in this type of company – it delivers a greater degree of economic alignment between managers and shareholders than is the case for cash compensation alone.Now let’s see how we know the company has good quality revenue that we can count on. This is important. It’s one reason why the valuation multiples are so high – CRM offers both high growth and highly dependable revenue, a rare combination.Let’s look at the ‘deferred revenue’ line we included in our balance sheet summary above. Deferred revenue appears in the liability section of the balance sheet so it’s natural to think it’s a bad thing. It’s not.Deferred revenue means very simply, “how much cash have I been paid upfront for which I have yet to deliver the service?”. For CRM, the balance at the last year end was $8.6bn vs. $13.3bn TTM revenue. So the company has been paid upfront for – and will almost certainly recognize - $8.6bn of future revenue – some two-thirds of the most recent year’s revenue. If you asked most companies, would they like almost complete future certainty over an amount of revenue equal to two-thirds of last year’s total revenue – they would be fairly eager to say yes. With CRM – as for many cloud stocks – this comes for free with the business model. Together with the growth, this is one of the main reasons why cloud stocks always look so expensive – the high level of certainty over future revenues.We said above that CRM operates a “Run, Forrest, Run!” kind of business model, where growth begets growth. What if growth slows – what then?There are some protections in place in the business model. We can see that CRM generates plenty of cash despite its high growth. It also gets paid upfront for a lot of its revenue. So it generally has a high level of cash ‘float’ as Warren Buffett terms it; and it pays a substantial proportion of its staff expenses in stock, meaning that it uses less cash for staff compensation that would otherwise be the case. In an up-market, this is great news for shareholders. There is dilution, yes, but there are so many people at the company who benefit personally from a rise in the stock price that the aligment between managers and stockholders is very close indeed. That is a good thing.But in a down-market, this can turn ugly. Firstly, when markets are falling – not correcting momentarily like Q4 2018/Q1 2019, but falling – like, 2000-2002 falling or 2008-2009 falling, the majority of these managers’ comp is worth a lot less than it used to be, perhaps nothing if the equity is based on stock price appreciation from the point of award. So managers can feel they will be waiting years for it to come into value. So they are likely to pressure the company for a greater percentage of comp in cash – certainly for those not in the C-suite. And that will push down that cash generation pretty markedly, closer to the GAAP earnings performance in our chart above. At some point the company has to say – we can’t afford this – we’re in a down market (meaning we’re probably in a recession and life is tough every day for us) – we have to preserve cash, we probably want to buy some companies cheaply and for that we want cash too – so we are going to fall out a little bit with our managers because we can’t give them the cash they want. And so some of them – maybe a lot of them – are going to leave, or work with a lot less vigor than is usually the case. That kind of downward spiral isn’t good. That’s what life is like at IBM. And we know how that is turning out for shareholders. And IBM isn’t in the Bay Area where equity gain is the principal motivation tool.So shareholders in CRM ought to want it to keep on running. Keep entering new markets, keep making bold acquisitions, keep pushing organic growth. So speaking for ourselves, when we see CRM make bold deals like Mulesoft (formerly MULE) or Tableau (DATA), we think – good. Better, these kinds of moves can present opportunity for patient investors. The market generally doesn’t like big expensive acquisitions. Paying double-digit multiples of next year’s revenue for cloud bolt-ons is frowned upon. And Salesforce’s biggest-check deals have caused the stock to swoon on both occasions. In March 2018, when the MULE deal was announced, the stock dropped 9% on the day, then recovered over the course of the next month. CRM had been trending above the SPY and QQQ, fell in-line on the day of the drop, then accelerated again past those indices.CRM just announced its biggest-deal yet, a $16bn acquisition of Tableau (DATA). Again this gave shareholders a drop, this time of 6% on the day. It has yet to recover a month later and indeed has lagged the same indices since then.We suspect that the DATA acquisition will work out just fine. We’re a little concerned that DATA’s products are long in the tooth – it came late to cloud, having started life with a more traditional product and business model. But CRM is better placed than anyone to assess its product scalability and business model transformation potential so we’re happy to trust their due diligence team.Here’s CRM’s current valuation:Source: Author based on company dataAll the multiples are lofty on an absolute basis as we can see, but not out of line for a cloud stock and factoring in the stability that comes with size and market leadership, this valuation isn’t too bad right now. If you want or need to put some cash to work, there are plenty worse places to put it than CRM stock today, as we show below.But the patient investor may find themselves rewarded if they hold fire. Here’s how CRM’s revenue multiple (EV/TTM Revenue) has moved over the years.Source: YCharts.com, Author's notesWe’ve layered on three ‘tramlines’. 9.5x TTM revenue is the peak for most of the last decade, save for a brief outlier period in 2010/11; 5.5x TTM revenue is the trough for most of that period, and 8.5x TTM Revenue is a level the stock has touched regularly in the last decade. We use these below in our “Bull”, “Base”, and “Bear” cases respectively.Here’s our exit model. We assume no dividends and we take no account of transaction fees or taxes. Also, since CRM is basically a growth equity investment, we’ve modelled the exit accordingly. We use a revenue multiple, use dilution as a key returns driver, and assume that cash is up a little or down a little when we exit. (Which matches CRM’s history in the last 10 years).Source: Company data, author's analysisWe conclude that for us, CRM is a Buy – Long Term Hold at $150/share or less. We think that delivers asymmetric risk of +74% bull case, +38% base case, and a 3% loss bear case, over let’s say a 3-year period. Further, we think that price may present itself without too traumatic a market correction – it’s just a 4.5% drop from the current price and it won’t take too much of a stumble in the Q2 tech earnings season to deliver that.© Cestrian Capital Research, Inc – 18 July 2019"
4275276,102764,2019-07-16T16:28:36-04:00,"Buying high-quality growth stocks for reasonable valuations can be an effective strategy for superior returns in the long term.Salesforce is an exceptional growth business, and the company has significantly enlarged its growth opportunities over the years.Discounted cash flows, valuation ratios, and multi-factor analysis are indicating that Salesforce's stock is attractively valued for such a strong business.If the company continues growing at full speed and outperforming expectations, the stock should offer attractive returns from current levels.","Value investing is not just about buying stocks with low valuation ratios. Investing in high growth companies with reasonable valuations can be even more profitable in the long term.In the words of Warren Buffett himself:Salesforce (CRM) is an outstanding growth business, and the stock looks like an attractive proposition for investors looking to buy a wonderful company at a fair price.Salesforce is the undisputed leader in customer relationship management, and the company has successfully leveraged on its strength in that market to expand into new opportunities in areas such as customer service, marketing automation, e-commerce, analytics, and artificial intelligence.Revenue growth has been nothing short of spectacular over the long term. In the year 2010, the company made $1.3 billion in annual revenue, and it has already exceeded $14 billion in revenue on a trailing 12-months basis for the current year.Data by YChartsThe numbers for the first quarter confirm that the business keeps firing on all cylinders. Total revenue reached $3.74 billion, up 24% year-over-year and growing by 26% in constant currency terms. Operating cash flow reached $1.97 billion, up by a vigorous 34%. In a sign of confidence, management also raised guidance for the rest of the year.One of the most attractive traits of Salesforce as a growth stock is that management has done an impressive job at expanding the company's growth opportunities into different areas over the years. The company estimates that the size of the total addressable market could be worth as much as $140 billion, and the size of such a market is expected to continue increasing at a solid speed in the years ahead. Source: SalesforceWhen investing in growth stocks, the sustainability of growth rates is a crucial consideration. Salesforce has proven an impressive capacity to sustain rapid revenue growth and expand its future growth opportunities over the long term.The discounted cash flow analysis of Salesforce's stock is based on the following assumptions.Under these assumptions, we reach a fair value estimate of $191.43 per share for Salesforce, which implies a discount of 21% versus the current stock price. The average price target among the analysts following the stock is currently $183, so the valuation estimate is roughly in line with estimates.Taking a look at cash flows over the past decade, it's important to note that operating cash flow is rapidly increasing, while capital expenditures are relatively flat. Since free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital expenditure, this dynamic should allow Salesforce to produce rapid growth in free cash flow over the years ahead.Data by YChartsThe business model allows for expanding free cash flow margin as the company gains size over time, and I wouldn't be surprised to see Salesforce outperforming the growth assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis. In such a scenario, the stock would obviously be more undervalued than what the numbers above imply.However, the main point in discounted cash flow analysis is not accurately estimating free cash flows, which necessarily carries a large margin of error. The idea is assessing if the stock is reasonably valued based on conservative cash flow assumptions, and Salesforce is in fact conservatively valued for such a dynamic growth stock.Salesforce's stock is trading at a price to sales ratio of 8.63, this is not cheap at all in comparison to the broad market, but software companies typically trade at valuation premiums due to the industry's attractive growth prospects.The table below compares Salesforce versus Intuit (INTU), Workday (WDAY), Shopify (SHOP), and Red Hat (RHT). These companies have different strategies and growth rates, so the comparison is not completely straightforward. But it's still worth noting that Salesforce is reasonably priced in comparison to other successful software companies.Data Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialImportantly, valuation is a dynamic as opposed to a static concept, and Salesforce has an impeccable track record of outperforming revenue expectations over the long term. The chart below shows the average revenue estimate and the actual reported sales number for Salesforce since July of 2015, and the company has not missed sales estimates even once.Data Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialFundamental momentum can be a powerful return driver for stock prices. When a company delivers revenue numbers above expectations and Wall Street analysts increase their forecasts for the company going forward, then the stock price needs to increase for the valuation to remain constant.We can see in the chart below how revenue estimates for Salesforce in the current year have significantly increased over time, and this has been a vigorous tailwind for the stock price.Data by YChartsAs long as Salesforce can maintain its track record of outperforming revenue expectations, this could be a strong tailwind for the stock price.Valuation needs to be analyzed in its due context. A company with strong financial performance and vigorous business momentum deserves a higher valuation level than a company producing mediocre financial performance and declining fundamental momentum.In that spirit, the PowerFactors system is a quantitative system that ranks companies in a particular universe according to a combination of factors, such as financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength.In simple terms, the PowerFactors system is looking to buy good businesses (quality) for a reasonable price (valuation) when the company is doing well (fundamental momentum) and the stock is outperforming (relative strength).Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123The backtested performance numbers show that companies with high PowerFactors rankings tend to deliver superior returns over the long term, and the higher the PowerFactors ranking the better the backtested performance.As of the time of this writing, Salesforce has a PowerFactors ranking above 95, so the company is in the top 5% of stocks in the US market according to the PowerFactors algorithm. In other words, valuation levels are compelling when analyzed in the context of other quantitative return drivers for Salesforce.There are some important risks to consider when evaluating a position in Salesforce's stock. The recent acquisition of Tableau (DATA) for $16 billion makes a lot of sense from a strategic perspective, and it could open the door to promising growth opportunities in the years ahead. But the price paid for the transaction is quite aggressive, so management will need to make sure that it can smartly capitalize on its opportunities in order to justify the acquisition price tag.Software stocks have also substantially outperformed the market in recent years. Investing in the top players in an outperforming industry is the right thing to do, but the sectors that deliver the biggest gains on the way up can also suffer more pain when markets pull back. Momentum cuts both ways in the stock market, and you need to accept above-average volatility when investing in growth stocks.Those risks being acknowledged, Salesforce is an impressive growth stock, and valuation looks very reasonable for such a high-quality business. If the company continues growing at full speed and outperforming Wall Street expectations as it has done in recent years, current valuation levels should allow for attractive returns going forward."
4271153,105095,2019-06-19T20:09:43-04:00,"Big data and business intelligence is a rapidly growing industry. On its own, Tableau is among the leading firms in this area and was well-positioned to succeed.The acquisition was an all-stock deal, meaning this will have no hit on the cash flow and Salesforce.com's ability to continually grow.Salesforce.com's acquisition of Tableau is strategic in nature, the addition of the latter on Salesforce's products would create a product offering that is unmatched.","Salesforce.com (CRM) recently acquired Tableau (DATA) in an all-stock deal valued at roughly $16 billion. Wall Street wasn’t too happy at the announcement of the deal, sending the stock down as much as 8% the day it was announced. Criticisms of the deal are that Salesforce overpaid for Tableau or that maybe Salesforce was stepping way outside its comfort zone. Given that it was an all-stock deal, the acquisition is expected to decrease fiscal 2020 non-GAAP EPS by 37 cents to 39 cents. In 2018, Salesforce earned $1.43 per share on $13.28 billion in revenue, making it clear that the stock is expensive from strictly a P/E ratio perspective.So why am I so excited about this deal? Basically, the deal is strategic in nature and reminds me of the time Facebook (FB) acquired Instagram. At the time Facebook was heavily criticized for having overpaid. However, Facebook knew the strategic value of Instagram and how it complemented and enhanced its existing services. Now as a stand-alone company, Instagram is valued at $100 billion and returned 100 times its investments. I believe Salesforce’s acquisition of Tableau is poised to do the same.A deal that is strategic in nature is designed to bring the acquirer capabilities it doesn’t yet have and that will allow it to intensify its own capabilities system. So what exactly is Tableau?Tableau Software is a computer software company that produces a family of interactive data visualization products focused on business intelligence. Tableau is a self-service analytics platform that empowers people of any skill level to work with data to get rapid insights and make impactful data-driven decisions. Using Tableau you can quickly connect, visualize, and share data, create and publish dashboards and share them seamlessly from PC to iPad.Prior to the Salesforce acquisition, Tableau was already posting healthy revenue figures and looked to be further expanding with subscription annual recurring revenue at $510.1 million as of March 31, 2019, up 115% year over year. Looking at the broader market, with companies pushing into analytics, Tableau was already poised to be a successful company on its own.Source: Enlyft Tableau’s analytics platform will help Salesforce augment its current product offerings, which include tools to help companies with sales, marketing, and customer service. Salesforce can leverage the technology to extend data intelligence and insights for the customers that Salesforce already has. Currently, Salesforce is sitting on a treasure trove of customer and market data. Being able to harness that data to deliver insight is a key concern for every C-suite executive. It is forecasted that revenues from big data are expected to hit $247 billion in 2022.Source: Statista care of PcmagThe combination of a leading CRM and a leading data visualization tool will give Salesforce a combined product offering that is unmatched in the market place. Against other competitors such as SAP (SAP) and Oracle (ORCL), the ease of use of Tableau and Salesforce architecture would give it a competitive advantage. The integration of Tableau as a native software, to get data directly from Salesforce fields (either called “opportunities” or “cases”), will give it an advantage over competitors such as Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) PowerBI which are not directly integrated into the system. That only scratches the surface, imagine what types of synergies and innovations are possible by layering data analytics unto Salesforce’s entire suite of products or the upcoming artificial intelligence tools.Source: Salesforce Investor day 2018 care of ForbesSource: Salesforce press releaseMarc Benioff is truly a visionary CEO in the same vein as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. Salesforce wants to hit $60 billion in revenue by 2034. That is still ways off from today, but I can easily see the company continuing its exponential growth in the coming years. Ignore the naysayers who say the Tableau acquisition was too expensive or that Tableau as a company was having operating losses. Salesforce paid the right price, using stock (ensuring no cash flow hit) and this will benefit its product for years to come."
4269648,69905,2019-06-11T12:48:22-04:00,A discussion of Salesforce's biggest acquisition: Tableau.Salesforce's cash flows are misleading.Shareholders are best to avoid this stock.,"Salesforce (CRM) is determined to be perceived as a high growth company and as such be rewarded with a punchy multiple.Now, on the back of its latest acquisition, I assert that its shareholders are better off calling it a day before the music stops.(Source)The problem with relying on acquisitions to support growth is that not only does management have to play an intensely competitive game of hunting for continuous treasure. But even more challenging is that, in order to move the needle on the company's bottom line, each investment needs to be bigger than the previous one.Source: author's calculations, Salesforce SEC filingsAs you can see above, with the passage of time, whereas management attempts to divert the narrative towards its top-line growth and Salesforce's generative cash flows, it is distracting shareholders away from the total sum deployed towards fueling its growth.Below is one example of the type of comment CEO Marc Benioff made during Salesforce's recent earnings call:However, this narrative is misleading. The reason being that Salesforce continues to be highly acquisitive and boosting its cash flows by consuming whole companies.For instance, going back to fiscal 2017, Salesforce spent roughly $3.7 billion to support its growth (see table above). Then, moving forward a few years, Salesforce has deployed more than 4 times this amount and its fiscal year is not even over yet.Moreover, its acquisition of Tableau (DATA) has diluted Salesforce's shareholders by approximately 13%.Once more, below is what Salesforce wants its shareholders to measure the company's progress by.Source: Investor Day PresentationEven though its top-line has in the past demonstrated a strong pace of growth with a CAGR of 26%; going forward, Salesforce is guiding for a CAGR of 20%.Having said that, perhaps more significant is that its bottom line is not keeping pace with its top-line, as its recently guided fiscal 2020 non-GAAP EPS number is expected to end down 8% year-over-year to $2.52.In other words, despite boasting on the call that 'no other enterprise software company of our size and scale is growing at this rate', Salesforce shareholders are actually not participating in this growth whatsoever.As you can see in the above table, Salesforce does not scream out as an overpriced stock.The reason being that Salesforce's management is being very savvy in how it goes on to support its top-line growth.For example, although Cloudera (CLDR) is not a direct peer to Salesforce, it is nevertheless a key player in the cloud space at large. And, in comparison with Cloudera, Salesforce even looks very cheap, with its cash flows being valued at just 30.8x compared to Cloudera's 46.3x.However, Cloudera, despite its recently failed acquisition, is not a serial acquirer. Its cash flows are relatively clean, without the need for significant adjustments.While Salesforce, as I have shown throughout this piece, makes its cash flows look healthier than they actually are by its continuous stream of acquisition.As we enter the final stages of this very mature bull market, some, such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B), have shown a tremendous amount of patience by sitting on large sums of capital waiting for correct opportunity to make acquisitions which move the needle.Others, such as Salesforce, have shown no appetite for slowing down on its highly acquisitive endeavor. Given that its adjusted non-GAAP EPS figures are starting to turn south and while the music plays, its shareholders might opt to sit this one out.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive emails of my latest research, please click ""Follow"" at the top of this article."
4269547,100666,2019-06-10T23:23:27-04:00,"I should have bought shares of Salesforce.com a long time ago, but I finally did it at the end of May.Marc Benioff is an outstanding, larger-than-life CEO, a visionary who deserves to be in the league of his mentor Steve Jobs.Salesforce is training 1.4 million people on Trailhead.com to use its platform, and they will spread the word.Benioff sets ambitious financial goals and is good at motivating his troops.The company is still innovating and introducing new products at a very high speed.","I think every investor has a few stocks about which he has been kicking himself: ""Why didn't I buy it XYZ years ago when I already saw it was a great company?"" For me, Salesforce.com (CRM) is one of those stocks. I should have bought shares a long time ago, but somehow never did.But mistakes are there to be corrected, and I bought my first batch of Salesforce shares on May 24, as I announced on my Twitter account:In this article, I will give five reasons for why I did so.Marc Benioff, Salesforce (co-)founder, (co-)CEO and chairman, is the main reason why I have bought shares of Salesforce. I'm not easily impressed by people (I have no idols), but I am by Benioff. The man is, for me, in the absolute top of legendary founders: the category where you find Steve Jobs (AAPL) (who was, by the way, a mentor of Benioff), Bill Gates (MSFT), Jeff Bezos (AMZN), Mark Zuckerberg (FB), Larry Page and Sergey Brin (GOOG, GOOGL), and Reed Hastings (NFLX). They are not just the visionary founders of great companies, but they are larger than life. Those founder-CEOs are obsessed with their products. They really push their companies to outsized success.When you are reading this article, Marc Benioff will probably be a familiar name, but for the average Joe, the name is still unknown. I think that will change in the course of the next few years.(Source: Forbes)Benioff has a very charismatic and flamboyant personality. He sees it as his task to make the world a better place by the use of technology. In 1999 already, at the very start of Salesforce, Benioff created the 1-1-1 model of integrated corporate philanthropy. It's a contribution of 1% of shares, 1% of employee hours (mostly volunteering) and 1% worth of product to the community it is in. For the 1% product, Salesforce created the Philanthropy Cloud. The company announced that Philanthropy Cloud is ""a revolutionary new marketplace for giving, a first of its kind network platform to connect corporations, employees and nonprofits at scale.""In the meantime, more than 700 companies (and counting) have started to apply the 1-1-1 rule at least partly, including Alphabet, Atlassian (TEAM), DocuSign (DOCU), PagerDuty (PD), Yelp (YELP) and many others. So you see that Benioff is not afraid to start a movement. That's what I call charisma.But Benioff's philanthropy is, of course, not the main reason why I have invested in Salesforce. He has huge ambitions at the business level too.Benioff is seen as one of the inventors of a huge market that is still expanding at rapid speed: SaaS, or Software as a Service. SaaS is expected to gather revenue of $85 billion in 2019, and the total cloud industry is expected to have a revenue of $278 billion by 2021.But as simple as it seems now, it really took a hard-headed visionary man as Benioff to bring Salesforce to where it is now. After all, the company was launched in 1999, just before the dot.com bubble burst. Both Salesforce and Benioff were seen as losers and ridiculed back then. Remember, there was no cloud to speak of yet back then, and as they say, the pioneer always gets shot. So, it is a testimony for Benioff that he could guide Salesforce through this period. He fought with all the tactics he could come up with, many under the form of guerilla marketing stunts.You shouldn't forget that Salesforce's competitors were giants like Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP) and Microsoft. As a small player fighting these giants and coming out as a clear winner, you have to have grit and determination. That is what I like in CEOs of companies I have shares of.Just as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, it came early for Benioff. At the age of 15, he sold his first software ""How to juggle?"" for $75.Benioff was also in the top 10 of the most-liked CEOs on Glassdoor.com for 2018. As my fellow-contributor App Economy Insights showed in his article, being in the top of Glassdoor is a good prediction for long-term gains.I could make write pages more about Benioff, but that is not the intention of this article. I think you know enough now to understand that Marc Benioff is the most important reason for me to own Salesforce.(Source: Trailhead.com)Salesforce recently signed the White House Pledge to America's Workers to train 500,000 people to use Salesforce and to give them credentials through Trailhead, its online learning platform where you can learn everything about using Salesforce at your own pace and conditions. By means of gamification, you can learn all the skills to be successful in the Salesforce ecosystem. This should help empower the participants to get top jobs over the next five years.From the press release on the Investor Relations page of Salesforce about the Pledge, you can see that the Salesforce universe will keep expanding over the next few years:So, do I say the same as in point 1, namely that I love the good cause of this initiative? Sure, but I like one thing as much as the ESG side of this: Salesforce is training an army of people that will be disciples who will spread the Salesforce ecosystem as if it were religion. Don't forget, a lot of these people will seriously improve their lives, and that will make them thankful for Salesforce. Or how do you think the former housewife feels who Benioff mentioned in his recent Jim Cramer interview and who now is the leads of a team of 35 people after following the Trailhead training? She will love Salesforce from the bottom of her heart. And more people like that will follow. Those people are probably the best marketing campaign there is.Just to make it clear: the White House Pledge was for 500,000 American people who get reskilled. But 1.4 million people worldwide are already following the Trailhead courses.Salesforce is the market leader, and it is still building out its market dominance more and more, no matter what the competition tries to do. This is its market share:(Source: Marc Benioff's Twitter account)16.8% of the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) market - that is impressive, especially if you know that the second biggest, Oracle, only has 5.7%. And the two biggest competitors, Oracle and SAP, are losing market share versus Salesforce, suggesting that Salesforce takes over customers of its competitors. That is impressive. And even more if you take into account the fact that Oracle has bought NetSuite in the summer of 2016 for $9.3 billion to expand its cloud offerings.This quote of Marc Benioff from the Q1 2020 earnings call says enough, in my opinion:And Salesforce has a huge TAM (total addressable market). At this moment, the TAM stands at about $140 billion, but all of the market segments are growing, and most by double digits per year:(Source)And the picture looks even better than that. Mark Hawkins, Salesforce President and CFO, said on the Q1 2020 earnings call:Especially the part ""when you go to multicloud, you spend 10 x as much"" is very encouraging for the company. To show you how important that is, 92% of revenue comes from multicloud clients. If Salesforce can convince 62% of its existing customers to go multicloud and maybe take them to Customer 360, then it could even accelerate its growth.As I have already explained, I like CEOs who are ambitious. That doesn't only apply to their vision, but also to the financial goals they set. And Marc Benioff is one of the few top executives who is very open about his goals.He first set a goal of $10 billion of revenue in 2016 to achieve in FY 2018 (ending in December 2017). And he added: “My dream is to double this company within the next three to four years.”This is what the revenue of Salesforce over the past few years has looked like:(Compiled by the author)For Salesforce to reach the goal of $20 billion revenue at the end of 2020 (FY 2021), it would have to grow its revenue by another 23% if it hits its guidance. And you know what? I think the company can do that.Benioff has even set out a longer-term goal: by 2023 he wants $28 billion of revenue. And peering even further into the future, Benioff has already set the goal for 2034. Then, he wants $60 billion of revenue for Salesforce.And the goal-setting seems to be really ingrained into the company. Salesforce's co-CEO Keith Block said in an interview:(Co-CEO Keith Block - Source)I really like that culture of goal-setting. Measurable goals are a great tool to bring an excellent drive to your company, especially if they are combined with excellent CEO approvals, such as that of Benioff on Glassdoor. Because what a lot of investors miss in their quantitative approach to investing is that the company culture is one of the most defining factors for success or failure for a company. If you have ever worked for one, you know this to be true. But it is impossible to quantify that.The good thing about Salesforce is that it keeps adding more and more products. This is no coincidence: Salesforce has been in the Forbes Most Innovating Companies list for eight years in a row, coming in at #3 in the 2018 list. And that pays off. Besides new customers, existing customers can also be upsold because they sign up for the company's new product offerings.Salesforce offers several clouds: Sales Cloud (I think you can guess what that one is for), Customer Cloud (to manage customer support), Marketing Cloud (for personalized marketing to customers), Commerce Cloud (which is used for management and insights of e-commerce), Data Cloud (for sales and lead generation), Community Cloud (a social platform to connect employees and customers), Analytics Cloud (a platform for business intelligence, optimized for mobile access and data visualization), App Cloud (an integrated architecture for enterprise developers) and IoT Cloud (meant to store the data of Internet of Things devices). That is already an impressive universe of clouds. Here's a schematic representation:(Source: Trailhead.com)Salesforce has rolled out its AI platform Einstein recently. Businesses have huge amounts of data, and Einstein will learn from these data. It will sift through the data and give you insights that would be very difficult or time-consuming to implement on your own. Bots are an example. Einstein can also provide an automatic translation.On the Q1 2020 earnings call, Benioff talks about what has been added to Einstein and also about the blockchain:Einstein already provides a whopping 6 billion predictions per day. And since it helps their businesses, customers love it.The blockchain is the next big wave that Salesforce will surf. Again, here's Benioff on the Q1 2020 earnings call:But it is not the only focus. Salesforce also has Customer 360, a suite that combines all of the services that the company has into one big, integrated platform. Benioff noted on the earnings call:I think this is a great development. Too many compartments will lead to sterile work at a certain moment. It is the integration of all the different services and insights that will create completely original new insights.I should have bought shares of Salesforce a long time ago, but somehow I never did. But I am pretty confident that the company will keep growing for years and years. The compounding effect will show its magic when Salesforce keeps adding 20%+ revenue growth year after year.With its visionary CEO Marc Benioff leading the way and motivating his troops with ambitious financial targets, there is no stopping Salesforce. The company is still number three on the Forbes Innovators List, and as a result of its ingrained innovation, it keeps rolling out new services. The future is bright for Salesforce, and I am glad I finally am a shareholder of this wonderful company.If you liked my article, feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name.

4269531,25120,2019-06-10T20:15:19-04:00,"Salesforce.com is announcing a mega deal with a +$15 billion purchase for Tableau.The deal makes strategic sense but comes at a steep price as is recognised by investors in Salesforce.com.I continue to appreciate the long-term value creation under Mr. Benioff and thus would not bet against the company, but am anything but a buyer at current valuations.","Salesforce.com (CRM) is making a big move, and while the company has traditionally not shied away from some dealmaking, it is making a huge move with the +$15 billion proposed acquisition of Tableau (DATA). The deal, which comes at a big premium, is not so much welcomed by investors of Salesforce.com, although dealmaking has been crucial in the long-term value creation of Salesforce's shares.While I am not a big fan of this deal and adjusted earnings numbers employed by the company, I am very respectful of the operational performance under the leadership of Mr. Benioff, so much that I would not consider a short position at all, even after another expensive deal.Salesforce.com has reached a deal with Tableau in which it is willing to acquire the company at a $15.7 billion valuation, that is, of course, based on an enterprise basis. The exchange rate comes down to 1.103 shares of Salesforce for each share which investors in Tableau currently own.Marc Benioff is excited about the deal as it combines the leading CRM and analytics platform under one roof. Salesforce is all about understanding the customer and making it happy as data plays an ever more important role in this, hence the rationale to buy Tableau.With shares of Salesforce trading at $161.22 ahead of the deal announcement, the exchange ratio comes down to a valuation of $177.83 per share for Tableau. This marks a healthy premium compared to the unaffected price of $125.49 per share, a near 42% premium indeed.The $15.7 billion valuation is quite steep as the company updated the full year sales guidance to $1.40 billion alongside the first quarter earnings release, indicating that Salesforce is paying about 11 times sales, a healthy multiple with top-line sales growth totalling 19%. In traditional fashion, there is quite a large gap between adjusted and reported GAAP earnings. The revenue contribution of Tableau is equivalent to about 9% for all of Salesforce.com, expected to generate $16.10-16.25 billion in sales this year.The actual premium paid for Tableau is quite steep. In dollar terms, this premium amounts to about $52 per share, implying a $4.4 billion premium. It is this quite a large premium in dollar and percentage terms which makes investors in Salesforce a bit cautious as its shares trade with losses of 5%, falling $8 per share to about $153. With a GAAP diluted share count of 793 million shares, the fall in shares of Salesforce amounts to nearly $6.4 billion, about two billion more than the premium paid for Tableau. This is a clear indication that investors are a bit cautious.Salesforce holds $6.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and $3.2 billion in debt. This net cash position of $3.2 billion will remain as this is an all-stock deal, of course.Trading at $161 ahead of the announced deal, Salesforce was awarded a $125 billion enterprise valuation, which is slightly less than 8 times sales, much lower than the multiple paid for Tableau. Furthermore, sales growth of 21-22% is actually a few percentage points higher than that reported by Tableau as these might be the reasons why investors act with some reserves to the deal.I have long been admiring while being critical on Salesforce.com as well. It is clear that the company has rapidly built out a dominant position in a rapidly growing industry, and the achievements in terms of growth have been very good.At the same time, the company is not really profitable yet and focuses heavily on adjusted earnings over GAAP earnings, yet +20% growth rates for a +$15 billion firm are a real accomplishment. Hence, while CRM has always been very expensive based on (GAAP) earnings numbers, the reality is that sales multiples were reasonable.The promise has been that of continued growth and a leadership position, and over time, a move from very low to non-existing realistic profit margins to industry standards as high as 30-40% of sales. Such a pathway could easily justify today's valuation. The Tableau deal brings more growth and operational leadership in the marketplace but is expensive as well, as investors are acting rightfully cautious in response to the deal.Given all of this, the company could still grow into the valuation as a tie-up with large technology players might still be in the works (at some point in the future). This is the only reason, together with the visionary leadership of Mr. Benioff, why I am not betting against the shares, but that is a whole lot different than actually owning them."
4269420,104537,2019-06-10T11:25:40-04:00,"Salesforce announced an agreement to acquire Tableau with an all-stock transaction.
        From a business perspective, the deal makes sense.
        But the transaction values Tableau at an excessive price.","Salesforce (CRM) announced today a definitive agreement to acquire Tableau (DATA) with an all-stock transaction that corresponds to an EV of $15.7 billion.The acquisition improves Salesforce's portfolio and offers obvious synergies. Salesforce will integrate Tableau's analytics capabilities into its CRM and middleware portfolio.But the proposed transaction values Tableau at a high EV/TTM Sales ratio considering its revenue growth and its operating losses.Let's discuss the potential operational benefits before getting into the details of the valuation. Image source: Rawpixel via PixabayBoth Salesforce and Tableau propose different software solutions. Salesforce is the leader in CRM (Customer Relationship Management) applications. Over the last several years, the company enhanced its portfolio via organic growth and acquisitions. Salesforce also expanded its business into the middleware segment with its acquisition of MuleSoft one year ago.Tableau is an analytics platform that helps its customers seeing and understanding data.The business case for a combination seems obvious. Salesforce's customers will benefit from improved data visualization and reporting capabilities Tableau offers.Management didn't provide any detail about potential costs synergies. Yet, I see possibilities to reduce costs, especially with sales and marketing. As shown in the graph below, both companies have been growing revenue at a strong double-digit CAGR over the last several years. But these growth rates come with high sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue. Even with a recent decrease, sales and marketing expenses represented about 65% of Tableau's revenue during the last reported quarter.Tableau's sales and marketing costs can reach Salesforce's lower costs as a percentage of revenue thanks to cross-selling opportunities combined with Salesforce's scale. But even with strong potential synergies, the proposed price for the acquisition seems high. So, let's have a look at the value of the transaction.Three months ago, I wrote about Salesforce:The all-stock transaction values Tableau at an EV of about $15.7 billion. Before the deal, Tableau's EV was $10 billion. And the deal was agreed when Tableau's stock price was close to its all-time high. The proposed price corresponds to a high EV/TTM sales ratio of $15.7 billion / $1.19 billion = 13.2x.Considering the revenue growth discussed above, the proposed price is high. With a similar revenue growth profile and a higher operating margin, Salesforce's EV/TTM sales ratio stayed below 10x over the last several years.But even before the transaction, Tableau was already priced for solid operating improvements. Over the last several quarters, the company reported negative operating income despite strong revenue growth.Thus, the valuation that corresponds to the proposed EV of $15.7 billion is excessive. But the acquisition is an all-stock transaction. Salesforce's stock price isn't as excessive as the proposed price to acquire Tableau. But Salesforce's EV/TTM sales ratio above 8x is still high. Thus, Salesforce's high stock price mitigates a part of the excessive valuation the Tableau acquisition represents.Also, the all-stock deal keeps Salesforce's balance strong sheet intact and gives possibilities for other acquisitions.From the operational perspective, Salesforce's acquisition of Tableau makes sense. Salesforce enhances its CRM and middleware portfolio with strong data analytics Tableau offers.Also, the combined businesses will benefit from cost synergies - especially with sales & marketing - considering the cross-sell opportunities.But the proposed deal values Tableau at an EV/TTM sales ratio of 13.2x, which is much higher than Tableau's and Salesforce's valuations over the last several years. In addition, Tableau has been reporting operating losses.Even if Salesforce acquires Tableau with an all-stock deal, Salesforce's high stock price doesn't match the excessive valuation the Tableau transaction represents.Thus, taking into account the portfolio and costs synergies, the deal makes sense. But the agreed price seems excessive when considering Tableau's growth rate and operating losses.Note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on my latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4269410,103480,2019-06-10T11:00:00-04:00,"Salesforce shares are back near 52-week highs after reporting strong Q1 results and a raise to the full-year revenue outlook.
        Though Salesforce beat Wall Street's expectations in Q1, revenue growth slowed down by 2 points to 24% y/y.
        Salesforce remains a viable long-term hold, but with small-cap software stocks having performed so poorly this earnings season, there are better value names in the market.
        Salesforce's current valuation at ~7.5x forward revenues is in-line with historical trends. With few catalysts on the horizon, it's difficult to see a major rally in the stock.","It comes perhaps as no surprise that Salesforce.com (CRM) was able to generate yet another ""beat-and-raise"" quarter in Q1. Managing earnings expectations has long been a bedrock of Salesforce's corporate strategy and one of the drivers behind its impeccably smooth appreciation in stock prices. Barring wider market downturns, Salesforce stock almost always goes up in a reliable fashion.I've been a long-term bull on Salesforce for years. The company's flagship Sales Cloud is the de facto gold standard in one of the largest categories of enterprise software, while Salesforce's investments into PaaS (most notably through its purchase of MuleSoft) and other tertiary products like Service Cloud have helped the company to maintain its 20%-plus growth rates in perpetuity. The company's lofty revenue target of $26-$28 billion within three fiscal years (nearly double this fiscal year's targets) isn't a pie-in-the-sky, overly rosy target. With Salesforce's combination of both M&A-driven and organic revenue growth in a variety of software categories, this target is perfectly achievable.But just because Salesforce's fundamental growth story remains intact doesn't mean that it's always a viable investment, and after getting through the Q1 earnings season, I see more opportunity in the small-cap space and am shifting Salesforce to neutral. While remaining fundamentally positive on the company's long-term story, I believe investors would be wise to reduce exposure to Salesforce and focus on small-cap names that have been hit hard this earnings season. This is especially true as Salesforce - like many of its smaller-cap peers - saw a bit of growth deceleration this quarter as well. As seen in the chart above, Salesforce's current valuation multiple of ~7.5x forward revenues is approximately on par with its historical trends. I believe the catalysts to propel this stock meaningfully higher are limited, while opportunities for rebounds in the small cap space are far more likely. In short, while I'm happy to revisit a long position in Salesforce in the future, my current neutral thesis on Salesforce is less about Salesforce's own performance in a vacuum ; rather, it's more about portfolio allocation toward more attractive opportunities that exist at the moment.First, let's quickly dive into Salesforce's headline figures for Q1. The company's earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Salesforce 1Q20 resultsSource: Salesforce 1Q20 earnings releaseIt's a typical quarter for Salesforce - broad beats across both the top and bottom line, driven by newer products, while the perma-bears will still point to Salesforce's relative inability to generate meaningful GAAP profits. Revenues grew by 24% y/y to $3.74 billion - though this beat Wall Street's estimates of $3.69 billion (+23% y/y) by a 160bps margin, we note that growth decompressed by two points relative to the 26% y/y growth rate that Salesforce was able to generate in both Q4 and Q3. We note, however, that growth would have been 26% y/y in constant currency terms, though that's also down one point from Q4's 27% y/y constant currency growth rates.The culprit behind this deceleration, of course, is Sales Cloud - at this scale, Salesforce is a victim of its own success. Salesforce's original product generated just 11% y/y growth this quarter, and is on track to be surpassed by the faster-growing Service Cloud (+20% y/y growth). While there's certainly nothing wrong with having a newer product category take prominence over an older one, we note that Sales Cloud has never seen single-digit growth but is tipping toward it - which may unnerve some investors. Figure 2. Salesforce revenue by cloudSource: Salesforce 1Q20 earnings releaseHere's some additional qualitative commentary from CFO Mark Hawkins on the company's sales trends on the Q1 earnings call:Despite better-than-expected top line performance and strong renewals, however, Salesforce's profitability still remained rather muted. The company generated a 10% net margin and EPS of $0.66, only 8% above Wall Street's estimates of $0.61. No doubt that Salesforce executed well in Q1 and remains well on track to hit its targets in FY20 (it always does) - but what's missing is a ""wow"" factor. In my view, Salesforce has become predictable and boring. That might offer investors some comfort in a turbulent market, but growth investors with strong stomachs should turn to harder-hit small caps for stronger gains. What happened in Q1? Here's a shortlist of all the small and mid-cap SaaS stocks that have pulled back sharply over the past earnings season: Nutanix (NTNX), Domo (DOMO), Box (BOX), Pivotal Software (PVTL), Yext (YEXT), and Docusign (DOCU). The chart below illustrates the trend well: over the past month, as the earnings season has progressed, Salesforce has held flat at ~3% gains while these small/mid-cap names have shed in the double digits.Of course, these losses were sustained for valid reasons in many of these stocks. Many of these mid-cap cloud companies have seen marked deceleration in their growth rates, sparking fears of systemic sales execution/renewal issues, especially in uncertain macroeconomic times. Meanwhile, Salesforce has held up fairly well with management noting ""healthy"" renewal rates and normal attrition levels, giving it the appearance of a safe haven within the SaaS space - but we note that Salesforce, too, is victim of growth deceleration as well.No doubt the list of ""losers"" above needs to be combed carefully for rebound potential, as many companies like Box are veritably struggling with competition, pricing pressures and general slowdown in customer appetite (I like Yext and Docusign above the rest, both of which are growing in the mid~30s and substantially faster than Salesforce - more on the former here and on the latter here). But in general, I believe the value spectrum has shifted toward the small caps (individual stock selection critical here) and away from large caps like Salesforce. Based on the broad deceleration that has hit across the software sector (in both small caps and large caps like Salesforce alike), and the resulting damage that has disproportionally hit small caps, investors should reduce their exposure to Salesforce and begin to overweight smaller-cap names. As we saw during the January/February market recovery, these stocks tend to rebound very sharply once sentiment turns.None of this reflects on Salesforce's success as a company. Salesforce remains the #1 pure-play SaaS company that dominates in several product categories from CRM to Marketing and Platform - but at the same time, it's trading at a full valuation and isn't really winning any praise on the margins/earnings front. Its attractiveness as an investment, in my eyes, has declined in favor of ""fallen angels"" like Docusign. Investors should revisit a long position in Salesforce later when its relative valuation has come down, and not when it's near 52-week highs."

The $50 million top-line beat may have seemed small at first glance. But given the predictable recurring revenue model, the performance can be considered impressive. Adjusted EPS of $0.93, on the other hand, clearly left consensus of $0.61 in the dust.Credit: Rolling StoneSalesforce's clouds continued to expand at a healthy pace (see six-month revenue growth trend below, on the right), albeit at a decelerating pace that is expected as the company continues to gain scale. Marketing and platform, now accounting for nearly 40% of total revenues (vs. only one-third this time last year), continue to fill in the growth gap left by the maturing of the market-leading sales and service clouds. Once again this quarter, I estimate that much of the company's growth momentum has been fueled by acquisitions, including MuleSoft and the smaller Datorama and Rebel.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsLikely the result of operating leverage, profitability increased noticeably this time. Gross margin expanded YOY by about 140 bps, levels that I don't recall having seen in recent quarters. Opex increased at a faster pace than revenues, which seems largely in line with the company's need to integrate the recent acquisitions and continue to invest in top-line expansion.With revenue growth up in the mid-20s, op margin climbing an encouraging 120 bps and full-year EPS guidance receiving a 14-cent bump at the mid-point of the range, I believe Salesforce's longer-term financial targets remain well on track of being achieved, if not exceeded. See summarized P&L below.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from earnings releaseCRM has been one of the market-beating names in my All-Equities SRG portfolio since mid-2018.

But very importantly, the company's growth has been paced and largely predictable, a key tenet in my storm-resistant growth investment thesis.Data by YChartsCertainly, CRM continues to look pricey. Current-year P/E is likely to approach 60x on Wednesday, levels that are far from comfortable for most investors (certainly value-biased ones, which I once considered myself to be). But I believe the multiples to be justified, given a number of factors: (1) expected long-term earnings growth rate of 25% that looks compelling, (2) spotless, net cash-rich balance sheet, and (3) a recurring revenue model that is likely to not only grow over time, but remain relatively stable even through less-than-ideal macro environments."
4267537,20715,2019-05-31T10:43:21-04:00,Salesforce.com is expected to report earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday.Analysts are extremely bullish toward the stock with 40 out of 43 rating the stock as a buy.The stock has been trading in a range for the last three months.,"Application software company Salesforce.com (CRM) is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday. The report is for the fiscal first quarter of 2020 and analysts expect the company to report EPS of $0.61. The company earned $0.74 in the first quarter of 2019, meaning analysts expect a 17.6% decline in year over year earnings. The revenue estimate is for $3.68 billion and that is 22.5% above the revenues from 2019.Both the earnings growth and the revenue growth are below the pace Salesforce has set in recent years. In the last three years, earnings have grown at a rate of 45% per year while revenues have grown at a rate of 26%. The fourth quarter results were reported in March and they showed earnings growth of 23% with revenue growth of 26%.Salesforce’s management efficiency measurements are average at this point. The return on equity is at 12.8% and the profit margin is at 16.9%.Personally, I think Salesforce will need to improve the ROE and profit margin if the stock is going to resume the torrid pace the stock set in 2017 and the first three quarters of 2018.From the beginning of 2017 through the end of the third quarter of 2018, Salesforce jumped from under $70 a share to over $160. The stock traded in a pretty tight trend channel during this stretch, but it fell below the lower rail last October. Like the overall market, the stock fell considerably in the fourth quarter, but something that was different was that the stock bottomed in November rather than December.Salesforce bounced sharply from its low and gained over 45% from the November low through the end of February. Since then, the stock has really been moving sideways for the last three months within a range between $150 and $167.The sideways action has caused the weekly stochastic readings to move slowly lower and they are now close to oversold territory. The indicators haven’t been this close to oversold since last fall and before that it was all the way back at the end of 2016. The 10-week RSI is just below the midway point and has only reached oversold levels on two occasions in the last three and a half years.It is also worth noting that the sideways action has allowed the 52-week moving average to catch up to the stock. After the big rally in January and February, a pretty sizable gap had formed between the stock and the moving average.One thing I expect from the earnings report is that it will help move the stock out of the range it has been in for the last three months. It might not happen immediately, but I don’t see the range holding for the next three months.Turning our attention to the sentiment indicators, the overall sentiment toward Salesforce is pretty bullish, especially the analysts' ratings. Normally, I lump the “buy” and “overweight” ratings together and consider them all “buy” ratings. In the case of Salesforce, it is worth looking at them separately because there are 37 “buy” ratings. There are also three “overweight” ratings and three “hold” ratings.If we consider the overweight as buy ratings, it means that 93% of all ratings are “buy” ratings. That is one of the highest buy percentages I have seen lately. The only two stocks that I could think of that were even close to a similar buy percentage were Alphabet (GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN). Alphabet’s buy percentage is 88% with 37 of 42 being buy and overweight ratings. Amazon’s buy percentage is 100% with 43 “buy” ratings and four “overweight” ratings. In terms of strictly “buy” ratings, Amazon is the only company I can think of with more than the 37 for Salesforce.The short interest ratio for Salesforce is currently at 2.1. That reading is a little below average and the number of shares sold short jumped by 11% from the end of April through the mid-May reading. The number of shares sold short moved from 9.57 million to 10.62 million. While this indicates an increase in bearish sentiment, the ratio is hardly high enough to spur a short covering rally.As for the put/call ratio, it is in the average range. The current reading is 0.818 with 138,371 puts open and 169,056 calls open at this time. When Salesforce reported earnings on March 4, the put/call ratio was at an even 1.0.The overall sentiment toward Salesforce is skewed to the optimistic side with analysts extremely bullish. The short interest ratio is a little below average, but short interest has increased. The put/call ratio is average, but it has fallen recently and that is a sign of increasing optimism.I can’t give Salesforce a bullish outlook at this point. With earnings expected to decline on a year-over-year basis and with the average management efficiency measurements, I’m not sure the stock deserves the bullish sentiment it is getting. With the stock jumping early in the year and now stuck in a range, I’m not sure investors are ready for a decline in the EPS.There isn’t enough short interest to really push the stock higher and create a short squeeze after the earnings report. There is also very little chance of upgrades from analysts.There is resistance at the top of the range ($167). But the rising 52-week moving average could act as support and it is just under the bottom of the current range ($150).Right now, I am steering clear of Salesforce. If the stock were to fall down to the $130 area, I would be more bullish from a technical perspective. I would also like to see the sentiment shift away from the bullish side, at least a little. Maybe see some of the analysts move to “hold” ratings and see the short interest ratio move above the 3.0 level.I stated earlier that I thought Salesforce would break out of its range after the earnings report. If I had to place a bet on which way it would break, I would have to go with it breaking below the $150 level. I don’t think there is enough bearish sentiment to help drive the stock above the $167 level, but there is enough bullish sentiment that could shift to a more cautious stance and could drive the stock below the bottom end of the range."

(CRM) has produced strong growth over the last decade and management is expecting more growth for 2021. The company operates with moderate profit margins and returns on equity. While the company's profit margin was reasonable at 8% for the last fiscal year, the margins have been poor over the last decade. Also, the return on equity is currently at 8%, but this is the best it's been for the last decade.The company's balance sheet shows moderate debt levels with Salesforce.com's long-term debt at only 10% of the value of its assets and its total liabilities is 49% of the value of its assets.With the moderate total debt level, the company can easily take on more debt if needed (for any future capital expenditure plans the company may have). I prefer companies with total liabilities under 50% of the total asset value - as this gives the company plenty of leeway before debt becomes excessive. When debt levels raise, so does the bankruptcy risk which is something I like to avoid when investing with a long-term view.Salesforce.com operates with a minimal amount of working capital (with a current ratio of 0.95) meaning that its short-term assets (such as cash and deposits) do not quite cover its short-term liabilities (bills the company has to pay). I personally prefer current ratios above 1.0 so that the company's bills can be paid with cash rather than having to dip into its long-term finances.Salesforce.com's forward PE multiple is 75x with a stock price of $155. The company's trailing PE multiple is 105x and its book value multiple is 7.6x. These multiples imply that Salesforce.com is expensive.Salesforce.com has a significant history of growth with its revenue increasing 78% per year over the last decade. The chart below visually shows Salesforce.com's revenue and earnings trend over the last decade along with the next two years of consensus forecasts.Salesforce data by ADVFNAs the above chart shows, Salesforce.com's revenue has consistently increased over the last decade and the forecasts show this trend continuing into 2021/01. The earnings initially declined with losses through 2013/01 to 2015/01. The company's earnings then picked up and its growth is expected to continue into 2021/01.Salesforce.com has been busy on the acquisition front having acquired four companies already this year. Last year, Salesforce.com acquired five companies.The acquisitions so far this year include,While acquisitions have been a key driver for Salesforce.com's growth, the company also generates growth organically which management expects to continue, with Marc Benioff stating in their latest earnings call:To help drive organic growth, Salesforce.com has partnered with Apple (AAPL) for developing apps. Apple and Salesforce are developing a mobile software developer's kit (SDK) so that businesses can use Salesforce.com's cloud-based software on mobile devices.I think partnering with Apple is a good move as Apple's specialty is mobile devices and its programming language. Since the cloud gives remote access, it makes perfect sense for Salesforce.com to make its cloud services available on mobile devices. Apple will even be launching a new Get Started iOS App to assist software developers with building apps for Salesforce.com's cloud services.Salesforce.com and Amazon's AWS (Amazon Web Services) (NASDAQ:AMZN) are offering a new set of data integration services for their common customers using the cloud. This will make it easier for customers to use more Salesforce.com applications on AWS, such as Salesforce.com's customer relationship management software.To further its organic growth, Salesforce.com is finding international clients for their customer relationship management (CRM) cloud-based system, with Keith Block - Co-Chief Executive Officer, stating:National Australia Bank is one of the biggest banks in Australia and will be replacing 13 existing systems with the Salesforce.com CRM platform. Salesforce.com and Telstra (OTCPK:TLSYY) (a dominate telecommunications company in Australia) have joined forces to deliver Salesforce.com's CRM applications to customers over Telstra's wireless networks.Management is confident that Salesforce.com will continue to grow, with Mark Hawkins - President and CFO, stating:Whenever I see management raising their guidance, it tells me that they are confident in the company's ability. As an investor, I'm reliant on management's views. The projected growth is around 20% per year, which is quite high, but the company has grown significantly over 70% per year over the last decade. So, the projected growth rate is actually lower than its historical growth rate. I think that the company will likely continue expanding, even if its future earnings growth shows some volatility like it has in the past.Salesforce.com has a history of revenue growth. The company's earnings have increased, although there were earnings losses for a number of years. Even with the losses, the average growth rate was still 74% per year. The forecast earnings growth rate is 20% heading into the 2021/01 fiscal year. The PEG (PE divided by the earnings growth rate) can be used to arrive at a valuation based on its earnings growth.Using the forecast earnings growth rate of 20% gives a forward PEG of around 3.8 with a 2021/01 PE multiple of 75x.It's commonly accepted that a stock is fairly valued when its forward PEG is 1.0 which means that Salesforce.com is overvalued with a stock price of $155. Its fair value would be around $40.Most good growth stocks usually have forward PEG's in the 1.5 to 2.5 range, but Salesforce.com's forward PEG of 3.8 is expensive, even for a growth stock.As an active investor, I personally like to determine some likely price targets. This gives me a feel for how high the stock price could go in the short term and how soon it could get there.Salesforce chart by StockCharts.comOver the last decade, Salesforce.com's stock price has surged higher. The stock pulled back late last year as the stock market pulled back from its all-time high. The stock market resumed its rally this year and Salesforce.com rallied back up along with the market.In the short term, the stock could rally some more and will probably do so as long as the market continues to rally. The strong 50% rallies seen during the last two years could be replicated again this year. Adding a 50% rally to the $120 low from late last year gives a target of $180 that could be reached within a year.Salesforce.com has a history of strong growth and this growth is expected to continue. As the stock is quite expensive, I suspect that it will be vulnerable to corrections if future earnings disappoint the market. Over the longer term, I think that Salesforce.com has the potential to trade higher, but its high stock price for its earnings makes the stock vulnerable to significant corrections.Salesforce.com derives its growth from a combination of organic growth and acquisitions (having acquired 4 companies so far this year and five companies last year). Salesforce.com has expanded significantly over the last decade with its revenue increasing at an average rate of 78% per year.Salesforce.com has partnered with Apple to make its cloud-based software services available on mobile devices. The company continues to increase its client base internationally with Australian company National Australia Bank replacing older existing systems with Salesforce.com systems. Also, in Australia, Telstra will deliver CRM applications to customers over Telstra's wireless network.While Salesforce.com has grown significantly, the stock is expensive with a forward PEG of 3.8 and a forward PE multiple of 75x. Management expects 20% per year growth, but the valuations are too high for my liking. I'm confident that management will deliver growth, but the stock is priced for perfection, and if future growth disappoints, the stock is vulnerable to a significant correction. Even halving the current stock price would still leave the company expensive but more acceptable from a valuation point of view."

No, I don’t have experience conducting sales through phonebooks, company directories, or third-party published reports. Yes, the old dinosaurs of the sales industry would laugh at me, however the truth is, they themselves have begun to see the value of a high-quality CRM software.The CRM software industry is highly competitive and there are a lot of good companies. Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), SAP (ETR: SAP), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), Hubspot (NYSE: HUBS), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are perhaps the biggest CRM software companies in the industry. These are all large companies with advanced capabilities that many sales professionals are familiar with. However, the most impressive CRM I’ve worked with has been Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). The superiority of Salesforce propelled my sales career rather quickly. The California-based SaaS company leads the industry in revenue market share worldwide for good reason, and investing in their growth is backed up by strong fundamentals and sound management. Wall Street’s last seven reports on Salesforce have been in favour of the company and the average price target now stands at $181.40. However, the potential growth from this stock stands at a much higher value, shares will reach the $200 to $210 level by year-end and represent a tremendous buying opportunity for investors.Source: IDC, Worldwide Semiannual Software Tracker, April 2019.Fourth quarter results have seemed to reinforce the estimated price target. Once again, EPS beat estimates, which were reported at $0.70, $0.15 greater than the $0.55 consensus.To summarize: The results are rather impressive given the highly competitive nature of the industry. Salesforce has rapidly accelerated as market leaders through constant innovation and strategic acquisitions complemented by a highly effective business model focusing on growth and customer retention. The company is projecting 21% revenue growth in 2019 and has explicitly stated it’s intention of organically doubling revenue in the next four years.Before the availability of instantaneous information, selling was often associated with information asymmetry at the benefit of the salesman. Buyers were weary and had to be extremely vigilant and careful in understanding the risk that a product may fail to meet their expectations and/or have defects. This “buyer beware” approach was known as caveat emptor and frankly made the process of selling much easier from the seller’s perspective. However, with the advance of technology that is now available at consumers’ fingertips, individuals can rapidly access a plethora of information while being sold on a product. Essentially, the script has flipped and has made selling a far more advanced process where sellers must correctly diagnose a customer’s needs and identify an appropriate solution. Sellers are now more accountable than ever for providing accurate information. This new approach to selling is known as caveat venditor and has ultimately benefited the economy by decreasing risk, optimizing products, and addressing consumers’ needs more efficiently.Salesforce complements the new world of selling far better than its competitors. Sales processes are far more complex, lengthy, and analytical than ever before. The base of consumers has also rapidly expanded and managing clients from leads all the way to close requires strong organizational skills that Salesforce seamlessly provides through its highly customizable platform that makes pipeline management a breeze. Even compared to its most competitive counterpart, Oracle, Salesforce is the clear winner. From a management perspective, the website FinancesOnline is often the go-to website when deciding upon choosing a CRM software. The reason behind this is because of the website’s extensive ranking criteria that covers many topics not included with many other CRM-ranking websites.Source: FinancesOnline.Oracle’s Sales Cloud plans feature a $2,000 setup fee with plans starting at $2,000 per month. Oracle Sales Cloud also hampers customers by making them commit to long-term contracts with penalties for cancellation. Salesforce allows users to commit to shorter-term contracts without a setup fee, and even an unlimited version with a wide array of capabilities can be purchased for far less than Oracle’s offering. Additionally, another key under-looked factor is compatibility across various devices. The reason why this is under-looked is because of the growing mobility of salespeople and the need to access information across many devices in various locations. From an integration perspective, Salesforce integrates with a multiple of six times more than any other CRM software, another key metric given the role and power of big data to identify highly qualified leads with great potential. In any given day, Salesforce generates over 1.9 billion emails sent from its Marketing Cloud, logs over 9.7 million customer support cases on its Service Cloud, and creates over 3.2 million sales leads in its Sales Cloud. These values will only continue to grow as the company continues to gain market share.Source: FinancesOnline.Insights into sales activities, pipeline, and forecasting have all been vital in building upon Salesforce’s competitive advantage. The dashboards and reporting Salesforce offers are extremely customizable and present real-time relevant information useful for sales reps, sales managers, and senior managers. Salesforce can generate advanced, detailed reports ranging from lost opportunities by geographic territory all the way to highest revenue value by sector or customer segment. Identifying which lead sources yield the most valuable deals is a paramount metric for any company, and Salesforce’s ability in accurately reporting on this makes it an extremely valuable tool worth the investment. Complex/lengthy sales processes are the new norm, and among CRM software, Salesforce addresses this the most effectively and makes it highly applicable for small startups, SMEs, and large enterprises.Source: FiverrSalesforce dominates because of their constant desire to innovate and reshape approaches to selling. Einstein AI, a new artificial intelligence assistant integrated within Salesforce’s different cloud solutions, automatically uncovers relevant insights, predicts future behaviour, proactively recommends the next best possible steps, and ultimately automates these tasks. It’s innovations like these that generate tremendous revenue potential for not only Salesforce, but its customers by allowing them to explore new and qualified customers that would receive the greatest benefit from their products. Salesforce Lightning has also been a game changer in terms of improving productivity. Lightning almost instantaneously delivers tools and services to automate business processes, integrate external applications, and generate reports. Ultimately, a business benefits from this through increased efficiency, optimized operational capabilities, and the opportunity to build upon business through applications directly in line with the purchasing company.In the modern age of selling, customers' needs are increasingly becoming more dynamic. A versatile CRM software that is able to assist in uncovering the needs of various individuals is the only way to stay relevant as creative destruction victimizes business after business for not evolving the capabilities of their offered product. Better selling yields better products and services to customers. It also generates unprecedented levels of economic growth by offering businesses the potential to deliver these higher-quality products to not only more customers, but the right customers. The company is projecting revenue growth of 26% and EPS growth of 192%. Given the way Salesforce has reinvented selling, these expectations will once again be beat, leading to higher share prices. Salesforce has become synonymous with selling and will propel its stock price to $200 to $210 by year-end 2019.Source: Salesforce.com."
4247557,104608,2019-03-09T15:34:57-05:00,"Salesforce remains in a great long-term position and the recent acquisition of Mulesoft adds another layer of value.Q4 revenue grew 26% as the company is approaching a $15 billion run rate.Q1 guidance was a bit shy of expectations, however FY20 guidance was actually raised slightly from last quarter and still implies 20%-21% growth.Valuation has pulled back a bit post earnings, but provides a great buying opportunity for long-term holders.","Salesforce.com (CRM) reported another strong quarter, although first quarter guidance appeared to be slightly short of consensus expectations. For a company that typically posts a beat-and-raise quarter, investors punished the stock as it traded off ~5% post earnings.Investors appear to be a bit worried about the weaker than expected guidance, however, I view this as a good buying opportunity. The company eclipsed the $10 billion revenue mark in 2018 in very quick fashion. CRM actually noted they are the fastest enterprise software company to reach this milestone, a rather impressive feat.Despite falling ~25% from the October high, CRM has rebounded quite nicely and recently surpassed the pre-selloff high. Investors seem to follow this stock like a cult, which is why the post-earnings sell-off provides a great opportunity. Financials remain strong and even the weaker than expected Q1 guidance places the company in a great long-term positionThough CRM is still up nearly 35% year-to-date, they remain down ~10% from their recent highs. Over the long term, CRM is one of the clear leaders in the new hybrid cloud environment and a name that should be held onto for many years.CRM has rebounded from the recent lows, as they were once down ~25% from their all-time highs, following the broad market correction. This correction hit SaaS technology stocks especially hard, but their Q3 earnings reinforced CRM’s aggressive growth potential and erased any concerns about fundamental weakness. Although Q4 earnings were strong, Q1 guidance seemed to be a bit light compared to census, thus providing a solid buying opportunity.Prior to third quarter ending, CRM acquired one of the leading back-end infrastructure software companies, MuleSoft, for a massive $6.5 billion, or ~16.5x forward revenue. Historically, CRM has focused on the front-end of applications, however, there continues to be a significant demand for back-end operations. The PaaS space continues to grow and develop as enterprise customers look to integrate front- and back-end applications together. This is a significant opportunity of growth that CRM is in a great position due to their acquisition of MuleSoft.Source: Company PresentationDuring Q4, revenues grew 26% year-over-year to $3.6 billion which was ahead of consensus estimates for 24% year-over-year growth. Q4 revenue growth showed no signs of deceleration from Q3, another impressive feat considering the run-rate revenue of nearly $15 billion. As CRM continues to expand and diversify their revenue, they should be able to maintain strong 20%-plus revenue growth for the next several quarters.Source: Company PresentationPlatform revenue continues to drive most of CRM's revenue growth, which was up 54% in Q4, well ahead of Service Cloud's 22% growth and Sales Cloud's 11% growth. Sales Cloud continues to be the largest segment of revenue, representing nearly 31% of total revenue, down from 33% last quarter. However, this segment’s growth remains well below the total company, at just 11%. As this segment continues to grow at a slower pace and become a smaller portion of overall revenue, the higher growth revenue will drive total company revenue growth in the likes of 20%-plus.By geography, revenue from Europe was up 31% and represented 19% of total revenue. Growth in Asia Pacific also was strong at 25%, thus demonstrating the international revenue base continuing to grow at a healthy pace.Source: Company PresentationOver the past few years, CRM has done a great job becoming more profitable. Investors have historically knocked down valuation a bit because of the lack of GAAP profitability from this name. Operating cash flows grew very well at 27% to $1.33 billion and continued strong operating margins drove EPS to $0.70, a 49% growth compared to last year and well ahead of consensus expectations for $0.55.Source: Company PresentationFor Q1, management expects revenue to grow 22% to $3.67-3.68 billion. The 22% revenue growth is a slight deceleration from the 26% revenue growth in Q4. However, Q1 guidance was slightly below consensus expectations of 23% growth to $3.69 billion. This should not be viewed as a negative for two main reasons. First, CRM is a nearly $15 billion run-rate revenue company and a slight deceleration should be expected for a company growing mid-20s. And second, going off historical trends, CRM could beat their revenue guidance and end up growing closer to 24% in Q1.The high end of management's guidance is only slightly below consensus expectations, by $10 million. If we assume CRM continues on their quarterly revenue beat pattern, we are likely to see Q1 revenue closer to consensus original expectations.Management also put out updated FY20 guidance targets, with revenues expecting to grow 20-21% to $15.95-16.05 billion, a slight raise from their prior expectations for $15.9-16.0 billion. The midpoint of FY20 revenue guidance was exactly what consensus expected, $15.99 billion. Despite the weaker than expected Q1 guidance, management remains very confident in the full-year outlook.EPS guidance of $2.74-2.76 represents flat growth from FY19, another worry investors had. Despite CRM's history of beating bottom line guidance, investors could remain a bit concerned about EPS guidance. However, if we believe revenue will ultimately beat guidance and margins somewhat improve over the year, we could see a nice bottom line performance in FY20.After another beat and raise quarter and with management guiding to 20%-21% revenue growth for FY20, investors should be very confident in the long-term trajectory of CRM. Despite coming off a 25% correction in the past few months, CRM has rallied back and was recently trading above their pre-correction highs. Investors took some off the table after receiving lighter than expected Q1 guidance, however, full-year guidance was actually raised as management remains very confident in the business fundamentals. I believe CRM is in an excellent position to continue on their growth trajectory and reach new all-time highs heading into 2019.The acquisition of MuleSoft also gives CRM additional room to run as they enter the front-end of applications. As the PaaS market inevitably continues on the high-growth path, CRM will begin to develop a strong foothold and grow their market share. Trading at just over 7x forward revenue, and below the recent valuation over the past few months, this name is a solid SaaS tech name to hold onto for the long term.In my opinion, there are other growth SaaS names that may have a higher return potential in 2019, however, there are very few names (and even less in the tech sector) that provide the consistent execution as CRM. Over the long term, CRM is an absolute winner that should be held onto.Risks to CRM include integration with MuleSoft not working out as planned. The $6.5 billion purchase was viewed as pretty high and if CRM is not able to successfully integrate the acquisition and realize the benefits, investors may begin to look elsewhere to deploy their capital. Also, if the market goes through another correction, much like the one we just went through the past few weeks, CRM is not immune to their valuation contracting."
4246785,103480,2019-03-06T15:48:55-05:00,"Shares of Salesforce dipped approximately 5% after announcing Q1 guidance estimates that came in a hair below consensus.Despite this, Salesforce smashed Wall Street's top and bottom line targets in Q4.Revenues continued to grow at 26% y/y, unchanged from last quarter's growth rate, which is a tremendous accomplishment for a company at a ~$15 billion annual run rate.Salesforce's focus on Platform as a Service has continued to play out well, making Platform the largest contributor to revenue growth over several quarters.The company has also outlined an aggressive revenue target of $26-$28 billion (nearly double FY20 targets) by FY23.","In a rare reversal of fortune for the world's largest pure-play cloud computing company, Salesforce.com (CRM) took a ~5% tumble after reporting solid Q4 results. Investors looked ahead to a subpar guidance outlook for Q1 which fell slightly short of Wall Street's estimates, and the negative reaction broke a multi-quarter streak for a company that is typically known for the reliability of its ""beat and raise"" earnings pattern.The main question on investors' minds: Do we have anything to be worried about? Is the dip a signal to lock in gains, or is it an opportunity to load up on more shares? In my view, Salesforce remains a hold - and investors should increase exposure here.Data by YChartsLet's quickly review all the recent themes surrounding Salesforce and its push toward >$20 billion in revenues (note also that in this quarter's earnings call, management announced an ambitious goal to reach $26-$28 billion in revenues by FY23, essentially saying that Salesforce will again double its revenues within the next four years).The story at Salesforce is shifting more and more toward Platform-as-a-Service - which is a major pivot for a company that is best known for literally pioneering the SaaS application software category. This strategic shift was highlighted strongly by Salesforce's purchase of high-flying PaaS company MuleSoft for a whopping $6.5 billion (one of Salesforce's largest deals ever). With the addition of MuleSoft and with increased focus on Salesforce's third-party app store and services, Platform revenues unsurprisingly clocked in at their highest percentage (23%) of total revenues in FY19.Figure 1. Salesforce FY19 revenue by cloud categorySource: Salesforce Q4 earnings releaseWhile Sales Cloud is still the dominant seller at 33% of revenues, Platform is the fastest-growing - up 49% y/y in FY19 including MuleSoft, versus just 13% y/y growth in Sales Cloud. This is incredibly important for Salesforce as establishing a presence in PaaS essentially makes Salesforce the gold standard for running a business in the cloud. A bit more on that: Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP), for example, became such large software giants because large global enterprises use so many of their solutions in a neat, coordinated bundle. Salesforce is attempting to achieve a similar effect by pushing its PaaS offerings - by making Salesforce the foundation on which IT leaders build and deploy their applications, Salesforce becomes the de facto core of an organization's technology stack. When viewed from this lens, Salesforce's target of doubling revenues within the next four years doesn't seem too lofty.Investors are naturally concerned about near-term guidance. The company's outlook for $3.67-$3.68 billion (+22% y/y) in revenues falls just short of Wall Street expectations of $3.69 billion (+23% y/y). We do have to remember, however, that Salesforce is a serial under-caller of its guidance ranges. For Q4 (the quarter just ended), for example, Salesforce guided to $3.55-$3.56 billion in revenues (+24% y/y), but actually came in at $3.60 billion (+26% y/y), or an entire $40 million above the high end of its original guidance range. Figure 2. Salesforce guidance Source: Salesforce Q4 earnings releaseThe high end of Salesforce's Q1 guidance is only $10 million below Wall Street's expectations. Given that Salesforce will likely achieve a similar magnitude of beat in Q1, any concerns about any meaningful growth deceleration in Q1 should be diminished. Note also that Salesforce's full year FY20 guidance of $15.95-$16.05 billion in revenues (+20-21% y/y) also hit Wall Street's mark of $15.99 billion, which is also reassuring in light of a seemingly weaker Q1 outlook. It's worth noting as well that Salesforce's pro forma EPS guidance midpoint of $2.75 also represents flat EPS to FY19, but the company's consistent bottom line beats also suggest that EPS will actually clock in higher for the coming year.With all the focus on Q1 guidance, it's also easy to lose sight of the fact that Salesforce posted a tremendous fourth quarter. Here's a look at the earnings summary below:Figure 3. Salesforce 4Q19 resultsSource: Salesforce Q4 earnings releaseRevenues grew 26% y/y to $3.60 billion, surpassing Wall Street's estimates of $3.56 billion (+24% y/y, also the high end of Salesforce's own Q4 guidance ranges) and showing no deceleration whatsoever from Q3's growth rate. A couple of interesting notes on Salesforce's growth. As previously mentioned, Platform revenues are driving the majority of Salesforce's top-line advancement, up 54% y/y in Q1 and far outpacing Sales Cloud's 11% y/y growth and Service Cloud's 22% y/y growth. Note also that on a geo basis, Salesforce saw the strongest constant currency growth in Europe, up 31% y/y. This contrasts sharply against SaaS peer Box (BOX), which earlier last week had called out Europe as its poorest-performing region and the major driver behind a slowdown in billings.Figure 4. Salesforce growth by geographySource: Salesforce Q4 earnings releaseAlso important to note is that Keith Block, who was recently elevated to co-CEO alongside Marc Benioff, mentioned that Salesforce is having strong traction with resellers and systems integrators. Among large-cap software companies, growth in the reseller channel has been incredibly important to sustaining strong revenue growth. Per Block's comments on the Q4 earnings call:Because resellers and SIs also tend to take on more of Salesforce's lower-margin professional services work, a channel mix shift toward resellers is also hugely beneficial to Salesforce's margin. Note as well that Salesforce drove 27% y/y growth in operating cash flows to $1.33 billion, and pro forma EPS of $0.70 grew 49% y/y and showed massive 27% upside surprise to Wall Street's expectations of $0.55. Salesforce's post-earnings stock dip has effectively priced in the risks that investors are fearing. The concern of deceleration is certainly legitimate - next year, the acquisition of MuleSoft will be ""lapped,"" and Salesforce's optical growth rates will see pressure. However, the most recent trends we've seen coming out of Q4 suggest that it's too soon to bank on a slowdown anytime soon, especially with Salesforce greatly expanding its presence in the reseller channel. The fact that Salesforce was able to effectively double net new partner additions in EMEA and APAC will be tremendous growth drivers in those key regions in FY20. Salesforce's strategy of becoming the dominant enterprise software platform to run the modern enterprise is the biggest reason to remain invested in this stock. The company has confidently signaled its ability to double its revenue base within 4 years, and its stock should also rise in tandem."

        Earnings growth will likely be robust, but margin erosion could become a point of contention.
        I rate CRM a hold into earnings.","Salesforce.com Tower Indianapolis. Source: Salesforce.comSalesforce.com (CRM) reports quarterly earnings Monday. Analysts expect revenue of $3.56 billion and eps of $0.55. The revenue estimate implies 5% growth sequentially. Investors should focus on the following key items.Salesforce derives revenue from subscription fees from customers accessing its enterprise cloud computing services and from professional and training services. The company's flagship Sales Cloud product represented over 30% of total revenue. Its revenue grew again by double-digits. Service Cloud and Salesforce Platform, the next largest operating segments, grew revenue 24% and 51%, respectively.A key metric for the company could be its unearned revenue and/or backlog. Unearned revenue could give an indication as to where the company's future revenue is headed. Unearned revenue consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services and recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Source: Shock ExchangeUnearned revenue increased 26% Y/Y. However, it fell 9% sequentially. The company's revenue recognized over time ($3.2 billion) and revenue recognized at a point in time ($0.2 billion) exceeded billings of $2.9 billion. In the upcoming quarter management expects unearned revenue to grow 17% Y/Y and 52% sequentially:Investors could take robust growth in unearned revenue as a bullish sign. Management's revenue guidance for the next fiscal year could also determine sentiment going forward.Salesforce's revenue growth has been explosive. That growth as come organically and via acquisitions. A key test is whether the company can continue to grow revenue and maintain margins at same time. Oracle's (ORCL) revenue growth has stagnated, yet it has been able to maintain its bottom line through cost cuts. Salesforce's revenue for the quarter-ended October 2018 was up 26%. Its gross margin was 73.8%, up 2 basis points versus the year earlier period. However, gross margin was down 3 basis points sequentially.R&D, marketing, and general expenses totaled 71% of revenue during the quarter, up from 68% in the year-earlier period. Saleforce's EBITDA margin fell 900 basis points to 39%. As a result, EBITDA only grew 1% Y/Y, despite strong top line growth. The important question is, ""Why are margins falling?"" Salesforce likely has to spend money in order to book new business. If revenue growth stagnates then management may be able to buoy EBITDA with spending cuts. However, if gross margin is falling due to pricing pressure or to lower margin business brought on via acquisitions then that could be more difficult to fix. Margin erosion could be a point of contention this quarter.CRM is up nearly 30% Y/Y. With a $126 billion enterprise value, CRM trades at an astronomical 91x run-rate EBITDA. The stock is priced to perfection. Revenue growth will likely be robust against, but margin erosion could hurt sentiment long-term. I rate CRM a hold into earnings."
4243167,104662,2019-02-21T23:24:30-05:00,"Salesforce's premium valuation is predicated on market share growth and TAM expansion.Its PaaS offering, led by Lightning, App Cloud, and AppExchange, is a wide moat growth driver.Mulesoft and Einstein benefit from secular trends in API capabilities and intelligent workflows, respectively.Valuation risk remains high, but Salesforce has proven that its reinvestment has been efficient.Sentiment and valuation will decrease if Salesforce continues to reinvest without corresponding revenue growth; so far this hasn't occurred.","Determining Salesforce’s (CRM) valuation is rather difficult, as the company is not focused on profits or margins. This strategy, employed by several other SaaS companies as well, has created confusion among investors, as some immediately throw away Salesforce as an investment due to the lack of a strong bottom line. And really, shouldn’t earnings be the basis of valuing a company?Another complication with Salesforce is that there is a lack of visibility when forecasting future profitability. Investors can start forecasting earnings growth based on guidance and market trends, but long-term forecasts may prove unreliable. For example, Salesforce has proven to be aggressive when it sees an opportunity, and it may look to sacrifice net margins (by increasing R&D and SG&A costs) and target market share in greenfield or emerging areas such as IoT, enterprise analytics, intelligent automation, or hyper-convergence etc.Shareholders would likely support management in expanding, even though net margins wouldn’t grow as expected. As a whole, it looks as if Salesforce is struggling with profitability. However, it is more likely that its core business can produce high net margins on its own, but its younger segments drag margins back down. Basically, Salesforce could be viewed as a combination between a steady core business, and a high growth, negative or low margin SaaS business, such as Twilio (TWLO), ServiceNow (NOW), and Splunk (SPLK).Below, I will review Salesforce’s growth drivers, organized by their current impact to Salesforce’s revenue (core business, growth drivers, and emerging growth drivers). Then, I will revisit its valuation, focusing on earnings vs. reinvestment costs.Source: SalesforceCurrently, about 57% of revenue is generated by the Sales Cloud and Service Cloud. Basically, these two offerings are the core of the company's CRM business (Salesforce’s entire portfolio is basically an end-to-end CRM offering, but I will use slightly different classifications to differentiate the offerings, as well as highlight different opportunities Salesforce can take advantage of).These two cloud offerings, often used together by enterprise customers, could be seen as the “cash cow” of Salesforce. Salesforce has had the top market share in CRM for five years, and is also growing market share faster than most competitors combined. In terms of effectiveness, Gartner also rates Salesforce as a Leader in CRM, and has rated Salesforce as a leader for ten consecutive years.Source: Available Through Salesforce (link here)Claiming that these two cloud offerings are “cash cows” is a bit tongue-in-cheek. We don’t have information on profitability of each segment, as Salesforce organizes itself in one single segment operationally. Also, Salesforce is gaining market share at an industry high rate, as explained in the press release:Sales Cloud and Service Cloud are still growing strong despite having a dominant market share position. However, their market share growth is still growing at a point where Salesforce likely sees a greater benefit in maintaining a higher SG&A cost (and lower margins), than shifting its focus to profitability.Source: SalesforceAs of now, I believe the Salesforce Platform, Marketing Cloud, and Commerce Cloud are the company's growth drivers. Salesforce Platform is reported in earnings as “Salesforce Platform and Other,” which clouds how much revenue it generates.However, Salesforce Platform is a very exciting growth driver, and has perhaps the strongest moat capabilities in the portfolio. Lightning, App Cloud, and AppExchange are the major offerings in this segment, which serve as its PaaS offerings. Companies such as Veeva (VEEV) build their products on Lightning, and these relationships create large switching costs. In addition, Salesforce has AppExchange and Heroku, which allow its portfolio to benefit from continuous innovation through third parties. Last quarter, this segment grew 51% YoY. Backing this growth is Salesforce’s ability to execute, with Gartner rating its platform offering as best in class as well.Source: Available Through Salesforce (link here)In addition, the Commerce and Marketing cloud offerings are also starting to make a more meaningful impact, contributing slightly less than 15% of revenue last quarter, but grew 37% YoY.This is an interesting segment, as the previously mentioned segments are all dominated by Salesforce. However, Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) have both invested heavily in this space, with Adobe buying two of the top vendors, Magento and Marketo, to establish a comprehensive offering that will compete with Salesforce.Because of this, Salesforce may enter into a spending spree to position itself better. Out of the four mentioned segments, this is the largest concern for investors. Commerce and Marketing Clouds are both natural fits in the overall ecosystem, and cross-selling potential is large. A takeover spree in marketing may be necessary if Salesforce wants to compete with Adobe, but I don’t think this is the best use of funds.Source: SalesforceThe TAM for commerce and marketing is very large, and I believe Salesforce can gain a sizable portion of these markets with cross-selling and organic growth. Therefore, I would view any large acquisition in these areas as a red flag for investors, as I believe this would be an inefficient use of capital.Currently, its emerging growth drivers are basically add-on features to its current portfolio offerings. These offerings consist of MuleSoft, IoT Cloud, and Einstein, among others.First, Einstein is an AI/Analytics offering that adds machine learning capabilities to Salesforce’s current offerings. In addition, there is also an integrated analytics tool offering. Einstein has large potential, and not just due to secular growth in analytics. As Salesforce has always been front and center in the low-code and automation revolution, Einstein expands its low-code offerings to include data science and machine learning capabilities, as it can increase intelligent workflow automation through integrations with external applications.IoT cloud is an interesting fit. On the surface, Salesforce offers a no-code IoT offering, where you can store IoT data into the Salesforce cloud. IoT is in the early innings for Salesforce still, and although I see a market for CRM and IoT, I don’t think it will make a large impact overall, and just serve as a nice add-on.Finally, there is the MuleSoft integration, where Wedbush noted that large wins and customer attrition led to an upgrade. MuleSoft, also marketed as Integration cloud, was a large acquisition early in 2018. Although valuation was steep (22x TTM revenue), MuleSoft was a smart strategic fit, and I believe that Salesforce can grow MuleSoft at a faster rate than what they could do alone. As management noted in the earnings call:MuleSoft is a middleware, which serves as an excellent fit for not only cross-selling purposes, but for increasing data integration between Salesforce’s offerings and other cloud providers. On the defensive side, Mulesoft increases switching costs and increases Salesforce’s moat. In addition, MuleSoft would be able to benefit from secular trends in API initiatives. From McKinsey:Source: Available Through SnapLogic (link here)As I mentioned before, when valuing a company like Salesforce, or any fast-growing SaaS company, investors have to evaluate earnings vs. reinvestment. ROIC is typically used, but Salesforce is focused on increasing revenue by increasing market share and increasing segments served. Because of this, the market has given Salesforce a premium valuation, on the basis that investors are willing to wait for meaningful margin growth once Salesforce has demonstrated a slowdown in market share and TAM growth. With this said, below are the relevant valuation metrics:Source: Seeking AlphaSalesforce has been a machine in revenue growth, with almost every quarter generating 25% revenue growth, give or take 2%. As mentioned before, I don’t see a catalyst for Salesforce forward P/E to decrease substantially (outside a corresponding bear market). Investors in the SaaS space value market share, TAM, and revenue growth. For Salesforce, this translates to a premium valuation, unless those three metrics fall without strong margin appreciation.I believe weakness in the Sales Cloud will be offset by the PaaS offering and MuleSoft, and I expect Salesforce to beat the conservative guidance given. P/S/G is used for early-stage software companies, so I don’t think it should be used for Salesforce. Compared to Adobe, it’s hard to see an attractive valuation for Salesforce, and a bear case is also predicated on it having low flexibility on SG&A costs. I don’t see evidence of this, as market share gains continue to grow faster than peers.As implied throughout this article, valuation risk is likely the largest risk for Salesforce, and a slowdown in market share growth and revenue growth could cause investors to pressure management to escalate margin growth.Although I don’t necessarily agree, there is also single leader risk, where if Marc Benioff stepped down or left, I believe Salesforce’s stock would suffer.On the business side, I’ll reiterate a couple of risks. First, MuleSoft was purchased at a high multiple. If MuleSoft entering the Salesforce ecosystem does not increase growth rates, then Salesforce will likely end up with a low ROI. Also, the digital marketing/commerce cloud market is becoming a red ocean, and Salesforce may spend aggressively if it believes it needs to counter Adobe.Otherwise, as I’ve mentioned in other articles, I don’t see large downside risk in software companies that improve efficiency and productivity in the workforce. Salesforce continues to see strong billing growth and a large RPO, and I believe this sub segment, focused on improving performance, will perform well in a slowdown, but not necessarily a full recession.Also, Gartner notes that Salesforce has pricing power and sells at a premium thanks to its moat, and CRM employees often are required to have Salesforce experience. However, market share growth may decline in a slowdown if businesses rely more heavily on cost, and Salesforce loses pricing power.Salesforce is a technology blue chip stock, with market dominance. However, margin growth is still slow, and P/CF multiples are high relative to other mega cap software companies. Despite that, I believe the market will continue to give a premium valuation to Salesforce as long as revenue growth remains in the mid-20s, and investments in new offerings (Einstein, Platform, MuleSoft) continue to succeed and contribute to revenue growth. I don’t expect the market to change the way it values software companies any time soon, but Salesforce does have high expectations that it needs to reach in order to keep its premium valuation. Overall, I believe Salesforce should be viewed as a best-in-class business that is trading in a currently overvalued sector.Disclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

Even though the technology sector was one of the most affected during this bear market, we see that software companies have shown to be more resistant despite being in one of the most ""expensive"" industries in the market.In the case of Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE: CRM), although the share price fell 25% of its historical high during October and November, the company still maintains an appreciation of 34% YTD thanks to a rapid recovery after showing solid results for its third quarter of 2019. This change in trend is partly due to the fact that executives increased their growth expectations for the rest of the year, and even more important, for next year; leaving behind part of the fears that revolved around the value of the company.CRM data by YChartsSalesforce has been known for being one of the fastest growing software providers, maintaining a CAGR above 20% for more than a decade. While revenues have been shown to be resistant to macroeconomic trends during this time, investors have been skeptical of the company's most recent acquisition. The purchase of MuleSoft in May 2018 for $6.4 billion raised doubts about the high price paid for the company, especially given that the market for this line of business is very different from Salesforce’s main market, which can in theory lead to integration problems that can reduce its profit margins in the future.Despite these concerns, we see that Salesforce is one of the best-positioned companies in the software industry. Their revenues have benefited both from trends coming from their core markets and from their business model. The ability of executives to identify growth drivers and invest in high growth product lines has kept the company as the undisputed leader in the customer relationship management (NYSE:CRM) space. (To learn more, read our software industry review)On the other hand, it seems that some investors see the price of shares trading at a fairly high premium compared to others in the sector, a situation that is worrying given the current fears that predominate in the market. However, by looking at Salesforce from an industry context, the company has several characteristics that make it a good long-term option.Management's ability to invest in markets with strong secular trends has been outstanding throughout the technology sector. The implementation of its software-as-a-service (SaaS) model in 2005 quickly consolidated Salesforce as the most important CRM service provider. Recently, cloud-based offerings such as the Sales Cloud and the Service Cloud have kept revenues in a prolonged period of growth that have been much higher than the industry average.Although Salesforce CRM applications were used by large financial, hospitality and healthcare companies at first, we see that they are increasingly used in retail and e-commerce companies. The proliferation of e-commerce companies has gone from little more than a trend to becoming a growth driver for many software application companies. Likewise, the growing orientation of delivering an increasingly personalized customer experience has meant that investments in CRM software by organizations have begun to surpass other types of business software, such as operating systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP), and data base.Source: Extracted from Salesforce investor presentation.This focus on providing a complete customer relationship experience has been key to Salesforce's success. Its highly focused services have expanded into new adjacent business lines that have made the company more than a CRM company. The new Marketing and Commerce Cloud offers seek to leverage the digital transformation of large companies. We see that the accessible markets of both digital marketing and e-commerce will become the new drivers of growth for the company within the next five years.Management has known how to integrate its entire product portfolio well. Its Marketing Cloud application gives a more complete vision of the clients by integrating the data of digital campaigns into the applications of Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, boosting the marketing efforts of its users. This unique vision is particularly useful for organizations that seek to offer more personalized marketing experiences. In the same way, its Commerce Cloud application allows the customer a unified experience across all points of commerce through multiple digital channels, allowing e-commerce to drive greater conversion and loyalty from their customers. Finally, we see that the recent acquisition of MuleSoft is proof of the company's focus on empowering customers with customer information. This new line of business called Integration Cloud seeks to capitalize on the recent digital transformation through connected experiences.Source: Extracted from Salesforce investor presentation.Overall, we see that the integration of data between Salesforce’s applications has created a high switching cost among its customers. These applications have entrenched themselves within the operations of companies, becoming a fundamental part of their processes. This advantage has manifested itself in high recurring revenues from its business customers, boosting the growth of total revenues.Although the software industry is dominated by large players such as Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle Corp. (NYSE: ORCL), for the case of the Application Software sub-industry we see that the offer is highly fragmented, with enterprise applications that fulfill very specific functions. Likewise, the strategies of these software suppliers have focused on the verticals of their core markets, focusing on cross-selling and expanding the offerings of their existing services. For its part, we see that Salesforce has had numerous acquisitions in recent years that have expanded its range of applications, continuing with this industry trend and always maintaining its integration approach between its application ecosystems.Net income has managed to enter positive territory during 2018, after a long losing streak. Additionally, the growth of both the top-line and the bottom-line is at the highest end of the industry now. This make us believe that Salesforce valuations are trading at a reasonable premium, especially when comparing its ratios against those of companies such as Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU) and Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTXS). We believe that this difference between Salesforce's valuations and its growth rate is what makes it an attractive option in the long term.Source: Data provided by Fidelity and various third parties.However, from an operational performance perspective, we see that the company's margins are quite compressed compared to the rest of the industry. While gross margin has begun to improve in recent quarters as cloud applications begin to show operational efficiencies, the operating margin continues to fall below its competitors.The costs related to marketing and sales are those that weigh more in operations, and it is expected that the percentage of these costs in relation to revenues will remain around 45% in the coming years. Salesforce has maintained this high cost structure as it seeks to increase the base of its customers and continues to build greater brand awareness. We consider that the expenses related to their international markets, the investment in strengthening their newly acquired businesses, and the acceleration in the hiring of their sales force will continue to weigh on operating margins in the future.Source: Data provided by Fidelity and various third parties.Although the company's margins and returns are below industry standards, we see that management's ability to generate a positive free cash flow is a positive point. We believe that this feature makes Salesforce more attractive, especially considering that the capital structure and debt levels have remained at stable levels, with a Debt-to-Equity ratio of around 0.28x.Overall, we see that Salesforce has several competitive advantages that have made the price of its shares trade at a reasonable premium. We estimate that a positive FCF will allow the company to pursue new growth opportunities through acquisitions, while continuing to invest in its marketing and sales efforts to maintain revenues in its current growth spurt. Likewise, we estimate that the expansion into new high growth markets, with its Marketing, Commerce, and Integration Cloud application will allow the company to maintain its growth rate of 25% over the next five years."

Sell CRM.,"Salesforce.com Tower Indianapolis. Source: Salesforce.comSalesforce.com (CRM) continues to show impressive financial results. In its most recent quarter, the company delivered revenue of $3.39 billion and EPS of $0.13. Revenue was up 26% Y/Y and 3% sequentially. Salesforce.com also boosted its FY19 revenue guidance to $13.24 billion, which represented 26% growth Y/Y. It initiated FY20 revenue guidance at $16 billion, representing 21% annual growth. The guidance reflects the current momentum in the business.Corporations around the world are leveraging technology to change their culture and manage client relations. The digital transformation in helping companies become more connected to clients has inured to the benefit of Salesforce.com. The majority of the company's services are cloud-based, which separates it from Oracle (ORCL) and certain other companies. Salesforce.com has dominated the cloud and considers itself the global leader in customer relationship management.Its leadership in the cloud and the strength of its relationships could help the company defend its presence within the industry. The stock is up by double digits since earnings were reported, but the glass appears half empty.Salesforce.com derives revenue from subscription fees from customers accessing its enterprise cloud computing services and from professional and training services. The company's flagship Sales Cloud product represented over 30% of total revenue. Its revenue grew 11% Y/Y. Service Cloud and Salesforce Platform, the next largest operating segments, grew revenue 24% and 51%, respectively.The company's unearned revenue and/or backlog is another metric that helps determine the direction of future revenue. Unearned revenue consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services and recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred.Source: Shock ExchangeUnearned revenue increased 26% Y/Y. However, it fell 9% sequentially. The company's revenue recognized over time ($3.2 billion) and revenue recognized at a point in time ($0.2 billion) exceeded billings of $2.9 billion. Unearned revenue also fell during the quarter ended July 31, 2018. Next quarter management expects unearned revenue to grow 17% Y/Y and 52% sequentially.Heading into the quarter, I suspected billings would disappoint. They were $2.2 billion for the quarter ended April 30, 2018, and $2.9 billion for the quarter ended July 31, 2018. They ticked down slightly this quarter; however, the decline in billings did not change the narrative. Management's expectations of double-digit revenue growth for FY20 was the main focus of investors. Such revenue growth implies strong billings growth for the foreseeable future.Given Salesforce.com's strong top-line growth, I would have assumed an expansion of its margins. Gross margin was 73.8%, slightly up from 73.6% in the year-earlier period. Cost of services are primarily expenses related to delivering Salesforce.com's service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity and certain fees paid to third parties for the use of their technology, services, and data. The company could be so focused on growing revenue that it could be difficult to contain expenses.R&D, marketing, and general expenses totaled 71% of revenue during the quarter, up from 68% in the year-earlier period. The company's EBITDA margin fell 900 basis points to 39%. As a result, EBITDA only grew 1% Y/Y, despite the 26% growth in revenue. Salesforce.com likely has to spend money in order to book new business. I expect its EBITDA margins to improve once revenue growth slows.Salesforce.com has benefited from the animal spirits unleashed since the Financial Crisis. Extremely low interest rates and top-down stimulus have helped spur business fixed investment. However, the Fed is now removing the punch bowl. Industrial production for the month of October was 0.1 percent month-over-month. This was nothing to write home about. A weak economy could lead to mass corporate layoffs; fewer employees who access the Salesforce.com's systems remotely could lead to less revenue.CEO Marc Benioff had this to say about the economy on the earnings call:Benioff made an astute observation pursuant to CEOs ""investing aggressively."" The lion's share of bailouts and tax cuts since the Financial Crisis has been designed to spur business fixed investment. I believe more of the stimulus efforts should have gone to consumers.If consumers cannot afford to buy the new products being built by corporations, then it could be a drag on the economy. With 96 million people no longer in the labor force, who does Mr. Benioff think will purchase all these products his clients are looking to build? Moreover, the debt binge corporations have embarked on amid record low rates could tamp down business as corporations seek to service that. That does not bode well for growth in the customer relationship management space or for Salesforce.com.CRM is up over 30% Y/Y. Revenue could grow by double digits in FY20. If the economy falters, the company's long-term growth prospects could dim. CRM remains a sell."

        It has promoted itself as the emblematic tech growth stock promising to smash $16 billion of annual revenue by next year.
        The number of deals generating more than $1 million was up 46% YOY in the third quarter.","It’s been a grueling winter for tech stocks and countless number of positive earnings reports have fallen on deaf ears.Will the bloodletting stop?Not if Salesforce (CRM) has something to say about it!And if you thought that tech’s secular tailwinds had vanished, this latest earnings report confirmed that software stocks are alive and are as potent as ever.That is why I have identified software stocks as the best tech play in the current late-stage economic cycle.At the Mad Hedge Lake Tahoe Conference, I clearly telegraphed that companies do not pour capital into CapEx for large and risky projects at this late stage, they search for the additional incremental dollar by arming their staff with optimal and efficient software programs to squeeze more juice out of the lemon.Salesforce is a great example of this.Moving forward, Salesforce is on the A-team of the software squad and ideally positioned to harpoon any whales that come near their boat.Companies are looking to double down on software initiatives at this point which is another reason why annual IT budgets have shot through the roof.I have met countless CEOs who guide thousands of staff throughout branches around the world and they told me that one of the big in-house additions has been integrating Salesforce as the main customer relationship management system deleting legacy systems of yore that have pooped out.The switch bears fruits immediately with operations supercharged like a 5-star high school football prospect on his first month of ‘roids.Simply put, everything just works a lot better with access to this software.What CEO wouldn’t want that?Even more salient is that Salesforce has promoted itself as the emblematic tech growth stock promising to smash $16 billion of annual revenue by next year.I love that Salesforce commits to ambitious sales targets and always delivers the goods.A talking head on a prominent financial TV show went on record saying that Apple is the key to the tech narrative perpetuating, I would completely disagree with this statement.Everyone and his mother have absorbed that Apple iPhones sales have plateaued, I am honestly sick of hearing the same story in the news over and over again.That is why Apple has been trying to morph into a software and service stock. They are doing a great job at it by the way.The real conclusive acid test to the tech story is these high growth software stocks because they should be the ones outperforming at this stage in the economic cycle.If companies tilted towards software like Salesforce, Twilio (TWLO), PayPal (PYPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Adobe (ADBE), just to name a few of the crown jewels of software stocks, start laying eggs, then I would admit the tech story is dead. But it’s not.Salesforce is poised to continue its ascent and that basically means quarterly sales growth in the mid-20s for the foreseeable future.There is an addressable market of $200 billion and the pipeline is rich as ever could be.Salesforce has really turned the corner with free cash flow and profitability. It was only a few years ago they were turning in heavy losses, but this new Salesforce will be even more profitable as the network effect makes the sum of the parts and each add-on cloud-based software tool even more valuable.Companies just love the breadth of functionality that Salesforce offers and their pension for product enhancement is really owed to CEO Marc Benioff who never shies away from calling his peers out and never cuts corners.In fact, Marc Benioff is one of the good guys in an increasingly rotting Silicon Valley, part of this has to do with him growing up as a local lad in Burlingame, just a stone throw from his newly built palatial Salesforce Tower gracing downtown San Francisco’s picturesque skyline.Benioff has more skin in the game as a local and publicly supported Proposition C, effectively a bill that would charge a homeless tax on big earning corporations in San Francisco.Benioff has also promised to fund any subsequent legal attack that attempts to unravel this homeless tax putting his money where his mouth is.Benioff noted that he has seen no softness in the macro spending environment.And even with all the crazy headlines spinning around in the media, there has been no material impact from any supposed peak or downshift in the business environment.Not only is Salesforce dredging up SME deals at a fast rate, they are also quickly targeting the big kahunas.The number of deals generating more than $1 million was up 46% YOY in the third quarter.The volume of $20 million-plus relationships is also growing significantly.In the past quarter, Salesforce renewed and expanded a 9-figure relationship with one of the largest banks in the world.Salesforce is able to upsell their cloud tools to customers and these firms eat up the Einstein built-in functionality that uses artificial intelligence to improve the existing software.North America comprised 71% of total revenue which is why this software company will reap the rewards for any extension of this economic cycle because they are largely domestic and best in show.Salesforce beat and raised its outlook calming the frayed nerves of investors looking to dump software stocks.Just look at the billings growth that was anticipated at 19%, Salesforce smashed it by 8% coming in at 27%.Not only are they scooping up new customers, but renewals have been just as robust.The truth is that Salesforce can’t roll out enough cloud-based software products to meet the insatiable demand.All of this backs up my thesis that software stocks will be the outsized winners of 2019.The FANGs are not dead, I rather hold an Amazon (AMZN) or Apple (AAPL) long-term if I had the choice.But at this stage, investors should be piling into all the crème de la crème software stocks.Avoid them at your peril."
4250654,101848,2019-03-23T09:46:34-04:00,"Salesforce.com continues to put up stellar growth numbers, underscoring investor demand for risk assets in the current market under the Fed's current patient monetary regime.Friday's market stumble on global economic weakness and an inverted yield curve at the 3-month and 10-year level clearly spooked investors but will likely be a temporary market aberration.CRM has a strong contractual structure that sports a 20% compounded annualized growth rate over the past five-year period that is more than likely to continue moving forward.Expect a 20% premium on Friday's close for the current year.","After putting up a solid 47% YTD market performance through the end of the 3rd quarter of 2018, Salesforce.com's (CRM) (red-green bars) upward trajectory was artificially cut short. By mid-November, CRM had given up 23 percentage points of gain on the year. Reversing course for the third time during the quarter, CRM piled on an additional 31 percentage points of gain to end an otherwise hardscrabble year just shy of $136/share, up just over 25% on the year. By contrast, the S&P 500 (black dotted line) was under 9% in its second down year since the Great Recession of 2007 (see Figure 1, below).CRM’s fortunes remained favorably tuned in the new year, posting almost 18% on the year through Friday’s market close, on the heels of the Fed’s embrace of monetary patience that so favorably colors the market’s perception of risk assets. The S&P 500 has posted almost an equally stellar start to the year, up almost 13% over the same period. The market stumbled badly Friday on fears of weakening global growth which saw German industrial output unexpectedly drop 0.8% MOM in January, sending German Bund yields back below zero. Here in the US, the yield on the 3-month Treasury note finished the day at 2.245% while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.441% in heavy trading, inverting the yield curve for the first time since September 2007. While the possibility of a US recession remains remote in the eyes of most, investors took note and were clearly spooked throughout the trading day. The 2-10 spread narrowed to 11 basis points. All that said, CRM remains poised to add another 20% to its current market share price, finishing the year at $195/share.Figure 1: Salesforce.com and the S&P 500CRM operates through four basic subscription revenue streams. Typically, these subscription services run for 12 to 36 months. Subscribing customers are under no obligation to renew after the end of the period, yet with revenue streams growing at an annualized rate of just under 20%, clients appear to be finding value with the service provided over the period. Subscription service integration appears to be growing at an even faster pace, hovering about 30% YOY, a good sign for forward growth. CRM expects about $16 billion in revenue this year and $26 billion to $28 billion by fiscal 2023.The company’s sales cloud platform allows subscribing clients to store sales data, monitor and generate leads, forecast business opportunities, as well as deliver quotes, contracts and invoices. Sales cloud has traditionally been the biggest revenue generating segment of the CRM platform at 33% through the fiscal year ending this past January. Over the past five-year period, sales cloud subscription contracts have grown at a compounded annualized rate of growth of just under 11%.At 29% of total revenues, the service cloud connects subscribing clients to sales agents in real time via myriad channels, including phone, video, email and messaging, web portals, social networks and online communities and proprietary mobile apps. Logistical links and inventory control and distribution control the flow of goods from sales units to end users. The segment’s five-year compounded annualized growth rates is just north of 22%The Salesforce platform comprises about 23% of total revenues and is also the fastest growing segment over the period at an annualized rate of just over 31%. The platform allows developers and corporate users to integrate and manage business specific apps that further enhance the customer’s proprietary cloud experience. In May 2018, CRM incorporated MuleSoft to the program mix, which allows subscribing clients to connect to any system, application or device either cloud- or land-based on the unified platform using existing networks rather than custom code. Of the $2.9 billion revenue stream of the Salesforce platform, MuleSoft contributed just about $360 million through FY2019.The marketing and commerce cloud platform is the second fastest annualized growing segment over the period at 30%, comprising just over 15% of total revenues. The marketing cloud optimizes the one-on-one marketing effort between client and customer across electronic media while retaining the ability to target specific clientele and sell across markets to generate desired scale and customer loyalty.Profit as a percent of total revenues came in at 74% through FY 2019 that just ended this past January. Total revenues have been growing at a compounded annualized rate of 19.70% over the five-year period. Profits have largely kept pace at 19.21% annualized growth rate for the period. The annualized cost of revenues for the period came in at just under 22%. Research and development spending remain steady at 20% of operation spending. Meanwhile, diluted EPS soared just short of 192% to $1.43/share as tax savings piled high on the company’s balance sheet thanks to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (2017).CRM continues to put up strong growth numbers over which quibbling remains very difficult. A 20% growth differential through the end of the year added to its current share price appears very realistic."
4225634,104608,2018-11-30T08:31:22-05:00,"Salesforce reported another very strong quarter, with revenues reaching a $13 billion run-rate growing at 26% y/y.The stock was down 25% from all-time highs as the market went through a correction phase, however, the stock is now down only ~10% from all-time highs after strong earnings.This could be one of the best tech long-term plays in the market with management confident in 20%+ revenue growth for many quarters to come.","Salesforce (CRM) reported another very strong quarter and pushed aside any investor doubts that the company could be as susceptible as other technology companies in the recent market weakness. CRM continues to push forward, full steam ahead, with their latest earnings report beating their previous guidance and consensus estimates, driven by 27% billings growth.Though CRM is still up nearly 35% YTD, they remain down ~10% from their recent highs. Over the long term, CRM is one of the clear leaders in the new hybrid cloud environment and a name that should be held onto for many years.CRM has rebounded from the recent lows, as they were once down ~25% from their all-time highs, following the broad market correction. This correction hit SaaS technology stocks especially hard, however, this past quarterly earnings reinforced CRM’s aggressive growth potential and erased any concerns about fundamental weakness. The recent correction appears to solely be market-related, as fundamentals remain as healthy as ever.Prior to the quarter ending, CRM acquired one of the leading back-end infrastructure software companies, MuleSoft (MULE), for a massive $6.5 billion, or ~16.5x forward revenue. Historically, CRM has focused on the front-end of applications, however, there continues to be a significant demand for back-end operations. The PaaS space continues to grow and develop as enterprise customers look to integrate front- and back-end applications together. This is a significant opportunity of growth that CRM is in a great position due to their acquisition of MuleSoft.Source: Company PresentationDuring Q3, revenues grew 26% y/y to $3.39 billion which was slightly ahead of consensus estimates for 25% y/y growth. Although growth decelerated ~100bps from 27% last quarter, this should be expected given CRM’s run-rate revenue of $13 billion. As CRM continues to expand and diversify their revenue, they should be able to maintain strong 20%+ revenue growth for the next several quarters.Source: Company PresentationSales Cloud continues to be the largest segment of revenue, representing nearly 33% of total revenue. However, this segment’s growth decelerated to 11% y/y compared to 13% y/y last quarter. However, the revenue upside to the quarter was largely driven by Salesforce Platform and Other, now representing nearly 25% of total revenue. This segment grew over 50% largely due to the MuleSoft acquisition.Source: Company PresentationOver the past few years, CRM has done a great job becoming more profitable. Investors have historically knocked down valuation a bit because of the lack of GAAP profitability from this name. However, this past quarter, operating margin slightly declined to 21.9% compared to 23.1% in the year ago period. Although it is difficult to place a dollar figure to this, a decent chunk of the lower margins was likely due to their annual Dreamforce conference.Despite this, net income grew a significant 54% y/y to $477 million. This represents a 15.1% margin, a ~270bps expansion from the 12.4% net margin CRM had in the year ago period. The significant net margin expansion led to EPS of $0.61 for the quarter, well ahead of consensus estimate of $0.50.Source: Company PresentationAfter another strong quarterly report and following CRM’s tradition, management raised guidance for Q4 and FY20.For Q4, management expects revenue to grow 25% to $3.551-3.561 billion. The 25% revenue growth is another ~100bps deceleration from Q3’s 26% growth. This should not be viewed as a negative for two main reasons. First, CRM is a $13+ billion run-rate revenue company and a mere 1% deceleration should be expected for a company growing mid-20s. And second, going off historical trends, CRM could beat their revenue guidance and end up growing closer to 26% in Q4.Management also put out their FY20 guidance targets, with revenues expecting to grow 20-21% to $15.9-16.0 billion, slightly ahead of consensus estimate of ~$15.8 billion. Management seemed very confident on the conference call about their long-term growth remaining at or above 20% for quite some time, something investors should not take lightly.After another beat and raise quarter and with management guiding to 20-21% revenue growth for FY20, investors should be very confident in the long-term trajectory of CRM. Despite coming off a 25% correction in the past few weeks, CRM has rallied back and is now only down ~10% from their all-time highs. I believe CRM is in an excellent position to continue on their growth trajectory and reach new all-time highs heading into 2019.The acquisition of MuleSoft also gives CRM additional room to run as they enter the front-end of applications. As the PaaS market inevitably continues on the high-growth path, CRM will begin to develop a strong foothold and grow their market share. Trading at just over 7x forward revenue, and closer to 5.5x FY20 revenue, this name is a solid SaaS tech name to hold onto for the long term.In my opinion, there are other growth SaaS names that may have a higher return potential in 2019, however, there are very few names (and even less in the tech sector) that provide the consistency and execution as CRM. Over the long term, CRM is an absolute winner that should be held onto.Risks to CRM include integration with MuleSoft not working out as planned. The $6.5 billion purchase was viewed as pretty high and if CRM is not able to successfully integrate the acquisition and realize the benefits, investors may begin to look elsewhere to deploy their capital. Also, if the market goes through another correction, much like the one we just went through the past few weeks, CRM is not immune to their valuation contracting."
4225246,103480,2018-11-28T19:10:03-05:00,"Salesforce shares rocketed nearly 10% after posting yet another beat-and-raise quarter.The strong quarterly results, as well as an upbeat Q4 outlook, will help Salesforce begin to reverse its losses from the October pullback.Revenues continued at a strong growth pace of 26% y/y, barely decelerating from last quarter.The company also substantially boosted its bottom line and margin profile.","Having tucked yet another beat-and-raise quarter under its belt, cloud pioneer Salesforce.com (CRM) has proven to investors yet again that it is truly one of the only stocks in the SaaS sector that is a comfortable long-term Hold. The company continued to outperform both its own internal targets as well as Wall Street expectations on the growth front, while making better-than-expected progress on its profitability.Unsurprisingly, shares of Salesforce rose nearly 10% in after-hours trading in response to the strong third-quarter release:CRM data by YChartsThe rebound is a welcome respite for Salesforce, whose stock at one point dipped 25% below all-time highs and officially entered ""correction"" territory, along with many other SaaS peers. This quarter's bullish results, however, provide a perfect rebound catalyst.With Salesforce, there are rarely any surprises: the company continues to excel on the growth front and rarely sees any execution issues. Even though the company's flagship Sales Cloud application has seen massive deceleration from previous years, Salesforce's emerging efforts in PaaS and other application categories have begun to carry the weight. The company has also made smart (albeit, overpriced) acquisitions in companies like Mulesoft (MULE), which instantly made Salesforce a serious contender in backend infrastructure software. Though Salesforce has been a front-end apps company for the majority of its lifetime, there is a substantial opportunity for it to grow in the PaaS space by owning the MuleSoft platform that many enterprise IT customers use to bind front-end applications together.The bottom line on Salesforce.com: this is a company to retain in your portfolio for the long term. It is already the largest pure-play SaaS company, and there are virtually no companies that can supplant its dominance in sales and marketing software.For Salesforce, a quarterly beat is almost invariably accompanied by a guidance raise. The company didn't break from tradition this quarter, releasing the following guidance outlook for both Q4 and next fiscal year (FY20):Figure 1. Salesforce guidance rangesSource: Salesforce earnings releaseNext quarter's expectation of 25% y/y growth barely decelerates from this quarter's 26% y/y growth - and given Salesforce's tendency to come in one or two points stronger than its guidance, it's more than likely that the company will actually hit 26% or 27% y/y growth in Q4.It's worth noting as well that the company's FY20 targets - the first time Salesforce is offering its view of next year's performance - came in well ahead of consensus expectations. Its targeted 20-21% y/y growth comes in a few points stronger than Wall Street's estimate of $15.83 billion, or +19% y/y. Salesforce's Marc Benioff has essentially committed to perpetual growth above 20% y/y, so it's likely that the company will maintain a healthy buffer on top of this growth rate and actually achieve mid-20s growth.Here's a glance at its results in the third quarter:Figure 2. Salesforce 3Q19 resultsSource: Salesforce earnings releaseRevenues grew 26% y/y to $3.39 billion, outdoing Wall Street's expectations of $3.37 billion (+25% y/y). Note that Salesforce had grown at 27% y/y last quarter, so growth only came in one point weaker this quarter. For a company of its scale (now at a ~$13 billion annual run rate), its resistance to a typical deceleration pattern has been truly impressive.Salesforce's ability to maintain top-notch growth continues to rest on its diversification into new software categories, which I've repeatedly touted as the key component of its bullish thesis. Here's a look at the product trends below:Figure 3. Salesforce revenue by cloudSource: Salesforce earnings releaseSales Cloud growth meaningfully cranked down to 11% y/y, down two points from 13% y/y in Q2. Thankfully, however, the Salesforce Platform (aka, its PaaS products) ballooned 51% y/y including Mulesoft, providing the bulk of the company's revenue growth in both percentage and dollar terms in Q3.Salesforce made noticeable headway on the profit front as well - which has always been the biggest drag on its perception. Because the company incurs a hefty amount of stock-based comp, its cash margins are best gauged using its pro forma income statement:Figure 4. Salesforce pro forma income statementSource: Salesforce earnings releaseOperating margins fell slightly to 21.9%, versus 23.1% in the year-ago quarter, due largely to a more expensive Dreamforce conference. In spite of this, pro forma net income grew 54% y/y to $477 million, representing a net margin of 15.1%, 270bps better than 12.4% in the year-ago quarter.It's worth noting as well that Salesforce's pro forma EPS of $0.61 smashed Wall Street consensus of $0.50 with 22% upside.For Salesforce, a beat-and-raise quarter is nothing new. It has been following a modus operandi of ""underpromise, overdeliver"" for years. The vast majority of investors are still expecting the company to continue beating results next year - so what could possibly send shares down in FY20?As we saw in October, Salesforce really loses steam only when the broader market tumbles. When investors turn cautious on valuations, it is one of the first stocks to fall. The biggest risk to Salesforce in FY20 is a widespread portfolio rotation into value names. Investors have long bemoaned the company's lack of GAAP profitability, and while this objection can be easy countered when growth stocks are in vogue, it makes Salesforce susceptible when investors shift their preference to dividends and cash flow.Thankfully, the company's current valuation at ~7x forward revenues isn't too demanding, thanks to the October pullback. In addition, while GAAP profits are elusive, Salesforce still has its FCF growth to lean on. Year-to-date, it has grown free cash flows at a robust 27% y/y pace (in line with revenue growth), a while achieving a respectable 17% FCF margin.The other main risk to Salesforce is its rather freewheeling M&A policy. Though the company remains a strong FCF generator, it has constantly spent more on acquisitions than its operations have brought in. It spent $6.5 billion on MuleSoft alone, and even a Salesforce bull like myself found it difficult to justify the purchase price at a ~16x forward revenue multiple.As a result of its acquisition spree, Salesforce's net debt position has widened to -$226 million as of the end of Q3, versus a net cash position of $2.80 billion at the beginning of FY19. The company's rather rapid leveraging may make investors nervous in a time of rising interest rates.All this being said, however, it's difficult deny that Salesforce's unstoppable growth pace continues to eclipse virtually all other considerations. The fact that it has continued to defy top line expectations every quarter (even if some of the growth is acquisition-assisted) provides enough fuel for the stock to rally in 2019.Stay long on this name - barring a major market meltdown, Salesforce is primed to continue delivering outsized returns."
4225145,92586,2018-11-28T13:49:15-05:00,"Salesforce.com's fiscal 3Q19 was yet another in a series of market-beating quarters that suggests the growth story is far from over.Acquisitions helped to drive a robust 20%-plus increase in sales, but I continue to pay attention to opex that jumped quite a bit this quarter.I remain a CRM bull at current levels.","Salesforce.com (CRM) is flying high once again.The stock was up as much as 9% in Tuesday's after-hours trading (but gave up as much as half the gains during the Wednesday session on cautious Street reports), as fiscal 3Q19 looked as good as the cloud company's quarters have been lately. For as long as I can trace (i.e. since at least early 2014), salesforce.com has not disappointed analysts on revenues or earnings expectations. Credit: ZDNetWhen it comes to the growth story that is salesforce.com, revenues take center stage. In this regard, the company delivered a YOY increase of 26% that fell only 70 bps below last quarter's growth rate - which in turn had been the highest achieved by the company since the April 2016 quarter. All service segments experienced double-digit growth but, as should be expected, sales cloud (nearly one third of total company sales) saw its rate of increase diminish to 11% vs. 13% last quarter as it continues to gain scale and expand its market leadership. I estimate that salesforce.com controls more than 40% of the sales cloud market.Offsetting the loss of growth momentum in the more mature service offerings, MuleSoft (the application network company acquired in May) contributed with what I estimate to be about one-fifth of the total company's top-line growth - primarily in the form of platform sales that grew 51% YOY. In my view, bolt-on acquisitions for a price tag of less than $1 billion (e.g. Datorama and Rebel in 2018) will play a crucial role in keeping Salesforce.com's revenue growth in high-teen territory for the next couple of years, until the San Francisco-based company reaches and likely surpasses its fiscal 2022 revenue goal of $22 billion at the mid-point of the guidance range.See key revenue metric charts below.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsMoving down the P&L, gross margin expanded yet again (this time by 59 bps vs. last quarter's more modest 11 bps) as gains of scale overcome growth in subscription and support costs. A bit less encouraging was a YOY increase of 140 bps in opex as a percentage of revenues, which can probably be attributed to MuleSoft integration efforts. Since growth-related topics tend to dominate the conversations, cost diligence often takes a back seat - but I will continue to monitor the trends to ensure my GAAP op margin target of up to 15% (vs. only 3% this quarter) can be reached by fiscal 2022.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsSalesforce.com has delivered another impressive quarter, sending signals to the investment community that the growth story is far from over. Better yet, the company has raised its current year EPS forecast to $2.60 vs. $2.51 last quarter (roughly the size of the fiscal 3Q19 earnings beat) and initiated fiscal 2020 revenue outlook a solid $200 million ahead of consensus - in my opinion, one of the most relevant drivers of today's bullishness.The stock has caught a break as a result, after having lost 20% in market value since the start of the third calendar quarter. In hindsight, I believe CRM at $128/share would have been a great entry point into this seemingly expensive stock that, I believe, will reach new heights over the next 24 months as fiscal 2022 goals become more likely of being achieved.Multiples of 50x on P/E and 1.8x on PEG may scare the more value-oriented investor (see graph above). However, valuation metrics should reset to more reasonable levels over time, as Salesforce.com continues to grow the top and bottom lines at a healthy clip. In addition, and more importantly, I continue to be a great fan of Salesforce.com's pure-SaaS model that should (1) make revenues not only grow, but ""stick,"" and (2) help push margins up without many ups and downs as the company continues to expand."

Recent share price weakness is deemed to be in line with the tech-sector correction. Courtesy of MetaStock XenithSalesforce began 2018 above a “golden cross” that formed back on March 6, 2017 when the stock closed at $82.50. A “golden cross” occurs when the 50-day simple moving average rises above the 200-day simple moving average and indicates that higher prices lie ahead. This tracked the stock to its all-time intraday high of $161.19 set on Oct. 1.The stock began the second half of 2018 well above its semiannual value level of $123.44 which is the middle of five horizontal lines.

4224521,31441,2018-11-26T12:40:02-05:00,"CRM reports quarterly earnings Tuesday.CRM's growth has been spectacular, but expected future revenue or billings could disappoint the market.Sell CRM into earnings.","Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. Source: FortuneSalesforce (CRM) reports quarterly earnings Tuesday. Analysts expect revenue of $3.37 billion and EPS of $0.5. The revenue estimate implies 3% growth sequentially. Investors should focus on the following key items.Saleforce delivers enterprise software through the cloud that focuses on customer relationship management (""CRM""). Salesforce allows its clients to interact with their own customers via mobile devices, through the cloud, Internet of Things (""IoT""), etc. It derives revenue from subscription fees from customers accessing its enterprise cloud computing services and from professional and training services.The lion's share of its revenue is derived from subscription services. Therefore, its unearned revenue and/or backlog is a key metric to determining what future revenue will look like. Unearned revenue is similar to deferred revenue under the company's previous accounting guidance, except for the removal of the limitation on contingent revenue. The unearned revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year subscription agreements. Unearned revenue consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services and recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Salesforce invoices customers in annual installments.At the beginning of the quarter-ended April 30, 2018, unearned revenue was nearly $7.0 billion. It was $5.9 billion at the end of the quarter-ended July 31, 2018 - a decline of over 25%. The (1) revenue recognized at a point in time and (2) revenue recognized over time for the quarter ended July 31st totaled $3.3 billion, and matched the total revenue recognized during the July quarter.Said another way, if billings for the upcoming quarter do not exceed revenue recognized during the quarter, then the unearned revenue will likely continue to fall. For now, over 100% of expected revenue is included in unearned revenue. Sentiment could change for CRM if the unearned revenue balance ever fell shy of the future quarter's expected revenue. Having revenue already in the backlog is a nice problem to have for now.Salesforce has reported explosive sales growth, partly through acquisitions and via organic sales. Total sales for the most-recent quarter were $3.3 billion, up 9% Q/Q and 27% Y/Y. The company acquired MuleSoft, a provider of platforms to build application networks, in March of this year. Management intimated MuleSoft added about $100 million of revenue during the most-recent quarter. Sans MuleSoft, revenue would have been up about 6% Q/Q.Gross margin was 74.1%, up slightly from the 74.5% reported for the April 2018 quarter. Operating income margin was 3.5% versus 6.4% for the April 2018 quarter due to lower gross margin and higher marketing costs. As Salesforce added scale, I would have anticipated higher margins. Maybe the integration of MuleSoft took a toll. However, if margins continue to fall, investors could question the competitive landscape or Salesforce's ability to maintain pricing power.Salesforce has dominated the CRM space within the cloud, and its top line growth as been phenomenal. This quarter future growth expectations could be tested depending on its outlook for billings. Billings were $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion in the previous two quarters. For the quarter-ended January 31, 2018, its deferred revenue was $7.1 billion, up about $2.7 billion versus the quarter-ended October 31, 2017. The $2.7 billion change could be a proxy for billings during that quarter, which I considered robust.If management's outlook for billings in the quarter-ended January 2019 does not match or exceed the $2.7 billion figure from the January 2018 quarter, then investors could question Salesforce's future growth prospects. This could be an interesting quarter given the economic outlook for the U.S. economy. This could also be a quarter that determines whether Salesforce has reached a high water mark on future client billings.CRM is up 14% Y/Y, expected growth in revenue or billings could disappoint the market. Sell CRM into earnings."
4211193,102196,2018-10-11T16:22:05-04:00,"Salesforce is significantly overvalued as compared to its peers, such as Oracle, SAP and Microsoft with EV/EBITDA at over 100x.Revenue growth rates are too low to justify such an extremely high valuation multiple, keeping in mind that EBITDA margin stagnates at 8-9% in the last 3 years.It is still not clear, how CRM will be able to compete with new smaller startup companies, which are more innovative in their field.Moreover, CRM's growth rates are significantly limited by the market growth as it is already a strong leader in the CRM market, but the market does not grow that rapidly.","Salesforce's (CRM) recent decline in share price warrants for additional analysis of the company to determine whether this decline calls for buying the stock. In this article I argue that even at this share price, the stock is too overvalued and brings no significant competitive advantage and return in the long run.Fig. 1 - CRM share price dynamicsSource: CapitalIQCRM generates revenues from two sources: ""(1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing enterprise cloud computing services and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue."" Subscription revenues accounted for more than 90% of total revenues in fiscal 2018. Therefore, one of the main operating metrics to judge whether the company will continue generating growth is its customer base and churn rates.Unfortunately, CRM does not report its churn rates, which is worrying, because investors should have this knowledge as it is incremental in determining the company's operation performance. What CRM reports is net additions in terms of customers - 17% growth in 2019 as compared to 2018 in small clients with reported 40% and 67% in clients with annual revenue of $10m+ and $20m+, respectively. In fairness, it doesn't say much, as these figures don't match with average revenue growth, which is 20-25%. That means average contribution of one client is declining and that is an extremely bad sign.Fig. 2 - CRM customer base forecastSource: CRM's investor day presentationWe also have to consider the fact that CRM is quite an active acquirer - at least more than 23 acquisitions in the last 5 years. That is a lot. When you consider slow growth rates you've got to wonder: What would happen with revenue growth without these deals? The most obvious answer is that it would be even lower, and that should frighten CRM's shareholders. Because if you can sustain these growth rates only by keeping capital expenditures at a high level, these rates will be quite hard to sustain.Fig. 3 - CRM's revenue and EBITDA dynamicsSource: CapitalIQBut why does EBITDA margin not increase? Gross profit declined in 2017 by 200 basis points and stayed at this level in 2018. Actually, what helps CRM to decrease its expenses is pushing down SG&A, but that is not a good sign in terms of business model feasibility - if you can't increase margins by anything apart from SG&A, then your business might not be that good. One more topic in question is CRM's ability to decrease marketing expenses as % of sales. In 2018, this figure equaled 46% as compared to 47% a year before - only a slight change of 1%.Another point to consider here is that the CRM market growth rates are approximately 13-15% per year as per CRM's presentation. Keeping in mind that CRM is the market leader in practically all of these segments, its revenue growth is limited by the market growth (as they can not take 100% of the market and the market share growth is quite limited as well) - I'm speaking of the long-term forecasts, of course. That means, there is a strong limit in terms of the company's revenue growth we should consider while evaluating this investment case.Fig. 4 - CRM market segment growth ratesSource: CRM's investor day presentationFig. 5 - Competitors' trading multiples (as of 10/10/18)Source: CapitalIQBased on the range of multiples for CRM's competitors, I arrive at a target price of $55.8, which is more than 2.5x times lower than the current market share price. Of course, it doesn't mean that I believe the stock price can get down to this level in the nearest future, but it can give a hint of how much this company is overvalued at the moment.To summarize, for now CRM is overvalued due to extremely high multiples relative to competitors and due to active M&A activity, which is the crucial factor of sales growth rates, which are not that high as is.I recommend to wait until there are more signs CRM's business model is feasible and allows the company growing faster and without significant CAPEX for M&A. As for now, my recommendation is to sell the stock."
4209368,69905,2018-10-02T10:51:17-04:00,Salesforce's top-line revenue growth rate will start to contract after FY 2019.I examine Salesforce's use of cash in acquisitions and strategic investments.Salesforce's shares are very much overvalued.,"Salesforce (CRM) is a stock which is very much in investor favor with the investor community at present. Moreover, while Salesforce has been overvalued for some time, I argue that the newest investor presentation from a few days ago shows that Salesforce's growth rate will start to contract after FY 2019, contrary to what investors might be expecting, given that Salesforce had raised its FY 2019 guidance revenue by $50 million to $13.125 to $13.175 billion.Salesforce's share price continues to climb without stopping for breath. If, in my in my humble opinion, it was overvalued before its Q2 2018 results, then now, it is still overvalued.Salesforce shareholders are being allured by two key factors. Firstly, by Salesforce's consistently growing top line. Secondly, by a steady increase in its share price - offering shareholders a false sense of security.We shall discuss its top-line growth momentarily. However, for now, I wish to put a spotlight, on a less discussed, but nevertheless weighty consideration.Source: author's calculations, SEC filings - figures are rounded up and where appropriate netted.As the table above shows, Salesforce has numerous cash outgoings which take place each year, but investors are not putting much if any, weight on this. Just to emphasize, there is nothing wrong with making strategic investments and numerous acquisitions. Having said that, the problem of growing inorganically through M&A is that shareholders are reliant on management's prudence and business savviness to be able to spot and acquire undervalued businesses in a fully valued business environment.I have already touched on this in my previous article on Salesforce. To appreciate what investors are buying when they purchase Salesforces at $120 billion market cap or $160 per share, we should weigh up its FY 2019 GAAP EPS at the midpoint of $0.98. This leaves Salesforces shares trading at an exorbitant multiple of more than 160 times its earnings. Here, readers should pause to consider whether there is a real opportunity to profit at these levels? In fact, upon further consideration, readers should reflect whether Salesforces is growing anywhere near fast enough to support this level of punchy valuation?Source: author's calculations, morningstar.com, press release - revenue growthThus far, Salesforce had been growing at a remarkably consistent and rapid pace. However, according to its latest investor presentation from a few days' ago, Salesforce highlights that it expects its growth from FY 2019 through to FY 2022 to slow down to 20% (page 5). Consequently, all of a sudden investors paying up more than 160 times earnings, with the expectation that Salesforces would at a minimum continue to grow its top line with a CAGR of approximately 26%, but now, shareholders will have to contend with Salesforce's next leg of its growth expanding at a slower pace.In order to clarify my viewpoint, I wish to highlight for readers that I truly believe that Salesforce is accomplishing a tremendous feat in consistently growing their top line. This speaks highly of this management team. However, Salesforce's employees are getting handsomely rewarded too. For instance, for FY 2019, company employees are getting stock-based compensation of $1.3 billion (FY 2019 guidance: $1.65 per share*776 million shares), up from roughly the $1 billion in compensation in FY 2017.Thus, while management touts its non-GAAP EPS number at a midpoint $2.51 for FY 2019, investors should only put any weight on this number if they seriously believe that this employee compensation is truly non-recurring - which it obviously it is not.In fact, out of all the add-backs which management uses to get Salesforce's GAAP EPS to its non-GAAP EPS, stock-based compensation is the most meaningful add-back, by far.Next, in FY 2018, company employees put down $650 million to exercise their options. This figure is a substantial figure - you will hopefully agree? How did that cash get used by Salesforce? To pay down its revolver ($200 million) and payments on its convertible ($123 million). In other words, while the share price is going up, Salesforce is all too happy to vest its options, which is providing Salesforce with a source of liquidity to pay back up its debt obligations, but in the event that there was to be a bump in the road and the share price stagnates or even falls, then management might not be so quick to exercise its options, leaving Salesforce struggling to find cash to pay back some of its debt.Source: author's calculations, morningstar.comThe above table is somewhat falsely alluring, as it gives the appearance that Salesforce is not as expensive as it truly is. On the face of it, it shows that Salesforce is overvalued with a current P/Cash Flow (from operations; GAAP) of 38.8X relative to its own 5-year average of 30.1X, as well as overpriced when compared with its peer group with a median P/Cash Flow of 28.1X. However, this type of analysis does not put enough consideration on the fact that Salesforce is a recurring acquirer which needs to use substantial amounts of capital to support its top line growth rate.In the article, we have discussed the fact that according to Salesforce's newest presentation its top-line growth rate is going to start to contract after FY 2019. We have also scrutinized the fact that Salesforce uses substantial amounts of capital for acquisitions to support its top line growth rate. Finally, I have questioned whether investors might be overpaying right now to participate in Salesforce's contracting growth rate.Author's note: The only favor I ask is that you click the ""Follow"" button so I can grow my Seeking Alpha friendships and our Deep Value network.Disclaimer: Please do your own due diligence to reach your own conclusions."

        With Salesforce having the best rated CRM, Salesforce has a lot of potential.
        Salesforce has continued to grow its company rather than focus on short term profits.","Salesforce (CRM) is a growing company disrupting the whole CRM industry. What started with CD’s has rotated into a subscription based product. Salesforce leads the CRM industry as it has ~20% market share. With the value of CRM market set to hit $123 billion by 2021, Salesforce has a set plan and distinct goals to continue growth. These goals and ways to get there have led Salesforce to be the fastest growing company in its market competition. As stated from Marc Benioff, CEO and chairman, ""Just as we'll be the fastest enterprise software company to reach $13 billion, we're well on our way to surpassing the $20 billion revenue goal faster than any other enterprise software company in history."" Salesforce has continued to prove in every single quarter report how big their growth really is. In every quarter, they have grown by close to 25% year over year. With CRM being the fastest growing market, Salesforce is set to run with it. to With continuous growth and high market share, Salesforce has earned a spot in my portfolio and should earn a spot in yours as well.With big market share, Salesforce revenue was able to grow 27% to $3.3 billion year over year in Q2. With this, Salesforce is well on its way to becoming the fastest enterprise software company to reach $20 billion in revenue. Not only did this market share help get one step closer to their target revenue, this helped create a 19% increase in operating cash flow and a 25% jump in free cash flow, to $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. As customer relations are becoming more and more vital for companies to succeed, Salesforce is not only proving to capitalize on this, they are proving to excel on this. Image Source: Q2 earningsWith Salesforce being voted the best CRM product for 5 straight years, the company now expects revenue to rise as much as 25% to $13.175 billion in fiscal 2019. Guidance in Q2 was very good as it said Q3 will grow 25% year over year giving investors hope and knowledge that the company is growing rapidly. With such an increase in revenue, many would expect the same to be the case for profit. Although the company does see profit, it is very minimal compared to the revenue. Just like many other growth stocks, many see this a concern yet we see it very differently. Just like Square(SQ), the company has chosen to take a route of growth and a focus on the future rather than short term profit. With this being the case, Salesforce’s future looks very bright. Although the price is quite high, 148.92 as of the time writing this article, and the forward FY PE is ~55X, this valuation takes into account the bright future of the company.Even though this has a PE that high and just started hitting profit in 2017, the company has a fortified moat, its user friendly software, and a long product line to help show its future. Although many believe the valuation of all growth stocks has flown past reasonable prices, the general market is taking into account the companies future and likelihood of growth continuation. With Salesforce, this is no different.A main reason for Salesforce's growth would be because of their increasing product platform. Although Salesforce's ""main"" product would be their CRM, they also have products ranging from sales to platform. With a growing need of customer relations, Salesforce is making products for each end. Image Source: ForbesThis chart depicts why Salesforce has continued growth through every quarter. With an increased total available market(NYSE:TAM), Salesforce has been able to foresee the market growth and capitalize by making products in various areas. Overall, Salesforce has been able to grow for the sole reason that they have diversified their product. As of Benioff’s word, the CRM market will be worth $123 billion by 2025 and is one of the fastest growing markets. To add to this, Salesforce has proven to be the best CRM product for five straight years. Not only is it number one overall, Salesforce is number one in sales and services for CRM. Salesforce has made it a point to not only focus on CRM but to venture into other areas aswell. One area they have grown has been their commerce cloud which has grown a lot in the passed year. The mobile orders have grown 40% year over year. Commerce cloud has been able to lead growth as it helps companies connect to more users with more insight on what their users like. With an increase in orders and commerce cloud use, revenue has grown a lot. In the graph shows commerce cloud revenue growth year over year for various countries.Image source: commerce cloudTo continue a focus on growth, Salesforce acquired Mulesoft for $6.5 billion. Although this is a hefty price, Benioff had his vision clear as to the integration. In Salesforce’s 19 year life, it has focussed on growth and market share over profits. With the acquisition of Mulesoft, this allows the company to improve, grow and continue its strategy. Although the world is moving towards cloud based CRM, there is still a lot of on premise applications and Salesforce needs to be able to connect the two or they are put into a huge disadvantage. While this is the case, Salesforce’s goal is to grow their SaaS system, which Mulesoft will also help. With the acquisition of Mulesoft, Salesforce takes a step into growing their SaaS even more by adding highly strategic platform capabilities. Image source: mobile CRMTo help grow its market share, Salesforce has used mobile CRM to boost revenue and user base. As seen in the chart above, mobile CRM has proven to be very effective for companies to reach their sales quota. This, of course, is the main objective of all businesses and mobile CRM has proved to help. In addition to having a great product to endorse, Salesforce is in the fastest growing enterprise-software category helping them grow by more and more every single quarter. With this, Gartner predicts that by 2021 the CRM market will be the single largest revenue off of spending in enterprise software.Salesforce controls the largest section of the CRM market, controlling around 20%. Owning that size of any market is tough to do especially with lots of competition, so how does Salesforce manage to maintain the highest stake in the market? A key element of all CRM companies is weather or not they take a proprietary, or open source approach to their software. To be a proprietary CRM company, a company must be the sole contributors towards the software development without any outside control over the software leaving it completely uncustomizable. The benefit to this system however is that if there is a fault in the software, someone, or a group of people, can be held accountable for this fault. This is not the case in an open source CRM software. This relies on the community and is highly customizable. It is not owned by a company and thousands of people can end up developing this software leading to potentially more innovation. However if something goes wrong, no one can be held accountable and the company using the software is left stranded. Salesforce takes both approaches. This leads them to a level of extreme customization that no other company offers, according to idealistconsulting.com who have worked with Salesforce for ten years. Companies can choose which aspects of each side they prefer and implement those to create their personalized CRM service. Salesforce also allows customers to change their customizations whenever they would like allowing it to be able to grow and change with their business. This difference isn’t something that many investors are aware of, but many companies are. This an important factor to the company’s success, potentially one of the biggest factors, and something that many businesses find attractive causing them to choose Salesforce over a different CRM company. Salesforce’s unique CRM is the reason for their growth and promising future. Overall, with a market that just continues to grow, an prediction to be the largest market in the software-enterprise field by 2021, the CRM market is going to be huge and Salesforce will follow it.With all growth stocks, comes risk. For Salesforce, that risk is its value. Even though the future is very bright for Salesforce, the company is overvalued, period. With a forward PE of 54.52X, the company is simply overvalued for its profit as of right now. As of right now, the general market is weighing in a majority of the good things and not much of the bad. Even though this comes across as a huge problem, its not. As of right now, we think it has the valuation of 2-4 more good quarters. That being said, the price is ahead of its time by about a year. Although this may be a bad sign for potential investors, its much smaller than it is. With Salesforce killing it, those 2-4 good quarters are very likely. Once those come, Salesforce should fit right in its valuation. We don't believe that this is a compelling enough reason to sell but, this may be a big enough reason for the price to drop to the low 140's. All in all, Salesforce has proven through its growth and market dominance that it is on its way to reach its goals and will be the quickest company in its department to do so. Although there are risks regarding Salesforce, and all growth stocks for that matter, the future is bright for Salesforce. With a CRM product better than all competitors in a growing market, Salesforce has found themselves in a perfect position for a company to be in. In a world where customer service means everything, businesses need to have the best product for them. To conclude, with Salesforce, the reward simply outweighs the risk and is certainly worth a buy in a mid-long term growth portfolio."
4203901,69905,2018-09-04T12:26:40-04:00,"Salesforce is an overvalued stock.Too many hidden costs hide its real economic value.Within its hotly craved sector, Salesforces offers investors a poor risk-reward return, particularly compared with its peers.","Salesforce (CRM), is one of the hottest stocks in town. It released its Q2 2019 results last week and the Street largely under-reacted, even though Salesforce beat analysts' estimates. I am beginning to wonder whether investors are possibly becoming conscientious of Salesforce's ever-increasing hidden costs? Salesforce remains substantially overvalued and is best avoided. Salesforce's Q2 2019 results were more of the same. Salesforce delivered strong top-line growth of 27% (constant currency) to $3.3 billion - which is remarkable. Salesforce's top line continues to prove that size is not the enemy of performance.On the other hand, once we step down a couple of lines on its income statement, the real cost of Salesforce's top line growth becomes apparent in its stock-based compensation. Of the $458 million generated in cash flows from operations, no less than 76.6%, or $351 million is in the form of non-cash compensation expense. To put this figure in context, while its top line delivered 27.3% YoY growth, management pocketed a 37.1% increase compared with the same period a year ago. Having said that, it was not all bad. This quarter co-CEO Block stated confidently on the call that he detects enterprises' continual demand for a digital transformation. Furthermore, Block highlighted to investors how Salesforce is steadily outpacing its competitors and that Salesforce it continues to take all-important market share. Furthermore, shareholders were no doubt pleased to hear management's comments that MuleSoft performance was strong in the quarter, contributing $122 million (3.7% of total revenue). Although I do question whether Salesforce might have slightly overpaid for Mulesoft, by putting down $6.5 billion.CFO Hawkins highlighted on the call that Salesforce's free cash flow was up 42% to $288 million. But surely payments for capital lease obligations should be factored in also? Certain large cloud operators such as Amazon (AMZN) are very open to the fact that free cash flow should include lease repayments as it is an ongoing cost of doing business. If Salesforce were to apply a similarly transparent account of its free cash flow, we would see Salesforce's free cash flow dwindle down to $199 million in Q2 2019. Additionally, we should at least pause and consider whether Salesforce's consistent and recurring purchases of strategic investments, which approximate roughly 30% of capex, should also be accounted for? If we were to answer in the affirmative, then Salesforce's free cash flow would actually have been $264 million in the quarter. Nevertheless, all factors considered, Salesforces is growing at a fast clip. But is growing fast enough to support it trading at approximately 90X adjusted free cash flow? Personally, I struggle to agree.Source: author's calculations, morningstar.comIn the above table, I highlighted how the overall sector is very much in favor with the investment community, with each one of the companies trading at extended multiples, both on their P/Sales ratios and P/Cash Flow ratios. Relative to Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce appears to be trading at a significant discount. However, this could not be further from the truth, because as I have discussed in this article already, Adobe is quite conservative with its stock-based compensation, and its cash flows are nicely representative of its real economic value (Buffett's owners' earnings). Whereas Salesforce's cash flows are skewed by its notoriously excessive non-cash stock-based management compensation. In other words, this is the equivalent of a business highlighting its strong revenue and pretending that management works for free; which I should highlight Salesforce's management certainly does not work for free. In fact, it has guided that fiscal 2019 should have roughly $1.3 billion in stock-based compensation, a jump of 28% compared with last year.Salesforce's shares have smoothly trended upwards in the past two years. This gives the illusion that investing in Salesforce is safe. I argue this is not the case; that Salesforce is indeed materially overvalued and that there are much safer investments elsewhere in the market. Attempting to figure out Salesforce's intrinsic value is a challenging affair, one that we thankfully do not need to attempt with any sort of precision.

4203812,102764,2018-09-04T03:15:19-04:00,"Salesforce stock is on fire, gaining nearly 60% in the past year on the back of vigorous revenue growth.However, past performance does not guarantee future returns, and valuation levels can get extended when a stock rises steeply.In this context, investors have reasons to wonder if the stock still offers attractive potential going forward or if the best is already in the past for Salesforce stock.Statistical research has proven that quantitative factors such as financial quality, valuation, momentum and relative strength are powerful return drivers for stocks.Based on these indicators, Salesforce stock is well-positioned for attractive performance going forward.","Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has gained nearly 60% in the past year alone, and its performance is even more impressive on a longer time frame. Over the past decade, investors in Salesforce have gained a stratospheric 1,010%, versus a far more modest cumulative gain of 127% for the S&P 500 index in the same period.CRM data by YChartsWith the stock delivering such massive returns and trading near historical highs, investors may understandably feel reluctant to buy Salesforce stock at current prices. From a contrarian perspective, the time to pull the trigger is when the stock is substantially down and trading near its lows of the year, not when it is reaching record high price levels.On the other hand, past price performance and valuation can be remarkably different things, and only because a stock has risen steeply, that does not mean it’s necessarily overvalued. Importantly, valuation needs to be interpreted in its due context. Companies with superior growth obviously deserve an above-average valuation, and Salesforce is an exceptional growth stock.There is no infallible formula to pick winning stocks, but statistical data shows that quantitative indicators such as financial quality, valuation, momentum and relative strength tend to generate above-average returns for investors in the long term. Let's take a look at Salesforce from a quantitative perspective in order to find out what the numbers are saying about the stock and its potential returns going forward.Salesforce is a market leader in software-as-a-service. The company offers a deep ecosystem of services across different verticals that are critically important to customers. Brand recognition, the ubiquity of products and access to data provide solid sources of competitive strength for the business.Salesforce competes against strong players such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), but it has outperformed the competition and consolidated its leadership position in the industry over the past several years.Source: SalesforceThe enterprise software industry is going through a major shift over the past several years, since many corporations of all sizes are moving toward the cloud and subscription-based services for all kinds of applications.Salesforce is a major driving force behind this trend and also one of the main beneficiaries from it. Back in 2009, the company was making $1.08 billion in revenue, and Wall Street analysts are currently expecting Salesforce to make $13.17 billion in sales in the current fiscal year.CRM Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsFinancial performance for the most recent quarter confirms that the business keeps firing on all cylinders as of the period ended July 2018. Revenue for the quarter rose 27% year over year, and revenue under contract grew 36% to $21 billion. In a sign of confidence, Salesforce also raised its guidance for the full year.Importantly, Salesforce is benefiting from vigorous growth across its different business segments, and this is a major positive when it comes to evaluating the company and its ability to sustain performance over the years ahead.Source: SalesforceProfitability is somewhat of a mixed picture, though. The company is aggressively investing for growth, and stock-based compensation is taking a considerable toll on GAAP profit margins. On the other hand, non-GAAP margins are much more attractive, and profit margins are moving in the right direction.Source: SalesforceMoving forward, Salesforce has a lot of room for growth in the years ahead. Management estimates that the total addressable market opportunity for the company is currently worth $72 billion, and the size of such market opportunity is expected to increase to over $120 billion by 2021.The company is focusing on artificial intelligence as a key growth engine with its Einstein Artificial Intelligence service. According to a report from IDC, artificial intelligence technologies associated with CRM activities will generate $1.1 trillion in global business revenue from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2021, and Salesforce is building a wide portfolio of AI solutions in multiple services and applications.Source: SalesforceThe table below shows key valuation ratios and financial statistics for Salesforce versus other industry players such as Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP), Adobe (ADBE), Intuit (INTU), Workday (WDAY), Red Hat (RHT), Splunk (SPLK), ANSYS, Inc. (ANSS) and Shopify (SHOP).Data in the table includes forward P/E, price-to-sales, price-to-operating cash flow and expected earnings per share growth in the coming five years. Salesforce is expected to remain a growth leader in the sector over the years ahead, and valuation is not too excessive if the company delivers in accordance with expectations.The market is expecting vigorous growth for Salesforce. From current price levels, the stock is clearly vulnerable to the downside if financial performance disappoints. However, it's important to note Salesforce stock does not look overpriced when considering industry valuation standards and the company's growth potential in the long term.Stock prices don't just reflect current fundamentals, but expectations about those fundamentals can be even more important. When a company is delivering better-than-expected earnings and expectations about future earnings are increasing, this generally means that the stock price is increasing too.Salesforce has delivered earnings numbers considerably above expectations in the past four quarters in a row. The chart below shows the expected earnings number, the actual reported number and the difference between the two, both in absolute terms and in percentages.Wall Street analysts have substantially increased their earnings expectations for Salesforce in the current fiscal year and next fiscal year over time. Like it usually happens, rising earnings expectations are a powerful upside fuel for the stock price.CRM data by YChartsMoney has an opportunity cost. When you buy a stock with mediocre returns, that capital is not available for investing in companies with superior potential. Besides, winners tend to keep on winning in the stock market, so you want to invest in stocks that are not only doing well but also doing better than other alternatives.Salesforce stock has substantially outperformed both the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK) over the past year. In comparison to both the broad market in general and the sector in particular, Salesforce is displaying impressive relative strength.CRM data by YChartsThe PowerFactors system is a quantitative investing system available to members in my research service, ""The Data Driven Investor."" This system basically ranks companies in a particular universe according to the factors analyzed in this article for Salesforce: financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum and relative strength.The system has produced solid performance over the long term. The chart below shows the annualized returns for companies in different PowerFactors ranking buckets since January of 1999 in comparison to the SPDR S&P 500.There is clearly a direct relationship between the PowerFactors ranking and annualized returns, meaning that companies with higher rankings tend to produce superior returns and vice versa. In addition, stocks with relatively high quantitative rankings tend to materially outperform the market over the years.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123Salesforce is among the best 10% of stocks in the market based on the quantitative algorithm. The company has a PowerFactors ranking of 98.12, and it enjoys strong metrics across the four factors considered: financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum and relative strength.Historical performance does not guarantee future returns, and performance numbers for quantitative systems should always be interpreted with caution, since the future is always a matter of possibilities and probabilities as opposed to certainties.Because of its own nature, a quantitative system is always backward-looking. This means that a system can tell you that a specific group of companies with certain quantitative attributes has a good chance of delivering market-beating returns over long periods of time, but it does not tell you much about a particular stock.In the case of Salesforce, it operates in a high-growth industry prone to technological disruption. It's important for investors to monitor the competitive landscape in order to make sure that the company remains strategically well-positioned for growth in the years ahead. This is particularly relevant since the stock is priced for aggressive growth expectations. If growth slows down more abruptly than expected, compressing valuation ratios could deliver a considerable blow to investors in Salesforce.The quantitative system alone does not tell you the whole story - it's important to understand the business behind the numbers in order to truly understand the main risks and return drivers in Salesforce stock. That being acknowledged, making investment decisions based on quantified data is certainly a sounder approach than relying entirely on emotions and subjectivities when picking stocks. If the statistical evidence is any valid guide, Salesforce is well-positioned for attractive performance over the middle term."

Salesforce is headquartered in San Francisco.Salesforce’s strategic investment approach is a classic ‘platform’ play where the firm invests across a large number of industries that can utilize its horizontal cloud data platform.When CRM began its strategic investing years ago, it originally focused its investments on early-stage companies but more recently appears to have transitioned its investment efforts toward mid- and later-stage technology companies.There is certainly less risk associated with investing at later stages of a startup’s development. Perhaps its initial efforts to seed its platform were successful enough that CRM could begin to focus on assisting certain companies in breaking out and achieving scale.In any event, Salesforce’s investing continues at a busy pace as the firm grows in size and going forward I expect to see strong investment both in the U.S. and internationally."

During a bull market, when it is easy to make solid returns, investors clamor for growth, and Salesforce certainly delivers this as well as accompanying passionate rhetoric too. However, the problem is that Salesforce's valuation is so stretched that it leaves its shareholders primed for disappointment as the company inevitably misses the Street's expectations.Salesforce's Q2 2019 earnings are out next Wednesday AH. After a rock solid Q1 2019 earnings result, where revenue was up 22% to $3.01 billion, putting Salesforce on a $12 billion annual revenue run rate, it is evident, there was very positive momentum created in Q1 2019. Shareholders have cheered on an already expensive stock, which has since its Q1 results day rallied by more than 10% in less than 3 months.The key takeaway last quarter was that Salesforce's top line, at its present run-rate, will be the fastest enterprise software company to reach $13 billion - a remarkable feat.Furthermore, Salesforce continues to innovate and heavily invest in AI, which allows Salesforce to leverage its Service Cloud together with Einstein Analytics with the end goal of creating a more personalized customer experience. For instance, one of the largest federal agencies in the U.S. has chosen Salesforce's strong ecosystem to improve the services they provide to millions of Americans every day.Additionally, since the quarter end, there was the rewarding announcement that Gartner for the 12th consecutive year recognizes Salesforce as a Leader in Sales Force Automation. However, for this value investor, this is where the good news finishes.Have you ever wondered why Salesforce's cash flows are so strong? CFO Hawkins highlights Salesforce's 'operating cash flow yield of approximately 24% [for FY 2019]', which is slightly disingenuous as it essentially removes management's compensation, which is a very real cost of running Salesforce so successfully.Source: Proxy form - page 35As the table above highlights for CEO Benioff, Salesforce's management team gets paid substantially well. However, most of the compensation - which reaches above $10 million annually for CEO Benioff alone, comes in the form of stock-based compensation. However, due to a one-off change in the timing of the annual grants from November to March, this benefited Salesforce's fiscal 2018 GAAP results, which improved from 0.8% operating margin to 2.2% in FY 2018.Nevertheless, to be clear, these stock-based compensation options are very much in the money, with a weighted-average exercise price of $78.40 and the weighted average remaining contractual term was approximately 5 years.Why does this matter? Because when it comes to Salesforce's stock valuation, in this rare case, I actually recommend readers zero in on its GAAP FY 2019 guidance of $0.49-0.51 rather than its non-GAAP diluted EPS $2.29-2.31, which adds back amortization of intangibles and stock-based expense - which are integral expenses for operating Salesforce.Source: author's calculations, morningstar.comSuperficially, we can see in the table above that the whole sector is trading a premium - which it certainly is. However, some of Salesforce's peers are decidedly safer investments than Salesforce. For instance, whilst Adobe's (ADBE) market cap of $125 billion is quite close to Salesforce's market cap of $110 billion, Adobe's bottom line trades at under 60X trailing earnings, while Salesforce's bottom line is being priced at meaningfully north of 200X forward earnings. This level of valuation leaves Salesforce so risky to invest in, that any slow down and shareholders could quite easily lose substantial amounts of capital swiftly.Once again, as I have already discussed above, although Salesforce's management proudly puts a spotlight on its robust cash flows (from operations), I do not believe this offers investors the fullest picture. The fact of the matter is that Salesforce's diluted share count continues to trickle up over time, and it ended Q1 2019 at 754 million diluted shares, up 14% from its weighted average in FY 2016.While one has to commend Salesforce's aggressive pace of growth, I fail to see how its stock is anything less than perfectly priced, leaving no room for execution failures and inevitable missed estimates. Earnings are out next week, with its soaring stock, results day promises to be anything but a non-event.Author's note: The only favor I ask is that you click the ""Follow"" button so I can grow my Seeking Alpha friendships and our Deep Value network.Disclaimer: Please do your own due diligence to reach your own conclusions."

(NYSE:CRM) is a leader in cloud computing and has been a strong momentum stock since February 2016. The only technical warning I can offer is that the stock’s 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading will rise above 90.00 next week on a positive reaction to earnings. Based upon my analysis, the 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic is the most consistent measure of technical momentum. It’s based upon the last 12 weeks of trading including the highest high and lowest low. With strong momentum a stock typically will end the week close to its weekly closing high. When this pattern changes and the stock, even though still setting new highs, begins to close further below the high, the stochastic will begin to slip in what’s called a negative divergence.The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic scales from 00.00 to 100.00 where readings above 80.00 are overbought and readings below 20.00 are oversold. Today’s reading for Salesforce is 86.73, well above the overbought threshold. A positive reaction to earnings will push this reading above 90.00, which I describe as an “inflating parabolic bubble” which is a longer-term warning to reduce holdings.Salesforce closed Tuesday at $152.99, up 49.7% year to date. The stock is in bull market territory, up 49.6% since setting its 2018 low of $102.27 on Jan. 2. The stock set its all-time intraday high of $154.88 on Aug. 27 and was knocking on the door of a new high before reporting quarterly results.Salesforce beat analysts earnings estimates but Wall Street had opposing views as to why the stock traded up to $157.50 then down in after hours trading. Some on Wall Street say that shares of Salesforce fell despite an earnings beat and strong full year guidance. Others say that Salesforce wavered on lower guidance. I say that daily and weekly charts can be used to help trade earnings volatility regardless of fundamental views. Courtesy of MetaStock XenithSalesforce has been trading above a ‘golden cross’ since March 6, 2017 when the stock closed at $82.50. A ‘golden cross’ occurs when the 50-day simple moving average rises above the 200-day simple moving average and indicates that higher prices lie ahead. This bullish pattern has been a reason to have been long this stock. The horizontal lines show that shares of Salesforce are well above my monthly, semiannual, quarterly and annual value levels of $142.28, $123.44, $119.17 and $107.38, respectively.The weekly chart for SalesforceCourtesy of MetaStock XenithThe weekly chart for Salesforce is positive but overbought with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $146.00. The stock is well above its 200-week simple moving average at $86.42 which is also known as the ‘reversion to the mean’ last tested during the week of Feb. 12, 2016, when the average was $52.49. Buying the stock on weakness to the ‘reversion to the mean’ was thus a prudent investment strategy to buy on weakness longer-term. The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading is projected to rise to 86.73 this week up from 83.60 on Aug. 24.Given these charts and analysis, my trading strategy is to buy weakness to my monthly value level of $142.28 and reduce holdings on strength to my weekly risky level at $156.04, which was doable in after-hours trading."

We will examine the outcome of getting long a two-week out of the money (40 delta) call option in Salesforce.com Inc. 7 days before earnings (using calendar days) and selling the call before the earnings announcement. Here's the setup in great clarity. Since Salesforce reports earnings after the market closes, we note, again, that the trade closes before earnings, so this trade does not make a bet on the earnings result. We can add another layer of risk management to the back-test by instituting and 40% stop loss and a 40% limit gain. Here is that setting: In English, at the close of each trading day, we check to see if the long option is either up or down 40% relative to the open price. If it was, the trade was closed.

It's a fair question to ask if these returns are simply a reflection of a bull market rather than a successful strategy.

As I have argued recently, salesforce.com already controls what I estimate to be 40% of this market, so a decrease in the revenue growth rate here would not be surprising -- sales cloud, representing one third of total revenues, was up 16% last quarter vs. total company's top line growth of 27%. For guided revenue growth of 25% to materialize, I expect service and marketing/commerce cloud to pick up the slack. Both businesses combined accounted for more than half of salesforce.com's revenue growth in fiscal 1Q19, in dollar terms.Still a value investor at heart, I would be satisfied to see gains of scale helping to push opex down relative to revenues produced. In my long-term projections, I believe R&D, marketing and G&A (including share-based compensation) in proportion to sales would need to drop by two and a half percentage points per year for GAAP op margins to reach 12.5% by fiscal 2022 and help support the stock's current valuation -- between fiscal 2014 and 2018, the dip averaged three percentage points. Realistically, however, operating costs could continue to rise in the short term in support of customer experience (e.g. ramp up of AI functionality) and integration of newly-acquired businesses (i.e. MuleSoft and CloudCraze). See graph below.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsI am not going to lie: any upcoming salesforce.com's earnings release will cause me, a ""newbie"" shareholder who jumped in earlier this month at $145/share, some anxiety. Shares have risen an impressive 63% and 210% in the past one and five years, respectively. Because the share price climb was accompanied by impressive revenue growth, any top-line hiccup or expectations for one to come up in the near future could harm the stock's valued status as a ""growth play"" and send prices down, perhaps sharply. Only because this hasn't happened in the past does not mean it can not happen in the future.CRM PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsFears aside (justifiable, as an investor is unlikely to receive returns without taking on proportionate risks), I remain optimistic about what Marc Benioff and his team will manage to deliver next week. Perhaps more importantly, I remain confident that salesforce.com's appeal that supports my bullish stance on the stock will remain unchanged: (1) a portfolio of several high growth businesses built upon (2) a subscription-based, SaaS model expected to generate recurring revenues that I believe will provide stability to financial results and to the stock in the foreseeable future.Should this continue to be the case, I will likely be ready to buy my second batch of CRM within the two-week period following the earnings release (as a reminder, my first small purchase was made mid-August). While I am a CRM bull, I understand that dollar-cost averaging into a richly priced stock might be the best strategy to avoid jumping onboard at peak levels. I would encourage potential CRM investors to consider the benefits of doing so as well."

Revenues of $3.28 billion topped expectations by about $50 million, with subscription revenues (93% of total sales) up 28.4% YOY. Even after adjusting for 14 cents in accounting-related upside to non-GAAP EPS, earnings still came in ten cents per share above consensus, as gross and op margins expanded by 11 bps and 176 bps, respectively.(Image Credit: TechCrunch)I was satisfied to see that my expectation for 20%-plus revenue growth over the next few years does not appear to be at risk. Now, aided by the recent acquisition of MuleSoft, total revenue growth of 27% was the highest achieved by the company since the April 2016 quarter. In the earnings call, the management team reinforced its optimism about the CRM space as a whole, but specifically about Salesforce.com's individual performance - allegedly growing at nearly twice the pace of the overall sector.As regards the segment split, sales cloud grew at the slowest pace for as far as I can remember: 13% vs. 14% YTD and 16% in fiscal 2018. This was a slight concern that I presented in my earnings preview, since I estimate that Salesforce.com now controls more than 40% of the sales cloud market. The rest of the portfolio picked up the slack, however, with platform services up 53% YOY (part of it likely produced inorganically).(Source: D.M. Martins Research, using data from company reports)Lastly, I was very satisfied to see profitability improve. Gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was up modestly as the company continues to gain scale. GAAP opex as a percentage of revenues (excluding one-off charges) dipped to 70.6% this quarter versus fiscal 2Q18's 71.8%, and I expect the operating profit rate to continue to dip over the next several quarters.(Source: D.M. Martins Research, using data from company reports)Even though the after-hours reaction has been largely neutral to slightly negative, with the stock swinging from -3% to +2%, Salesforce.com's fiscal 2Q19 results look solid. Growth appears to be as healthy as ever, and so does the backlog (i.e., ""revenue under contract""). The full-year outlook has been raised, a little on revenues and quite a bit on EPS (about 21 cents at the midpoint of the range). However, I believe the majority of that bottom line guidance increase to be related to mark-to-market accounting on investments that has little or nothing to do with the company's operations.(Source: D.M. Martins Research, historical data sourced from company reports)I liked to see the company's non-GAAP operating margin expand by a solid 176 bps YOY this quarter, which is very important for my fiscal 2022 GAAP operating margin target of about 12.5% to be reached (see graph above). I further believe that profitability should improve gradually going forward, with operating leverage playing a key role in margin expansion.If, for any reason (potentially a lower-than-expected earnings guidance for fiscal 3Q19, or maybe some profit-taking), CRM drops during the trading session tomorrow, I will likely pull the trigger on my second buy order; due to valuation concerns, I chose to buy shares using a dollar-cost average strategy. Looking beyond the next few days or couple of weeks, I remain confident that CRM stock will keep moving higher as the company continues to deliver."

When shares traded at 82x forward earnings, in November 2017, I called the stock ""hard to swallow"". At 68x earnings, in March of this year, CRM seemed ""pricey, but [the financial results] looked good"". Today, shares trade at 54x next year's non-GAAP earnings consensus, and I am finally ready to take a deep breath and buy my first few shares of the San Francisco company's equity.Credit: TechCrunchTo be clear, this is not a move intended to ride momentum or to time an entry ahead of the next leg up in share price appreciation. Instead, I will buy CRM, the priciest stock of my portfolio in P/E terms, and intend to hold it for a multi-year period because I now start to better appreciate what the company has to offer: (1) a portfolio of several high growth businesses built upon (2) a subscription-based, SaaS model expected to generate recurring revenues that I believe will provide stability to financial results and to the stock in the foreseeable future.See graph below for a visual of the company's six high-growth businesses.Source: November 2017 Investor DayThe first bullet above reminds me a bit of the Facebook (FB) story. Analyzed as a one-platform business only, the company was likely to have reached growth stagnation a while ago, when ""Facebook proper"" reached scale and saw its appeal lose steam in the social media space to newcomers like Twitter (TWTR) and Snapchat (SNAP) -- starting in 2015, and particularly with the younger audience. That was about the time that Instagram picked up the slack and began to drive most of Facebook's usage growth, with WhatsApp likely being the next candidate to play a similar role.In the case of salesforce.com, the company's dominance in the sales cloud space (which I estimate at over 40% market share today) suggests that growth opportunities on that end of the business (+16% YOY last quarter vs. total company's +27%) might be limited to the low-to-mid teens going forward. To the rescue come the service, marketing and commerce cloud businesses, each controlling no more than 20% of a sizable total addressable market, with plenty of runway ahead and cross-sell opportunities to offer. Add to the mix salesforce.com's large cash reserves representing 36% of book equity (see below) that could fuel inorganic growth (refer to the recent MuleSoft acquisition), and I start to believe that management's $21 billion revenue target by 2022 (mid point of the guidance range), for a projected 17% top-line CAGR between 2018 and then, is starting to look a bit too conservative.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsThe SaaS, subscription-based model is what, in my view, has the potential to (1) make revenues not only grow, but ""stick"" and (2) help push margins up without many ups and downs as the company continues to gain scale. Below are my revenue and GAAP op profit projections through 2022. If I am right about top-line CAGR of 20% between 2018 and 2022 and op margin expansion of about two to three percentage points per year, I estimate that a fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS of $4.50 for a much more reasonable forward P/E of 32x is not out of question.Source: projections by DM Martins ResearchThat said, I understand that I am exposing myself to the risk of buying CRM at a peak, precisely after shares have raced 40% YTD and more than doubled over the past three years. For this reason, my entry into the stock will be phased (i.e. dollar cost averaged) over a multi-month period, even though I don't find it highly likely that shares will correct substantially in the foreseeable future -- absent unfavorable macro factors that might impact the stock market as a whole."
4203036,103480,2018-08-30T05:44:36-04:00,"Salesforce shares pulled back by ~5% after announcing upbeat Q2 results alongside in-line guidance for Q3 and FY19.Revenue growth accelerated 180bps in the quarter to 27.4% y/y, an impressive feat for a company at Salesforce's nearly $15 billion revenue run rate.The long-term, multi-product growth story still remains intact, and any pullback should be used to buy shares.Shares are still modestly valued at ~8x forward revenues.","Dropping after reporting an earnings quarter is an unusual event for Salesforce.com (CRM), the largest pure-play SaaS company in the market and the dominant vendor of sales and marketing software. Salesforce has a decade's worth of unbroken earnings streaks - and though investors' reactions to those earnings quarters might vary from time to time, the general direction of Salesforce has always tilted toward growth and stock price appreciation. Given how fast Salesforce shares have appreciated this year, a minor pullback in the stock might actually be healthy for its long-term trajectory.Among investors, Salesforce has always been somewhat of a controversial stock that many investors love to hate. The biggest issue that bears have with this company is its long history of producing sub-par profits. Many investors think that it's incredible that this stock trades at a ~60x forward P/E. Salesforce just raised its guidance outlook to $2.50-2.52 in EPS for FY19 on a pro forma basis (which primarily nets out stock comp, as well as other small items). Still, Salesforce appears to be trading at a rich P/E multiple - and on a GAAP basis, this multiple exceeds 100x.Figure 1. Salesforce updated guidanceSource: Salesforce investor relationsBears feel vindicated when Salesforce shares pull back, feeling that its high P/E ratio will eventually bring it back down to earth. Using P/E as the crutch of Salesforce's bear thesis, however, is misguided. High-flying internet stocks like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) have essentially gotten a ""hall pass"" for several years on the earnings front, and these stocks also trade at ridiculously high forward P/E ratios. Yet investors seem to have no problem with these companies' high valuations, even as profit growth remains thin.I continue to believe that Salesforce's decision to invest in growth is wise. For a company that deals almost exclusively in long-term subscription relationships with large enterprise clients, it almost doesn't matter how much Salesforce spends upfront in sales dollars to land clients. In the long run, these clients cost very little to maintain. Salesforce is deferring its profits until a later date - years away, even - but long-term investors should be comfortable with that.And if we look at the company from a revenue valuation standpoint, its ~8.3x forward P/E ratio isn't far off from where other high-growth SaaS companies are currently trading in the market:CRM data by YChartsIn my view, Salesforce remains as close to a permanent hold as you can get in the volatile SaaS sector. Very few companies have reached this scale while still growing at Salesforce's rate, and very few companies have this much clout and dominance in its space as Salesforce does.One of the key aspects of the Salesforce bullish thesis that needs to constantly be revisited is the fact that the company is no longer dependent on a single product for the majority of its revenue stream.If you think about the software sector, most SaaS startup or mid-cap companies - and even large companies like Workday (WDAY) - are known primarily for one product or area of expertise.Workday is known primarily for its HCM platform, though in recent years it has diversified into ERP systems. Autodesk (ADSK) is known for its computer-aided design (CAD) software. Dropbox (DBX) is a file-sharing giant. Tableau (DATA) is a leader in BI. The list goes on and on.Salesforce, on the other hand, is no longer just a CRM play. Salesforce's Service Cloud has nearly overtaken Sales Cloud in terms of overall revenues, and is certainly growing much faster than Sales Cloud is. The Salesforce Platform is also trailing close behind. When a company like Salesforce has so many different products to rely on for growth, its growth trajectory is far more believable. These tertiary business segments aren't moonshots in the style of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - these are proven, well-installed applications at multi-billion-dollar annual run rates.Figure 2. Salesforce revenues by productSource: Salesforce investor relationsEach of Salesforce's four key application segments are, in themselves, companies that would be worth at least ~$15 billion or more standalone (applying Salesforce's ~8x revenue multiple on these annualized revenue streams). And each quarter, the smaller clouds keep growing at astonishing rates.Sales Cloud is only showing 13% y/y growth this quarter, but as Sales Cloud saturates and slows down, Platform revenues are growing 54% y/y (helped by the recently acquired Mulesoft), and Marketing revenues are growing 37% y/y. One additional mention on Platform revenues - Mulesoft aside, a good deal of these revenues come from the Salesforce app store, so a decent chunk of the company's revenue growth is being generated by third-party developers that it doesn't even pay.This continued multi-product growth story, which gets validated every single quarter, remains one of the top reasons to stay long on Salesforce. New co-CEO Keith Block (who got promoted earlier this year) also noted that Salesforce is reiterating its target of $23 billion in revenues by FY22, which is about 75% higher than FY19's annual revenue target within just three years. Taken from the earnings call transcript:Here's a look at full results in the second quarter:Figure 3. Salesforce 2Q19 resultsSource: Salesforce investor relationsRevenues grew 27.4% y/y to $3.28 billion, which as previously noted was due largely to tremendous revenue growth in Salesforce Platform. Revenue beat Wall Street's expectations of $3.23 billion (+25.4% y/y) by a solid 180bps, and revenue growth also accelerated 180bps over last quarter's revenue growth.The strength this quarter was not reserved just to the top line, however. Salesforce also made notable progress on the profitability front, even if it's still several years out from achieving a ""normalized"" P/E ratio or net margin profile.Gross margins, which were already high, bumped up 10bps to 74.1% on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses largely rose in line with revenues, particularly on the sales and marketing side (recall that Salesforce's absorption of Mulesoft also brings its heavy losses into the fold), but the company also managed to grow operating income by 37% y/y to $115 million. This represents an operating margin of 3.5%, up a small 30bps over 3.2% in the year-ago quarter.And, due to a tax benefit this quarter, Salesforce drastically boosted GAAP net income to $299 million. It's not just on the GAAP (tax-affected) side that Salesforce showed strength, however. Pro forma EPS of $0.57 showed a 21% beat over Wall Street consensus of $0.47.Note also that free cash flow grew 42% y/y to $288 million in the quarter, despite this being a quarter where FCF is typically thin. For the year-to-date, Salesforce has generated $1.63 billion in free cash flow (+28% y/y) at an FCF margin of 26.0%:Figure 4. Salesforce free cash flowSource: Salesforce investor relations""Low"" EPS aside, free cash flow is arguably the more important metric to watch, and a 26% FCF margin is almost unparalleled in the SaaS sector. Judging Salesforce purely on the basis of its GAAP earnings, in my view, produces a skewed picture. Its FCF, at the very least, is incredibly strong.Salesforce has produced yet another strong quarter that showed growth across its emerging products, which is critical for the company's path to $23 billion in revenues - a target Salesforce has reiterated with confidence this quarter. In addition to top-line strength, Salesforce is also generating healthy beats to the bottom line and continuing its free cash flow expansion.Dips in Salesforce should be bought. Stay in for the long haul."

Management note how regulations could impact the business; the UK (outside of the EU) might not be subject to the same regulations.Salesforce sees the UK as a safe place to invest; the UK is a large revenue segment in Europe already, and the company aims to take advantage of the expected $65bln of net new business revenue that should flood the UK by 2022.It is unclear if the UK will keep such regulations as GDPR (""The General Data Protection Regulation"") in the future. Salesforce has noted that GDPR, and other rules, could harm the business going forward, everything from ""significant fines"" to ""cost of compliance burdens"" would have an impact on how Salesforce operates in the EU.Source: Salesforce 2018 annual reportThe EU seems determined to cause havoc in the tech sector with regulations around data. Europe (including the UK) accounts for ~18% of total revenue. Salesforce's FY-2017-FY-2018 revenue in Europe grew by 38.58%; US revenue, on the other hand, increased by 21.75%.The UK corporate tax rate is currently a more appealing 19% when compared to the EU's 23.3%. Lower taxes and a possibility or fewer regulations are all benefits of doing business in the UK.The $2.5bln investment in the UK should not harm the company's FCF as much as you might think. CapEx on an annual basis is ~$500mln. The $2.5bln investment in the UK will be over the next five years; this equals ~$500mln per year, in line with present CapEx spending.The investment should now give a good amount of lobbying power to the firm, thanks to the 900 jobs that are being created.Salesforce met with the UK Prime Minister Theresa May, and the PM welcomes the investment:The company was one of the first to promote SaaS (""Software as a Service""). The SaaS model shows that everyone benefits, the users are satisfied because they do not take large costs upfront and they get the latest version without having to repurchase, and the companies that offer SaaS are satisfied because they get a recurring revenue, along with the ease of scalability.In theory, SaaS companies could operate on the clients they have now (assuming they are profitable) and spend zero on marketing, as long as the product remains in-line with what the end user wants, that is the power of SaaS.CRM Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThe company works with all sizes of institutions and also serves governments.

Click here to find out more »Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), a leader in customer relationship management, is a multi-year play on cloud adoption led deferred revenue growth. The company has been expanding its total addressable market (TAM) and delivering solid free cash flows, making it a darling of the stock markets. However, CRM's current valuations have run ahead of its TAM (how can a company be valued more than the market it serves?), making it a likely short.Sources: Company presentations, SEC filings, Company websiteDue to the increasing interest levels in the cloud space, gaining market share is becoming increasingly expensive, leading to a spate of richly valued deals.CRM's own investments seem to be losing impact towards market share gains. The last row in the table below shows how per unit increase in market cap is likely to become more expensive.Sources: Company presentations, SEC filings, Company websiteCRM's recent partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a further acknowledgement of its difficulty in growing TAM. By aligning itself with G-Suite and making Google Cloud its ""preferred public cloud provider,"" Salesforce aims to cross sell and up sell into synergies arising from partnering with Google. Not only could this lower CRM's cost of acquiring market share, but also help avoid costly acquisitions such as MuleSoft - CRM acquired MuleSoft at $6.8 billion, valuing it at 15x trailing revenue.While CRM's efficiency of revenue growth may have declined, revenue is still expected to grow at a healthy 24% to $13 billion in F2019. Despite this stellar growth, even at a P/Revenue, the company's valuations look unsustainable.Sources: Company presentations, SEC filings, Company websiteThe >7x multiple on revenue implies that the market expects CRM to continue delivering on this rate of revenue growth for the next seven years out, which is quite unlikely given the increasing price of acquiring revenues. It is worth highlighting that the lure of subscription-driven revenues has made valuations go through the roof - most cloud/SAAS companies are trading north of 10x revenue multiples!The big question is whether such stratospheric valuations can sustain. CRM for one has always been expensive. It has been a consistent industry leader (Gartner, IDC, Forrester, etc. have always given the company top marks) on the back of its offerings.Furthermore, taking a cue from the recent Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) acquisition of GitHub, CRM may well be on the path to be acquired by GOOG - MSFT was the biggest contributor to GitHub, an industry-leading code repository. CRM and GOOG's strategic partnership to leverage Google Cloud Platform for CRM's international infrastructure expansion may just be enough to keep investors guessing when GOOG could acquire CRM, thus preventing any significant correction to CRM's valuations.It is interesting to note that CRM's competition-defying products are not only the fruit of its 30,000+ employees, but also are derived from its developer community of over five million. At an EV of over $104 bn, this translates into an EV/Developer of $20,833. MSFT just paid an EV/Developer of $268 for GitHub's developer community of 28 million! While CRM's F2019E revenue is almost 40x that of GitHub's estimated revenue of $300 million and CRM is a listed and profitable entity, it still is not enough to justify the ~80x difference in EV/Developer across the two companies. While MSFT has paid 25x of revenue for GitHub, but much less at a developer level, clearly highlighting MSFT's intent of increasing the value derived from developers. In the wake of slowing market growth, how much will CRM be able to increase its EV/Developer is a big question mark!Although it is difficult to be rational in an overheated market, a way to normalise the valuation is to look at leading tech consulting companies such as Accenture (ACN), Infosys (INFY), etc. that are in the process of productizing their services. These companies trade in the range of 3-4x revenue. Given CRM has a far better track record of delivering on subscription revenues, a fair valuation multiple would be a premium to it, at 4-5x 12-month trailing revenue, which still implies a downside of 30-40% from the current price levels.CRM's ability to keep the focus on growing market share in a growing TAM is certainly going to be difficult to ignore, however, so shall be diminishing in utility of CRM's investments. Thus from a 12- to 18-month perspective, it would be prudent to sell the rumor (of Google potentially acquiring Salesforce) and reap the benefits of an impending fall in CRM's price."
4178696,98236,2018-06-01T00:12:02-04:00,"Earlier this week, Salesforce reported the results of its fiscal Q1.This was another strong quarter, although it is easy to get carried away by the headline hype.The company is on track to achieve its growth goal this year on a currency-adjusted basis.It achieved significant leverage at scale, both GAAP and non-GAAP.The acquisition of Mulesoft is a modest headwind to reported EPS and a modest tailwind to anticipated revenue growth.","Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) reported the results of its fiscal Q1 on Tuesday, May 29th. For those readers who want the short version, the quarter was a stunner - or at least almost so. It is best characterized by the title of a song that was the theme of one of the great performers of my youth, Ethel Merman. The lady was oversize in many ways. She had a big, bold brassy voice, and I remember her often performing with a dress full of sequins and perhaps pearls. She was one of the more conspicuous Republicans amongst theatrical performers and lived long enough to sing her theme song, ""Everything’s Coming Up Roses,"" at Ronald Reagan’s inauguration. But even with her very prominent political affiliation, she was known as the First Lady of Broadway for a decade or more. And if you want to know how Salesforce did this past quarter and don’t want to read more than a sentence or two, well just know that at Salesforce “everything’s coming up roses” and you have it all. Not quite the sensational quarter of the headlines, but another one of a long string of strong quarters.Anyone who follows the IT sector even for a brief while often reads about decelerating growth. And the fact is that growth deceleration, sort of like ageing, is a fact of life for most IT vendors as they grow and mature. Year after year, Salesforce has guided for growth deceleration, and this year started out typically with that kind of forecast when the company last reported. After all, this company has now passed an annual revenue run rate of $12 billion - and it is still growing strongly. It has managed to put off any significant growth deceleration for several years now, and while organic, currency-adjusted growth has slipped into the low 20%'s range, that is no mean accomplishment given the size of this company. Salesforce is finally making some money - real money that can be used for acquisitions or other ways of increasing shareholder value.While the 25% top line growth that was reported this quarter has been typical of this company’s performance for some time, the leverage at scale is something new. Salesforce attained a noticeable increase in GAAP - yes, GAAP operating margins which reached more than 6% this quarter compared to breakeven results last year. Despite the plethora of huge transactions that marked the quarter, including an addition to the company’s relationship with one of the larger insurers in the world, sales and marketing expense rose just 20% year on year. For Salesforce, at this point in time, that is an accomplishment.The purpose of these articles is not to report on events that are well-known amongst investors for whom they are relevant. I try to look out a few quarters to see if I can produce some value-add in suggesting the future trajectory, at least on a relative basis, of the names in my space. And to cut to the chase, I think that while Salesforce is a great company doing as well as might reasonably expected, it is probably not going to produce much differentiated return - because everyone knows it is a great company that is executing at the top of its ability.Again, at this point, everyone is aware that Salesforce had a strong quarter retrospectively, and that adjusted for accounting rules and the acquisition of Mulesoft, it is raising guidance, albeit modestly. Overall, analysts closely adhere their projections to company guidance, and that has been the case this time around. Most new analyst models now forecast that EPS will rise to about $2.30, and that revenues will reach $13.1 billion for the year. Like many other companies in the IT space, it should be noted that the company’s performance is coming in the midst of what is a quasi-boom. Salesforce's leader acknowledged that there is a strong tailwind from the economy in interviews after the conference call. I have written before that this one of the rising tide of IT spending, built on Big Data, AI, analytics, IoT, and digital transformations, continues to be an underrated tailwind. This company is enjoying tailwinds from all of these sources, and it has proven adept at taking advantage of the latest and most important trends in the IT space.Salesforce, unlike other IT vendors, does guide for operating cash flow, and it is probably worth noting that the relationship between net income and cash flow has been changed by the adoption of ASC 606 standards. Q1 CFFO was not an upside, although the company did raise its anticipated full-year cash flow margin to 19.5-20.5%, and in turn, that brought estimates for that metric to around $3.15 billion for the current fiscal year. CFFO growth is expected to be 14-15% for the full year, including a headwind of about $150 million from the acquisition of Mulesoft. The main reason for the rather modest increase in CFFO this past quarter, and perhaps for the balance of the year, has to do with ASC 606 and how it treats multi-year contracts. I recently wrote about the changes required to comply with ASC 606 in an article on Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), for anyone who wants more depth on the subject. But in any event, the fall in what is now captioned Unearned Revenue was noticeably greater than in past Q1's, for no other reason but that revenue recognition has changed.The company’s new forecasts for revenues, CFFO, and non-GAAP EPS are all modestly above prior First Call consensus estimates with adjusted revenues, including the impact of Mulesoft and the adoption of the ASC 606 standard, now expected to rise by about 22% this year - maybe 0.5% greater than before. EPS guidance is notably greater than the prior estimates, and is greater even after allowing for a headwind of about $.02 in EPS from the acquisition of Mulesoft. The new non-GAAP EPS forecast of $2.30 compares to the prior First Call consensus of $2.13, and while not explicitly stated, this kind of margin increase is impacting GAAP as well as non-GAAP results.Salesforce is a well-loved stock, with 40 out of 45 analysts rating it as a Buy. The First Call consensus price target, for whatever that's worth, had been $140/share, and based on my reading so far, revised average price targets seem to be rising around $5 or a bit more. A well-loved company, a modest beat and share price performance that had already encompassed 25% appreciation on a year-to-date basis. The shares have appreciated modestly above the 21% percentage appreciation of the IGV so far this year, and thus, it is not terribly surprising to find the shares reacting modestly to the strong quarter and strong guidance. When a company is covered by 45 analysts as this one is, and when 87% of the shares are already owned by institutions, with another 5% owned by insiders, it is hard for an upside earnings report that is probably within the range of what had really been expected, by itself, to cause a substantial share price reaction - although the opposite would probably not be true.Like Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), this company, as it adopts ASC 606, has decided to introduce a new metric to better track bookings. This new metric is called “total remaining transaction price,” and it rose 36% year on year. The current portion of this metric rose by 26%, suggesting that some of the largest deals that Salesforce closed this past quarter are multi-year engagements. In time, it is the expectation of Salesforce - and Splunk and probably most other IT firms - to have “remaining transaction price” supersede deferred revenues as a key metric, which will best eliminate the length of invoicing terms from investor perception. That said, the company has not yet forecast the future trend of this metric, perhaps because it is unknowable at this point.The quarter was strong, the guidance raise was small, and most professional analysts and investors expect that this company will produce some level of upside. Given the level of performance this quarter, the issue of valuation and futures need to be addressed to see if there is a reasonable rationale for believing the shares can significantly outperform the IGV index.Perhaps it is heretical to put it this way - but in fact, in 2018, it is difficult to have a special sauce in terms of product virtuosity when it comes to sales force automation. Salesforce has been a leader in the various Gartner MQs which are applicable - I have linked a couple here for the convenience of readers - and there is no reason to imagine that this will not continue to be the case. The company mainly gets its star rating because of its ability to execute. It closest competitor, Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA), has a strong score in terms of vision but is less capable of supporting the very largest opportunities that are available in the customer engagement space. In fact, as the MQ analysis suggests, Pega is probably a better choice for users who have needs that are more involved and complex than straightforward CRM requirements.Salesforce has seen some level of growth recrudescence of different levels in the past several quarters in the growth of its Sales Cloud revenues. Sales Cloud remains the company’s largest line of business with about 34% of corporate subscription and support revenue this past quarter. The company’s ability to execute within that space, and to grow at a 16% rate, certainly suggests that it is gaining market share. And it is probably also a testament to the rapid acceptance of solutions with Sales Cloud based on Einstein AI.Probably the most impressive result last quarter was the 41% top line increase in the company’s so-called Commerce Cloud. Commerce Cloud encompasses lots of solutions, and it is not likely to grow by 41% every quarter as was the case in the just-published earnings report. How much of the growth last quarter might have come from the products associated with the Demandware acquisition is not clear. But at this point, it seems fair to suggest that Salesforce is winning the battle against its many competitors and has done an excellent job of managing that acquisition. Commerce Cloud, with its most recent revenue jump, is now 15% of total Salesforce revenues, and it is reasonable to imagine it will continue to exert a positive impact on reported top line growth on into the future. Whether or not Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) recent acquisition of Magento might lead to a countervailing acquisition by Salesforce is an open question.The company was one of the pioneers of the ecosystem phenomenon, and that business component achieved growth of 36% last quarter. If Salesforce has a special sauce, it is knowing how to foster a symbiotic relationship with all of the companies that exist on its platform. The addition of Mulesoft to its repertoire is probably going to further enhance the ability of this company to achieve outsize growth in its Platform and other revenue buckets.For many years, Salesforce has had a substantial unfulfilled business opportunity outside the US. This past quarter, revenues in Europe jumped 48% (about 31% on a constant currency basis) to about 20% of the total. It would seem reasonable to suggest that such a percentage leaves significant room for further upside.I think it can be somewhat difficult to describe precisely why Salesforce has been, and remains, successful in its many spaces. It is not necessarily its technology, which, while certainly competitive, is not quite unique or unequalled. The company does provide its users with enough support and service so that it hasn’t lost users because of its attitude or lack focus on user success. While Salesforce is all about a sales culture, and both the CEO and his immediate lieutenant, Keith Block, have sales backgrounds, the company hasn’t had to go overboard in terms of aggressive sales practices.In some ways, it has been fortunate for Salesforce that it has competed with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP and even IBM in that it has reputation for being more flexible and more forward thinking than its larger rivals. While the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Dynamics CRM platform has been gaining some ground, there is plenty of space for a bunch of number twos in this market. Salesforce has been able to remain far more focused on the higher-growth components of the IT space - and even its largest and lowest-growth space, Customer Engagement, has far more potential than ERP, HCM or Financial apps. And of course, the company has no migration concerns to deal with in that it has never sold any on-premise solutions - more of a benefit to its flexibility than might be imagined.Special sauce/moats - if by that the reader envisions some particular unduplicated technology or some unique IP or some contractual lock-in, it will not be found in the Salesforce go-to-market approach. But the company does have rafts of contented customers who are willing to pay modest premiums for solutions that work, are mainstream, and afford users the competitive attributes that they expect to achieve from their IT investment. Salesforce has proven to be a worthwhile partner for many of the largest enterprises on a global basis with which it has a lengthy history, and its senior management has been able to infuse the organization with values that work in software sales. That is about as much secret sauce and competitive moat as the company has, and it has been good enough to maintain its growth rate above the levels that many had thought possible.Shares of Salesforce are an attractive investment for many institutions, but may not be a particularly attractive commitment for some individual investors who are looking to “beat the market” - something very hard to accomplish with a well-covered name that presents all of the financial metrics that are necessary to understand the company. Institutions are looking for stability, visibility and a dependable management team that is making appropriate choices to ensure that this company continues to maintain its position in higher-growth parts of the IT space. They are also likely to appreciate the company’s recent turn to profitability and to be comfortable with its relatively aggressive acquisition strategy. If I were preparing a brokerage report, I would probably rate these shares a buy as the course of least resistance. But in writing for the audience on SA, I think it is important to realize that the positives of this company and its longer-term growth prospects are well understood at this point. That is why institutions already own it in such size.While I was suitably impressed by the strong performance of both this company’s international business and its growth in the commerce cloud, it still grew by 22% on a constant currency basis. And that is the way it has to be valued - 22% growth!So, EV/S to start with. Based on Salesforce’s latest sales forecast, it should generate about $14 billion of revenue in the next 12 months. Its latest enterprise value, after paying for the acquisition of Mulesoft, whose revenue is included in the above estimate, is about $102.7 billion. That puts the current EV/S ratio at 7.33X. That metric is perhaps a bit above the current average for other companies with top line growth of 20-25%. On that basis, the shares are not a bargain and not an outlier either. Perhaps a slight premium can be justified based on size/liquidity and more accurate forecasting - but that is hard to say.The P/E ratio is currently about 53X, based on an estimate of non-GAAP 12-month forward EPS of $2.50. As mentioned, Q1 saw a significant improvement in operating margins, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. In particular, stock-based comp fell to 8.4% of revenues, down from 10.5% of revenues the prior year. The company improved its GAAP operating expense ratio 500 bps last quarter on a year-on-year basis. Overall non-GAAP operating margins climbed to 15% last quarter, a substantial increase from the 9% operating margins that Salesforce achieved on the same reporting basis in the same quarter of the prior fiscal year.Its operating margin guidance is somewhat impacted by the acquisition of Mulesoft, but there is no reason to believe that the company will not be able to continue to expand margins. It is now able to grow revenues substantially with less headcount additions than in the recent past.Overall, the P/E ratio of 53X is probably at lower levels than the average IT vendor. Given the company’s rapid diminution of the stock-based comp ratio, and the evidence of leverage at scale, I would expect that earnings will be supportive of share valuation going forward.The company is now projecting that its full-year CFFO will be about $3.15 billion, a cash flow margin of 24% on its revenue expectation. CFFO is rising a bit more slowly than revenues, even on an adjusted basis, primarily because the increase in unearned revenues is rising more slowly compared to historical levels. Basically, although Salesforce bookings are rising quite rapidly, as seen in its new metric of ""remaining transaction price,"" less of that increase is coming from advance cash payments which will restrict cash flow growth. The company’s spree of real estate purchase in San Francisco, New York and London is abating, and capex has begun to fall. Overall, free cash flow will probably reach around $2.65 billion a year, and at that level, the free cash flow yield will be about 2.6%. That is not a particularly impressive number for a company of this size; even after adjusting for the headwind from Mulesoft, the free cash flow yield would be less than 3%.Salesforce, for me, remains as it has been. A company firing on all cylinders, one with strong but not ground-breaking technology, and engaged in the growthiest components of the application software space. The strategies of its leadership have put off growth rate compression - a consummation aided this year by currency movement. Overall, it is fairly valued, with most of its attributes well-recognized by the institutional ownership base that owns most of its shares. I expect the shares, for the most part, will continue to track the performance of IGV or QQQ."
4178845,103519,2018-06-01T14:04:59-04:00,"CRM reported a very strong quarter, beating EPS and revenue expectations.Revenues grew 25% YoY, much more rapidly than expected but consistent with previous results.Management was extremely bullish during the call. Future expectations are incredibly high and likely to be met.The company continues outperforming the competition and its market share keeps rising.","Salesforce.com's (CRM) latest quarter was outstanding across most metrics. The company reported double-digit growth in all relevant metrics, exceeded analyst expectations and company guidance, and raised expectations for future performance across the board. Although results were a pleasant surprise, CRM has an enviable track record of setting sky-high expectations and then exceeding them.CRM remains the company for CRM services, with little sign of competition slowing it down. Earnings were up 86% YoY to $0.52. Impressive, although not particularly relevant. As the company is currently focusing on revenue growth, not earnings, its margins are tight and its income substantially lower than its potential implies. Revenue is much more indicative of the company's performance and was up 25% YoY, outstanding for most companies, but inline with CRM's performance during the last few years. Even so, analysts, and the company itself expected lower revenue growth due to market saturation, competition and CRM maturing as a company. The fact that the company manages to achieve solid growth, quarter after quarter, even as the industry matures and it runs out of untapped markets, is a remarkable feat, and great sign for investors.Revenue growth came almost exclusively from increased sales/subscription agreements, although currency movements did account for 3% of revenue growth.Growth was very well spread out across the company's different business segments and geographical markets. Growth was generally higher in more niche products and markets, a positive development which should serve to further diversify the company's revenue streams:(Source: CRM 1Q2018 8-K)(Source: CRM 1Q2018 8-K)A key characteristic of CRM's revenues, and its broader business model, is their recurring nature. The company was one of the innovators of the SaaS business model, in which software is thought of, and sold as, a subscription-based service. This ensures the company's revenues are stable and easy to forecast,. Just look at how their revenues have developed across the years:Even as the company places little emphasis on cost reductions, most expenses still managed to decrease as a percentage of revenue during the quarter. Although management doesn't explain why this is the case, it's very likely due to economies of scale. As revenues continue to grow investors should expect to see further widening of the company's margins, leading to significant earnings growth.(Source: CRM 1Q2018 8-K)In general terms, the company's outlook remains incredibly strong, and has slightly improved after the latest earnings, for several reasons.First, guidance itself was raised after taking into consideration this quarter's beat. The company now expects revenue growth of 24%-25%, inline with recent results:(Source: CRM 1Q2018 8-K)The amazing thing is, these revenues have more or less been booked already. As the company operates under a subscription model it can very easily model its revenue in the near future as a function of its current subscriber base. Management has indicated that revenue is expected to grow 26% YoY if you consider how many customers it has under contract so far, a great result and one that exceeds guidance once more.Second, the Mulesoft acquisition will help the company offer a better, more robust portfolio of services, which should allow it to continue to increase market share.Third, management was extremely bullish during the call. Although this proves little, the call was probably the most optimistic I've heard. I can't imagine management under performing after such call.Taking into consideration the above analysis, I think investors should expect another guidance beat for the following few quarters.The company's management mentioned, in several occasions, how CRM is outperforming the competition, increasing market share and growing in size. The biggest evidence for this is just how quickly the company is rising in the Fortune 500 ranking:Incredible results, and few, if not none, companies have comparable records. CRM's growth continues to outpace the competition, with the company having the fastest revenue growth of the five largest enterprise software companies in the world.As an incredibly high-growth rate company with razor-thin margins, valuation can prove tricky. Nevertheless, the company EV/EBITDA and EV/revenue multiples remain within the company's normal trading range, although slightly elevated. As analysts update their expectations in light of the current quarter and management's raised guidance both ratios should decline slightly.Looking at the company's share price, it only increased by around 3% after earnings, a small increase and not particularly relevant.In general terms I would say the company's valuation is inline with its recent past and is reasonable.Salesforce delivered an excellent quarterly report, outperformed expectations and delivered double-digit growth in key financial metrics across business segments and geographical markets. Future expectations are for performance to continue, and you can count on the company to over deliver. Its valuation and share price have changed little and, as such, the company remains a solid investment choice."
4178025,103480,2018-05-30T05:55:53-04:00,"Salesforce released upbeat Q1 earnings that topped analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines, sending shares up 5%.The company has held its growth rate at ~25% consistently for many quarters, and its FY19 guidance range also implies 25% top-line growth.Though Salesforce is still barely profitable on a GAAP basis and trades at extraordinary P/E ratios, it is producing robust cash flows. FCF grew 25% y/y this quarter.The landmark acquisition of MuleSoft will be a tailwind to top-line growth, but a headwind to margins.","As predictable as always, Salesforce.com (CRM), the largest pure-play SaaS company that's also commonly credited with inventing the subscription software business model, beat Wall Street's expectations in the first quarter. Perhaps no company has as much experience or skill in managing expectations as Salesforce. Now spanning decades, the company has consistently performed above expectations and guidance in each and every single quarter. Investors should have learned by now that whatever guidance and Street targets are pinpointed for a certain quarter, Salesforce is sure to exceed them.That didn't stop investors from cheering Salesforce's latest earnings beat, however. The strength of Q1 results, as well as above-consensus guidance ranges for Q2 and FY19, sent shares of Salesforce rocketing up 5% in after-hours trading despite the jarring market tumble related to the Italian political drama.CRM data by YChartsYear to date, Salesforce has already enjoyed a 30% rise. Yet, it's still difficult to call Salesforce expensive. The company has always traded at around 7x forward revenues, and as seen from the chart above, Salesforce's stock price growth is essentially keeping pace with its revenue growth. All told, if a company maintains a 25% revenue growth rate as well as a constant EV/revenue valuation multiple, its stock will also rise 25% in tandem.The consistency of Salesforce's growth is stunning. Salesforce has grown its revenues by around 25% y/y in every quarter dating back to 2015. Whether through organic growth or via acquisitions, Salesforce keeps managing to find a source for growth. With Salesforce surpassing a $3 billion quarterly revenue milestone for the first time in Q1, it also hit a $12 billion revenue run rate for the first time (after hitting the $10 billion revenue run rate milestone just three quarters back, in 2Q18).Guidance for FY19 and 2Q19 also implies ~25% growth, as shown below. These figures include MuleSoft's contribution. Note that analysts had expected $3.11 billion for Q2 and $12.76 billion for FY19, but their expectations don't include MuleSoft.Figure 1. Salesforce guidanceSource: Salesforce investor relationsOne other note on MuleSoft: though the acquisition is accretive to growth, the fact that MuleSoft is still a money-losing operation means it's a headwind to Salesforce's profit expansion. Mark Hawkins, Salesforce's CFO, made the following comment on the earnings call:I still find it difficult to justify the premium of ~16x forward revenues that Salesforce paid for MuleSoft (possibly one of the largest acquisition multiples ever paid for a mid-cap, non-startup technology company, above the ~10x multiple Oracle (ORCL) paid for NetSuite). There can be no denying, however, that MuleSoft makes for an extremely synergistic combination with Salesforce's platform technologies.All in all, Salesforce remains an unstoppable stock. Morgan Stanley (MS) seems to agree, naming Salesforce as one of 30 stocks they would choose for a three-year sideways market, as reported by SA News. Despite the seeming lack of profitability, Salesforce is making gradual margin improvements on top of robust, multi-product revenue growth. If there's one SaaS stock that can stand the test of time (or at least, a medium-term horizon of 3-5 years), it's Salesforce.Here's a look at Salesforce's results in the first quarter:Figure 2. Salesforce Q1 resultsSource: Salesforce investor relationsTotal revenues grew 26% y/y to $3.01 billion, surpassing analyst estimates of $2.94 billion (+23% y/y) by three points. The company kept a strong pace with Q4's exiting revenue growth rate of 24% y/y. Note that MuleSoft contribution has not yet been figured into the Q1 results - though the transaction was signed in March, management noted on the earnings call that it didn't close until May. MuleSoft will affect revenue comps for the remainder of the year, but in this quarter, Salesforce's 26% revenue growth is organic and ""clean.""As per usual, the growth derived from all of Salesforce's products, particularly its non-legacy segments. Key to the Salesforce bullish thesis is the fact that its dominance stems from multiple product lines, each with extremely large TAMs, so continued growth in Salesforce's currently-lesser clouds is of utmost importance.Figure 3. Salesforce growth by cloudSource: Salesforce investor relationsSalesforce's flagship business, Sales Cloud, grew 16% y/y to $965 million, matching its Q4 growth rate of 16%. Service Cloud, Platform, and Marketing Cloud, however, showed 29%, 36%, and 41% y/y growth, respectively, offsetting the lower growth rates in the much larger Sales Cloud. Indeed, while Salesforce's Sales Cloud CRM was once the lynchpin of its business, Service Cloud is very close to catching up as the number-one revenue generator, with Platform not too far behind (especially considering it's growing at more than twice Sales Cloud's rate).On the cost side, Salesforce also achieved tremendous results this quarter. The company scaled down operating expenses by 500 bps to 68% of revenues, achieved by a 200 bps reduction in R&D spending as a percentage of revenues, 200 bps reduction in sales and marketing as a percentage of revenues, and a 100 bps reduction in general and administrative costs. Even if we factor in the ~125 bps of MuleSoft-related operating margin headwinds that management alluded to going forward, Salesforce can still achieve positive margin improvements on a y/y basis. As a result of the cost improvements this quarter, Salesforce's operating income shot up to $191 million (a 6% GAAP operating margin) versus essentially breakeven last year.Pro forma EPS of $0.52 also beat analyst expectations of $0.46 with 13% upside, but even more telling than Salesforce's EPS is its free cash flow growth. FCF grew 24% y/y to $1.34 billion, representing a huge FCF margin of 45% this quarter. Often Dropbox (DBX) gets plenty of kudos for its 28% FCF margin - but despite the flack that Salesforce gets for its lack of GAAP profits, it's at least posting huge FCF and FCF margins.Salesforce remains a top pick for long-term holdings in technology. The company has such a long history of earnings outperformance and a commitment to maintaining its growth rate that it's difficult to see a bear case for the company, even though its stock has already heavily outperformed the market in 2018.On top of multi-product growth and significant y/y margin expansions, Salesforce also continues to improve on newer offerings like Einstein and Lightning while adding new products via acquisitions like MuleSoft. There's no question that Salesforce remains top dog in the SaaS space - yet its ~7.2x forward revenue valuation still pales in comparison to double-digit multiples for Adobe (ADBE) and Workday (WDAY). Remain long on this company."
4158990,98236,2018-03-26T15:57:08-04:00,"Salesforce announced last week that it was acquiring MuleSoft at a substantial premium.Some observers felt that the valuation was excessive at more than 16X forward revenues, a new record, apparently for that metric in the enterprise IT space.This article looks at the valuation and why it was justified in the opinion of this author.The author looks at the most direct analong to MuleSoft, Talend, and suggests that at just 6.5X EV/S, it may be undervalued and has a significant consolidation potential.The author provides readers of a list of 20 names in the enterprise IT space that may attract consolidation bids far higher than in the past based on the calculus illustrated by the MuleSoft acquisition.","Last week, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) announced that it would be acquiring MuleSoft (NYSE:MULE). Overall, reaction by analysts and investors was muted, and a fair number of analysts who cover Salesforce were not impressed with the deal. Since the deal was announced, CRM shares are down almost 8% since the announcement - they might have been down 8% in any event. Given the recent market turmoil (the QQQ index lost 7.6% this past week), it is hard to assign a specific weight to the impact of the merger announcement on the Salesforce share price. From my perspective, I am inclined to think that much, although not all of the share price pullback in Salesforce relates to macro issues, and most specifically fear of future interest rate increases. I doubt if any serious investor actually believes that the impact of a trade dispute between China and the US is going to change the cadence of free cash flow growth at Salesforce, and there is no sign of any global slowdown effecting macro IT spending growth.I think it is worth writing about this deal in some detail, not because it has made me a raging bull or bear on Salesforce. Despite the $6.5 billion consideration that Salesforce is paying, the transaction simply isn’t large enough in the context of a company like Salesforce with revenue expectations of almost $13 billion for this current fiscal year to have a significant impact. But I do think that the deal might highlight the investment merits of MULE’s closest peer, Talend (NASDAQ:TLND), and also highlights some changes in the valuation calculus for other higher growth names in the IT space.Writing in a positive vein about hyper-growth names in the wake of this past week’s stock market action may strike some readers as a fool’s errand at best and perverse at worst. But much of this article is concerned with trying to explain the merits of the MuleSoft acquisition and why similar acquisitions of other high-growth businesses can make sense. The one dimensional argument about valuation and the excesses of Salesforce in that respect are, I believe, based on stale bromides that do not stand up well to the light of careful investigation.I will let other commentators opine on the longer-term impact of Trump’s tariff announcement or the appointment of John Bolton - he of the bristly mustache - or signs of weakening global growth. I am not really sure how weakening global growth comports with a scenario of rising interest rates - but I suppose it makes for good filler for newspapers and blog writers.Personally, I think the policy behind the tariffs is terribly misguided and will not have a great deal of success - except perhaps politically. That said, the mercantilist policies of the Chinese and the form of state capitalism used by that country also present dangers to the world economy. But, ultimately, the impact of the tariff imbroglio on the outlook for Salesforce is going to be de minimis, in my opinion. Just for the record, the amount of business that Salesforce does with China is rather minimal; indeed, Salesforce revenues from the entire Asia/Pac region were less than 10% of total revenues last quarter, with Japan and Australia quite a bit larger than China as revenue drivers.My view is that despite the consideration paid by Salesforce, the MuleSoft transaction is the right deal at the right time for Salesforce. That said, it simply isn’t large enough to sway my investment conclusion reading the name. I think the transaction, as structured, enhances the outlook for CRM’s free cash flow by 4-5%/share going out 2 years. That isn’t quite enough for me to re-enter the name at this point.For those unfamiliar with the company, MuleSoft is one of the leading vendors of what are called application programming interfaces (APIs), technology that is used to… well, integrate applications. The company came public about a year ago - I have written about it twice and linked to my latest article here. MuleSoft is a subscription vendor, and 80% of its revenues come from recurring subscriptions. That said, not all of its solutions are sold for use in the cloud; there are plenty of on-premise applications that need to be integrated. While some observers think this is a negative in the transaction, I think that as Salesforce becomes a larger company, it needs to have at least some exposure to hybrid cloud architectures, and MULE solutions are perhaps a way of getting that exposure.This is not a new space, and there are literally dozens of solutions that attempt to provide users with the tools they need to link applications in a seamless fashion and to prepare data coming from many sources to be used by these stitched together applications. For years the giant in the space has been Informatica, now a private company. One of Informatica’s principle competitor has been Ascential, long owned by IBM (NYSE:IBM), while another major competitor is Dell’s (DVMT) Boomi, but there are numerous others as can be seen looking at the linked Gartner Magic Quadrant reports linked here.The market itself has been growing in the low double digits for some years now, and revenues are forecast to reach $13 billion + over the next four years in this linked study. That said, as I will try to show, the opportunity for Salesforce is actually greater than the TAM of the application integration space.The acquisition transaction has been structured as part cash and part stock. Each MuleSoft shareholder will get $36/share in cash and .0711 share of Salesforce stock. MuleSoft will have about 132 million fully diluted shares at the time this transaction closes - hence Salesforce will issue about 9.3 million shares to close the transaction. That is roughly 1% dilution as Salesforce has a currently forecast outstanding share count of 763 million. Overall, as I will attempt to portray, I think that this transaction will add about 4-5% to the free cash flow/share of Salesforce within the next couple of years. Not a game changer, and not enough to tempt me from the sidelines regarding an investment in Salesforce - but this transaction will ultimately be seen as a positive for Salesforce shareholders and confound current nay-sayers over the course of the next couple of years, I believe.MuleSoft's Valuation - The point of view, really depends on the point of viewMuleSoft shares weren’t considered cheap by most observers before the acquisition announcement - but MuleSoft has been one of the fastest growing companies in enterprise IT. There are simply not that many vendors of almost anything that are growing at 60%/year, which is the growth rate MULE achieved last quarter - an acceleration of growth when compared to prior quarters. That kind of growth is never going to come cheap, and it is hardly surprising that Salesforce had to pay a healthy premium As I look at it, the basic premium that was paid by Salesforce amounted to about 44% - compared to the price at which MULE shares traded at the start of March.Is that too much? I really do not think it is, but almost regardless of how one evaluates the raw numbers, the size of the transaction is such that it hardly matters in evaluating Salesforce shares.One should recognize that MuleSoft had recently forecast that it would achieve revenues of $1 billion by 2021. And given the company’s record of over attaining its sales forecast, that was probably a conservative expectation. When writers talk about valuation, their perspective seems to be fixated on historical rather than forward metrics. And their perspective is seemingly devoid of the recognition of sales synergies in this kind of deal. Of course, paying a notional 16X the revenues that were forecast by MuleSoft for the current year is expensive. But evaluating the transaction that way is really not particularly appropriate.Almost certainly, MULE’s internal plan would be for substantially greater growth than was guided during the most recent earnings release. Just as an example, about 80% of the company’s revenues come from subscriptions. It would be almost inconceivable to imagine that with that kind of revenue model, and the kind of bookings that were reported last quarter, that the company could possibly see flat sequential revenues in this current quarter which is the guidance it offered in its last conference call. It doesn’t work that way.And hence, the 16X EV/S metric cited by some really is one that needs to be discarded as a point of departure. The company actually said it would be growing by 35% compounded through 2021, a remarkable forecast, to say the least. There is simply no way that this company is going to grow at 35% this current year, and 35% in 2021 - again, in the real world, the numbers just do not work out that way.It should also be noted that MuleSoft, despite its lack of profitability, is already generating positive cash flow from operations. Most of the cash flow is a product of the rapid growth in deferred revenue balances which increased by $40 million last quarter in addition to the $89 million of reported revenues. It may not be the “traditional” way to calculate EV/S, but the level of deferred revenues that MuleSoft generated last quarter is inevitably a part of the calculus that ought to be used in determining whether this transaction makes sense for Salesforce.But even that doesn’t begin to encompass the economics of the transaction. These days, a principal strategy of Salesforce relates to the growth of its ecosystem. The company’s Platform and Other revenue bucket grew 37% year-on-year last quarter and reached a $2.1 billion annual run-rate. That was about 20% of revenues in this last quarter up from 18.5% of revenues in the year-earlier period, and it is the fastest growth rate of any of the buckets in which Salesforce reports revenue. Obviously, Salesforce has a strategic focus on augmenting its platform business - and at least at a high level, the application integration solution that is offered by MULE is very likely to augment the value of the Salesforce platform offering and to help Salesforce maintain the growth rate of that part of the business.At this point, Salesforce offers hundreds of applications through its AppExchange store. The ability to stitch some of these applications together using a MuleSoft API gateway is almost certain to have two notable impacts. One of these will be that MuleSoft revenues will rise beyond what has been projected by MULE as an independent vendor, simply because the MULE Anypoint Platform will be sold by Salesforce as part of its offering, dramatically broadening the distribution of the solution. Harder to quantify, but nonetheless a key part of the justification for the merger is that with Anypoint as part of the Salesforce offering, is the potential drag-along of other Salesforce AppEx offerings, a very profitable business for the company.I don’t purport to know the details of the quantification that was used by Salesforce to justify the acquisition and to win board approval for what might seem to be an expensive and dilutive transaction. And, I am sure that when Salesforce next reports, or when the transaction closes, the company will reduce current year EPS expectations to take account of some additional expenses in connection with the transaction. But again, the cost synergies that are likely when consolidating a company that is spending 64% of its revenues on sales and marketing are substantial. Even Salesforce, notorious for its sales and marketing spend, has managed to reduce its spend ratio for that expense to 48%.Summing up, I believe that the acquisition of MuleSoft is a positive for Salesforce. I think that within 4-6 quarters, it will be accretive to earnings, and that the valuation is far less than meets the eye. But overall, the transaction is really too small to move the needle for Salesforce. Even if MuleSoft winds up adding $1 billion + to run rate revenues for Salesforce at some point within the next 6-8 quarters, that will only be 5-6% of revenues of total Salesforce revenues by that time. That would be noticeable in the context of the likely top-line growth of Salesforce, but really not enough to change recommendations for most analysts. The transaction marginally enhances my propensity to acquire Salesforce shares, but it simply is not a show-stopper in terms of its overall impact.The most direct read-through from this transaction relates to MuleSoft’s most visible publicly traded competitor, Talend (TLND). I have written about Talend a couple of times since it went public in August of 2016. Will Talend get acquired? Will it get acquired for the kind of valuation that MuleSoft is achieving? What are its prospects as an independent company?Just to set the context, Talend shares are up by about 34% since they reached a trough during February’s stock market correction. Some of that move took place in the context of the stock market recovery after February's swoon. Another leg of the move took place in the wake of what was viewed as a strong earnings report that the company issued at almost the same time in mid-February. Talend’s share price reaction to the announcement of the MuleSoft transaction has been quite muted-less than 5%.I am not going to try to evaluate Talend’s offering vs. that of the MuleSoft solution set or its other competitors such as Informatica or even Alteryx (NYSE:AYX). For those interested in that kind of detail, I have linked here to one of many articles that tries to describe what the author describes as ""the end of the traditional enterprise integration market.” The article is well worth reading in terms of describing the ways in which both MULE and TLND are disrupting the market. On balance, the MuleSoft transaction is a signpost that illuminates some of the reasons why the data integration market as defined by MULE and TLND might be expected to burgeon in coming years.I have linked to a blog post by Ashley Stirrup, Talend’s Chief Marketing Officer. Yes, of course, it is a commercial - that is what is written by Chief Marketing Officer. That said, I think it is worth taking a look at in the context of the MuleSoft deal. It might be noted that Mr. Stirrup further segments the application integration market - but the point for investors is the commentary regarding the “Innovation Multiplier Effect.” The basic reason that MuleSoft sold for the multiple it did is self-evidently because of that phenomena, and Talend’s potential value in a takeout relates to the same phenomena.At the moment, and after its latest run, Talend shares sell at an EV/S of 6.3X. That is obviously a huge discount when compared to the EV/S of the MuleSoft transaction with an EV/S of 15.8. Part of that valuation differential is the notionally lower growth of Talend compared to MuleSoft - although how much of that is real and how much of that is simply an aspect of forecasting by each company cannot be readily be ascertained.Talend has been growing a bit more slowly than MULE on a headline basis. But, last quarter, Talend’s bookings growth accelerated materially - and while the company urges investors not to consider the bookings number as a forward indicator because of issues of duration, the jump in bookings this past quarter was so large as to suggest a very strong end of year trend in terms of sales execution. The company typically has seen more than a bit of Q4 seasonality based on early renewals and part of the bookings upside related to that phenomena.The other sales trends that the company did cite as leading indicators, dollar-based net retention rates, cloud sales, and sales to enterprises were strong enough such that the company significantly increased its guidance for this current fiscal year - the company has had struggles in achieving hiring goals more than in finding potential users for its solutions. Talend’s largest competitor, according to its CEO is not MuleSoft, actually, but Informatica. Informatica is trying to play catch-up in this space, and when it comes to applications involving Big Data and the Cloud, Talend can demonstrate a substantial functional advantage. Talend also competes, to some degree or the other, with AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT), but as is true in much of the enterprise software space, Talend is also a partner of both companies.Given all of the above, I think the point to consider is that Talend's growth potential, at least in terms of what an acquisitor might contemplate, is comparable to the growth potential that Salesforce has likely seen in making its bid for Mule. It is far higher than the current consensus forecast of 35% top-line growth for 2018. It really depends on the specific strategy and current product portfolio of a potential acquisitor as to what a reasonable level of sales growth might be for Talend as part of a larger organization.It would be more than a bit irresponsible for me to suggest I have any specific information regarding the probability of Talend being acquired. I don’t, and it is worth noting that the MULE transaction seemed to come together in a matter of weeks - that could well happen for Talend. It should be noted that in the past few months Talend has registered shares for two groups of VCs who originally helped finance the company. This does not necessarily mean that Talend will not get consolidated; VCs have liquidity and timing requirements, and it is not surprising to see these kinds of sales, even immediately before a consolidation event.Talend would offer a potential acquisitor the same kind of benefits - at least in a qualitative sense - that MuleSoft offers Salesforce. It might be worth noting that while Talend is headquartered in Redwood City, CA, it was founded as a French company, and it reports its financials using the IFRS standard. That might be significant in that one potential acquisitor of Talend could be SAP, a company whose “Applications Integration Format” is relatively old and quite limited.There are, I think, more than enough reasons to own Talend shares besides betting on a potential consolidation. Hot space, category leader, well-recognized brand, and the ability to take share from older companies such as Informatica and IBM. But I do think that, going forward, it would be reasonable to speculate that Talend could easily receive a bid at a substantial premium above current share prices - and that should be part of the evaluation of these shares.I am a growth stock investor and a growth stock analyst. Those are my predilections, and despite my financial background, I am not fixated on some inflexible valuation methodology that winds up producing poor results for investors. Of course, hyper-growth stocks are expensive - if one uses historical data or spurious forward growth rates to calculate value. On the other hand, the level of bid from Salesforce for MuleSoft is likely to have some lasting impact on valuations of many potential hyper-growth acquisitions. Inevitably, everyone from VCs to institutions to corporate managers will have read about the Salesforce bid at 16X forward revenues for MULE and will do the math with their own company. The results will be a significant mark-up of valuations required to induce sellers to sell and will serve as a starting point in most future discussions of potential acquisitions in the IT space.I am writing this section of my article on a Friday afternoon when bears have bolted out of their dens and made a hash, at least for the short term, of the level of share price valuations. I think after a couple of weeks of valuation compression, coming soon after a correction, it is fair to say that macro valuation factors, i.e. higher interest rates are having some impact. How far will this go? I haven’t any glib answer or track record of forecasting these kinds of trends. I will just leave it at that.But I think, in general, and in the wake of the MuleSoft transaction, smaller hyper-growth stories are going to continue to outperform shares of both larger, old-line IT vendors, which in turn are likely to outperform the market as a while. I am often asked how I can recommend the shares of XXXX given how expensive they are. My answer is that the valuation simply lies in the eyes of beholder. Many of the recent IPOs in the enterprise IT space that have been growing at rates well above 30% can provide major strategic benefits for acquisitors. Almost all of these newer ventures are disrupting competitors that have existed for years as leaders in their niche.The acquisition of MuleSoft may have set a new record, but it is hardly likely to be the last of these kinds of valuations. The leaders of most larger enterprise IT companies whether that want to publicly acknowledge the fact or not, have probably come to that conclusion. Basically, consolidation transactions have the potential to be hugely profitable for acquisitors, and because in some cases, buying highly valued disruptors is the only way older IT businesses can remain competitive.Just as a case in point that bears noting: SAP (SAP) has dominated the e-procurement space since it acquired Ariba in 2012. While there have been other competitors in the space, and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has had an offering of an e-procurement capability for many years, Ariba has been considered the dominant player in the space. A few years ago, a company called Coupa (NASDAQ:COUP) came along and started to significantly disrupt the space. Just how disruptive Coupa has proven to be can be best depicted by the linked article. I am not proposing that readers ought to run off and buy Coupa shares. I would prefer to reserve that discussion to a different article that might focus on some of the specifics of the company, and particularly its recent checkered operational performance. But the point is this: Coupa shares do not appear to be all that cheap as has been pointed out on this site. (The current EV/S ratio, using the consensus for sales is about 10.3X and that would certainly be expense for the forecasted growth of 23%. On the other hand, the forecasted growth number seems to be wildly at variance with last quarter's growth of 41% and last year's growth of just less than 40%, coupled with an increase of 40% in the deferred revenue balance of the past year.) But with the new paradigm in terms of valuation set by the MuleSoft acquisition, they look far cheaper now than has been the case in the past.I have no idea if Coupa might be bought or not. I do know that if it is bought, the price for an acquisition will be at a substantial premium, regardless of the current EV/S. Like most companies in its class, Coupa is cheaper than it might seem because of the huge build-up in deferred revenue balances which has already led the company to achieve positive cash flow in its latest reported quarter. And Coupa, as can be seen from the linked article, is busy disrupting SAP’s Ariba, and all of the other solutions that have been extant for some period of time.There are many potential acquisitors of Coupa that readily come to mind-even a vendor like Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) might decide that entering this space could play to its strengths in its emerging set of financial/planning applications. But the point isn’t to forecast that Coupa will get acquired, or to comment about its guidance which seems intended to be a sandbag. The point is that in the wake of the MuleSoft transaction, Coupa management is most likely to insist on higher valuations based on sales synergies, and potential acquisitors will simply have to pay the price or move on.’ And if an acquisitor has a particular strategic vision that involves spend management, the odds are that they will pay what might seem an incredible valuation - at the end of the day, Coupa’s enterprise value is small enough that it will not result in substantial dilution.The fact is that the emergence of Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, “codeless” applications, digital transformation and the like have substantially changed the calculus of the return on investment that users derive from their IT spend. Many older IT vendors are seeing their cash cows under attack by new, disruptive solutions from a large crop of emerging vendors. Some established vendors have made acquisitions to enter the cloud, at least with hybrid solutions. Others are looking to find ways of accelerating their transition.Potential business leaders of these hyper-growth enterprises are well aware that the market dynamics have shifted in their favor. Whether or not the next deal in which a hyper-growth company is consolidated gets done at 16X EV/S, or at 9X or some other number, I think the calculus has simply changed substantially, and that needs to be recognized as an element in valuing supposedly expensive businesses. The concept going forward is that buyers are going to have to recognize something far closer to the full value of sales synergies in their offers - at least if they want to execute transactions.One thing that a transaction the like of the MuleSoft acquisition can do is to make it far riskier to short supposedly highly valued hyper-growth names. While not all hyper-growth names have very high short interest ratios, most of them have been at least moderately targeted by short sellers on the theory that a high EV/S ratio would stand in the way of an acquisition done at a significant premium. The recognition, at least by the management of Salesforce, that the “high valuation” label is really misplaced when considering the potential revenue synergies can really change the calculus dramatically for short sellers.Short ratios of 12% as currently reported by Yahoo for both Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) and Alteryx are moderately high. Other hyper-growth names such as HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) and Pure (NYSE:PSTG) and Square (NYSE:SQ) with short interest ratio of 18%, 19%, and 16%, respectively, represent a middle ground. At the moment, the short interest ratio of 33% currently reported by Yahoo for Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) and the 44% short interest ratio reported for Ubiquiti ((UBNT) are the outliers within my coverage universe.I have put together a list of companies that I follow that might be thought to be analogs of MULE - not so much in that they are competitors or sell comparable solutions, but in that they are relatively small, are enjoying hyper-growth, and could well be attractive to strategic acquirers. The list is not meant to be exhaustive and will doubtless spark some controversy. And so far as it goes, not all of the names on the list are favorites of mine, or names in which I might invest. But the list might provide readers with room to speculate about how the new valuation paradigm as defined by the MuleSoft acquisition might impact names that otherwise would appear to some to have extended EV/S ratios. Obviously, not all of these companies will be bought, and certainly, not all of them will or are likely to command an EV/S of 16X, either now or even if they are consolidated. But it might suggest that the current down-trend of the last week or so might not continue for an extended period. Here then is the list:Obviously, just because these are companies that can screen as having similarities with MuleSoft is not sufficient reason to recommend them for purchase. Readers are strongly urged to look at other articles on these names, some of which I have written and others written by other Seeking Alpha contributors.But for what it is worth, I do think the valuation calculation calculus has changed on these names and that future acquisitions will be done with far more recognition given towards some realistic guestimate of revenue synergies than might heretofore have been the case."

Focusing on a few key catalysts, outside of generally positive market trends for enterprise cloud I see the growth by acquisitions strategy really paying off over the long term given their acquisition selectiveness, along with IoT and deal integration as key drivers of outperformance. For now, I’ve spoken with investors and it seems to me that their main concern is valuation; however, I struggle to see how the current valuation is relevant right now with 20%+ EBITDA growth, multiple acquisitions per year, and a management team that has a proven track record for execution whilst maintaining a leading market positionSource: MarTech TodayWhile there’s certainly a lot to discuss with CRM, I want to focus on some of the more big picture items that I believe will guide the stock over the long term. These items also directly refute the bear cases such as balance sheet weakness (which I find to be nonexistent) or quality dilution.Growth by Acquisitions - following the buyout of MuleSoft, I really think it can’t be understated how important this strategy is to the company. Are acquisitions expensive? Absolutely (CRM just paid 21x sales for MULE), but I think investors by now understand that given we’re nine years into the present equity bull market. Very few companies are both cheap and good businesses with huge growth potential, let alone clear synergistic benefits. While some people view this strategy as potentially dangerous, which I’ll get into, within software, you’re dealing with a market that is constantly evolving and every few years a new theme comes across the board and billions are spent towards reaching the initial progress points. The clear winner has been Salesforce in the CRM space because of the high volume of acquisitions they do. Already this year they’re made three acquisitions: MuleSoft, CloudCraze, and Attic Labs (they also divested Practice Fusion).This strategy certainly doesn’t work for every company and one of my major concerns with it revolves around the strength of the acquiring company’s balance sheet. I’m not alone in this concern, either. Taking a look at CRM’s balance sheet, we can see that the company has $3.5 billion in debt relative to LTM adjusted EBITDA of $2.30 billion. That means LTM leverage is 1.52x. That’s not an unreasonably high level of leverage and still leaves the company the ability to pursue M&A should the right opportunity present itself. With that being said, the street is projecting a large step up in adjusted EBITDA for the current fiscal year – to $2.9 billion in adjusted EBITDA because of the synergistic benefits of their various acquisitions made last year and this year so far. A 21% growth rate in adjusted EBITDA leads me to believe they can handle the high volume of deals every fiscal year and will continue to approach the financing of such in an intelligent manner. Leverage, in that view, is just 1.2x. MuleSoft was a cash and equity split ($36/share in cash and 0.0711 shares of CRM for each MULE), with $3 billion in committed debt financing.Source: Investor PresentationClosure of Multiple Deals – You’re probably wondering why there’s such optimistic expectations for near-term results, but the answer is simple: the high volume of acquisitions are beginning to pay off. The closing and integration of MuleSoft, their latest acquisition announced earlier this month with a purchase price of $6.5 billion, will add 3%+ revenue synergies and, once stripped of unnecessary costs, likely a 4-5% boost to EBITDA right off the bat. Some of the key stats behind MuleSoft are impressive and easily fit into Salesforce’s enterprise software. For example, a 119% dollar-based net retention rate and average customer subscription and support revenue up 30% YOY really says a lot about the business. However, the best statistic I’ve seen from this acquisition is that 60% of MuleSoft’s 1,200 customers overlap with Salesforce, allowing them to further their relationships with existing customers – that’s a strong bit of momentum.These are the kinds of items that I look for in acquisitions that will allow this company to beat on future earnings reports. The real strength to earnings generation over the next few years, proxied by adjusted EBITDA, is the sustainability of a double-digit growth rate and rapid integration into the core platforms. I believe this company has a significant amount of execution risk, certainly when they take on a $6.5 billion deal so early in the year; however, I have to give CRM the benefit of the doubt. After 15 acquisitions in 2016 and four more last year, the company has proven to investors before that it can execute when there are high stakes.Internet of Things – This is more of a medium to long-term passive catalyst until it isn’t. The reason I say it like that is because right now, the IoT market is in its infancy. There are very few high quality applications that are emblematic of IoT. The springboard to make this market all the more sizable is 5G. It’s at this point that I’d highly recommend reading the conference call transcripts and 10-Qs of the major U.S. telecoms to understand just how much progress U.S. carriers have made in trying to roll out 5G. The main update is that carriers are looking to roll out the initial 5G update on a national basis by the end of this year. Two leaders in the space are Verizon (VZ) and T-Mobile (TMUS); however, “true 5G,” that is the peak promised speeds and extremely low/virtually nonexistent latency won’t be available until at least 2023, as most industry reports suggest based upon the high level of investment spend required to place nodes and sensors on every street corner in the U.S.To keep the long-story short and not diverge from the point, Salesforce will be a major software provider when IoT begins to ramp up, but that’ll require investment spend to fund 5G (higher data capacity, lower latency, faster network speeds). It’s also worth noting here how the MuleSoft acquisition can help add scale to this theme for Salesforce. Mulesoft had its core segments in retail, healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services, with manufacturing being identified as one of the major beneficiaries (along with transportation) . More broadly however, I continue to see positive market research reports that describe double-digit CAGRs for IoT spending, namely in enterprise. While 5G developments are a step in the right direction to fully enable this tech, Salesforce is a direct beneficiary of this heightened spending, making it difficult to bet against. Eventually, coupled with their growth by acquisitions strategy, I expect the company to place itself in the correct verticals prior to the full ramp of IoT in the U.S. in order to properly capitalize on the major shift.Source: Investor PresentationI’m often asked what I think the valuation of certain stocks are and I think that sometimes investors get too weighed down by what they are paying for a particular stock because valuation isn’t as important when growth is leading the charge. In fact, it has been that way since the company has gone public in mid-2004. The best way I can explain this is with the 2019 estimates for the company. Right now, the market expects the company to post a step up in EBITDA margin from 9.43% last year to 10%+ this year, showing that the growth is high quality. If margins were being heavily diluted, I’d be concerned about the effectiveness of such a strategy and that perhaps the management team had execution issues. Yet, reality is quite the opposite as they’ve seen annual accretion to EBITDA margins. It’s also worth noting that equity screens won’t pick this name up because of the 60x+ P/E and other stretched multiples.Source: StockChartsIf you look at the headline valuation, the stock looks wildly expensive but it absolutely needs to be put in context. Their EV/EBITDA is 29.3x and while that’ll significantly improve this year, the competitor average is 22.6x – that’s significantly higher than the S&P 500 at 13.28x. The more important statistic to look at, if you’re really going to hone in on valuation, is where Salesforce’s multiples are in relation to their historical average with competitors. In that regard, Salesforce is either in line or a few percentage points below its historical average. That makes the stock actually attractive from a valuation perspective, in my opinion.I am encouraged by Salesforce’s appetite so far this year to be aggressive on the acquisition front. MuleSoft is an excellent acquisition and will help the company to solidify customer relationships, where the overlap with MuleSoft exists. Furthermore, I advise investors to look past the current valuation because 20% YOY EBITDA growth is worth buying into, especially when there are long-term tailwinds like IoT spending with the company already well-positioned in one of the most key sectors. I’d be looking to buy on any dip or negative reaction to an acquisition."

Yet, the San Francisco-based company continues to deliver  astounding results quarter after quarter.Credit: InvestorPlaceIn the most recent case, the all-around beat in fiscal 1Q19 was the largest as far back as I could trace (i.e., since early 2014 at least), with revenues beating consensus by $70 million and earnings topping analyst expectations by six cents per share. Over the past three years, Salesforce.com's revenues have nearly tripled, while adjusted earnings have basically quintupled.Given the impressive numbers, I wonder if it might be too late to buy gravity-defying shares at the current all-time peak.I have developed a taste for companies with a compelling product suite and a predictable subscription-based model that can help to simultaneously grow and smooth out both financial results and stock price - my most recent bullish call of such profile was Adobe Systems (ADBE). I am starting to see in CRM a similar opportunity, even if shares have appreciated 60% over the past 12 months and nearly 270% since mid-2013.In the case of Salesforce.com, I see growth opportunities in the company's smaller businesses (platform and marketing/commerce) that have been developing well and gaining scale, in addition to inorganic contribution from acquisitions like MuleSoft. As a result, I expect revenue growth to remain in the 24%-25% range for the next few years, in line with what the company has consistently delivered in the past three years (see first graph below). With the product portfolio developing further and subscription services accounting for nearly 100% of total revenues, I don't project top-line growth trending down at a noticeable pace any time soon.CRM Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsAs Salesforce.com gains scale, I also believe that SG&A will continue to decrease as a percentage of revenues (see first graph below), helping to create operating leverage.

However, past performance does not guarantee future returns, and valuation levels are clearly demanding at current prices.

The company offers customer relationship management (CRM) applications in areas such as sales force automation, customer service, marketing, document management, and analytics.The enterprise software industry is going through a major shift over the past several years, since many corporations of all sizes are moving toward the cloud and subscription-based services for all kinds of applications.Salesforce is a major driving force behind this trend and also one of the main beneficiaries from it. Back in 2009, the company was making $1.08 billion in revenue, and Wall Street analysts are currently expecting Salesforce to make $12.75 billion in sales in the current fiscal year.CRM data by YChartsThe most recent earnings report from Salesforce confirms that the business is firing on all cylinders, as the company has recently announced both earnings and sales numbers above Wall Street expectations.Revenue during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 amounted to $3.01 billion, growing by 25% year over year and increasing 22% in constant currency. Unearned revenue stands at $6.2 billion, up 25% year over year.Image source: SalesforceImportantly, revenue growth was quite healthy across the company's different products, which speaks well about Salesforce and its ability to continue delivering vigorous growth going forward.CRM is the fastest growing enterprise software segment. Management estimates that the total addressable market opportunity for Salesforce is currently worth $72 billion. More importantly, the size of such market opportunity is expected to increase to $123 billion by 2021.Image source: SalesforceAs long as management keeps playing its cards well and effectively capitalizing on its growth opportunities, it makes sense to expect sustained revenue growth from Salesforce over the coming years.On the other hand, Salesforce is aggressively investing for growth, and stock-based compensation is taking a considerable toll on profitability. GAAP operating margin amounted to 6.4% of revenue last quarter, a significant improvement of 322 basis points year over year, but still quite low by industry standards.Valuation is an important risk factor to consider. The table below shows forward price to earnings, price to sales, price to free cash flow and annual revenue growth over the past five years for Salesforce in comparison to other industry players such as Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP), Adobe (ADBE), and Intuit (INTU).Salesforce has crushed the competition in terms of revenue growth, so the company clearly deserves an above-average valuation. That said, current valuation levels don't offer any room for error. If there is any disappointment in financial performance down the road, the stock could be very vulnerable to the downside.In terms of price action, Salesforce is in a well-defined uptrend, and the stock is breaking above resistance in the area around $130 per share while making new historical highs after reporting earnings. If the stock can remain above the much important $130 level, this could open the door for further gains over the middle term. On the other hand, if there is a pullback in the coming days, the area around $125 per share is a key support level to watch.For investors who believe that the recently released earnings report from Salesforce will provide more upside fuel for the stock in the coming days, buying a short-term call option offers plenty of upside potential for a conveniently low capital commitment.For example, you can buy a call option with an expiration date on June 8, 2018, and a strike price of $125 for nearly $4.75 per contract. If Salesforce stock rises by 5% before the contract expiration date, investors in this contract can make a total return of 127.3% on their capital.However, this contract has only 9 days till expiration, so you need the stock to move rapidly in the right direction in order to make money. The breakeven stock price for this strategy is $129.75.Investors with a longer time horizon may want to consider buying a call option with a longer expiration date. As a reference, the call contract with an expiration date on January 18, 2019, is selling for $13.5 per contract.The maximum possible loss in this trade is the capital commitment of $1,350, and the strategy offers unlimited upside potential. In comparison to a short-term call contract, going for a longer expiration date carries a higher capital commitment, but you don't need to worry as much about the timing and the time decay.If you like the company but you don't like the price that much, selling puts is a smart alternative. For example, you can sell the put contract with an expiration date on June 22, 2018, and a strike price of $125 for $1.15 per contract.If the stock never pulls back to below $125 before expiration, then the put contract will expire worthless, and investors in this trade would be making an annualized return of nearly 14.1%. Conversely, if Salesforce stock falls below $125 by the expiration date, the put will be executed, and the investor will need to buy $100 shares of Salesforce at $125 per share.Since the main idea was buying the stock on a price correction to begin with, this doesn't sound like such a bad scenario at all."
4161088,85726,2018-04-04T18:12:51-04:00,"Conventional wisdom is that MuleSoft was a great asset, but Salesforce still overpaid.Here's why that may not exactly be true.Could the pullback in Salesforce shares be an opportunity?","Salesforce’s (CRM) acquisition of MuleSoft (MULE) is often seen by many as a fine strategic acquisition for Salesforce but at far too expensive of a price. Leaving aside MuleSoft’s strategic positioning in a new industry and potential first-mover advantages there, which I delve into in more detail in my marketplace service, The Fat Pitch Expedition, it may seem hard to justify the purchase price of nearly 22 times trailing sales (that’s sales, not earnings!).Still, MuleSoft is a very high-quality company with a product that could really form the underlying platform to link modern enterprise IT infrastructure and applications with the legacy resources of the past – which has been a huge, thorny problem for enterprise data scientists and CIOs.With Salesforce’s stock now down following the tech sell-off and the perception of an expensive acquisition (the most significant acquisition since Salesforce’s 2016 acquisition of Demandware), the question is: does Salesforce now become interesting? And also, why did MuleSoft sell (I think it probably did so somewhat reluctantly, but at that price, it would have been irresponsible not to).The recent S-4 outlining the process leading up to the deal, along with MuleSoft’s revised projections leading out to 2037 - that’s right, the next 20 years! – sheds some light on the issue. Still, even with those figures (which I’ll get into in a minute), MuleSoft's price seems fairly out of whack on a standalone basis.And that's likely why MuleSoft sold - Salesforce was clearly eager to pay up, especially after MuleSoft's strong Q4 earnings report. It is reported from the S-4 that Salesforce initially offered $38 per share in 50/50 cash and stock, but that MuleSoft insisted on $45 per share, and all cash. Salesforce caved on the price but was able to lower the allocation to 80% cash/20% stock. There was no other bidder, MuleSoft simply didn't think it was for sale, until Salesforce made them an offer they couldn't refuse. Perhaps Marc Benioff wasn't about to let MuleSoft slip through his fingers as LinkedIn did.As you can see, MuleSoft depicts robust growth through 2037. Goldman Sachs (GS) used these cash flow projections to come up with a DCF. Here are Goldman’s assumptions:Cost of capitalsource: Salesforce S-4, page You might be wondering why would Salesforce pay at the high end of Goldman’s estimated fair value … in 2021?The answer is two-fold. One, Salesforce obviously wanted the MuleSoft asset pretty badly. It’s entirely possible that Salesforce thought it better to buy MuleSoft’s integration technology before it could fall into the hands of a competitor, such as SAP (SAP), Oracle (ORCL), or perhaps even a large hyperscale cloud vendor.Of course, there could also be a different financial rationale, regarding the attach rate Salesforce can achieve, most via growing the top line at a faster rate while also limiting the need for an extra sales and marketing headcount. It's also possible that by going under Salesforce's umbrella, MuleSoft now carries less execution risk (and hence, a lower cost of equity) than it did prior, in Salesforce's eyes.A standalone MuleSoft might not have been worth nearly $6.5 billion in the public marketplace, but to Salesforce, it could very well justify that number, due to attach rate synergies.In 2017, MuleSoft grew its revenue 58% to $296.5 million, and on the recent conference call, the company did say that it was on track to reach $1 billion in revenue in 2021, for around a 35%-plus CAGR. That was why MuleSoft was already selling for as high a sales multiple as it was prior to the acquisition.But the company’s profitability is actually better than what it reports. That’s because the company gets paid in two ways: its core subscription for its Anypoint Platform (which is 80% of current revenues, or $237 million), and professional services and support, which is, essentially, a breakeven-to-loss-making operation that helps customers get set up with their subscription.And while the company’s overall gross margin was around 71.7% last quarter, the subscription gross margin is around 91.4%. Over time, subscriptions should scale faster, and, therefore, more revenue should drop to the bottom line.Last week, I gave some projections as to what MuleSoft would require in order to grow to $1 billion in 2021. In my somewhat unsophisticated projections, it seems as though MuleSoft would continue to post operating losses for the next few years (though I’m sure would still generate free cash flow due to upfront deferred revenue) given operating leverage but with continued investments in R&D and sales and marketing, with moderate G&A growth (I suspect the G&A would moderate after the bump up in 2017 due to the March 2017 IPO). Here’s a pretty rough income statement for standalone MuleSoft. Even with robust growth and sales leverage, I project continued GAAP losses until barely breaking even in 2021: Source: MuleSoft filings. Projections by authorAs it turned out, even that was too optimistic, as MuleSoft itself forecasts GAAP operating losses of negative ($91 million) in 2021, and free cash flow – stock based compensation of negative ($43 million)Now, MuleSoft claims it is chasing a $25-30 billion market, and that it was positioned to win a large chunk of that due to its positioning as the modern alternative to legacy point-to-point integration services. So, it’s possible the company could grow at a high rate for years, or even beat its estimates. If the company felt it could make the call for $1 billion in revenue by then, MuleSoft has a habit of topping guidance in its short life as a public company, so it’s possible the company could grow even faster and perhaps expand gross margins even faster, but I try to be somewhat reasonable and conservative in my projections.Attaching to Salesforce, however, could greatly decrease the need for heavy investments in sales and marketing and R&D, since there are likely a lot of cross-selling synergies with Salesforce’s large global salesforce.Salesforce incurred about $3.9 billion in sales and marketing last year, compared with MuleSoft’s $184 million. It’s entirely possible then, that Salesforce may be able to accelerate MuleSoft’s growth at least at MuleSoft’s guided growth rate (though perhaps even higher), while incurring essentially no incremental sales expense. There are also obviously potential G&A synergies and maybe R&D synergies as well, as each company has a similar microservices-based approach to software and middleware.Flattening out these costs over the four-year time frame yields a much different picture:Source: MuleSoft filings. Projections by authorThe only alterations I made were in drastically reducing sales and marketing as well as G&A – this is without altering the potential revenue synergies and the gross margin expansion that would come with it. The difference in 2021 is about $300 million in profit.In this scenario, Salesforce is only paying about 21 times 2021 operating earnings. I know you say “only!,” but that is much more reasonable given the strategic nature of the acquisition. In addition, if MuleSoft can keep growing over 20-25% beyond that (remember the company claims it is chasing a $25-30 billion market that is growing 25% at the moment, so $1 billion leaves considerable runway ahead of MuleSoft in the out years), I could see the company be valued at higher than that four years out.On the recent merger call Salesforce’s executive said of MuleSoft, and this was the key quote here:Time will tell, and Salesforce has now made it onto the Fat Pitch Expedition Watchlist worthy of deeper investigation, especially in the wake of the recent sell-off ."

The company announced the acquisition of MuleSoft (MULE) in order to give the company and its organic growth profile another boost by adding another potential great service to its current line-up. The transaction is certainly not cheap and furthermore will be dilutive at first for the company, but that does not seem to freak out investors.Salesforce.com continues to post >20% growth in a very steady way, which is a big achievement for a company of its size, as investors are more concerned about the company gaining and maintaining its leadership position, rather than posting big GAAP profits by now. If the company can over time post margins of 30% (typical for large software names) the valuation can still be justified, although this requires a lot of profitable growth as shares continue to price in great execution for years to come.Salesforce.com has reached an agreement to acquire MuleSoft in a rather large $6.5 billion deal. Marc Benioff is very pleased with the deal as the combination of both firms should result in improved flows of enterprise information across public and private clouds and increase the power of innovation. While this is not a small deal after all, it just shows how large the company has grown as Mr. Benioff did not even attend the conference call in which the deal was discussed.MuleSoft's solutions helps businesses integrate IT, applications, devices and data from a monolithic structure to a single place called the ¨Anypoint Platform¨ in which IT departments can simply plug in assets through an API. This kind of work used to be simplistic and labour intensive in the past, being real ¨donkey¨ work which has given MuleSoft its name. Having looked at the prospects for MuleSoft following the IPO and as recent as February of this year, I have been too cautious on two separate occasions. The acquisition by Salesforce.com makes me feel like a donkey myself as I failed to be an owner of the shares.Salesforce.com is very interested in the technology as the combination of both companies can accelerate digital information for both customer groups. Better data and faster decision making results in superior outcomes and eventual customer experiences, being key for companies to differentiate themselves these days. Investors in MuleSoft stand to receive $36 in cash and 0.0711 shares of Salesforce.com which values their holdings at $44.89 per share, representing a 36% premium over the unaffected share price.The deal results in great returns for those being allocated a few shares in the IPO of MuleSoft a year ago. Shares went public at $17 per share as investors have doubled their money ever since, although first day investors were never able to buy the shares at these levels as shares jumped to $25 on their opening day.The $6.5 billion valuation is certainly not cheap by any means, yet the real value has to come from the strategic partnership and integration, potentially resulting in great revenue synergies. Salesforce.com believes that the deal could bring in $415 million in sales this year (40% year on year), for a 15 times sales multiple! With 1,200 employees the company is quite efficient, bringing in $350,000 in sales per FTE.In comparison, Salesforce.com is a $12.65 billion revenue giant (on a forward basis) with revenues seen up 21% this coming year. The 29,000 workers on average generate over $435,000 in annual sales. The real benefit has to come from both improved customer service to existing customers of Salesforce.com, thereby essentially offering the services of MuleSoft (currently used by 1,200 customers) to Salesforce.com's customer count of more than 150,000. The deal makes that pro-forma sales will jump by 3%, as the strong growth profile of MuleSoft adds to the organic growth profile of the company as well.The actual premium offered by Salesforce.com amounts to roughly $11 per share, representing a roughly $1.5 billion premium offered to control the company. That is equivalent to roughly $2 per share in terms of Salesforce.com which has 757 million shares outstanding. That premium more or less corresponds to the value lost by shares of Salesforce.com in reaction to the deal. That said, a $2 move on a >$120 stock at the time of the deal announcement is no major move after all.Late February, Salesforce.com released its results for fiscal year 2018. Revenues were up 25% last year to $10.48 billion, as the company projected a 20-21% increase in sales in fiscal year 2019, which results in sales of $12.6-$12.65 billion, as the MuleSoft deal will push this number above the $13 billion mark.The company earned $1.35 per share in 2018, for earnings just shy of a billion. Important to realize is that these are so-called non-GAAP earnings. As always the gap with GAAP earnings is very large as GAAP earnings only totaled $0.17 per share. The pre-tax gap between both earnings methods amounts to $1.79 per share of which $1.36 per share is the result of stock-based compensation expense, which is a real expense to shareholders. That line item makes up three quarters of the $1.19 per share adjustment which pegs my realistic annual earnings at just $0.45-$0.50 per share, resulting in an earnings multiple which is not meaningful at all.While the company expects adjusted earnings to jump towards= $2.02-$2.04 per share this year (again, on a non-GAAP basis) reality is that GAAP earnings will be very limited again, seen at $0.61-$0.63 per share.Salesforce.com has 757 million shares outstanding which currently trade at $116 per share, representing $88 billion in value. Holding $4.5 billion in cash and equivalents, Salesforce.com operates with a net cash position of $2.8 billion, resulting in a $85 billion valuation of its operating assets ahead of the deal with Mulesoft, or at nearly 7 times forward sales. The deal with MuleSoft calls for the issuance of roughly $1.3 billion worth of shares, involving the issuance of roughly 11 million shares, for 1.5% dilution.The remaining $5 billion deal tag will be financed with current cash holdings and assumption of some debt, but nothing too worrying given the cash flow power of this company, in part driven by the continued issuance of shares to please its employees. This expense runs at $1.1 billion a year, equivalent to nearly $40k per worker.It is evident that the products offered by Salesforce.com are in great demand, as witnessed by the continued impressive growth. The deal with MuleSoft adds another chapter to this growth story as $13 billion in pro-forma sales is a huge number in the software industry. At this rate the company is on track to become a $100 billion business, as least in terms of its valuation, yet this is still relatively small as four or five technology names are actually competing to become the first trillion-dollar company.The narrative is that investors believe that it is more important to deliver on consistent growth and gain scale, and thereby an early mover advantage, rather than delivering on strong margins. This past growth has served investors well as the company was just a billion-dollar company in 2008, having increased sales by a factor of 13 times over the past decade, offset by ""just"" 50% dilution.Having posted real GAAP margins at around 10% in 2009, Salesforce.com actually posted GAAP losses in the years thereafter and is now delivering on very modest positive margins, although the deal with MuleSoft will be dilutive at first.Established software giants are able to fetch operating profit margins as high as 25%-35% and that's exactly the promise of Salesforce.com. If it could achieve margins of 30% that yields potential for operating earnings of $4 billion over time based on the current revenue base. In the absence of substantial interest payments and applying a low tax rate, this yields potential earnings power of $3.0-$3.5 billion, for real GAAP earnings of roughly $4 per share. It is exactly this potential which makes shares look appealing (to some) amidst a strong balance sheet and 20% topline sales growth, still translating into a elevated 25-30 times GAAP earnings multiple.For year 2022, Salesforce.com has set a $20 billion revenue target. That means sales have to increase by more than 50% again in the three-year period 2020-2022, implying a 15% compounded annual growth rate. A 30% margin (which might be too early by then) results in operating earnings of $6 billion and net earnings of $4.5 billion, for earnings of close to $6 per share. That means shares already trade at 20 times earnings potentially seen in 2022, assuming 50% cumulative revenue growth in the coming three years, as well as +25 points in operating margin expansion."
4158071,103373,2018-03-21T13:45:00-04:00,"Salesforce.com has announced that it will buy MuleSoft for $6.5 billion, or 21 times the latter's 2017 revenue.The company is willing to pay the premium because it will give them tremendous short-term and long-term gains from servicing on-premise infrastructure and conversions to cloud products.The acquisition could boost Salesforce.com's chances of achieving its $20 billion annual revenue goal for 2022.","Salesforce.com (CRM) announced yesterday that the company will be buying MuleSoft for an enterprise value of a whopping $6.5 billion, a 36% premium over Tuesday’s (March 20th) closing price. MuleSoft had reported an annual revenue of $296.46 million in 2017, which means Salesforce is buying them at nearly 21 times revenue.The reason why Salesforce is ready to pay such a premium is because for the last two consecutive years MuleSoft has posted above 50% growth, and things are indeed looking promising for MuleSoft.MuleSoft runs a platform that allows large enterprises to seamlessly work across multiple software applications, data and devices. As software kept developing at a fast pace, many large organizations suffered from not being able to keep up with that pace. A good example is enterprises that are still operating IT infrastructure in their own premises despite cloud infrastructure offering cost savings and other technology advancements.Legacy software and applications will always remain a headache, slowing things down for large companies. It’s an almost tangible pain point, and one that MuleSoft addresses through its AnyPoint Platform.What’s significant is that Mulesoft will bring its 1,200 customers, which include Coca-Cola (KO), Barclays (BCS), Unilever (UL), VMWare (VMW), GE (GE), Accenture (ACN), Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY), Cisco (CSCO), AT&T (ATT) and Mount Sinai. While Salesforce.com might already be counting many of them as its clients, MuleSoft’s platform’s ability to integrate disparate parts of a company’s IT infrastructure will give Salesforce.com access to tremendous amounts of data. The more data it gets its hands on, the better for its own CRM product lineup because products can be cross deployed for revenue gains.Apart from this, it also reduces the friction for new companies that are still not using Salesforce.com’s products due to legacy software issues. Clearly, MuleSoft opens up a lot of doors for Salesforce.com, while adding a potent capability to its arsenal. That’s exactly why Salesforce.com is more than ready to pay such a heavy premium to buy the company.CRM has set an ambitious target to reach $20 billion in revenues by 2022, which is certainly an achievable target, as I outlined in a recent article called A Compelling Reason To Invest In Salesforce.com. The addition of fast-growing MuleSoft revenues will certainly help the company over the next several years. The further cloud technology advances, the worse legacy infrastructure will become, and all those enterprise customers are going to need platforms that will reduce those integration issues and allow them to cut across on-premise and cloud properties, which Salesforce+MuleSoft will be in a perfect position to service.On the one side there are immediate gains to be made from adding a strong revenue growth engine, albeit minuscule at this point considering the company’s overall revenues. It will play a key role in keeping Salesforce.com's overall growth rates above the 20% level, which it needs to hit its 2022 target. On the other side, there’s a long-term horizon to keep servicing on-premise customers until they finally decide to move to the cloud, which is inevitable.Either way, it’s only going to help Salesforce.com get to $20 billion that much faster. As I iterated in the previous article:"
4158044,103480,2018-03-21T11:36:14-04:00,"Salesforce announced it is acquiring MuleSoft for $6.5 billion in cash and stock.MuleSoft's AnyPoint Platform is a good technical fit with Salesforce's growing PaaS offerings.However, the 36% premium to MuleSoft's closing price is hard to justify. In addition, Salesforce is paying a hefty 16x forward revenues for the company.The acquisition of MuleSoft is Salesforce's largest to date.","Market observers have long had one gripe against SaaS giant Salesforce.com (CRM): Its pattern of acquisitions was too unpredictable and usually too ambitious. When Reuters broke the news that Salesforce would be buying MuleSoft (MULE), it seems that Salesforce investors' worst fears came true.MuleSoft has been a public company for almost exactly one year - this acquisition comes more or less on the IPO's anniversary. The company went public at $17 a share last March and was received with plenty of enthusiasm, with shares quickly ascending to the mid and high $20s. Now, MuleSoft investors have an even bigger payout to be cheerful about. Salesforce offered MuleSoft a deal worth $6.5 billion, or $44.89 per share. The offer consists of $36 in cash and 0.0711 in Salesforce stock. The deal is expected to close within the next few months (sometime during Salesforce's second fiscal quarter, ending July 31), according to MuleSoft's press release.Salesforce stock, predictably, is taking a bit of a nosedive on the news:How should Salesforce investors react? Though I've been a long-time long on Salesforce, this mega deal gives me pause. Salesforce, as of its most recent quarter, had only $3.5 billion of net cash on its balance sheet ($5.2 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in debt), and is proposing to take on another $3 billion in debt to finance the cash portion of this acquisition. In my opinion the deal, as well as the heady premium, is a bit overreaching. At best, Salesforce is now a hold.Forget about the price tag for a moment. MuleSoft is actually a really smart buy for Salesforce. In recent quarters, Salesforce's flagship Sales Cloud application has seen slowing growth as the company continues to saturate. It has relied on its tertiary clouds - particularly its Platform business - to power the >20% revenue growth that the company has committed to.See below the product breakdown in Salesforce's most recent quarter:Figure 1. Salesforce product revenue breakdownSource: Salesforce investor relationsThe Salesforce Platform grew 37% y/y in Salesforce's Q4, vs. just 16% y/y growth in Sales Cloud. Clearly, Platform is a huge opportunity. MuleSoft will be absorbed into a new ""Salesforce Integration Cloud,"" which presumably will fit into the Platform business. MuleSoft guided to $405-$415 million in revenues for the coming fiscal year, so that adds about 20% lift to Salesforce Platform's ~$2 billion run rate - certainly a good source of growth.From Salesforce's perspective, mega-deals like this one are more or less necessary for Marc Benioff to hit the long-term revenue target of $20 billion by FY21-FY22, which implies sustaining a ~20% annual growth rate for each of the next four years.From a product standpoint, MuleSoft also is a great fit. AnyPoint Platform already was highly compatible with Salesforce's offerings, with API connections to Sales Cloud being one of the most visible use cases for MuleSoft (for the unfamiliar, MuleSoft's AnyPoint Platform connects cloud applications together via API).Salesforce has spent a great deal of time building out the Salesforce ecosystem with the growth of its AppExchange offerings for third-party applications and expanded toolkits in Lightning and Force.com to build custom extensions. Owning MuleSoft gives Salesforce a credible lever into being at the center of a customer's cloud presence - as AnyPoint Platform/Salesforce Integration Cloud will be the PaaS layer that sits beneath all of a customer's cloud applications and connects them.Salesforce is no longer content with being an app company with a few big hits (Sales Cloud, Marketing Cloud) - it wants to be the cloud company at the center of it all. In terms of achieving that goal, there was probably no better company to buy than MuleSoft.Unfortunately, this acquisition doesn't exist in a priceless vacuum, and Salesforce investors will essentially be footing the bill for Benioff's grand vision. Certainly this isn't Salesforce's first foray into mega-deals for large public companies, but this is Salesforce's largest acquisition by far.Salesforce typically does a dozen deals per year, but mostly for smaller startups and for ""acqui-hires."" Salesforce's $33 million acquisition of MetaMind comes to mind here. It's been quite some time, however, since the last mega-deal. Before this, Salesforce's largest acquisitions to date have been its $2.8 billion acquisition of Demandware in 2016 and its $2.5 billion acquisition of ExactTarget in 2013.This $6.5 billion deal for MuleSoft trumps them all. On the bright side, Salesforce does have a good track record of making brilliant acquisitions and integrating them well. Salesforce's $360 million acquisition for Steelbrick CPQ, for example, was a good play for adding highly coveted CPQ capabilities to Sales Cloud.But it's hard to say that Salesforce is paying a fair price for MuleSoft. The $44.89 per share represents a 36% premium to MuleSoft's pre-acquisition closing price. In addition, the $6.5 billion enterprise value paid for the deal represents 15.8x MuleSoft's forward revenue guidance of $405-$415 million.Such an elevated multiple is almost unheard of in the software sector. Greg Schott (MuleSoft's CEO) and the board must be patting themselves on the back. Eyebrows were already being raised when Oracle (ORCL) paid 11x revenues for Netsuite or when Salesforce paid 10x revenues for Demandware (both deals in 2016, the year of the mega-deal in the software space). But 16x revenues is off the charts.In addition, Salesforce will be shouldering $3 billion of new debt to pay for the cash portion of the acquisition. With its balance sheet showing just $3.5 billion in net cash as of its most recent quarter, it is essentially bringing down its net cash balance to nearly breakeven. Of course, Salesforce does generate fairly decent free cash flows, but one can't help but to feel that a lot of value is being lost for Salesforce investors in this deal.Salesforce-MuleSoft is an exciting product combination. This isn't a random acquisition to grab headlines and simply chase inorganic revenue growth - this deal is manifested in a clear, ambitious strategy to greatly enlarge Salesforce's cloud ecosystem and become the center of its customers' cloud platforms.Unfortunately, it seems that Salesforce was willing to pay a bit too much for the deal, as the 36% premium and 16x forward revenues would imply. I'm skeptical that, despite the deal's obvious merits, MuleSoft will add more value to Salesforce than the cash that's going out the door."
4157080,103373,2018-03-16T10:43:42-04:00,"Several factors such as a consolidating Customer Relationship Management software market and a strong leadership position make Salesforce.com a compelling buy.Ample precedence has been set in other technology segments to show that the company will keep growing stronger over time.Valuation is very high, but there is still opportunity for a positive return on your investment. Use a long-term horizon and watch for changes in industry dominance and growth rates.","There's literally no margin of safety for anyone in Salesforce.com (CRM) at this time, and yet I would still recommend a buy. There are several reasons for that, among which are:Let's explore some of these factors and see why CRM still makes a good buy despite its high valuation.If you've been following my consumer goods segment articles, you may have noticed that I give a lot of importance to companies with above-average operating margins that lead their respective markets in either the number one or number two position. For software companies, it essentially boils down to having a leadership position and a clear lead in market share over the second best player.If you set these as your criteria, only a handful of companies will come out on top of their respective segments, and Salesforce.com is the one in the CRM segment. The company exploited the cloud-based delivery model for enterprise software at a time when majors like Oracle (ORCL) were doing CD installations that often took months even with armies of on-site engineers deployed to client sites.Moreover, to disrupt Salesforce.com's business now is nearly impossible because the world is only just getting the hang of various cloud environments. Unless a new product is able to disrupt the industry by offering something better than cloud-based software on a subscription basis that is easily scalable, that's not going to happen anytime soon.Source: Company Annual FilingsOn the annual revenue growth front, Salesforce.com has never come below the 20% level since the company was founded. By aggressively leveraging a web application server over the Internet, Salesforce.com beat larger players like Siebel, Oracle, SAP (SAP), and Microsoft (MSFT) at their own game to capture the number one spot in the CRM market, a leadership position that remains unchallenged to this day. The company continues to forecast above 20% annual growth, with a 25% guidance for FY-18 and 20% to 21% for FY-19.The second aspect we're going to look at is how strong that leadership position really is. We've already seen that disruption, at least at this time, is unlikely and that the company managed to push giants like Microsoft and Oracle out of the way to get to the top. Now it's time to see what that signifies.The key to maintaining market leadership is to keep increasing the gap between number one and number two, and Salesforce.com is continually doing that. The top 4 companies in this segment only hold 36.1% of the total addressable market, of which, CRM holds a little over half. The rest is shared by several smaller niche companies, and we'll see why that's important.Source: Salesforce Investor Day PresentationTo explain why a heavy ""Others"" segment is great for the number one and number two players, we need to look no further than the cloud industry itself, specifically the Infrastructure as a Service segment.If you see the market share graph below, you'll notice that the top few are mostly gaining market share, while the rest of the group is losing it. There must be some reason why the ""Others"" (Rest of Market) category isn't able to withstand the top-down assault. What is it?Source: Synergy ResearchThe biggest reason is that, as the larger players achieved scale competing with each other, they kept transferring most of the cost benefits to their customers in order to stay competitive. That's a very hard game to play when you're a much smaller player with a much smaller customer base.As this scenario plays out, the smaller companies will either sell out to the bigger ones, keep innovating until they hit that disruptive jackpot or simply stay put in their niche, growing organically in what will most likely be a highly contained market.I believe that's going to happen in the CRM segment as well, where the top 4 hold just a little more than a third of the entire market. And the reasons that are going to happen are the same as the reasons why it's already happening in the IaaS market: more services being added, prices constantly being cut, continual improvements, greater efficiencies, and such factors will keep stretching the yawn between the big and the small.Eventually, the cream of the crop is going to grow healthier, leaving a reasonable yet small share of market for others to fight over.The story was the same with SaaS, where Microsoft's Office 365 rapidly scaled up to beat the top 3 SaaS products: Salesforce, Box, and Google for Business. It was the same with IaaS, where Amazon still has a stranglehold over the market ahead of Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). And it's going to be the same with Salesforce.com in the CRM segment.In any technology market that's not highly fragmented, you'll tend to see this pattern. Think search engines and operating systems, where Alphabet, Microsoft, and Apple (AAPL) preside over desktop and mobile ecosystems, leaving very little for the others to feed on.Source: StatCounterSource: StatCounterOr how about smartphones, where Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Apple, and a handful of Chinese manufacturers hold the lion's share of market?Source: IDCFor the foreseeable future, Salesforce.com will lead the CRM pack by a wide margin, followed by Oracle, SAP, and then Microsoft. Others will be forced to yield market share to these four.That brings us to the specifics.Source: Salesforce Investor Day PresentationIn terms of revenue, a 20% growth rate through 2022 should allow the company to hit its target of $20 billion by then. A more optimistic view puts that figure at or above $22 billion. The reason that's achievable is because a 20% growth rate is well below the average that the company has been posting for the past several years. I believe its goal is conservative, but it's always better to under-promise and over-deliver, especially when there's a highly valued stock at stake. That lets us segue into valuation.CRM PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsFrom a valuation standpoint, Salesforce.com's stock is most certainly over the top, as evidenced by the over-the-top price to sales ratio. Price to earnings would be an irrelevant multiple in this case because the company keeps spending huge amounts of money - often over 45% of revenue - towards sales and marketing. From that perspective, Salesforce.com is like Amazon (AMZN) and other companies that put cash flows and revenue growth before bottom line profitability.But even on a price to sales basis, CRM is valued higher than Oracle or even Microsoft. That's natural because market expectations are still very high based on past performance, which has been consistently strong since the company was founded. And I don't see that sentiment suddenly becoming unfashionable in the near future.What that means is, there is literally no margin of safety for an investor getting in at today's price. Even if the company achieves its goal of $20 billion in annual sales by 2022, the current market cap of $92 billion would mean the stock is trading at more than 4.5 times forward 2022 sales. That's still a high number.That said, we've seen enough evidence to suggest that the days of growth are far from being over, at least as long as the company can keep growing at above 20% every year. The fundamentals are strong and the management has proved itself time and again that growth can be achieved, even if the cost of that growth is extremely high.You could argue that the company isn't making any money and hasn't been for a really long time, and that would be true. You could also say it's a bubble waiting to pop, as many SA authors have argued about companies like Netflix (NFLX). But as long as CRM holds the number one position in its segment, keeps increasing the gap with the number two company and keeps growing at or near current levels, any investor is necessarily going to see positive return on their investment. And that's the same with Netflix, for that matter, as I highlighted in a recent article.My recommendation: Keep a long-term horizon, hold the stock as long as Salesforce.com remains at the top of the CRM industry and keeps growing annual revenues in double digits - which I believe will be for a very long time; and keep buying during market weakness, bad news, and price dips."

It recently released its fourth quarter results that continued to outpace market expectations. And there doesn't appear to be any slowdown in sight.For the fourth quarter of the year, Salesforce's revenue grew 21% over the year to $2.585 billion, above analyst projections of $2.81 billion. Adjusted EPS of $0.35 was also ahead of the market's expected earnings of $0.33 per share.By segment, subscription and support revenues grew 26% to $2.66 billion, and professional services and other revenues grew 7% to $196 million. During the quarter, deferred revenue rose 28% to $7.09 billion, ahead of the market's forecast of $6.7 billion. Its unbilled deferred revenue rose 48% over the year to $13.3 billion.Salesforce ended the year with revenues growing 25% to $10.48 billion. Subscription and support revenues grew 25% to $9.71 billion and professional services and other revenues grew 21% to $769 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.17, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $1.35 for the year.For the current year, Salesforce forecast revenues of $12.60-$12.65 billion with an adjusted EPS of $2.02-$2.04. The market was looking for revenues of $12.54 billion with an EPS of $1.74. Salesforce estimates to end the current quarter with revenues of $2.93-$2.94 billion and an EPS of $0.43-$0.44. The Street had forecast revenues of $2.9 billion with an EPS of $0.37 for the quarter.To continue to drive market expansion, Salesforce continued to enter into strategic tie-ups. Last quarter, it announced a tie-up with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) that will result in the integration of Google's G Suite and Analytics products with Salesforce's range of cloud-based CRM products. The partnership addresses a growing need among customers - to be able to see a holistic view across Salesforce's CRM systems and Analytics. As part of the tie-up, Google will offer a company wide promotion to give free G Suite licenses for up to one year to all Salesforce customers that are new to G Suite. Additionally, the integration of Salesforce with Google Analytics will allow joint customers to merge sales, marketing and advertising data stored in both systems.Earlier this year, Salesforce also strengthened its ties with IBM (NYSE:IBM). The expansion of the partnership will bring together IBM Cloud and Watson services with Salesforce Quip and Salesforce Service Cloud Einstein so that companies would be able to connect with their customers and collaborate more effectively. As a part of this agreement, the AI tools of both IBM and Salesforce will work together to build custom applications that can be embedded to Salesforce solutions. These apps will help increase the effectiveness of sales teams using the applications. Users will benefit from new AI-driven recommendations for next best actions and will be able to utilize personalized, customer-triggered interactions based on near real-time interactions.Earlier this year, Salesforce announced the acquisition Attic Labs, an open-source decentralized database. Attic Labs is known for its flagship product, Noms, that lets users replicate data and edit it offline on multiple machines. Noms is able to sync up the edits while versioning them so that edits don't destroy previous versions of data. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Salesforce plans to leverage Noms to extend collaboration capabilities on Quip, Salesforce's document collaboration platform.Today there's an unprecedented opportunity within SaaS. Salesforce already has built critical mass for its product and is now looking to expand its product and market base. The new capabilities that the Google Analytics integration will bring to it is one innovative method of this expansion. What other innovations does Salesforce have in mind? India, especially, is full of SaaS companies with entrepreneurs and investors looking for exits. Is Salesforce looking to acquire some companies in the Indian market?Its stock is trading at $116.25 with a market capitalization of $84 billion. It has been steadily climbing from the year low of $80.50 that it was trending at in March last year. It had climbed to a year high of $118.15 earlier last week."

Sales growth of 25% has remained consistently in the mid-20s range since 2014, underscoring the power of the company's subscription model. EPS of $0.35 topped consensus by a penny, arriving also 25% above year-ago levels.Credit: Company's earnings slidesCovering the company's earnings results each quarter feels like déjà vu. The financials and op metrics continue to improve slowly but surely. While sales cloud gains scale and is likely to reach a decelerating revenue growth stage (the segment was responsible for $3.6 billion of the company's total $10.5 billion in 2018 revenues), the smaller marketing and commerce cloud division picked up the slack and posted impressive growth rates of 45% for the year.On a non-GAAP basis, fiscal 2018 marked the expansion of op margins by another 130 bps YOY, following an 80 bp and 170 bps increase in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. And although GAAP opex as a percentage of revenues inched above the 70% mark again (see graph below, on the right), the minor spike seems consistent with the seasonal trend observed in fiscal 2017. All factored in, it looks like costs continue to be under control, even if SBC expenses are still a tad too rich for my (conservative and value-oriented) taste.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsWrapping up the financial highlights, cash flow moved up at a faster pace than revenues, as salesforce.com's (1) collections on unrealized revenues increased substantially YOY and (2) earnings continued to improve. On the balance sheet side, the company's bank account is stuffed with $4.5 billion in greenbacks compared to last year's $2.2 billion, indicating liquidity will not be a problem for this cash-rich software company.I have always been fearful of CRM due primarily to the stock's valuations. On a non-GAAP forward P/E ratio, shares are valued today at nearly 70x, a higher price tag than February 2017's 60x. See graph and table below.CRM PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsBut I have to admit that salesforce.com has a solid subscription-based business model that attracts me for the predictability of the SaaS revenues. Margins are moving in the right direction, and so is cash flow. Growth rates, although not stratospheric, have yet to slow down significantly because, in my view, the company's smaller businesses (platform and marketing/commerce) have been developing well and gaining scale.All taken into account, CRM might prove to be a good acquisition for investors looking for quality and stability, even if at a bit richer price than some might be comfortable paying on this stock."
4152158,103480,2018-03-01T06:09:17-05:00,"Salesforce posted a strong end to FY18, with fourth-quarter earnings that topped analyst consensus and FY19 guidance above expectations.The company's 24% y/y top-line growth showed barely any deceleration from 25% growth last quarter; the outlook also calls for robust 21% y/y growth in FY18.On top of beating analysts' pro forma earnings estimates, Salesforce also turned a positive GAAP quarter.Salesforce is also pointing to ~20% operating cash flow growth in FY19, implying that the company is trading at a very reasonable forward OCF multiple of 24x.Among SaaS stocks, Salesforce is one of the most modestly valued despite its consistently strong execution.","Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the world's largest pure-play SaaS company, has done it yet again. For much of the company's decade-long lifespan as a public entity, it has spun out quarter after quarter of earnings beats and guidance raises, shepherding the stock's measured yet steady rally from its post-recession lows to a high now of over $115. Yet despite the expansion in the stock price and amid a cry from some investors who criticize Salesforce for not generating enough GAAP profits yet, Salesforce's fundamentals have risen in tandem with its shares. Marc Benioff, the company's iconic CEO, has made clear that he isn't satisfied with leaving Salesforce at the $10 billion annual run rate it just crossed this quarter - he's already drawn a line in the sand for $20 billion.This means that Salesforce's growth isn't about to taper off anytime soon. Despite longstanding investor fears that Sales Cloud, the company's flagship product, will soon stop growing (it's already tapered down its growth to the mid-teens), Salesforce's platform and other tertiary clouds are becoming massive businesses in their own right. On the side, Salesforce also has a nascent pool of ""strategic investments"" in companies like Twilio (NASDAQ: TWLO) that it could eventually acquire. The possibilities for this cloud giant are still very much an open-ended game. As such, Salesforce is still spending nearly half of its revenues on sales and marketing to chase growth. You could argue that other mega-cap tech success stories followed the same kind of playbook; Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), for example, didn't generate the massive profit margins it does now until recently. Directly after its IPO a few years back, the company was still focused on user acquisition and content development; Mark Zuckerberg didn't care at all about the bottom line. The company executed far ahead of plan regardless and is now worth half a trillion dollars. While Salesforce isn't growing quite as fast as the social media giant, give it breathing room to achieve scale before hankering after profits.Despite consistent execution and a growth runway that seems to keep leading upward, Salesforce remains one of the reasonably valued stocks in the software sector at ~6.5x forward revenues, with advances in its stock price keeping pace with its revenue growth. In contrast, other large-cap cloud stocks like Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) and Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) hover around 10x revenues (a ~50% valuation premium to Salesforce), despite delivering about the same quality of execution. Salesforce is the cloud stock to keep in your portfolio for years and years. The company's agenda is massive and covers nearly every aspect of application software. Even if the company doesn't have much to show for it in GAAP profits, its growing cash flows can at least hold investors over. Salesforce is pointing to 20-21% OCF growth in FY19, implying a massive ~$3.3 billion in operating cash flows (a sizable 26% OCF margin). This also means the company's current enterprise value of $80.3 billion only values the company at about 24x FY19 OCF - a very reasonable multiple to pay for such a robust grower.Let's dive in deeper into Salesforce's Q4 results. One of the most useful ways to check in on the company's performance is to look at its growth by ""cloud"", as shown in the chart below:Figure 1. Salesforce Q4 growth by productSource: Salesforce earnings press releaseAs shown above, Sales Cloud really is tapering off - it grew just 16% y/y in the quarter to $931.8 million. CRM is one of the largest areas in software - there are typically more sales people, and thus more potential CRM users, than any other function in any business - but with Salesforce's multi-year #1 ranking in the CRM leaderboards, there's not much more ground left for Salesforce to cover. The company's other ""clouds,"" however, are pulling their weight. Service Cloud, the company's next-biggest offering (a software tool for service desk employees), grew 28% y/y to $789.3 million in revenues for the quarter, actually an acceleration over the 25% y/y growth it saw last quarter. Ditto for the Salesforce Platform, which grew 37% y/y and accelerated over 34% y/y growth last quarter. As the IT market tilts toward open networks and connected ecosystems, Salesforce's platform business can help to greatly extend its presence with developers tools and third-party applications. Marketing and Commerce Cloud also saw growth in the 30s, with revenues of $397.6 million growing 37% y/y.Salesforce has a strong track record for innovation, with major releases this year including the rollout of the Einstein AI feature. Even as Sales Cloud and other large, saturated products continue to taper off, Salesforce can be expected to replace that growth with something new.Adding in the company's professional services revenues, Salesforce generated total revenue of $2.851 billion in the quarter, up 24.3% y/y and surpassing analyst estimates for $2.811 billion (+22.5% y/y).What does frustrate some investors is the fact that Salesforce is only improving its operating margins at a snail's pace, while other similarly-sized cloud companies like Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) have already begun generating massive profits.As seen from the company's common-size income statement showing its expenses as a percentage of revenues, the major culprit for this is sales and marketing:Figure 2. Salesforce expense percentagesSource: Salesforce earnings press releaseSalesforce stubbornly held its sales and marketing expenditures flat at 48% of revenues, a huge proportion of its total revenue base. There are startups with much smaller revenues that are spending ~50%, usually by the time a company reaches Salesforce's scale, it's no longer spending this much on sales. As previously mentioned, however, Salesforce is focusing on growth. As long as the company continues to deliver positive revenue surprises and lifts its guidance every quarter, its sales dollars are being well spent. At any point in the future, Salesforce can start to crank down its sales spending to a normalized ~20-30% of revenues, ""freeing up"" 20 points of margin against the very small 2% net margin the company generates today. Expanding Salesforce's earnings margin from 2% to 22% would mean multiplying its net earnings by more than 10x. As ludicrous as this sounds, when a business is built on top of such high (74%) gross margins, it has this huge profit potential down the road.Meanwhile, as discussed, Salesforce is generating massive cash flows (due to upfront software billings generating cash flows in advance of being recognized as revenues and flowing to the bottom line). OCF grew 27% y/y in FY18 to $2.7 billion, and the company is expecting further 20-21% growth in FY19.On a bottom line perspective, it's not like Salesforce is out of whack with Wall Street estimates either. Salesforce's pro forma EPS of $0.35 beat consensus targets by a penny.Staying invested in Salesforce is one of the best ways to play the secular shift into a software-driven business world. The well-known mantra that ""software is eating the world"" is very much a reality, and it's specifically the SaaS giants like Salesforce that are entrenched in their markets and carry #1 Gartner rankings in a broad suite of products that are best positioned to capitalize on this growth. Long-term investors in Salesforce have enjoyed a stock that has routinely outperformed market indices year after year.Forget about the bottom line and Salesforce's astronomically high, meaningless P/E ratio for now. The company is choosing to invest into growth instead of delivering profits and dividends - and for a company that has so ambitiously laid out a plan to hit $20 billion in revenues by FY21-FY22 (implying sustained growth of ~20% for each of the next four years), its current 6.5x revenue multiple is cheap. Salesforce is the kind of growth stock that continues to execute against targets and outperform regardless of the rainy days in the market."

It’s above a ‘golden cross’ on its daily chart and is overbought on its weekly chart.","Salesforce.com (CRM) closed Monday at $116.65 up 14.1% year to date and up 13.9% from its Feb. 9 low of $102.37. The stock set its all-time intraday high of $116.80 on Monday, Feb. 26.Analysts expect Salesforce to earn 33 to 34 cents a share when they report earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, Feb. 28. The latest guidance from the company is a penny below this estimate. According to JP Morgan (JPM), ‘the pace of business at the company has reached its highest level in four years, and that the growth outlook at the company is the strongest it has been in three years’.Price targets among Wall Street analysts range from $120 to $132 versus my $121 risky level that should be tested on a positive reaction to earnings on Thursday or Friday.The Salesforce P/E ratio is difficult to analyze. A MarketWatch story published on Monday indicates that the stock is trading at a P/E of 85 for 2018 and 65 for next year. Nasdaq.com shows a P/E ratio of 434.62 for 2017. 262.79 estimated for 2018, 156.94 for 2019 and 107.62 for 2020. Therefore, I prefer to look at the daily and weekly charts.Courtesy of MetaStock XenithThe daily chart for Salesforce shows that the stock has been above a ‘golden cross’ since March 3, 2017 when the stock closed at $82.22. A ‘golden cross’ occurs when the 50-day simple moving average rises above the 200-day simple moving average and indicates that higher prices lie ahead. This bullish pattern was a reason to be long the stock for the last 52 weeks. Notice how the stock has tracked the 50-day simple moving average, now at $108.93.The horizontal lines show that shares of Salesforce are well above my annual pivot of $107.38 and its semiannual value level of $101.33.Courtesy of MetaStock XenithThe weekly chart for Salesforce is positive but overbought with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $111.59. The stock is well above its 200-week simple moving average, also known as the ‘reversion to the mean’ now at $76.36 which was last tested during the week of Feb. 12, 2016 when the average was $52.49. Buying the stock on weakness to the ‘reversion to the mean’ is a prudent strategy to buy shares long-term. The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading is projected to rise to 84.77 thus week up from 79.76 on Feb. 23 rising above the overbought threshold of 80.00.Given these charts and analysis, my trading strategy is to buy weakness to my annual pivot of $107.38 and to my semiannual value level of $101.33. Investors and traders who have been long this stock should reduce holdings on strength to my weekly risky level of $121.00."
4148097,101837,2018-02-19T10:00:11-05:00,"Salesforce announced recently the lofty goal of $60B revenue by 2034.CRM market potential is projected to be $82B by 2025 and growing at 12% annually.International expansion, innovation, and acquisitions will lead the way for future revenue growth.The current share price may seem overpriced but is irrelevant to long-term growth investors.","2034 is a really, really long time away. That doesn't stop Salesforce (CRM) from ambitiously shooting for $60 billion in revenue 16 years after it crosses over $10 billion. In a recent investor presentation, Salesforce CTO Parker Harris announced their plan to reach $20 billion by 2022, $40 billion by 2028, and $60 billion by 2034. This would require Salesforce to grow at an annual rate of around 12% for the next 16 years. On the positive side, it is currently averaging 25% year-over-year growth for the past three years. On the negative side, it's much harder to grow the larger you become aka accelerating at a decelerating rate. Have similar companies grown their revenue by 5 times over a similar time frame? Sure, see Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Has it been done often? No. How will Salesforce achieve its lofty revenue goal by 2034? Salesforce, like all companies, can grow its revenue through international market expansion, innovation, and acquisition.According to one market research and consulting firm, the CRM market potential was $26.3 billion in 2015 and is projected to be $81.9 billion by 2025, representing a 12% annual growth rate. Salesforce is around 18-20% market share in 2016 according to its own press release and other market reports. Also, multiple marketing reports are saying Salesforce is increasing its overall market share each year. For Salesforce to get to $60 billion in revenue by 2034, the entire CRM Market potential would have to be around $240 billion, given 25% market share. If the current 12% annual growth rate for the entire CRM market continued until 2034, the CRM market potential would be $228 billion. One legitimate question is whether the current CRM market growth rate can be sustained over 16 years. But if it can, it is within reason for Salesforce to reach $60 billion in revenue from just the CRM market alone.The easiest way Salesforce can reach $60 billion revenue is by continuing to expand into international markets. Salesforce currently has only 26% of its overall revenue from Europe and Asia Pacific, but they are the fastest growing regions. Salesforce grew prior year revenue by 27% and 33% in the APAC and EMEA regions compared to 25% company-wide revenue growth. International growth is highlighted this year by key customer signings such as BP (NYSE:BP) and Groupe PSA in Europe as well as National Australia Bank (OTCPK:NAUBF) and Hitachi in the APAC region. To keep pace with international revenue growth, Salesforce is also increasing their international hires. In the current fiscal year to date, 40% of new hires have been made outside US. Investors can expect international investment and growth to continue in the future if Salesforce wants to reach $60 billion revenue.It comes as no surprise the world's leading CRM company was named the #1 most innovative company in 2017 by Forbes. Key innovative products like Einstein and Lightning use artificial intelligence to make predictive analytics, highlighting how powerful Salesforce can be for its customers. Don't expect the artificial intelligence wave to stop anytime soon. Last September, Salesforce announced it's launching a $50 million fund to invest in start-ups employing artificial intelligence.Salesforce has also looked to grow its revenue inorganically via acquisitions. In 2016, Salesforce was a little acquisition crazy buying 13 companies for over $5 billion. The largest acquisition, DemandWare for $2.8 billion, has successfully been integrated into the Salesforce Commerce Cloud and helps acquire more retail customers. Acquisitions slowed down tremendously in 2017, but that doesn't stop them from being at the center of acquisition rumors like the numerous Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) rumors, for example. Most investors are probably thankful Salesforce hasn't yet bought Twitter, but don't be surprised if Salesforce doesn't return to making huge acquisitions in 2018 for future revenue growth.Some investors might think Salesforce is astronomically overpriced right now using traditional metrics like the P/E ratio. Investors also might not want to invest in a company that doesn't bring increasing revenue to the bottom line. These are probably the same investors that thought Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was ridiculously overpriced at one time too.Looking a bit more into the details, investors can see Salesforce operating margin is on the rise over the last few years, and it's even more visible when excluding research and development expenses. As a growth company, investors should be alright if the main reason why a company can't earn more money on the bottom line is because it is reinvesting it back into the business for more future growth. As shown in this fiscal year, as Salesforce's revenue continues to grow, they will eventually bring more of it to the bottom line. Long-term investors shouldn't worry about the current share price or where it might be in a year because if Salesforce can hit or come close to its $60 billion revenue target by 2034, the price will increase by multiples of its price today.Who actually knows if Salesforce will really get to $60 billion by 2034? Again, it has been done before by companies like Microsoft, so it is possible. The fact it is ambitiously announcing its goals so everyone can see and potentially question their progress against is great. Growth investors at the very least should have more confidence in Salesforce's management to continue to press forward with growth as the world's CRM leader through innovation, international market expansion and acquisition. 2034 is a long time away, but Salesforce is on track to be a good long-term investment."

Recall that immediately after Twilio's IPO in 2016, it was one of the most expensive stocks in software with its $70 share price, representing a ~15x forward revenue multiple. Since then, shares have been sentenced to the mid-$20s/low $30s range, where they now trade at a modest 5x forward revenues. Here's a look at the company's one-year chart below:TWLO data by YChartsYet, beyond the strong earnings quarter, which I covered in a prior article, there's one more catalyst that's providing an extra kick to Twilio's shares, perhaps even more responsible for the recent rally than its earnings numbers. And that enthusiasm is related to Salesforce's (NYSE: CRM) disclosure of a minority stake in Twilio, filed in a 13F SEC filing dated February 14 (the same day as Twilio's post-earnings pop) that shows that the original SaaS giant owns ~890k shares of Twilio. See the filing below:Figure 1. Salesforce 13F filingSource: SECHere's my quick take on the news: While such a disclosure invites acquisition chatter and is responsible for a good portion of the newfound enthusiasm in Twilio, the company is undervalued either standalone or as an acquisition target. I'm maintaining a $39 price target (6.5x EV/FY18 revenues) on Twilio and am long the company for its fundamental strengths. The possibility of a Salesforce buyout is just a cherry on top.Let's dive into the Salesforce news nevertheless. By no means is Salesforce's ownership of Twilio that substantial - its shares are currently worth about $29.3 million, a drop in the bucket against Salesforce's ~$3.6 billion cash balance and ~$80 billion market cap. It also represents ownership of only about ~1% of Twilio's ~93M shares outstanding and current $3.07 billion market cap.It's unclear when Salesforce acquired its Twilio stake, but Salesforce is probably not going to start gobbling up Twilio shares in a bid for control. For one, Salesforce isn't known for takeover attempts, and for another, hostile takeovers have been out of fashion in enterprise software ever since Oracle's (NASDAQ: ORCL) hostile bid for PeopleSoft spawned the creation of Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY), which is now much more successful in HCM than Oracle.But one thing is plainly evident: Salesforce's Twilio stake transcends a pure investment holding; it's also strategic. Salesforce's other holding listed in the 13F report - MongoDB (NASDAQ: MDB) is another hint in that regard. MongoDB, which went public last Fall, marketed itself as an ""Oracle killer"" - with its NoSQL databases providing more flexibility and agility for modern data architectures than standard Oracle relational database software. While Salesforce isn't a direct competitor in the database or IaaS realm against Oracle, it is a major competitor in SaaS - with both companies offering a CRM product called ""Sales Cloud,"" and competing in areas such as marketing automation.Twilio, which describes itself as playing in the Communications-Platform-as-a-Service (CPaaS) space, represents an interesting opportunity for Salesforce. While Salesforce has had a rivalry against Oracle in SaaS for a long time, the battle has yet to really begin in PaaS. And as Salesforce's flagship Sales Cloud begins to saturate and decelerate on growth, it becomes really important for Salesforce's PaaS offerings - consisting of Lightning, Force.com, and Salesforce Platform - to take the center stage on growth. Salesforce's ""Platform and Other"" segment generated 34% growth in the company's most recent quarter, far ahead of Sales Cloud's more muted 17% growth. If Salesforce wants to hit Marc Benioff's target of $20-$22 billion in revenues by 2021 (FY2022), it's going to have to invest more into its platform services. A bigger PaaS ecosystem, after all, drives deals across all layers of Salesforce's stack.The two companies have long played nice and maintained a technological partnership and interoperability. Obviously, Twilio, which specializes in integrations and app-building, has extended its capabilities into Salesforce applications, which allow Salesforce users to originate customer communications (message and voice) from within the Salesforce environment.But thus far, the partnership has largely focused on Twilio capabilities in Salesforce apps. In a potential Salesforce-Twilio tie-up, the game completely changes, with Salesforce now able to offer Twilio's out-of-the-box SMS and Voice capabilities to any app developers wanting to build on the Salesforce platform. This is something Salesforce doesn't currently have, nor is it a capability that Oracle has fully fleshed out - giving it a major differentiation piece against its largest rival in the PaaS battleground.Salesforce has also long been known to be acquisitive to achieve these kinds of ends - expanding its ever-growing product portfolio into a new area of software. It bought Steelbrick to add CPQ capabilities to its Sales Cloud (a poke against Oracle and SAP (NYSE: SAP); it bought Quip to add collaboration and counter Slack.But a Twilio acquisition would depart from Salesforce's usual M&A game in a couple ways. For starters, Salesforce usually buys private companies, and even its larger deals for companies like Steelbrick and Quip tend to be under $1 billion. But that's not to say that Twilio isn't out of the question. Twilio is certainly in Salesforce's price range - its market cap is only slightly north of $3 billion, and Salesforce currently has ~$3.6 billion in cash on its balance sheet (the majority of its acquisitions are cash-and-stock, anyway). A Twilio aqcuisition would follow in the mold of its 2016 buyout of Demandware, its only major public company transaction. It paid $2.8 billion for Demandware and forked over a 56% premium. And while the potential premium on Twilio is anyone's guess, a Twilio deal would certainly become Salesforce's largest acquisition to date.Salesforce has been rather quiet on the acquisition front lately in 2017-2018, particularly as the company puts the finishing touches on its $1.1 billion Salesforce Tower, which will not only become the company's new headquarters but also the tallest and most expensive building in San Francisco. A deal for Twilio could signal to the markets that Salesforce is back in business. Marc Benioff receives occasional criticism for being too lavish with acquisitions and not focusing enough on organic growth, but he's got a good reason for doing so - when its biggest competitor Oracle is doing deals like the $9.6 billion buyout of Netsuite, Salesforce needs to keep up.All this said, while it's too early to call out the probability of a Salesforce-Twilio deal happening, the combination certainly makes sense. Twilio would grant Salesforce the diversification away from its Sales Cloud concentration that it despearately seeks, as well as another huge cloud business growing at ~40% that it can use to hit its long-term scale targets.Also not to be discounted is the fact that both companies are San Francisco-based, with strong relationships across key figures on both sides, and plenty of mixed blood between the two cloud companies. Twilio, in fact, just hired a ten-year Salesforce veteran, Sara Varni, who was in charge of selling Sales Cloud to become its Chief Marketing Officer.Twilio investors are receiving a deluge of positive news after a drought that saw Twilio sink to all-time lows in the $20s. Remain long on this name and ride the enthusiasm; don't sell too soon."
4133214,70365,2017-12-21T09:18:58-05:00,"Salesforce.com, a leading CRM software provider, has experienced outstanding growth in recent years.Over the next four years, the company plans to double its current revenue to $20 billion to $22 billion annually.Based on my valuation models, the company's shares likely offer an investment opportunity with an above market rate of return.","In recent years, Salesforce.com's (CRM) shares have clearly outperformed the broader market. Based on my quick look at the company's fundamentals in the light of proven valuation techniques, I believe its extraordinary growth potential is still yet to materialize. Since its founding in 1999, Salesforce.com has become a leading provider of Customer Relationships Management applications and services, most of which are delivered through cloud and are accompanied by a broad range of complementary services such as marketing automation, digital commerce or community management. From 2006 onwards, the company has grown primarily through acquisitions. Today, around 90 percent of the company's revenue comes from subscription-based services.One of Salesforce's key strengths comes from internationally diversified abundant customer base which covers major cities all around the world. According to the company's latest investor presentation and quarterly SEC filing, Salesforce's revenue growth rate is approximately double the one of global CRM market and exposure to a single client has not exceeded five percent of total revenue. As can be seen in the output below, Salesforce also recently significantly expanded its highest-paying customer band from three $20M+ customers in 2014 to twenty-four $20M+ customers in 2018. Source: Salesforce Investor Presentation 2017Over the past few years, Salesforce has also successfully managed to gradually grow its market share to almost fifth of the whole global CRM market. Between 2009 and 2016, the company's market share went from 6.3 percent of the market to 18.1 percent while market shares' of Salesforce's major competitors in the field of enterprise software stagnated or shrunk. This testifies Salesforce's durable growth and clear competitive edge in the CRM market segment. Source: Salesforce Investor Presentation 2017In the light of Peter Lynch earnings line, a famous valuation technique that helped the legendary investor to achieve an annualized rate of return of 29 percent, the best 20-year return rate of any mutual fund in history, Salesforces' shares are currently very attractive. Using the Fast Graphs forecasting calculator with a default 27 percent free cash flow growth assumption, the company's intrinsic value per share by the end of FY2023 is forecasted to hit a $284 USD mark, which implies more than 20 percent total annualized rate of return upside potential.Source: Fastgraphs.comThis, however, is a very optimistic scenario as the company's free cash flow on GAAP basis is now still negligible. Using the revenue variation of popular Peter Lynch's earnings line for the projection of intrinsic per share values of the company with a 25 percent annual revenue growth assumption, 5 percent annual growth in the number of shares outstanding and an unchanged current trailing 12-month price-sales (P/S) ratio of approximately 7x, the company's intrinsic value per share by the end of 2020 is forecasted to reach $130 USD. Should the price-to-sales multiple rise to 11x, the company's intrinsic value, according to my model, could reach as much as $204 USD. With respect to the current share price, this implies an annualized rate of return potential from 8 to 25 percent in the following years.To sum up, I would say Salesforce is well-defined by its beta. Admittedly, it is not a typical S&P500 stock, but rather what I call a sentiment stock – it has a tendency to outperform the market when the market is bullish, but it will also likely underperform the market when the market is bleak. Assuming bulls will not leave the markets anytime soon, I believe Salesforce offers an exceptional opportunity for all long-term investors who are willing to exchange above-average risk for above-average returns.Author's note: To bring similar articles to your attention, please consider subscription of my SA feed by clicking on the ''Follow'' button at the top of this page.Disclaimer: Please note that this article has an informative purpose, expresses its author's opinion and do not constitute investment recommendation or advice.

Several large players are moving into the CRM space and a poorly diversified Salesforce could feel the competitive effects on its bottom line.We suggest that current shareholders sell the stock as our analysis shows that Salesforce is extremely overvalued and could suffer a large correction when the market momentum slows.Different models in our prospective analysis all generate a market price that is much lower than the current stock price.,"Article by Katie Montair, Erik Huckle, Madison Manley and Roscoe WellingtonSalesforce.com (CRM) is a market leader in customer relationship management software. Currently, they hold just around half of the industry’s market share and do not look like they will give away their leadership role easily due to high switching costs and their strong brand name. Even though there are high barriers to entry in this industry, there is also competition trying to eat away at Saleforce’s revenue numbers. The company’s fate will ultimately be tied to how it defends its core offering as they heavily rely on their flagship product which generates 93% of overall revenue.We are currently in a bull market which shows no signs of abatement. Salesforce has been able to ride the market enthusiasm with its peers and is currently priced $103/share at the time of the submission of this paper. This team’s analysis took into account the strong competitive position Salesforce currently is in, category competitors and the market among other variables. We ultimately determined that the stock was overpriced. Using a cash flow based valuation we arrived at a stock price of $11.39 with the abnormal earnings method yielding a price of $8.50The most difficult part of this valuation is predicting the future strategic prospects of Salesforce. The market believes the company has an extremely strong position that it will be able to maintain and expand on well into the future. Technology advances rapidly though and it is difficult to predict with certainty what the importance of CRM will be for businesses of the next decade and beyond. The better bet, we believe, is to short Salesforce and watch the company try to defend its one core offering from many large, motivated competitors.1.1 A brief introduction Salesforce (CRM) was founded in 1999 as a company specializing in software as a service (SAAS). SaaS is a fast emerging industry in which companies are able to provide application services to their customers without the substantial installation costs. Instead, customers simply pay for the service month-to-month (or year-to-year), can log in to the platform online, and access the system from anywhere at any time. Other ways the SaaS industry is helping their customers to reduce costs is by automatically updating the software and enabling their customers to spend less on in-house IT personnel. SaaS is also known as cloud-based customer relationship management. Customer relationship management encompasses the principles and practices a company follows when interacting with their customers, and are used to analyze, predict and enhance their customer’s performance.Salesforce has become the largest and most successful customer relationship management company in the world. Currently, the company provides services to over 150,000 customers, including (RED), Schneider Electric, T3 Advisors, DUFL, Farmers Insurance and American Express. Saleforce’s largest competitors include Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP. Salesforce currently around twice the market share of their closest competitor, and show no signs of slowing their growth. The company is sets apart from their competitors by providing Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Commerce Cloud, and platform as a service (PAAS) capabilities. These services allow Salesforce customers to sell faster, manage better, market more effectively, and manage merchandise more efficiently. Salesforce customers have the ability to completely customize their experience by purchasing only the cloud services they need for their particular business.When Salesforce had their IPO in 2004, the stock was trading at $11/share. Since then, stock prices have generally continued to increase and are currently selling just below $100/share. Investors and analysts are excited and optimistic about the future of Salesforce as the CRM industry continues to become more prevalent in today’s business world.1.2 Business model and corporate strategy Salesforce’s mission is to facilitate their customer’s connections with their customers through the use of technology. Ultimately, Salesforce provides software services to companies to manage their individualized customer relations and enhance their business processes. The services are sold to customers on a subscription basis and are sold either directly from Salesforce personnel or indirectly through the company’s established partnerships. Beyond providing cloud space, Salesforce provides additional professional services such as implementation, training, support, process mapping and project management. The services are offered under broad categories including sales, service, Salesforce Platform, and marketing. Salesforce technology and applications can be used to assess company data, customer preferences, marketing strategies, internal performance, etc. The available software services do not pertain to one specific industry, but instead are general offerings that can be customized by each user. Through the variety of applications Salesforce offers, the company is able to work across a variety of industries and customer bases.Management’s strategy includes increasing service offerings and products, expanding into new markets (i.e. artificial intelligence), reducing customer attrition, targeting specific markets for vertical integration and upselling to existing customers. Salesforce has become a leader in the CRM industry due to its product ease and convenience and customer satisfaction. The cloud based platform combines a customer’s information and operational data into one space, allowing companies to reduce time, effort and resources. Salesforce provides applications that apply to various markets and company sizes. The model is centered around providing services to companies that have massive and variable customer relationships that would be too complex and resource heavy for them to manage with purely internal resources.Salesforce employs a SaaS method of delivery for its services and products. With SaaS, Salesforce hosts the cloud from internal infrastructures secured by third parties and allows customers remote access to the data space. Along with making it easier for companies to manage their own customers and business processes, Salesforce strives to make it easier for companies to interact with its technology.1.3 Industry competitive analysis By using Porter’s five-force framework and Marketline research, one can begin to understand how the firm is positioned in the competitive environment.Threat of New Entrants - The customer relationship management industry has significant barriers for new entrants in terms of customer adoption. The software creation to manage customers is relatively straightforward and requires a team of software engineers. Convincing a company to adopt a new way to track its customers and organize sales data is an entirely new challenge. The lack of transferability of information to a new program keeps customers from moving to a new provider. Once Salesforce has a customer, it is extremely difficult for those customers to change providers because it would require completely uprooting their business and starting from a new program. This process creates a high barrier to entry makes the threat of new entrants low. Also, even if those customers were willing to move all of their data, the monetary costs to do so would be significant. This, again, is a barrier for new entrants because if customers aren’t willing to pay the shipping costs, new firms will not be able to get off the ground.Bargaining Power of Suppliers - Salesforce has tried to narrow the bargaining power of suppliers by purchasing ventures which add value to their platform. In a different sense of vertical integration, they have made a practice of pulling all new technology which would add value to their CRM software instead of paying an outside party a fee. Salesforce made a series of acquisitions based on that buying strategy in the last couple of years. In September 2016, the company acquired HeyWire, an enterprise messaging company. HeyWire became Salesforce LiveMessage after the acquisition which added a mobile messaging function into the Salesforce Service Cloud. SteelBrick was also acquired in FY2017 Steelbrick is a company which creates applications which focused on automating the process of closing deals. Several other acquisitions which added to the functionality of the overall platform rounded out the year. All of these acquisitions seek to bring in-house any valuing adding software which could be considered supplier resources. Salesforce had a comprehensive strategy to acquire a host of companies which could have demanded a price premium down the road for an essential service within Salesforce.[1]Threat of Substitutes - Salesforce.com also faces competition from internally developed applications, enterprise software vendors, and online service providers. These varied groups attack the Salesforce model at different entry points and stages by enabling users to develop software tools and products which allow businesses the ability to build new apps that run on the customer's' current infrastructure or as hosted services. Salesforce was a first mover in the customer relationship management space, but since has inspired many different types of substitutes due to the large profit margins associated with this type of software.Bargaining Power of Buyers - Many of the company's current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. Growing competition introduces pricing pressures in the cloud market. Customer data is difficult to retrieve from the Salesforce system though and switching costs remain high. There is potentially a price point, and switching software available, which would lower this switching cost considerably in the future.Industry Rivalry - Salesforce.com operates in the customer relationship management market, which is very competitive, rapidly changing and highly fragmented. The company primarily competes with vendors of packaged business software as well as companies offering enterprise apps, including CRM, collaboration and business intelligence software. Competitors also include cloud computing application development and service providers. The major competitors of the company include Callidus Software, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP. SAP will be the focus of the comparables analysis further on in this report. Several of the big competitors are much more diversified and have larger budgets which enable them to successfully challenge CRM. The massive amount of profits available in this area will only bring more competitors into this space.[2]1.4 Critical success factors Salesforce is unique on the street in that it posts little to no profit each quarter. Rather than driving growth in earnings per share each year, Salesforce invests in growing its workforce and its brand. Salesforce prides itself on the happiness of their employees. They refer to their employees as Ohana, or “family”, which sets the stage for the culture that they are working to build. By creating a culture of inclusiveness, they are setting themselves apart from their competitors because their employees are happier and work harder. Additionally, the brand they have created is one of the many reasons that their customers buy their products. By spending money to build a reputation of reliability, customers feel that they can trust the product. Arguably, if they did not have this culture they would not be as successful as they are today.Another critical success factor is one related to investment in new products. Investment dollars going to new products will help diversify risk away from the Salesforce flagship sales cloud product. This is because if they were to face strong competition from a competitor or the reputation of their sales cloud product were to be damaged in a way that significantly hurt their revenue from that product, the strength of these new investments would be essential for maintaining Salesforce’s success.Salesforce revenues are split into two primary segments: subscription and professional services. In fiscal 2016, subscription revenues equated roughly 93% of their overall revenues. Considering such a large portion of their business is driven by subscriptions, a metric that is critical for the success of salesforce is customer retention. If Salesforce fails to provide a high-quality product at scale, it will hurt them in two ways. First, current paying customers will decide the service does not warrant the high price tag and will abandon the service for a less expensive competitor. Even a small increase in attrition will have a large effect on future revenue projections. Secondly, a lower quality product will keep customers who are currently piloting a Salesforce product, from rolling it out to their entire company/team. Salesforce mentions that a “land and expand strategy” with regards to contracts is key to success, which means they must convert pilots into full blown rollouts.2.1 Management incentives There are a couple of business risks that may incentivize Salesforce management to manipulate sales numbers. First, Salesforce’s key competitors, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP, are all older, more established companies in the market. Although Salesforce has been able to earn the largest percentage of market share, these competitors still have greater resources, more diversified products that can be offered to their customers, larger customer bases, and a longer history and accompanying recognition in the industry. If Salesforce’s managers were to feel the pressure from this risk of losing too many customers to their competitors, they may have incentive to distort the reporting measures. Some of the ways they may wish to distort these numbers could be to overstate their revenues earned from operations or understate expenses related to delivering their products to customers.A second risk that may give management incentive to manipulate accounting numbers are their strategic investments. These strategic investments are on the balance and represent Salesforce’s purchasing of competitors and up-and-coming companies. There is a chance that these companies will not live up to Salesforce’s expectations, may operate at a loss, or may cost Salesforce a substantial amount of capital if they are unable to make the operations of these investments succeed in their company. When these strategic investments are purchased, Salesforce may not have all of the relevant data to properly value the investment. If this is the case, Salesforce records an “other than temporary impairment”, which permanently decreases the value of the investment. If Salesforce makes a particularly bad investment and feels the pressure to manipulate accounting numbers, they may do so by overstating the strategic investment on the balance sheet. This can be done by overstating the investment or understating the impairment.Although these risks exist for Salesforce, it is not likely that they will give into these incentives to manipulate earnings. The growth of the company and the continued increase in name recognition are likely stronger motivations for management to not damage the reputation they have worked to build in the industry.2.2 Qualitative and quantitative red flags One quantitative low accounting quality indicated on Salesforce’s financial statements pertains to the effective tax rate (ETR) and tax expenses reported in the past few years. The company uses deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for its method of income tax accounting. Over the past four years, Salesforce’s ETR has been extremely volatile due to use of valuation allowances affecting their deferred tax assets and liabilities. The ETR in 2014 was 35%, indicating an expense should have been incurred, although Salesforce reported a tax benefit. Deferred tax assets from an acquisition were used to offset the deferred tax liability. In 2015, the ETR shifted to -23%, though the company reported an income tax expense due to international profits. In 2016, the ETR jumped to 174% and fell to -608% in 2017. The extreme decline in Salesforce's most recent tax rate is due to valuation allowances from an acquisition and stock compensation, both of which provided an immense tax benefit. It seems as though Salesforce’s tax strategy results in an inconsistent ETR and tax provision year over year. This trend indicates a potential red flag for low accounting quality as this strategy may be largely attributable to management’s manipulation of accounting principles. The volatility of Salesforce’s ETR does not provide evidence for sustainable use of their tax benefits. Additionally, these changes between reported tax provision and benefit year over year are affecting their bottom line and may not be a strong indication of the company’s operational success but rather an indication of accounting flexibility.In 2017, Salesforce reported multiple acquisitions, which caused Salesforce’s goodwill to jump by 3.5 billion and double their prior year goodwill balance. Salesforce had similarly doubled its goodwill in 2014, reporting growth from 1.5 billion to 3 billion. This trend in goodwill may be a red flag as the growth does not seem natural. Goodwill, which has a strong potential to be misvalued or become impaired in the future, is Salesforce’s largest single-line asset recorded on the balance sheet. Furthermore, it is surprising that throughout their deals, at least since 2012, the company has recorded minimal to no impairment related to goodwill. Goodwill impairment is a normal and frequent cost of doing business. However, Salesforce’s acquisitions seem only to be growing its goodwill balance. It is possible that the dramatic increase in goodwill and lack of reported impairment could be indications of low accounting quality. Goodwill is a valuation metric that can be easily manipulated per accounting policies. By recognizing little to no impairment, the company could potentially be delaying their losses.2.3 Accounting flexibility and adjustments Revenue recognition is important for a software as a service (SAAS) model. We used SAP (NYSE:SAP) for a comparable as it is a recognized industry competitor for Salesforce. In the Salesforce 10K they call out revenue generation primarily through subscription fees for the core service with support being a secondary driver (which is included in the base price). Salesforce recognizes these revenue streams ratably over the contract term, beginning on the start date of each contract. Revenue is then recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer or on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts and ratably over the contract term for subscription professional services.[4] SAP conducts their own revenue recognition in a slightly different manner. They do recognize cloud subscriptions and support but as the services are performed as opposed to over time. Fixed fees for continuous access and cloud support are recognized ratably over the course of the contract. Software license revenue which has software development agreements are recognized by stage and percentage of completion and from the total estimated development cost. Finally another set of fees are based on actual transaction volumes within the service and those are recognized as the transaction occurs.[5]Property, plant and equipment depreciations vary widely between SAP and Salesforce. Both companies depreciate on a straight- line basis over the estimated useful lives of their assets. SAP has very nebulous depreciation terms which estimate the useful life of buildings at 25 to 50 years, office furniture at four to 20 years and information technology at three to five years. In contrast Salesforce estimates an average weighted useful life of building at 32 years (leased at 27), furniture and fixtures at five years, and computer equipment and software from three to nine years. SAP also has a line item for automobiles, which are presumably service vehicles, which are depreciated from four to five years. SAP also has a very vague depreciation of leasehold improvements which just says, “based on the term of the lease contract.”[6] By using smaller useful lives to depreciate assets, Salesforce is able to recognize greater depreciation costs year over year compared to SAP. Compared to SAP, Salesforce is able to leverage greater depreciation expense quicker which results in greater tax reduction in the current year.Leases are treated differently by SAP and Salesforce, which could be a direct reflection of the US and International accounting bodies. SAP is moving towards recognizing leases on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities. The 20-F mentions operating profit will most likely increase as as costs that were treated as rental expenses in the past are required to be recorded as interest expense. Salesforce is vague with categorizing leases. The first line in the Lease and Asset Obligations section says, “The Company categorizes leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases.”[7] An interesting addition to the Cash Flow Statement is line item on Salesforce terminating a lease for their main building in the process of buying it outright. The lease termination cost $36M and is listed right in operating activities.The German Corporate Governance code is well represented through the SAP 20-F. Share based compensation is meticulously laid out for each executive of the company. SAP follows IFRS 2 in regards to share based payments for their accounting practice. Under IFRS 2, SAP recognizes transactions in its financial statements, including transactions with employees or other parties to be settled in cash, other assets, or equity instruments of the entity. All charges are noted in the consolidated statements of changes in equity of SAP group. Salesforce recognizes stock-based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as their stock price increases, as they acquire more companies, as the hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. All expense are recording the the consolidated statement of operations.2.4 Measuring CSFs and the impact of accounting quality Salesforce expenses tell much of the story when measuring the critical success factors of workforce and brand. Workforce and brand can be measured using Selling, General and Administrative expenses because they show how much money Salesforce is willing to invest in building their customers’ perceptions of the company. Selling, General and Administrative has made up the majority of its expenses at $4.9B, or a whopping 59% of total revenues. To put this figure in perspective, Salesforce’s competitors Microsoft and Oracle have SG&A expenses at 36% and 30%. With this amount of investment in itself, Salesforce sets the street expectation on investing in building employee retention. In order to measure Salesforce’s investment in their brand, the Marketing and Sales expenses should be evaluated. This expense has continued to increase since 2015 and has remained around 50% of total revenues. This shows their commitment to investing in promoting their brand to existing and potential customers. If Salesforce is going to continue to create value for shareholders, it must continue to outpace the likes of Microsoft and Oracle in building their reputation and workforce.When measuring the success of their investments in new products, it is necessary to evaluate the product mixes and product growth. In the 10-K for the year ended Jan. 31, 2017, they break down revenues by service offering. This shows Salesforce’s commitment to properly invest in diversifying and growing products that generate revenues that can support their business if their main platform were longer a viable source of income. As Salesforce continues to grow and diversify, they will continue to maximize shareholder value.Growth in deferred revenue is critical to understanding customer retention. This is an indicator of a customer’s intentions to continue to use Salesforce’s products. This measure of deferred revenues can give a glimpse into the future of revenues, and therefore shows how well Salesforce is leveraging this critical success factor to create shareholder value. This would suggest that commitments from existing Salesforce customers are just as, if not more, important as earning the business of new customers when it comes to generating revenue for the firm. Overall, it appears that Salesforce is committed to retaining customers in order to maximize the value of the firm.3.1 Profitability Analysis - DuPont DisaggregationThe team utilized the dupont disaggregation method to in a first evaluation of ROE. Salesforce balance sheet from 2015-2017 was pulled from Yahoo Finance. The Dupont disaggregation approach breaks down ROE into three factors: Profit Margin, Asset Turnover and Financial Leverage.In all, Salesforce’s ROE performance over the last five years has been steadily increasing.The main driver behind ROE growth, according to the DuPont disaggregation, is profit margin. Many other technology companies have had a similar growth pattern. These companies have returned profits internally and reinvested in other parts of the company. Shareholder’s have also focused on different drivers of growth which has allowed leadership the ability to remain unprofitable for many years before eventually having a year in the black. The profit margin in the years surveyed, besides the most recent year recorded, has been negative, which generated a negative ROE. As soon as it reached a positive number, even though asset turnover and financial leverage remained unchanged, the ROE exhibited a dramatic positive uptick.Another driver, the financial leverage metric, is a high-level view of what a company is doing with shareholder’s equity. Two companies could be highly levered and have drastically different outlooks based on how the capital is deployed. For the purposes of this particular analysis we made sure leverage was consistent and not detracting away from the overall measure of ROE. In theory, Salesforce borrowing against the equity provided by shareholder’s should help the company to create new opportunities which lead to a better market position and increased earnings. Salesforce has actually decreased its leverage over the years, even though the number overall has stayed fairly consistent. The next section will delve more into net financial leverage and what the means for the alternative disaggregation method.3.2 Profitability Analysis - An Alternative DisaggregationUsing the alternative disaggregation approach to evaluate ROE can better specify the main drivers behind ROE performance. Salesforce’s balance sheet was recasted for five fiscal periods from 2013 to 2017, as shown in Table 1. The alternative disaggregation approach breaks down ROE into three factors: operating ROA, net financial leverage and spread.In all, Salesforce’s ROE performance over the last five years has been steadily increasing. In 2013, the company’s ROE was -11.41% and has increased to 2.06% most recently in 2017.The main drivers behind ROE performance year over year seems to be the the operating ROA and the net borrowing cost. Each year’s ROE is dependent upon the operating ROA, its magnitude and sign. When the operating ROA was negative throughout 2013 to 2016, the ROE was also negative. Conversely, as soon at the operating ROA reached the positive threshold in 2017 at 7.03%, the ROE was positive at 2.03%.Another main aspect of ROE performance is Salesforce’s net borrowing cost. The net borrowing cost is very volatile as a result of the company’s shifting effective tax rate, which has significantly, almost worryingly, fluctuated each year. In 2016, the ETR was 174%, resulting in a net borrowing cost of -51.16%. The ETR for 2017 was -608%, yielding a 32.61% in after tax net borrowing cost. The greater the net interest expense after tax, the greater net borrowing cost. Additionally, the greater fluctuation of net borrowing costs results in a larger deviation from operating ROA and subsequent larger spread.The net borrowing cost is a result of excess interest expense over interest income combined with its volatile effective tax rate. Salesforce’s ETR has continually become more volatile in nature, adding uncertainties about the company’s expense management and subsequently, ROE performance. Although large and negative ETRs may be beneficial for the company in the short term, the severe fluctuation between ETR year over year yields unexpected consequences, like volatility in ROE performance. In order for the company to yield higher ROE results, its net borrowing cost needs to be minimized to lessen the spread. Management could increase ROE performance by exhibiting better cost management pertaining to both tax and borrowing expenses. A major concern of the company is its stability and its potential inability to reach profits and maintain those levels year over year.3.3 Credit AnalysisLiquidity ratios are important for estimating Salesforce’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow to keep the short-term operations going. A useful ratio to evaluate their short-term liquidity is the current ratio because it indicates the amount of current assets available to cover obligations coming due. Figure 1 shows a detailed description of this calculation, but the current ratio for Salesforce is .826. This means that for every $1 of current liabilities they have $0.826 to cover that liability. It is worth noting that their current liabilities consist of accounts payable and deferred revenues, which will presumably be earned over time. If the calculation were to only include the accounts payable (the actual amount of cash that will likely be required to pay back their current liabilities), the ratio would be 3.422. This would fare much better for their ability to cover their short-term liabilities with their short-term assets.Solvency is an important measure because it tells investors how well the company can cover their long-term debts. When evaluating this long-term solvency, it is useful to look at the “long-term debt to shareholders’ equity ratio”. This will give a measure of Salesforce’s level of long-term debt in the capital structure. It can also give an indication of how levered the company is considered. Figure 2 gives a detailed calculation, but the ratio is .377. Generally, the higher the ratio, the riskier the company is in terms of solvency. For Salesforce, a ratio of .377 is not considered especially risky and does not show Salesforce to be highly levered.Coverage ratios are also a key part of evaluating the riskiness of a company. These ratios give the company’s ability to produce the cash flows required to cover principal and interest payments as they come due. A relevant ratio for Salesforce is the “cash from operations to total debt” because it will show their ability to generate additional cash to cover their debt payments as they are due. Figure 3 shows the calculation for this ratio, but the final ratio is .214. This ratio does not show that Salesforce would easily be able to cover their debts with the cash flow from their operations.Overall, Salesforce appears to be a moderately low risk investment in terms of their credit ratios. Their liquidity and solvency ratios indicate that they can cover their short-term liabilities and they are low risk in terms of non-current debt coverage. The biggest area of concern is their coverage ratio, which indicates that if they were required to use their cash flow from operations to pay their debts, they would not be able to do so.3.4 CSF AnalysisThe Salesforce brand and workforce are vital to the success of the company, and measuring this factor is done through the General and Administrative expenses and the Marketing and Sales expenses. Since 2015, these expenses have increased significantly. These selling and marketing expenses combined were $3.4B, $3.9B, and $4.9B in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. In those years, these expenses were 64%, 59% and 59% of the corresponding revenues. These numbers are extremely persuasive when evaluating the level of commitment that Salesforce has put into increasing their employee satisfaction and the external perception of their brand.The second critical success factor of investing in new products is measured with the revenues generated by each cloud service offering, according to their 10-K. While their flagship product (Sales Cloud) has grown 10% and 13% in the last two years, two of its newer offerings, Service Cloud and Marketing Cloud, have grown at much faster rates. Their Service Cloud has grown 38% and 28% and the Marketing Cloud revenues have grown 39% both years. Additionally, the percentage of revenues provided by the Sales Cloud (their primary service) has decreased from 2015 to 2017, indicating that more revenues have come from their other services. This kind of growth in revenues from their non-primary service is imperative in growing the diversity of their business.Finally, the critical success factor of customer retention is measured through their deferred revenues. In both 2016 and 2017, deferred revenue grew 29% above that of the previous year. This alone indicates that their customers are committing to staying with the company. Additionally, in 2016 total revenues grew 24% above the previous year and in 2017 this growth was 26%. The fact that deferred revenues are growing at a rate so much higher than total revenues shows that Salesforce has been able to retain their customers and convince them to commit to continuing to use their services. This ability is in line with their business model because their service is designed to help the customers’ businesses run more efficiently. If they were not doing this well, customers would not have the desire to continue using their service, and thus their deferred revenues would not be increasing quite so rapidly.4.1 Forecasting Condensed Financial StatementsBelow is our condensed income statement and balance sheet for Salesforce. We’ve arrived at these future projects through multiple assumptions with regards to revenue growth, cost of revenue and operating expenses. A detailed account of those assumptions is as follows:Revenue growth: Salesforce revenue is split into two primary buckets: subscription based and professional services based. Each revenue segment has significantly different growth rates. The subscription product is Salesforce’s flagship product which has been around for quite some time and has nearly reached market saturation. Therefore, revenue growth for this segment is lower. We’ve assumed a revenue growth rate of 24% for the next fiscal year slowing from there at the rate of 100 basis points per year. The professional services segment is newer, and has been growing at a much faster rate. We anticipate this to grow at 37% for the next fiscal year slowing from there at the rate of 100 basis points. Both of these are consistent with historical growth rates for each respective segment.Cost of revenue: The cost of revenue for the two different segments varies dramatically with the subscription service seeing gross margins of just under 80%. The professional services segment is not yet profitable with gross margins at -7%. We expect the costs for the subscription service to increase by 50 basis points annually and we expect the services segment to remain unprofitable over the next five years.Operating expenses: Much of the operating expenses for Salesforce has been in the form of sales and marketing. As the company is pressured to increase its earnings, it will be forced to reduce its sales and marketing spend. Currently sales and marketing make up 47%. We expect this to decrease by 100 basis points per year.Forward Looking Financial Ratios: Looking at the Long Term Debt to Shareholder Equity the current ratio is at 0.38. As we look at how this ratio trends over the next five years, we see it decrease by an average of 5% per year, down to 0.30 by 2022. The current ratio for salesforce however, remains relatively flat from its current position at 0.83 to 0.85 by the year 2022.In looking at our sensitivity analysis, we created an optimistic scenario by keeping the subscription revenues growing at a consistent pace, coupled with lowering the cost of the services revenue significantly (decrease by 10% per year). These are realistic changes in the assumptions as they could be caused by launching new subscription products and having a higher client to consultant ratio. The tweaked assumptions increased overall sales in 2022 by 10% from $23.7B to $26.5B. They had an even larger effect on gross profit which saw an increase of 17% from $16B to $19.4B.If we look at a pessimistic scenario of Salesforce projections, we could lower the growth rate of both revenue segments by a larger amount, which could be caused by both competitive and profitability pressures. By reducing them both by 250 basis points instead of 100, we see 2022 total revenue decline by 17% from $23.7B to $19.7B. We see an equivalent effect on gross profit as it drops by 17% going from $16B to $13.3B.4.2 Estimating Cost of Capital The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is an effective method for estimating the cost of equity, and is used by nearly 90% of corporate financial officers. CAPM is calculated as the risk-free rate + (market beta * market risk premium). When forecasting Salesforce’s cost of capital, we assumed a 2% risk-free rate, 5% market risk premium and used a beta of 1.5 to yield a cost of capital of 9.5%.There are other ways to calculate the cost of capital, one of which is the cost of debt. This measure can give a more accurate representation of the market rate of the debt instruments. This is calculated as the pre-tax borrowing rate for debt * (1 – tax rate). We will assume a pre-tax borrowing rate of 6% and a tax rate of 35%. This renders a cost of debt of 4%.The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) method is also an effective way to calculate the cost of capital. It weights the distributions expected to the equity and debt holders individually in order to give a more accurately weighted cost of capital. It is calculated as the (cost of debt * (market value of debt/market value of the firm)) + (cost of equity * (market value of equity / market value of the firm)). This is equal to: (4% * (1.55/9.05)) + (9.5% * (7.50/9.05)) = 9%.4.3 Cash Flow-based ValuationWhen calculating the cash flow based valuation for Salesforce, we arrived at share price of $11.39. This is significantly under the share price when Salesforce reported its latest 10K which at the time was approximately $79.10. When looking at our model, the current value is significantly weighted toward the terminal value of Salesforce. This is mostly due to the fact our model only goes out for five years and our net assets are decreasing in the short term due to much needed working capital. Our terminal value makes up 95% of our total value. Also, much of our valuation is determined by our cost of equity and long-term growth rate. We assumed a 9.5% cost of equity and a 5% growth rate. If we look at very optimistic scenario in which the long term growth rate for IT companies similar to Salesforce is more like 9%, then we see a share price much closer to what the actual trading price is (9% growth gives us $97.41 / share). If we dial the long term growth rate down to something closer to GDP in the 2% range, we see the share price settle in at $7 per share as the long term outlook for the company is not as exciting.4.4 Abnormal Earnings Model (AEM) ValuationIn valuing Salesforce using the Abnormal Earnings Model Valuation, we came up with an even lower share price than our cash flow based valuation, at $8.50 per share, much lower than the current valuation of $79.10. The major difference between this valuation method and the cash flow based valuation method is that nearly all of the value comes from the current book value of equity. When we look at our projections, our ‘Normal Earnings’ come in much higher than our forecasted earnings, creating negative residual income for years 2018 through 2022. This model is more sensitive to the cost of equity used for Salesforce, as opposed to the cash flow based valuation model, which is much more dependent on the long term growth assumption. Even by lowering the cost of equity assumption down to 5%, we still only arrive at a $10.61 per share price for Salesforce.4.5 Market Multiples-based ValuationThe market multiples-based method of valuation yields discrepancies in the value of Salesforce based on the performance measure applied. As seen in Table 2, the companies used to evaluate Salesforce were a few the company’s direct competitors: SAP, Oracle and Microsoft. The competitor’s price-to-book ratios multiplied by Salesforce’s book per share ratio was used to value Salesforce’s price per share. Typically, the price-to-earnings ratio is another used to value a company, however, Salesforce’s negative earnings per share resulted in an unreasonable, negative valuation when using the PE ratio.When using SAP and Oracle to value Salesforce, the resulting price per share for Salesforce conveyed the stock is highly overvalued. Salesforce’s stock price as of November 27th, 2017 was $106.67, though the valuation yielded stock prices of $56.57 and $42.57, for SAP and Oracle respectively. Microsoft yielded stock valuation of $106.31, almost the exact “current” price. There are some major discrepancies when using market multiples to value a company. Specifically, the difference between longevity and diversification among the companies used to evaluate Salesforce. No competitor is exactly the same as Salesforce (selling the same product mix, length of time on the market, business strategy etc.) making it extremely difficult to reasonably suggest the market multiples yield appropriate values for Salesforce. For instance, SAP, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) were founded in 1972, 1975, and 1977 respectively, while Salesforce was founded in 1999. Salesforce's competitors have over a 20 year advantage of established market share, supplier connections and customer bases. As a result, these competitors are not an exact match to approximate the value of Salesforce’s price per share, even though they share overlapping industries, because they all have been in the market longer.Furthermore, not each company sells the same product mix. Microsoft, which was the market multiple that resulted in closest valuation to Salesforce’s “current” stock price, is a vastly different corporation than Salesforce. The company is a leader in the information technology market, selling software, applications and hardware (computers, Xbox, etc) to name a few diverse product offerings. Additionally, Microsoft’s market capitalization is 653.425 billion. In comparison, Salesforce specializes in customer relationship management (CRM) applications only and its market capitalization is 76.491 billion. Microsoft can be compared to Salesforce as it offers Microsoft Dynamics CRM, a direct competitor to Salesforce’s CRM software. However, the market multiples valuation method does not only take into consideration Microsoft’s particular software platform, rather the company as a whole. This is compared to SAP or Oracle, who have more similar product offerings to Salesforce. Microsoft’s market multiple is most likely an unreasonable valuation metric and Salesforce’s stock seems to be overvalued.Based on the analysis conducted throughout this report, it is our recommendation to short Salesforce’s stock. The evidence from major factors such as accounting and financial performance and valuation metrics yields a company displays unstable performance and a stock that is currently overpriced. There were a few irregularities in Salesforce’s financial and accounting performance. As mentioned previously under the qualitative and quantitative accounting red flags, Salesforce has exhibited major inconsistencies with its effective tax rate and somewhat its goodwill valuation. These fluctuations and unstable trends suggest that the company does not have adequate control over its expense management and may be manipulating areas of its statements to improve its financial position. Another factor to consider in Salesforce’s financial state is its high financial leverage (total stockholder’s equity and liabilities divided by total stockholder’s equity). Each year the company’s financial leverage hovers above at least 230%, signaling a risky investment for investors. Salesforce has been taking on much more debt relative to its outstanding equity. Although this is not an indicator for poor company performance, it does add to the other related factors indicating a potential for short selling.Additionally, all of the valuation methods used to value Salesforce show that the company is currently significantly overvalued. Salesforce’s most recent stock price on November 27th, 2017 was $103.35. Cash flow based valuation yielded an appropriate stock price of $11.39 and the abnormal earnings method yielded a stock price of $8.50. The market multiples based valuation, resulted in stock prices (per competitor) that were more similar to the “current” price, however this method is highly unreliable. Even with substantial adjustments made to the cash flow based and abnormal earnings methods, Salesforce is largely still an overvalued company. In conclusion, it would be best to short sell this stock as it does not seem to represent its actual worth in the marketplace.Figure 1:Figure 2:Figure 3:Table 1:Table 2:"

Its revenues derive from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, from basic subscription fees and additional support; and (2) professional services such as process mapping, project management, and implementation services. As Raimo Lenschow, a Barclays analyst, says about Salesforce:Even though it's barely turned a profit, investors love Salesforce with a passion. So let's see what all the hubbub is about.Let's take a look at the revenue breakdown for its basic two revenue sources below, per its 10-Q:Source: Company 10-QAs we can see, from those two sources combined, Salesforce's cost of revenue ($714.5M) comprises about 26% of its total revenue ($2.678B). Its main subscription service segment is significantly more profitable than its professional services segment, with subscriptions bringing in 93% of all sales. Subscription's gross margin is about 78%.Its professional services segment - including services such as its Salesforce Architects, Expeditions, Experience Design, and Marketing Cloud Services - is a much smaller segment, making up about 7% of its total revenue. This segment is also significantly less profitable, with a gross margin of just 3.82%.If Salesforce cannot turn its services market into a higher-margin business, it may be better off spinning it off and focusing on higher margin business: its subscription service. Nevertheless, overall, revenues have been growing like a weed. Revenues are up nearly eleven thousand percent (!) TTM since going public in 2004.CRM Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsYet - troublesomely - its net income is no higher than it was back in 2004. Indeed, its TTM net income is correlated with its revenue to a correlation only of 0.44.At least it's no longer negatively correlated, as it was for a lengthy period a couple of years ago, as shown in the chart above.Why is net income so low? Net income is so low because both COGS and SG&A increase in tandem with its revenues. In fact, unlike the lacklustre correlation between revenue and net income, the correlation between revenue and SG&A (corr: 0.999) and revenue and COGS (corr: 0.999) is nearly perfect (0.999!).Based on that stagnant net income - stagnant all the way back to 2004 - without some operational cutbacks, it's hard to see how Salesforce will grow its profits in the future. Especially when, as of 2017, Salesforce already owns 18% of the CRM market.Source: DreamForce 2017 CRM Investor PresentationSo let's say, hypothetically, Salesforce meets its goal of growing its revenue to a whopping $120B by 2020.Source: DreamForce 2017 CRM Investor PresentationThe problem is, without serious operational changes, it would still fail to offer investors bottom line growth as, without changes, its total expenses would grow in tandem with its revenues. When can we expect its revenue to translate into profits? Salesforce expects to nearly double its revenues by 2022.Let's say that Salesforce grows revenues to $20B by 2022. What will change to ensure that revenue growth translates into improvements in its bottom line? To do so, it would need an improvement in gross profit margins - for example, cutting SG&A and COGS. Yet Salesforce already states that it expects no improvement in its high SG&A, which makes up 45%.Source: Company 10-QIn fact, marketing and sales already makes up 64% of its total operating expenses:Source: Company 10-QThat makes me wonder that whether, without such aggressive sales and marketing, they wouldn't in fact be able to keep up their thousands-of-percent revenue growth. And that means, to me, that they will struggle long into the future to turn that sales growth into improving investors' bottom line. The chart below, in my opinion, is rather revealing:CRM Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThis chart is revealing as it shows that, in tandem, total expenses increases near-perfectly with Salesforce's revenues. That means that Salesforce is unable - no matter how much it churns out growth in sales - to turn that growth into profit. Simply, the more it sells, the less profit it make as a percentage of revenue.Yet profitability is critical to a company's long-term success, the so-called ""money in the bank."" No business can survive for long without profitability.CRM Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsDisturbingly, Salesforce's 11K% sales growth has translated into a lower profit margin now than back in 2004.Another problem is the fact that the company has a long history of diluting the shareholder base. When a company issues additional shares, this reduces an existing investor's proportional ownership in that company. This is obviously a problem for current shareholders.Source: YCharts, author's emphasisThe charts above show that several similar companies - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) - have taken steps to reward shareholders with buybacks.Salesforce has been the outlier that continues to dilute shareholders.Think of it this way. Let's say you buy 1,000 shares of Salesforce today at ~$110, when Salesforce has ~720 million shares outstanding.Let's say, over the next ten years, Salesforce achieves the unbelievably challenging feat of doubling its revenue, and because Salesforce investors love revenue, the stock price reflects that. Your risk has paid off! But during that time, Salesforce has issued 50% more shares (as per the previous ten years), so now there are 1.080 billion shares outstanding.A valuation increase doesn't equal a share increase. We're rewarded on a per share basis. Holding all else constant: instead of your shares being worth $220 per share, because of the dilution, they're now worth $165 per share. Even though the company doubled revenue, it increased its share count by 50%. That means that revenue per share has increased from $13.78 to only $18.38, or a 33% improvement. Thus, because of dilution, your return will be muted.So, Instead of being worth $220,000, even though you made the correct directional call, now, simply because of management's decision to dilute those shares, they're only worth $165,000.Dilution is just one of the many risks that investors can face when they invest in a company, among risks like business risk, market risk, opportunity risk, inflationary risk, legislative risk. This risk - dilution risk - is one risk that a shareholder should attempt to avoid to limit his or her downside. You've been forewarned. Avoid investing in dilutive companies like Salesforce.Goodwill represents the premium a company pays to acquire another company over the estimated market value of assets. Goodwill can be, and often is, impaired, putting the shareholders at risk.Source: Company 10-QIt's good when a company has a lot of assets, yet not so good when these assets are inflated with goodwill. Comparing goodwill to total assets is a way to judge a company's use - or misuse - of goodwill. And for Salesforce, goodwill makes up nearly 42% of its total assets.Reviewing the quality of the company is only half the battle though. We also need to review the quality of the stock. At the moment, the EV/EBIT for Salesforce is 438.23 EV/EBIT. This translates into an earnings yield of just 0.23%. Compare that 20 basis points with the 200 basis points provided by a two-year t-bill. If its earnings yield is less than the risk free rate, in my opinion, it's not worth the excess risk of its shares.Compared to some of its competitors (and other companies in the software space), Salesforce is underperforming based on several metrics while being valued at a much higher multiple.Source: YCharts data & *=Seeking Alpha data, author's compilation.With a P/E of 11,177, investors are, in my opinion, paying far too much for each dollar of Salesforce's earnings, especially in light of more profitable, less expensive alternatives. And yes, I can anticipate the criticisms now:In my opinion, Salesforce is a company that's diluting its shares, that's goodwill makes up over 40% of its total assets, that's been unable to translate ~11K% of sales growth into virtually any bottom line growth. As such, I would caution investors against it. For investors interested in the CRM space, I would suggest to look instead to some of the more profitable companies listed above in the CRM space."

Information such as an individual patient's current weight, BMI, metabolic rate, medical history, kidney and liver function, and other diagnostics can be securely collected and stored using Salesforce's CRM. This kind of data is required to optimize costs and drive information logistics efficiency.Pharmaceutical companies are finding it more and more challenging to maximize profits due to increased competition brought about by digital technology. Competition thus has provided the impetus for healthcare, led by big pharma, to innovate in order to improve financial returns. Since CRM has become mainstay in business, a number of pharmaceutical companies have transformed their marketing approach by employing customer-centric models. In fact, about 75% of all pharmaceutical companies have already made some kind of CRM investment. As patients become more engaged, (over 85% of patients surveyed believed they were capable of making their own healthcare treatment decisions), pharmaceutical companies are adjusting their digital commercial models.Simply put, Salesforce meets the dynamic needs of the pharmaceutical industry, and adds value to companies. From employee engagement and productivity workshops and software to salesmanship training, the platform has evolved into a marketing powerhouse. Sales teams are the most important part of any pharmaceutical business. Healthcare needs a unified and cross-compatible system that can act as the main communication channel for sales and service. Major challenges faced by pharma are tighter regulatory constraints, pressure to find more efficient communication channels, and restricted physician access. Salesforce is highly responsive and customizable. Salesforce CRM tools provide key data feedback into the effectiveness of messaging, materials, sales tactics, and insights to medical reps on doctor prescribing behavior. Moreover, Salesforce successfully implements the customer-focused paradigm that is proving to be a cost-effective solution to tighter competition in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries.Merck (NYSE:MRK) has found the need to innovate more rapidly than ever before - and Salesforce is at the center of that innovation. According to Dorothea Wenzel, SVP of Global Business Franchise Fertility, ""Relationships between physicians and patients have become too technical. The personal element has gotten lost over time. This is where we see the clear potential of Salesforce to help facilitate this exchange again.""

In spite of the positive changes to the regulatory environment, pharma still faces some dynamic challenges. Some authors are starting to note that the upside for pharma is becoming more and more limited, and are avoiding investment in the sector. Market-wide fundamentals look sound for pharma, with increased spending in the U.S. in the pharmaceutical market expected to hit $1.4 trillion in 2019 (or a yearly growth rate of 7%). Trumpcare is expected to be positive for big pharma. But many pharmaceutical companies are fishing out of the same waters, sharing market niches, and running into walls of patent expiration and increasingly limited label expansion opportunities. Indeed, competitive pressures and the political environment have forced innovative patient-centric approaches to healthcare and big pharma. Merck has taken a position of leadership in implementing CRM, and more than three fourths of biotechnology is using CRM at some level. Strong Bio is suggesting investors need to take innovative measures to increase portfolio margins as well. CRM has been showing consistent profits in the range of 20-25%. Compare this to your pharma investment, and you'll likely be riding the trend upwards if you can get in on a downswing in price. CRM may therefore give the investor a longer lever on their pharma investment allocation, even though CRM is likely to be driven by, you guessed it, the need of big pharma to innovate rapidly."

The cost of an apartment at 432 Park makes little sense in terms of the functionality of having a roof over your head, a place to eat, and a view to look at. And then there is Salesforce (CRM). No one could possibly pretend that the shares are not very highly valued. They have been highly valued for years. For a variety of reasons, I do not hold them in my portfolio. But this remains one of the best software companies around, and finding cavils regarding the valuation of the shares is a pastime that is not highly remunerated.Should readers own Salesforce in their portfolio. Not if they imagine that a reprise of this year's performance is likely. The company is growing topline in the range of 22%-23%, currently. It is achieving a consistent but moderate improvement in profitability, mainly non-GAAP. Operating cash flow is rising by about 21%. Outstanding shares continue to increase at a rate of 6% a year. Operating cash flow per share, therefore, has risen 12% so far this year and that rate is not projected to increase. None of those are metrics that would support another share price increase of more than 50%. The EV/S using the current equivalent share count of 738 million and the company's forecast for fiscal 2019 revenues (starts 2/1/18) is about 5.9X.But the fact is that Salesforce is one of the more unparalleled growth engines at scale in the enterprise software space. And its profitability is rising, albeit modestly, particularly in the wake of what seem to have been some successful acquisitions about one year ago. And while stock based comp is quite high as a percentage of both revenues and cash flow, at least it is no longer rising as a percentage of those metrics.Institutional investors, the kind that own 88% of the outstanding shares of Salesforce, do so because it is a large liquid name that is showing positive operational trends. It appears to be relatively safe as an investment. It has a stable management that has been running the company for years now. Institutions have different screens for investing than you and me - and in particular there are simply not that many large enterprises with long term growth records that have the kind of liquidity available with CRM. In many ways, investing in CRM represents a very compelling choice when considering alternatives for these kinds of investors.There are individuals who like to invest alongside of institutions. I try to write articles on companies that might be appealing to individual investors. There can be divergence in the investment goals of institutions and individuals. To an extent, investing alongside of institutions has some specific benefits. For the most part, it is likely that doing so will cut down on portfolio volatility and perceived risk. While important considerations, there are other goals that can matter more to many investors including this writer.CRM is a great company in the sense that it has made itself the gold standard in key niches of its business. This link is a bit old but they data would show the same results for this year as was the case when it was published. It is a good company in managing its expenses. The promotions announced during the conference call suggest that the company is focused on optimizing its product strategy for growth. While I think investing in CRM is not likely to produce positive alpha over the next 12 months, I think that the company will continue to attain its operational objectives - one of which is now to continue to achieve 20% top line growth through its fiscal 2022 (ends 1/31/22).That said, I doubt that investing in CRM shares is going to produce positive alpha over the next year, although it is quite possible, that at a better entry point than today's share price, there will be a potential for positive alpha. There are likely to be better times to enter this name. If I had to rate it for retail investors, I would describe it as a strong hold.Salesforce announced the results of its fiscal Q3 a bit over a week ago. On balance, the quarter is best seen as fairly typical for this company. Modest beats across the board, tiny increases in guidance and a relatively muted share price reaction. Gushy analysts on the call, who are happy that there are no excuses necessary to make to their institutional clients. Investors expect lots from the operational performance of this company, and it has become an engine to deliver the operational performance expected by its shareholders.Perhaps the biggest takeaway from considering this past quarter, is that there are few takeaways. The revenue beat, when compared to this company's prior forecast was about 1% and that beat was mainly a factor of FX changes. For me, the biggest positive surprise was the strong 17% increases in what this company calls its sales cloud. The company achieved a 40% increase in revenue in its commerce cloud, all of it organic at this point. Overall, revenues rose by 23% in constant currency. Billings, excluding the substantial benefit from the acquisition of Demandware rose by 23%.The company saw a spike in its unbilled deferred revenue account which rose by 10.5% sequentially, one of the largest quarterly increases for that metric in several years. Unbilled deferred revenue obviously adds to the company's forward visibility and is probably one of the elements in the overall strength of the commentary of management during the conference call. The spike was attributed to deals that closed prior to expectations. Not to take anything from the Salesforce attainment, but the last quarter was a good quarter in which to sell large enterprise software deals. Many enterprise software companies have wound up closing deals at a higher rate than had been anticipated. Salesforce was certainly a metaphor for that trend.CRM achieved some noticeable improvements in its GAAP expense ratios although, for sure, this is a process and not a short - term event. Some interesting specific items included an improvement in services gross margins which improved from nil a year ago to almost 4% this past quarter. Sales and marketing expense fell from 46% to 44% and general and administrative cost fell from 11.5% to 10.1%. The research and development expense ratio was essentially flat at 14.7% this past quarter.Overall, operating expense fell from 72.5% of revenues to 69% of revenues. That is one of the more significant improvements in operating margins the company has been able to achieve and lead to a substantial increase in GAAP operating income which rose from nil to 4.3% of revenues in this past quarter. While CRM shares are far from what might reasonably considered as anything other than expensive, this trend is perhaps the most favorable indication of expense management I have ever seen at this company.The guidance that Salesforce provided was typically conservative and designed to be exceeded. The specifics included a non-GAAP EPS guide that was about $.01 below the prior consensus. The company obviously spent less than it had planned last quarter and is apparently determined to catch up. Color me skeptical about that. EPS is likely to be a noticeable beat compared to this forecast.The revenue guidance that was provided for this next quarter was about $30 million, or 1% higher than the company's prior projection. The company's deferred revenue growth guide was such as to even out the very strong performance in that metric of Q3. While the guide may be consistent with the company's statement regarding closing deals sooner than anticipated, Q4's, in a sales driven culture that is embraced by this company, will typically see substantial over-attainment. I would be surprised to see the growth in deferred revenue decline as forecast, and calculated bookings are not likely, therefore, to decline either.As mentioned, considering the company's results, it is apparent that operating expense spending was below its management's plan in Q3 - the primary cause for the noticeable margin expansion. The CFO suggested that the company would revert to prior trends with regards to spending and margin improvement, and hence what was an EPS guide down. The odds of it really happening that way are not very great - Q4 EPS will be far closer to the $.39 non-GAAP level the company attained this past quarter than to the $.32 - $.33 it is forecasting for this quarter.Looking back a little further, at the start of the current fiscal year, Salesforce has forecast that total revenues would rise by 22%-23%. The newest forecast is that revenue will rise by 24%. Earnings per share for the full year are now projected at about $1.33 which compares to $1.28 at the start of the fiscal year. The growth in deferred revenues on the balance sheet was probably consistent with prior full year expectations - although Salesforce does not forecast that metric for more than one quarter at a time. The growth in non-billed deferred revenue has clearly been significantly above expectations and relates to this company's success in closing larger, multi - year transactions as it becomes viewed as the ""go - to"" vendor in the horizontal spaces in which it competes.Part of the reason for the success of the shares in terms of valuation is that compared to most other hyper-growth companies - even at scale - Salesforce has offered investors lots of consistency, visibility and reliability. Those are themes that play well for most institutional investors - and come to that, many retail investors are fans of those tunes.Given the consistency of performance this company has achieved, it might be appropriate to look at some of the factors behind how Salesforce has been able to achieve those kind of results, quarter after quarter. Needless to say, sales execution is a principle element in the company's toolkit. Keith Block came to Salesforce from Oracle about 4 years ago and has certainly been a factor in the disciplined approach to sales recruiting and sales execution. The team of Block and company CEO Marc Benioff seem to work effectively in tandem.The company announced a new role for Bret Taylor who became the company's president and Chief Product Officer. And I think that the focus on product is one of the things that has enabled this company to continue to grow at 20%+ rates, even at its current scale.I am not going to detain readers by evaluating all of the company's clouds and its platforms and their different growth rates in any detail. As I mentioned earlier in this article, this company has continued to grow its sales cloud by a 16%-17% rate this past fiscal year - and the sales cloud at 36% of revenue is till the company's largest revenue source. I think the strength in the sales cloud has more than a little to do with the early adoption of Einstein which has the capability of changing the value proposition a CRM application that is resonating with many users.The company's smallest cloud, which is called Marketing and Commerce, and which is built around acquisitions including Demandware and ExactTarget as well as Krux and Quip probably has the most long-term growth potential. That set of solutions grew by 40% last quarter, all of it organic. Salesforce derives substantial synergies from being able to offer both sales automation, commerce and a social marketing experience in a single package. That has really been a significant part of the company's success in closing mega-deals of the kind that lead to this past quarter's spike in unbilled deferred revenueThe Salesforce Platform has continued to grow at rates above 30% for some time now and is currently producing 20% of the company's revenues. While there are many companies that offer a Platform as a Service (PAAS) solution these days, the product that is best known as the Force App Cloud has achieved a substantial mind share with developers because the company enjoys such a large market share in the CRM space. The Force is one of those things that is part of a virtuous cycle, i.e. developers use Force as because it provides them with a large cohort of CRM customers, and customers choose Salesforce in order to gain access to multiple products that were optimized to run on the CRM platform.I think in defining the reasons behind the sustainable growth of this company, a key explanation is that it has made its development bets wisely and perhaps fortuitously. Its focus on AI has been early and consistent and it has leveraged its platform capability as well as any other competitor in the IT space. I think when a company appoints a President who is really the Chief Product Officer, it speaks volumes as to just how important product strategy is for this company.At times, and in comments I have had on past articles, some observers have suggested that Salesforce only addresses 35% or 40% of the available application software market. And that is probably true. But the reason for the hyper-growth of this company is that its solutions, for the most part, address the high growth components of the application space. The portfolio is designed for sales synergies, but is also designed for rapid growth.People, a successful sales culture, and a focus on product strategy beyond the relying on just the ideas of the CEO is a recipe for several years of substantial growth.Analysts and investors are always concerned about competition and Salesforce has had to compete with Oracle since its birth. The fact is that this company jumped into the cloud far before that became de-riguer. All of its competitors are still struggling with transitions and the need to support on-premise and cloud functionality. If nothing else, CRM has sold itself into a role of a trusted advisor for many of its clients who have been willing to step up to spend $10's of millions/year with Salesforce. While that may sound like a commercial, and sometimes resonates that way on a conference call, in this particular case it is true.Rather than writing some pointed commentary about who is doing what to whom in this space, I have linked to the most recent Gartner study. I wouldn't describe the Gartner analysis as definitive - market research vendors seldom write that way. And readers can see that Gartner has a number of cautions in its evaluation of Salesforce. Overall, my reaction to the study is that it shows a glass 80% or more full but with some significant opportunities that are still available to Salesforce in some specific verticals.The basic CRM application is not one that readily lends itself to a moat or unique IP. Verticalization, a key strategy of this company over the years, does afford some differentiation and this company has focused on selling that as a significant piece of its go-to market strategy. I am sure readers who have used the Salesforce CRM app have wondered how the company could have built a franchise based on the core functionality of an elaborate spread sheet. These days of course, the spreadsheets are combined with predictive analytics, AI and machine learning to drive forecasts and to enhance decision support at enterprises. In addition, the CRM AppExchange offers users access to an amazing variety of functionality that constitutes a competitive moat.I am not going to try to say who has a better CRM solution since the definition as to what is better is very hazy at best. The Gartner chart has Salesforce in the pole position where it has resided for 9 years. It is far ahead of its competitors in the leader's quadrant. When the 2nd place position in the MQ is held by Pegasystems (PEGA), it would seem reasonable to suggest that competition and moats are not major factors in evaluating this company's growth potential or its ability to lead the market for the foreseeable future.At the end of the day, answering the question of who has the better product in the CRM space is really not possible. Microsoft has had some high visibility wins - some of which might be based on barter/alliances. Oracle has had its own share of success in migrating high profile users to its cloud based CRM stack. It is not feasible for this writer and would be hard to define except on a case by case basis, who has a ""better"" solution. Salesforce is spending development resources efficiently, in a focused fashion and is likely to continue to maintain its leadership position in its focus spaces into the future. Oracle could better save its advertising dollars that it spends on making unsubstantiated market share claims and use them more efficiently, rather than in trying to promote the notion that it is gaining market share in the CRM space.In the course of this last conference call, management talked about its goal of achieving $20 billion of revenues by fiscal 2022. In addition the CFO said he believed non-GAAP margins could reach the mid 30% range by then - or at some point in the foreseeable future. The company is just now starting pay corporate income taxes and it is difficult to forecast a tax rate 4 years from now. And of course the matter of growth in average shares is not an insignificant consideration, either.But all in, the based on conference call commentary, Salesforce could achieve operating income of as much as $7 billion by the end of fiscal 2022 . I expect corporate taxes for this company to be around 20% at that point, yielding net income of $5.6 billion. The company currently reports outstanding shares of 738 million including the conversion of its senior notes and employee stock award. Outstanding shares are growing around 5%/year. Using share growth of 4% through fiscal 2022 would results in outstanding shares of 863 million. So, all of that would imply EPS in fiscal 2022 of about $6.50.How much could the shares sell for in that scenario? Certainly 30X at a minimum, and probably more than that because of the qualitative attractions this company has for growth oriented institutional investors. The long and the short is, that in the most optimistic scenario, there is plenty of share price appreciation potential.It probably will not quite happen that way. Currently non-GAAP operating margins are running around 20% and they should rise by about 150+ basis points a year. So, probably a better guess for operating margins in fiscal 2022 might be 27%. And maybe corporate taxes will be 22%. Using those assumptions brings EPS to $5.10.The company is forecasting operating cash flow for this year of about $2.6 billion which compares to a current non-GAAP earnings forecast of $945 million. Most of the difference between cash flow and non-GAAP EPS relates to the increase in this company's deferred revenue balances. Assuming that the percentage difference between earnings and CFFO will narrow as this company continues to scale up, suggests cash flow from operations of perhaps $9 billion in fiscal 2022 using the high margin assumption or to $7 billion if percentage margin improvement remains stable. Free cash flow should be around $7.5 billion in the high margin assumption and about $5.5 billion using the lower margin assumption.I think using a free cash flow yield at that point of 5% is a reasonably conservative way of looking at valuation. That yields a share value of $174 at the top end of the range and about $127/share using what I might call the more likely expectation.I have reasonable confidence that Salesforce can achieve a 20% CAGR for the next 4 years. I think the more conservative expectations for growth in terms of margins is more likely. I really have nothing specific on which to base tax rate assumptions or weighted average shares other than the most recent trends.It doesn't take huge changes in assumptions to turn this analysis on its head. Most notably, what free cash flow yield is most likely 4 years from now. Are these kinds of potential returns adequate for growth stock investors? Maybe not. But they are probably adequate for the kinds of institutions that own and buy these shares. Salesforce is one of the more attractive and conservative ways to invest in a hyper-growth name. It may not produce noticeably positive alpha - but it is most likely to achieve stable, visible and relatively predictable results. And that may be enough for some individual investors."
4140292,102830,2018-01-25T18:56:18-05:00,"Continued growth in the Enterprise SaaS market has helped Salesforce grow its revenue by an average of 25% per year.Based on a two-stage discounted cash flow model, I expect 21% upside in the stock.Wall Street analysts are bullish and expect 9% upside.","Salesforce's (CRM) has had a great run. It's stock has increased 44% over the last year and 160% over the last 5 years. With that kind of increase, is the stock still reasonably valued? I believe it is. Below, I'll analyze the stock from 3 different perspectives, which includes historical Price/Sales multiples, a comparables analysis, and a two-stage discounted cash flow analysis. As you'll see, Salesforce is still a stock worth buying and has plenty of upside potential left.Salesforce is all about growth right now. Over the last 3 full fiscal years, revenue has grown by 106% (27% annual growth). Through the first 3 quarters of 2018, revenue has increased by 25%. I'd expect this trend to remain strong given Salesforce has successfully expanded into a number of fast-growing verticals to prop up long-term revenue growth potential, including analytics, application development, and the Internet of Things. Revenue growth hasn't equaled much in profits so far, but that's ok for now. This hasn't kept Salesforce from improving free cash flow year-over-year, which has begun to improve its net cash position. The only thing I don't like is the increasing share count (i.e., employee stock plan). That's very common for a growth company, but does dilute existing shareholders.Salesforce Price/Sales multiple has been pretty consistent going back to 2012, which is a good sign. There's one thing I really like looking at the chart below. You can see that Salesforce's stock increase has been a result of sales increases, so it's been completely tied to improving performance. This creates a chart that shows divergence between stock price and valuation multiples (I don't like seeing convergence unless the stock is significantly undervalued). I look at so many stocks where this is not the case and price increases have only been a result of valuation increases. It's reassuring that Salesforce is valued on the same multiple over the last couple of years and isn't testing all-time highs in terms of valuation.CRM data by YChartsThe key takeaway here is that Salesforce is reasonably valued. When Looking at the table below, I believe that Price/Sales relative to long-term growth rates and gross margins is the most important. Adobe Systems (ADBE) is probably the most relevant comparable. You can see that Salesforce's gross margins are 12.8% worse than Adobe, but Salesforce trades almost 40% cheaper in terms of Price/Sales. Comparing Salesforce to a more mature company like Microsoft (MSFT) also yields compelling results. Salesforce is growing twice the rate and has better margins.In this model, I assume that Salesforce grows revenue at 25% per year for the next 5 years and increases the a rate at which they turn revenue into free cash flow to 30% by 2022 (the average over the last 4 fiscal years was 16%). After the initial period of super-normal growth, I assume Salesforce continues to grow at a long-term rate of 3%. This is a very simplified model. Chances are, Salesforce will not continue to grow sales at a rate of 25% per year, but would likely grow at a rate greater than 3% for much longer than 5 years.Wall Street is bullish on Salesforce too. Out of the 45 analysts that cover the stock, 37 rate it as a buy (none rate it as a sell). That's a very high percentage (and rare) of analysts that see upside in a stock. The average price target is $122.49. Given the current price, that indicates more than 9% upside potential.Salesforce is a great stock to add to a growth-oriented portfolio. I particularly like the annual revenue growth, which I expect to continue at a high rate. Not only has Salesforce expanded to different verticals, but the SaaS market should continue to grow. This is because it remains a great way for enterprises to cut costs in IT infrastructure. Based on my analysis, Salesforce also trades at a reasonable valuation relative to historical Price/Sales multiples as well as peers. In the future I'd expect Salesforce to pull back development spend and become a cash flow machine. I believe my two-stage discounted cash analysis is conservative and shows 21% upside potential."

It is also likely that investors are cashing in on big gains.Salesforce which began as a CRM (customer relationship management) cloud solution has grown its business beyond its initial Sales Cloud. It now sells subscriptions and services on several additional clouds, including its Service Cloud, Sales Cloud, and its Platform(aka App Cloud.)(Source: Salesforce Q3 press release)In the Q3 earnings conference call, Salesforce revealed solid revenue growth beyond its flagship Sales Cloud (which grew at 16.8 percent) to its Service Cloud (25.1 percent y/y growth), Platform (33.6 percent y/y growth), and Marketing and Commerce Cloud (40 percent y/y growth.)More than 70% of Salesforce's business is with customers who use more than one Salesforce Cloud.Salesforce has leading edge products such as Einstein Analytics (artificial intelligence), Quip (a Salesforce subsidiary with next generation productivity apps), and a slew of add-on products such as its Industry Clouds for Health, Financial Services, and Communities as well as SteelBrick (configure, price, and quote software), Pardot (e-mail marketing), and LiveMessage among others. These are newish and represent $.31 of every dollar Salesforce earns.Salesforce also announced a partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in November which has not even begun to bear fruit. Through it, the companies will work together to bring Google Analytics, the same ones it uses for its successful ad business, to Salesforce customers. When integrated into Salesforce's products, Salesforce customers will have complete views of customer journeys on and offline, something that competitors like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (NYSE:SAP), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) aren't able to provide.On a call with investors last week, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said that ""We're on a path to exceed $20 billion faster than any enterprise software company in history.""Dreamforce, the company's user conference, drew more than 150,000 Salesforce enthusiasts (called Trailblazers) to San Francisco earlier this month. They engaged not only with Salesforce executives to learn firsthand about the company's portfolio of products, but they also attended workshops, showed off their certification badges to each other (they don't mean much at your kids' soccer game, but they do within user communities), and were inspired by celebrities like Ashton Kutcher, Natalie Portman, will.i.am, the Bush twins, and former first lady Michelle Obama. Who wouldn't want to be part of that club? Belonging is important to millennials, and they will soon be making software buying decisions.This is a generation of buyers who value the recommendations of their peers, they don't download white papers like older executives did.Salesforce introduced new learning pathways and programs on Trailhead for its Trailblazers (Salesforce users.) More than 450,000 have signed up to learn how to develop applications on and use the Salesforce platform. This is a group of users that collects badges, certifications, and builds careers as they learn. Not only can they make Salesforce look good in their workplaces, but their livelihoods are invested in the success of Salesforce where they work.Salesforce has identified its next generation of leaders.

The results, however, failed to spark share price momentum at first glance.

Revenues of $2.68 topped consensus by a decent $30 million, although about two percentage points of FX tailwind not seen last quarter seems to have played a key role in the top-line beat. Growth in deferred revenues and off-balance sheet contracts, none of which shows up in the P&L, remained at least as robust as last quarter's comparable metrics, which I find encouraging as the sales pipeline continues to look healthy.An important topic in my view, but perhaps not as much in the eyes of pure growth investors, is the company's management of operating expenses. For the first time as far back as I can trace, GAAP ""recurring"" opex (i.e. selling, R&D and G&A costs including share-based compensation) dipped below 70% of total revenues (see chart below). While I find the ratio still very rich, it shows that the company might be heading in the direction of delivering my expected 10% of GAAP op margins by fiscal 2022.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsPerhaps helping to explain the lack of share price momentum was salesforce.com's guidance for the upcoming quarter. While top-line expectations were set slightly above Street's consensus $2.79 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $0.325 at the mid-point of the range lagged projections by a penny and a half. I am suspicious, however, that a more reasonable driver of the mild sell-off are the rich valuations and some profit-taking, particularly after the stock has climbed over +50% YTD.The results of fiscal 4Q17 did little to change my mind on CRM. While I appreciate salesforce.com's efforts to push for revenue growth that is likely to be sticky due to the company's subscription-based model, I have reservations about the cost structure and the stock's valuation.CRM PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsI calculate that even more optimistic financial performance assumptions over the next five years might fail to justify the current market cap of about $77 billion. If I take the high-end of management's FY22 revenue guidance of $22 billion and apply my less-than-conservative GAAP op margin projections of 10%, the resulting $1.5 billion in net income would still suggest a very rich 50x five-year forward P/E multiple that I find hard to swallow.For the reasons above and despite salesforce.com's delivery of robust results in fiscal 3Q18, I choose to stay away from the stock, fearing that shares could be priced too aggressively at current levels.Note from the author: if you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow DM Martins Research.

Even with these large increases, I believe both stocks are still good buys and have plenty of upside left. With that being said, there is a valuation disparity and I believe Salesforce has more upside potential.There's a few things I like about both companies, but Adobe is the clear winner here. I especially like Adobe's combination of strong revenue growth and improving gross margins, which has led to strong free cash flow. Adobe has been using some of that free cash flow to repurchase shares, which is something I like to see because as an investor, you have two forces working in your favor. Profits should continue increasing from revenue growth, and those profits-per-share will be magnified by a reduction in share count. Over the last 3 full fiscal years, Adobe has:Salesforce, on the other hand, has grown sales at a faster rate, but has yet to turn that into meaningful profits and is also experiencing some gross margin erosion. I'm OK with a lack of meaningful profit because Salesforce is spending heavily on acquiring new customers, but the margin compression is a little concerning. Over the last 3 full fiscal years, Salesforce has:Both companies expect to continue strong growth. For fiscal year 2018, Adobe expects $8.7 billion in revenue, YoY revenue growth of 20%. Adobe also expects GAAP earnings-per-share of $4.40, YoY growth of 30%. Salesforce operates on a different fiscal year, but has already projected 20% sales growth for 2019. These are the same sales growth percentages, but Adobe is the winner given its stronger margins. Every incremental dollar in revenue will equal greater profits and free cash flow compared to Salesforce.Adobe has more cash, a lower amount of leverage, and a better current ratio. This should allow more flexibility for Adobe and maybe even some potential for an acquisition in the future.At first glance, it might look like Adobe is better given a more attractive Forward P/E, EV/FCF, and PEG Ratio. However, I think Salesforce is the more attractive choice. I believe the most relevant metric here is Price/Sales given the growth rates. Adobe does deserve a premium given higher gross margins, but a 64% Price/Sales premium is too much in my opinion. Once Salesforce puts more of a focus on profits and free cash flow, I believe this will lead to excess returns compared to Adobe.The chart below also gives me the feeling that Adobe's valuation is unlikely to go much higher from a multiples perspective. You can see that a fair amount of Adobe's stock performance has been tied to increasing Price/Sales multiples, especially over the last two years. Since Adobe has a forward P/E of 28.25x and a PEG of 1.32x, I think this a fair valuation. I just don't see the Price/Sales multiple going any higher. Future stock performance will be more tied to operating performance.ADBE data by YChartsSalesforce Price/Sales multiple has been pretty consistent over time. Stock price increases have been a result of sales increases, so it's been completely tied to improving performance. This creates a chart that shows divergence between stock price and valuation multiples, which is something I like to see.CRM data by YChartsWall Street is slightly more bullish on Salesforce as well. According to MarketWatch, the average target price for Salesforce is $122.49, which represents 8% upside based on the current share price of $113.70. The average target price for Adobe is $215.48, which represents 7% upside based on the current share price of $201.05. What really separates Salesforce is a more consistent analyst consensus, which includes 82% that rate the stock as a 'Buy.'In many ways, Adobe has a superior performance profile compared to Salesforce. Adobe has been able to drive sales growth and turn that growth into strong profits, gross margins, and free cash flow. I also believe that Adobe has an almost impenetrable market position with much stronger barriers to entry. Adobe's software is quite simply the gold standard for digital media solutions. With that being said, this analysis is about which stock is the better buy and I believe Salesforce has more upside potential. I like that Salesforce trades at a significant discount to Adobe in terms of Price/Sales. Salesforce has been putting more spend into acquiring customers, so I do believe that will translate into quickly increasing profit and free cash flow in the future. Salesforce also has a much larger market to sell into. Large enterprises will continue transitioning and upgrading their CRM systems."
4127143,103480,2017-11-22T11:59:03-05:00,"Consistent as always, Salesforce delivered yet another beat-and-raise in Q3, with revenue growth of 25% y/y.In a recent investor day presentation, Salesforce also outlined its path to $20-$22 billion in revenues by FY22, implying another doubling of revenues within five years.While the company's GAAP profits are thin, it's making incremental margin improvements every quarter as it focuses on growth. Operating margin increases this quarter were particularly impressive.As the largest pure-play SaaS company and the market-dealer provider of multiple application categories, Salesforce remains one of the sturdiest long bets in the technology sector.","It should come as no surprise that Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) beat expectations yet again in Q3, with a beat on both the top and bottom lines. Yes, the shares traded flat after the earnings announcement due to in-line Q4 guidance - but if there's anything we know from Salesforce's history, it's that the company always guides low and comes out on top. Let's quickly review the results and then discuss the key takeaways and how investors should play this quarter. Salesforce delivered revenue of $2.68 billion (+25% y/y), relative to consensus estimated of $2.65 billion. Of this revenue, $2.49 billion was subscription revenues, also growing at 25% y/y.The chart below, taken from Salesforce's earnings release, shows the subscription revenue breakdown by major ""clouds"", also known as its major product categories:Figure 1. Salesforce subscription revenue breakdownSource: Salesforce Q3 press releaseSales Cloud continues to be Salesforce's largest and flagship product, the app that started it all - and while it's reached nearly $1 billion in quarterly revenues, its growth has slowed down to 17% y/y, largely as expected. Here's the y/y growth rate of all of the products:Fairly obviously, it's the smaller ""clouds"" that have become more instrumental to growth - Platform especially, as the majority of that growth is organic. The growth seen in Marketing and Commerce applications is impressive, but it's important to note that Salesforce's acquisitions in the space, especially of Demandware (bought for $2.8 billion in late 2016), is driving a lot of this optical growth. Salesforce's Platform capabilities, however - consisting of its Lightning app development platform, Heroku PaaS offering, and AppExchange ""app store"" for third-party applications - are not only growing the company's top line, but also strengthening the ecosystem and ""moat"" around the Salesforce brand. Tech giants have long realized that in the modern world, software is king - and customers like adopting software with large ecosystems that have many customizable extensions to third-party applications. Salesforce was early to recognize this, and it's now built out one of the most robust platform ecosystems to surround its flagship products. Let's shift gears and look at profitability:Source: author-created chart; data from public filingsSalesforce was actually able to generate $116 million of operating profit this quarter (representing a 4% margin), a huge increase over an operating profit of just $3 million last year in 3Q17. As seen above, a large portion of this was driven by increased sales and marketing efficiency, with sales spending as a percentage of revenue down 3 points to 44%. Put another way: sales and marketing spend this quarter grew only 19% y/y to $1.18 billion, while revenue growth outstripped that at 25% y/y - thus the meaning of the term ""improved sales leverage."" Yes, operating margins are improving slowly due to the company's focus on growth, but Salesforce has seen steady increases each quarter.Salesforce's pro forma EPS of $0.39 (which primarily adds back its stock comp expenses to its GAAP net income) exceeded consensus of $0.37.Even in the face of strong earnings, Salesforce draws a lot of controversy from bears in the market. Opponents of the company like to point out that Salesforce is becoming more and more saturated in CRM, where it already has the dominant market share, and that the company still isn't able to turn a respectable profit. These are short-sided comments: Salesforce is now much more than a CRM company, with 8 different ""clouds"" that each serve large addressable markets. As for lack of profits - neither is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) profitable at the moment, and for the same reason as Salesforce - capturing market share and scaling the business, at this juncture, is more important than delivering a few quarters of profit. Salesforce is bringing in positive cash flow, anyway, so it's not like it's running out of liquidity to fund its growth. As I wrote in a prior article, Salesforce's prioritization of growth over profits is a choice - and as the company begins to scale toward its new $20 billion revenue target, it will eventually start turning more of its focus on margin optimization and gradually slow down its sales investments.Despite bear criticism, Salesforce is a company few dare to short. At every pullback in the stock, bulls rush in and bid it up, supporting the company's near-vertical climb since 2014. Year to date, the stock has already returned 57%:CRM data by YChartsSalesforce isn't a home-run type of stock. It's not going to double your money within a year like newer, hotter tech IPOs. Salesforce is the right pick for a steady, long-term holder who wants to bet on secular trends toward cloud computing and Salesforce's leading market share within multiple categories in SaaS. Despite being at all-time highs, Salesforce is one of the safest bets in the software industry for a single or double, generating modest alpha for your portfolio without incurring too much risk. In a company whose investors have already overlooked its lack of profits, and which has beaten quarterly expectations for years consecutively, there just isn't any credible trigger that can send the stock plunging downward - unlike other software companies, whose quarterly results can be a lot lumpier and whose margins (like Twilio's (NASDAQ: TWLO) earnings a few weeks ago, where a small margin contraction sent investors running for the exits) are more in focus.The following slides, taken from Salesforce's investor day deck, neatly illustrate Salesforce's market opportunity and its position within it:Source: Salesforce Investor Day 2017 deckThere are a couple things to note from these two slides: first and most obviously, Salesforce estimates its current TAM at $72 billion, growing to $120 billion by 2021. Second, Salesforce itself knows that CRM (Sales applications) is not going to be the primary driver of additional TAM - it's the Service, Marketing, and Platform clouds that will be driving the majority of growth as Salesforce pushes toward $20 billion in revenue. It comes as no surprise, then, that Salesforce saw the strongest growth in the quarter from its Marketing/Commerce (+40% y/y) clouds and its Platform (+34% y/y) category. Salesforce is smartly rushing into the areas where it estimates it will have the largest market opportunity three to four years down the road. CRM will be the anchor product for many more years to come, but as seen in the chart above, its strong penetration into that market will handicap its growth rate. With $120 billion in total estimated future TAM, however, Salesforce is not short of opportunities to grow - despite the maturity of Sales Cloud, it's built market-leading applications in a variety of other categories.Equally important as what the company has achieved this quarter is what the company sees itself doing, and in the past month, Salesforce has released its guidance window into FY18, FY19, and longer-term into FY22. All point to sustained ~20% y/y growth, which is what investors want to see.Salesforce upped its FY18 guidance to $10.43-$10.44 billion (+24% y/y), as it only has one quarter left to go. For Q4, that implies a guidance range of $2.801-$2.811. This is roughly in-line with what analysts were expecting at $2.79 billion, which is likely to blame for the flat after-hours trading: this earnings quarter, in-line guidance hasn't been enough to make investors happy. Pro forma EPS guidance of $0.32-$0.34 also fell slightly short of analyst consensus of $0.34.For FY19, Salesforce reiterated the guidance it gave in its investor day, projecting revenue of $12.45-$12.50 billion (+19-20% y/y growth). It's important to note that Salesforce has a pattern of sliding its guidance upward, however. Its initial FY18 guidance was $10.1-$10.15 billion, about $300 million (3%) lower than its current guidance of $10.43-$10.44 billion. If the pattern holds, Salesforce will build in more additional upside as it proceeds through its predictable pattern of beat-and-raise quarters and end up somewhere in the 22-23% growth range in FY19. It's important - psychologically, anyway - to investors that Salesforce maintains growth above the 20% threshold. Looking ahead even further, Salesforce has also drawn a line in the sand for FY22 (calendar year 2021), indicating a target of $20-$22 billion, which is Marc Benioff's next major milestone. The company did the same thing when initiating the $10 billion goal, though that goal was set only one year in advance, not four - see this article from MarketWatch. The slide below, taken from Salesforce's investor day deck, shows its path to $20+ billion:If we take the low end of this target for FY22, $20 billion, we calculate a CAGR of 18% from FY18-FY22. Yes, the company is expecting some deceleration in the coming years (at a $10-plus billion revenue scale, that's to be expected), though considering the company's current FY19 target implies 19-20% growth, there's not that much deceleration baked into the forecast - implying that Salesforce still feels its opportunity is huge. If we take the high end of this target ($22 billion), the implied FY18-FY22 CAGR is 20% and shows no deceleration whatsoever. Based on Salesforce's consistent pattern of meeting its goals (and with plenty of cash to acquire more revenue if it does find itself in danger of falling short), I'd be willing to bet that Salesforce makes good on these promises.Salesforce has consistently been able to trade at a historical average valuation of 7x revenue, barring any wider market pullback; currently, shares sit at 6.4x EV/FY19 revenues, based on the midpoint of its FY19 guidance at $12.475 billion. A 7x multiple implies a price target of $119, or 10% upside from current levels. Salesforce isn't substantially undervalued, but it still has some room for upside, especially given strong execution.Beyond shorter-term holds, Salesforce is one of the most comfortable long positions in the tech sector - it's the software equivalent of a ""sleep at night"" stock. With the company's strategic development of its platform offerings to build a wide ecosystem, as well as burgeoning growth in its marketing and ecommerce clouds, Salesforce looks well positioned to hit 20% growth in FY19 and continue that growth rate through FY22, where it expects $20-$22 billion in revenues. Given Salesforce's history of consistent execution (replicated yet again in this quarter), I'm comfortable staying long on the stock for the indefinite future."
4128210,103373,2017-11-28T16:21:43-05:00,"Salesforce.com has once again reported a stellar revenue growth quarter, but the reality may not be apparent to investors.High valuation multiples and growth expectations put the company in a precarious position in the long term.Is Salesforce.com merely prolonging the inevitable?","There were some trends that emerged from Salesforce.com’s (CRM) Investor Day and third quarter earnings that made it very clear that the company will be able to continue its current above 20% growth rate in 2018 as well.I want to dig into that success a little bit and talk about how that growth can be sustained for several quarters, but I want to do that against the backdrop of the company's valuation multiples.More importantly, I'd like to tie that in with clear and present implications for someone looking to buy into CRM or add to their position simply because revenue growth is still very strong.During the recently concluded Annual Investor Day, Salesforce.com said that it is targeting $20 billion in annual revenues by 2022. The company had $8.39 billion in annual revenues in 2017 and has guided for $10.4 billion in 2018. Aiming to double that again in a four-year period might look like the company is setting itself up for failure, considering the increasing competition from Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) in its core CRM (Customer Relationship Management) domain. But let’s look at that in perspective.The CRM market itself is expected to grow at healthy double-digit rates over the next several years. Salesforce.com has long been the number one player in this niche software space, and the larger vendors are already eating market share at the expense of smaller players.In a way, that’s a pattern similar to the one we’re seeing in the cloud computing segment, where Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft, Oracle and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) are all increasing market share. I’ve covered that in a recent article called Navigating Cloudy Waters: Understanding the Cloud Majors.Source: Salesforce.com BOFA Merrill Lynch 2017 Technology Conference PresentationSalesforce.com’s own data shows that it holds about 18.1% of the CRM market, which is slightly more than the combined market shares of the next three top players in the segment: Oracle, SAP (SAP) and Microsoft. Source: Salesforce 2017 Investor Day PresentationAs with the cloud computing market, consolidation already has started in the CRM segment. Here’s what Gartner research director Julian Poulter said about this more than a year ago: That increased competition at the top has spurred the top four players to offer additional services to complement their core product offerings. Better solutions and better pricing being the typical hallmarks of a highly competitive segment, the top four will eventually form a moat around themselves, similar to the way top cloud service providers are doing right now. In 2009, the top four vendors collectively held 27.2% of the CRM market, which improved to 36.1% in 2016. But the consolidation of the market under these top vendors will accelerate over the next five years as more and more companies adopt public cloud infrastructure and switch to SaaS applications over standalone licenses.And that brings us to the question of competition and how, if at all, it's affecting Salesforce.com's numbers. The second major reason why I believe Salesforce.com will continue its 20%-plus revenue growth rate is the dynamic underlying its current growth. Growth rates can often be deceiving because companies tend to cut prices or spend more on advertising, marketing and sales to keep revenues ticking up. An increase in competition is often a cue for the market leader to start doing some of these things.But that’s not the case at Salesforce.com. Despite Microsoft and Oracle nipping at its heels with their own cloud-based CRM products and rapid growth, the company posted 25% revenue growth during the third quarter. That looks even better when you look at its operating margin and marketing expenditure.During the third quarter, Salesforce.com’s operating expenses fell to 69% of net revenues, down from the 73% reported for the same period last year. A bulk of that savings came from the company spending a lot less (in percentage terms) on marketing and sales during the quarter. During the third quarter of 2016, Salesforce.com spent $998 million toward marketing and sales, or nearly 46.5% of net revenues. In the same quarter of this year the company spent $1.185 billion toward marketing and sales, which was only 44.19% of net revenues.Source: Chart prepared by author with data from Salesforce Financial Reports Research and development expenses held steady at 15% of net revenues during the third quarter of this year as well as the last, while general and administrative expenses dropped to 10%, compared to 11% last year. It was clearly not a single-quarter phenomenon, as total operating expenses during the first three quarters also were down from the same period last year. It might be too early to make a call, but I would hazard that Salesforce.com already has started to enjoy the benefits of scale as far as customer base growth is concerned.Moreover, the continuous launching of new products (e.g. Einstein Lightning and Trailhead), the addition of Commerce Cloud thanks to the acquisition of Demandware in 2016, and the slow but steady increase in customer retention rates (slowdown in attrition, as seen in the graph below) may have started helping the company earn more revenue per customer, thereby lowering the pace of marketing and sales expense growth when compared to the pace of net revenue growth. Source: Salesforce Investor PresentationThere are several conclusions we can arrive at based on the above analysis.First, there's enough evidence to suggest that the company can easily show 20%-plus revenue growth for the next several quarters despite the rapidly growing competition, which means valuation multiples will continue to stay at or go above the current already high levels of 7.8 times sales and 80 times forward earnings.Second, at those valuation levels much of the future growth potential is already priced into the stock, which means the 20%-plus growth is actually critical to the company. Any slowdown on that front is going to hit valuations hard, and the longer that takes to happen the greater the fall.Third (and this is where your investment decision comes in), with such delicately balanced dynamics at play, investing in CRM now might not be worth the risk even if you have a large appetite for it. There's literally no room for error, and any downturn in sales performance in the future could potentially wipe out billions of dollars in valuation overnight.My assessment: While it is undeniable that the company will keep growing its sales at current levels for several more quarters in spite of tough competition from its SaaS peers, thereby making it look like a great investment right now, the risk of an eventual downturn causing valuations to tumble is just too high to ignore."

EPS is expected to be $1.32-$1.33 in line with analyst estimates of $1.32.This will be the first year that Salesforce will go past the $10 billion annual revenue run rate. It is now eyeing to become a $20 billion cloud services company by the fiscal year 2022. The company also initiated revenue guidance of $12.45 billion to $12.5 billion for fiscal 2019.According to IDC, the AI market will grow from nearly $8 billion in 2016 to more than $47 billion in 2020. To cash in on this growth, Salesforce released its AI platform called Einstein last year. In March, it announced a strategic partnership with IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Watson to provide insightful analytics for businesses. Einstein already has clients like Coca-Cola that uses it for inventory tracking, Amazon Web Services that uses it to improve its lead-to-cash time, and US Bank that uses it for customer behavior and attrition analysis and cross-sell opportunities.Early this month, at this year's edition of Dreamforce, Salesforce announced myEinstein that will allow admins and developers who don't know code to build custom AI apps on Salesforce.com.

NS1 has now raised more than $45 million in funding since 2015.As noted above, Salesforce was already a customer before investing in the current round.Salesforce has made quite a range of investments in startups, largely due to managing a large ecosystem of software-enabled companies on its platform.The graphic below shows its investment focus by various metrics.(Source: Mattermark)The graphic indicates that Salesforce not only invests in a variety of industries but also at all stages of startup development.Geographically, Salesforce’s history is skewed toward Bay Area firms but has notably branched out internationally to invest in companies located in Tokyo and Paris.Salesforce’s approach has been to make a large number of investments, although likely for smaller amounts, where the investee company can benefit from access to Salesforce’s platform and ecosystem.Of special note is Salesforce’s investment at the very earliest stages of startup development, such as Pre-Series A and Series A. Although the definition of those ‘Stages’ has changed in recent years, Salesforce has been notable among major technology firms in making those investments, which require a significant infrastructure to accomplish.Salesforce management has thus decided to invest not only in a wide spectrum of software-enabled companies but to create the specialized staffing needed to identify, analyze, invest and support a large throughput of technology startups within its system.The firm will continue to expand its investment, and it announced as much in May 2017 when it disclosed a fourth fund with a fresh $100 million to invest within the next two years.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

Shares of the cloud-based software company have gained over 40% year to date on the back of explosive top line growth across different business segments. On the other hand, profit margins are under considerable pressure due to big expenses in stock-based compensation.Does Salesforce have what it takes to continue delivering market-beating returns in the future, or is now the right time to take profits in the stock?Salesforce is a top industry player in software-as-a-service. The company offers customer relationship management (CRM) applications in areas such as sales force automation, customer service, marketing, document management, and analytics.The enterprise software industry is going through a major transformation over the past several years, since many companies are moving toward the cloud and subscription-based services for a wide variety of applications. Salesforce is both a major driving force and one of the leading beneficiaries from such transformation, as the company is a pioneer in bringing cloud, social, and mobile technologies to the CRM industry.Over the coming years, Salesforce is focusing on artificial intelligence as a key innovation, with technologies such as its Einstein Artificial Intelligence service. According to a report from IDC, artificial intelligence technologies associated with CRM activities will generate $1.1 trillion in global business revenue from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2021, adding 800,000 new direct jobs in the process. The report calculates that Salesforce customers will account for $293 billion of the total aggregated revenue and more than 155,000 of those direct jobs by the year 2021.The company announced last quarter that it has reached an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion for the first time in history, with revenue growing at an impressive average annual rate of nearly 30% per year over the past decade.More than 90% of revenue comes from subscriptions, with the main source being subscription fees that Salesforce charges its customers for accessing its cloud computing application services. The company also charges extra fees for additional support services. One-time payments mostly come from consulting and application engagements, as well as training classes that are billed per session.It was the first industry player to sign up large customers into software-as-a-service, and this first-mover advantage has been a key growth driver for the company. According to data from Gartner, Salesforce has been the top CRM provider in the world for 11 consecutive years.The company offers a deep ecosystem of services across different verticals that are critically important to customers. Brand recognition, ubiquity of products, and access to data provide solid sources of competitive strength for the business. Salesforce competes against powerful corporations such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), but the company has outperformed the competition and consolidated its leadership position over time.(Source: Salesforce)Salesforce is producing spectacular sales growth. Revenue has more than doubled in the past three years, and data for the quarter ended on July 31, 2017, shows that the business keeps firing on all cylinders. Total revenue came in at $2.56 billion during the period, growing 26% year over year. Unbilled deferred revenue reached $10.4 billion in the quarter, an impressive increase of 30%.Importantly, revenue growth is quite solid across its different business segments, and this is a major positive when it comes to evaluating the sustainability of the company's growth levels.Source: Salesforce.In a sign of confidence, management raised revenue guidance for the full year by $100 million, to $10.4 billion. This is the second quarter in a row that Salesforce raised revenue guidance by $100 million, so momentum is clearly strong.Profitability is a very different story, though. Cash flows and earnings are expanding rapidly, but GAAP earnings figures are not nearly as healthy.Operating cash flow was $331 million last quarter, up 32% over the same quarter in the prior year. Management is expecting operating cash flow to grow between 20% and 21% during the full year, and free cash flow is expected to grow at a faster rate than operating cash flow due to disciplined capital expenditures.Looking at non-GAAP operating earnings, Salesforce reported an adjusted operating margin of 14.9% of revenue last quarter, a significant increase versus 12.9% in the same quarter last year. On the other hand, GAAP operating margin was significantly lower, at 2% of revenue.(Source: Salesforce)The main difference between GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings comes from stock-based compensation. During the quarter ended in July, Salesforce produced $381.3 million in non-GAAP operating income, with stock-based compensation amounting to $256.5 million and amortization of purchased intangibles representing an additional $74 million. This leaves the company with a much smaller $50.8 million in GAAP operating income.(Source: SEC filings)Stock-based compensation expenses are non-cash, and they depend on variables such as the stock price performance over a particular period, so this is fairly particular expense item. It certainly makes sense to look at margins, both including and excluding stock-based compensation, when analyzing performance.Nevertheless, leaving aside the accounting considerations, the fact remains that employee compensation is a key expense item for a services company like Salesforce, and stock-based compensation is a very real expense from an economic perspective.From a strategic point of view, management is doing the right thing. There is a huge competition for human talent in the tech industry, and stock-based incentives are one of the most powerful tools a company has in order to attract valuable employees. Salesforce is growing rapidly, and it has abundant room for expansion over the long term. Prioritizing long-term growth over short-term margins is the smart way to go when the market opportunity is so compelling.Still, this is an important risk factor to keep in mind. Being a growth company, Salesforce is aggressively reinvesting its profits in the business, so margins and earnings are hard to predict in the coming quarters.The following table compares some key financial and valuation metrics for Salesforce against industry peers such as Oracle, SAP, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), and Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU). The company is way ahead of its peers in both past revenue growth and expected earnings growth. While valuation is comparatively expensive in terms of price-to-sales or price-to-free cash flow, valuation metrics for Salesforce don’t look unreasonable at all considering the company’s superior growth.(Data Source: FinViz)Salesforce is generating tremendous growth, and the company looks well positioned for sustained rapid expansion in the years ahead. The stock is not cheap by any means, but the valuation is not excessive for such a dynamic growth business.The main risk factor to consider is that the company is generating thin profit margins on a GAAP basis, and it’s hard to tell how profitability will evolve going forward. However, the software and services industry is fertile ground for elevated profitability, and it makes sense to expect higher and more predictable margins from Salesforce as the business matures over time and reinvestment rates increase at a slower rate than revenue.As long as Salesforce remains strong enough to protect its market leadership in a much promising market, chances are that the stock will continue delivering market-beating returns in the years ahead."
4103720,20521,2017-09-01T15:28:53-04:00,,"Nothing appears to be in the way of Salesforce.com’s (NYSE:CRM) growth. After another stellar quarter performance, it is fairly evident that competitors, including the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), are not coming close to this giant. Here is an interesting infographic, courtesy MotleyFool.com, that shows how Salesforce has expanded its market share position in every category over the year.For the second quarter of the year, Salesforce’s revenue grew an impressive 26% over the year to $2.56 billion, above analyst projection of $2.51 billion. Revenue growth was driven by 17% growth in Sales Cloud revenues. Additionally, the company also recorded gains in billed and unbilled deferred revenue, which improved 29% compared with a three-year average of 27%. Net income came in at $17.7 million, or $0.02 per share. Adjusted EPS of $0.33 was better than the previous year’s $0.24 and the market’s forecast of $0.32. Overall, it delivered a rare feat by recording more than 20% in both revenue and margin expansion.By segment, revenues from Subscription and Support grew 25.6% to $2.369 billion. Professional Services and Other revenues improved 28.3% to $193.1 million.For the current year, Salesforce increased its outlook to revenue of $10.35-10.4 billion and an EPS of $1.29-1.31, in line with market forecasts. This will be the first year the Salesforce will go past the $10 billion annual revenue run rate. It is now eyeing to become a $20 billion cloud services company in the near future. For the current quarter, the company forecasts revenue of $2.64-2.65 billion and an EPS of $0.36-0.37. Analysts had forecast revenues of $2.61 billion for the quarter.Salesforce is benefiting from the tie-ups it has established with other tech giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Last year, Salesforce announced plans to use AWS to run some of its software. It intends to spend $400 million over the next four years on AWS, primarily due to the wider geographic presence that the service offers. The tie-up with Amazon has helped it expand its presence in international markets of Canada and Australia. Last month, Salesforce started running its software in AWS data centers in Canada and is planning to target Australia by the end of the year. The investment will help customers, especially government and financial services organizations, feel safer about hosting data within the countries.For Salesforce, international markets are still a lucrative opportunity. Currently, nearly 30% of its revenues are from international markets compared with more than 50% at Microsoft and Oracle.To break into this market, Salesforce is investing heavily. More than 40% of its new hires year to date have been outside the United States. During the quarter, it added several new clients in APAC with brands like Toshiba and Nomura in Japan as well as Queensland Urban Utilities and Australia Post in Australia.Its stock is currently trading at $95.49 with a market capitalization of $67.9 billion. It has recovered from the 52-week low of $66.43 it had reached in December last year. Earlier this week, the stock had touched a 52-week high of $95.23. Analysts expect the stock to climb higher. Canaccord Genuity increased its price target to $110 from $100 and maintained a buy rating, and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey's analysts increased their price target to $114 from $110 and maintained a buy rating. Credit Suisse analysts maintained an Outperform rating on the stock and raised their price target from $110 to $115."
4115355,103480,2017-10-23T05:45:40-04:00,"As we head into the Q3 earnings season for the software sector, there are several compelling reasons to remain long on Salesforce.com as the leader of the cloud category.In the past year, the company has experienced growth in all of its ""clouds,"" and the annual Dreamforce user conference in November should give us an update on the product roadmap.Due to a business model centered on high sales spending, Salesforce is often misunderstood by investors bashing on its lack of profits.Nevertheless, Salesforce continues its nearly vertical stock climb as it has never failed to issue a beat-and-raise quarter. The stock still remains decently valued relative to other cloud rivals.","Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) is often a love or hate name among both customers and investors. Very few cloud software companies generate as much notoriety as Salesforce does - especially as its new $1-billion headquarters, Salesforce Tower, nears completion in San Francisco, prodding some investors to scream about corporate excesses.Despite the controversy, even bears have to admit one thing: the stock's climb is impressive. Now, as we head into November (the height of the Q3 earnings season in software, as Salesforce and many other cloud companies end their fiscal years in January) and Salesforce attempts to break the psychologically important $100-stock price, we'll review the bull thesis on Salesforce and why the company has been so successful despite its lack of profits for its nearly two decades of existence.CRM data by YChartsYear to date, Salesforce has already returned nearly 50%. Unlike many other public SaaS peers, Salesforce's stock ascent has been fairly steady, with no sudden jolts like that of Twilio (NYSE: TWLO) or Tableau (NYSE: DATA). Even though there are many naysayers angling for the stock to take a beating, Salesforce has remained resilient, and for good reason.Even mild followers of Salesforce will already be familiar with the key points of the Salesforce bull thesis: >20% growth in all of its product categories, ripping out legacy CRM systems with the now-dominant Sales Cloud, and long-term recurring subscription contracts. Here let's dive a layer deeper and refresh our reasons for being long on Salesforce.This might be a strange proposition - the purpose of a for-profit company is, by virtue of its classification, to make profits. Why would any company choose not to be profitable? Salesforce's critics like to expound on the fact that Salesforce has, year after year, failed to turn a GAAP profit.The below chart, taken from Salesforce's 2016 investor day, is a good showcase of the company's thinking and the underlying concept that profitability is, indeed, a choice to be made.Figure 1. Salesforce growth vs. margin frameworkThe company chooses how to balance its growth versus its operating margin, and thus far in its life, it has chosen to focus primarily on growth. As Salesforce reaches the $10-billion run rate, it has put increased emphasis on margin, as shown by the highlighted section above - each year, it has shown improvements in operating margin, driven primarily by increased sales and marketing efficiency.The nature of Salesforce's multiyear recurring subscription contracts makes its heavy investments in sales and marketing wise. It's actually an ironic fact - long-term, generalist investors look at Salesforce's lack of profits and decry its lack of long-term viability. When in fact, Salesforce's choice to spend on sales - so that it can generate long-term contracts that have very compelling unit economics and are extremely profitable on a multiyear time horizon - is actually a choice driven by long-term thinking.To analogize differently, think back to your Econ 101 days. You probably remember that central bankers make a choice between inflation and unemployment, and that they try to pick a point on the spectrum that optimizes the tradeoffs in both outcomes. Salesforce's growth/margin framework is essentially the same - it can choose between today's profits, or tomorrow's. Corporate leaders who choose to maximize a future, recurring earnings stream should be praised, not criticized.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), a much-beloved company on Wall Street, does essentially the same thing without receiving the same fervent pessimism. Amazon has chosen to focus on scaling itself into a global, mammoth marketplace before focusing on short-term earnings. Investors should think of Salesforce in similar terms.For this reason, Salesforce's P/E of ~100 is entirely meaningless - it represents today's growth/margin spectrum positioning, not the long-term operating potential of the business. At any point, Salesforce could choose to slash its sales and marketing spend (nearly half of its revenues) and immediately generate a ton of profits from its existing contracts. But to do this would be to risk future growth.Salesforce is probably alone in the realm of large-cap enterprise software in that it has a defined category focus: customer-facing software for the front office, to be used to drive an improved customer experience. Other large-cap software companies - like Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) and SAP (NYSE: SAP) - try to be everything for everyone. This approach helps enlarge the revenue base and cross-sell different products, but it doesn't do anything for brand identity or making concepts stick.Salesforce's primary products - Sales Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Service Cloud, and Community Cloud all revolve around one common theme: delivering a first-class customer experience. This has generated an invaluable amount of brand goodwill for Salesforce - very few people don't understand what Salesforce does.If you surveyed a crowd of random people on the street, more of them could probably tell you what Salesforce does, versus SAP or Oracle. They know SAP and Oracle are software giants - but they wouldn't be able to tell you what kind of software. Despite Salesforce being a fraction of the size of Oracle and SAP, its strong brand association with sales and marketing functions helps generate new business.Figure 2. Salesforce product roadmap to dateSalesforce hasn't stopped innovating either, but it's innovating in its own realm. The company spends ~15% of its revenues (nearly $2 billion annual run rate) on its R&D function, and its continued product delivery in the CRM and customer-facing software category has given Salesforce a well-deserved reputation as a thought leader in the space.In addition, Salesforce's large developer ecosystem has further entrenched its supremacy in the space. Customers have the ability to customize Salesforce as they wish and build extensions to their other services - the open nature of its platform has given customers the ability to create and support their own use cases for Salesforce software, which distinguishes it from, say, Oracle, which is late to that game.Despite its strengths, Salesforce remains - as it always has - decently valued. Among its peers in large-cap cloud and enterprise software, Salesforce carries a reasonable EV/FTM revenues valuation.CRM EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsSalesforce's OCF multiple also remains decently valued relative to these peers, though Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) and Red Hat (NASDAQ: RHT) are cheaper in this regard. However, we also note that these companies are more mature and have placed greater emphasis on cash flows - Salesforce, once it reaches a larger scale it's comfortable with, has the capacity to greatly increase its cash flow profitability.CRM EV to CFO (Annual) data by YChartsIn general, a company that's growing revenues at ~25% and still also growing cash flows - Salesforce grew OCF to $1.56 billion in the first half of 2017, up 20% y/y - should deserve a premium multiple to its closest peers, especially given the entrenched nature of its business. Salesforce's modest valuation gives it room to run - ignore the naysayers who focus on the meaningless P/E ratio.When it comes to opinions on Salesforce, there seems to be no middle ground. The company seems to have only ardent fans or dedicated haters. We believe you'll benefit in aligning yourself to the former camp. When it comes to choosing cloud software stocks, few names scream quality the way Salesforce does. It is, after all, the pioneer of the cloud subscription delivery model and the largest pure-play cloud company.The company has a collection of admirable traits, and its product leadership in the customer software field is widely recognized. The company has years of growth left in it - its consistent pattern of beat-and-raise quarters is a testament to the resilience of its business and its savvy in choosing how to optimize growth versus profitability - as its earnings quarters consistently beat on both the top and bottom lines.Any pullbacks prior to the Q3 earnings season should be viewed as buying opportunities."
4102094,31441,2017-08-26T18:19:52-04:00,CRM reported strong quarterly earnings. The company beat on revenue and earnings and raised Q3 guidance.Deferred revenue was up an impressive 26%.Gross margins continue to lag. This could become a point of contention.Is the CRM glass half-empty?,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported another strong quarter. The company delivered revenue of $2.56 billion and EPS of $0.33. The company beat on both revenue and earnings. Revenue was up 26% Y/Y, and Salesforce is now at a landmark $10 billion run-rate revenue. The company also boosted Q3 revenue guidance. The stock is up about 1% post-earnings, but it did not reach the $100 milestone some were predicting. Despite hovering near its 52-week high, the glass could be half-empty for CRM.Revenue from subscription and support, and professional services rose 26% and 28%, respectively. Within the subscription and support segment, Salesforce's flagship Sales Cloud product was again the biggest contributor, and chugged along at 17% growth. The lion's share of the company's revenue is derived from subscription services. Therefore, its deferred revenue and unbilled revenue are key metrics - they are indicative of the company's future performance.Deferred revenue rose 26% Y/Y, in line with past results. Over the past seven quarters, deferred revenue growth has ranged from 23% to as high as 31%. Unbilled deferred revenue was $10.4 billion, up 31% Y/Y. Total booked business on and off the balance sheet was $15 billion, up 29%.These key metrics will not only drive revenue but also the sentiment for the stock. Salesforce delivered in spades, and I expect the company to deliver growth north of 20% for the next few quarters. The Customer Relationship Management segment was expected to grow from $26.3 billion in 2015 to $36.5 billion in 2017 - an 18% compound annual growth rate (""CAGR""). By growing its bookings at 29%, Salesforce's growth is outstripping industry growth, implying it continues to take share from competitors.Salesforce's gross margins were 73.8%, down from 74.2% in the year earlier period. Operating income margin was 2.0%, up from 1.6% last year. On the operating side, the company enjoyed the benefits of scale in general and administrative expenses which grew less than revenue. However, the decline in gross margin is a potential red flag.Part of the company's top-line growth has been driven by acquisitions. Last year Salesforce made nine acquisitions in the areas of artificial intelligence in e-commerce. Some of the target companies could have had lower margins; it could take a few quarters to see margin improvement post-deal, if at all. The other scenario is that with deep-pocketed competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) also in the Customer Relationship Management space, the company might have had to sacrifice margin in order to extend its market share lead.I expect companies' adoption of the cloud for salesforce management to continue in the near term. The question remains, ""What happens if Salesforce's top line growth eventually slows and margins continue to lag?"" The company's current top line growth is too gaudy to ignore, but stagnant margins and its inability to convert more of its revenue into earnings could hold the stock back. CRM trades at over 70x run-rate earnings and is hovering near its 52-week high - that's with government officials buoying financial markets with tax-cut talk. I believe the glass is currently half-empty and rate CRM a sell."
4101827,98236,2017-08-25T04:06:18-04:00,"Earlier this week, Salesforce reported the results of its fiscal Q2.The quarter was exceptionally strong on the sales front with a beat on headline numbers and a significantly larger beat on bookings.Salesforce's guidance was muted in the wake of such strong sales performance, but to an extent reflects emerging and enlarging seasonal trends.This article focuses, to an extent, on the unwillingness of the company to manage its GAAP expenses.The earnings beat this past quarter was entirely a function of rising share-based compensation.","Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported the results of its fiscal Q2 Tuesday afternoon. The results were strong, and certainly strong for a company of this scale. Revenue growth was about 26% and exceeded expectations, at least those reported by First Call by about 2%. On the balance sheet, deferred revenue growth had been projected to be 22% year over year. The actual number was 26%. Off-balance sheet deferred revenue growth reached 30%, compared to growth of 26% the prior quarter. Non-GAP earnings per share had been projected to be between $.31 and $.32, and they were in fact $.0.33. The company’s cash flow was unusually strong in the quarter, rising 32% year on year. Most of that performance was a function of balance sheet items and the growth of stock-based compensation - not the best way to generate cash flow.The bookings calculation, which includes the growth of both deferred categories, actually rose by 39% this past quarter - a number that is clearly unsustainable for this company. It should be noted that good as this attainment was, it was a product of weakness in the year-earlier quarter and increasing seasonality in terms of billings that the CFO has called out on many occasions. As the saying goes, the beer, at least from the perspective of sales performance, is not likely to get any colder than it was last quarter. And yet...The title of this article comes from one of the more famous songs from the movie “Casablanca.” And that title and the additional lyrics of the ballad echo my sentiments about the shares of this perennial growth company almost precisely. Well, not all of the lyrics - it is a love song, after all. But I do think at some point, as time goes by, fundamental things like earnings generated without excessive use of stock-based compensation matter.The company has not chosen to focus on margins - at least on a GAAP basis. In terms of evaluating expense discipline, I look at GAAP figures - after all, that measures the comparison between actual dollars spent quarter by quarter. Salesforce chooses to ignore GAAP as a metric to be considered in running its business. GAAP margins actually fell a little this quarter, and that is despite the revenue over-attainment. Indeed, GAAP earnings fell from a profit to a loss. Non-GAAP margins, on which Salesforce does focus, rose 195 bps - slightly faster than the company’s plan for margin expansion, but of limited importance in assessing the trending of expense management.Looking at GAAP expenses and expense ratios, gross margins fell about 100 basis points and the cost of research & development rose noticeably compared to the prior year and as a percentage of revenue. Overall, research & development spend was 44% higher than the prior year, partially representing the costs incurred in integrating the acquisitions Salesforce has made this past year and partially because the company is accelerating spending to take advantage of the market opportunities.I do not think providing a recommendation for CRM shares is a case of one size fits all. I personally do not own the shares, simply because it is my expectation that investors will ultimately be looking for results that this company cannot and will not choose to deliver in terms of margin improvement. Other investors, looking at the results of this past quarter, will come to a different conclusion based on the growth of the company and the likelihood that once again the quarterly projections will come to be exceeded. My own portfolio discipline limits the number of names in my portfolio. My screen limits names which are not showing improving expense trends absent some other supervening factor.I personally prefer investments in which future over-attainment is not already so firmly baked into expectations. It is likely to be difficult to generate huge positive alpha when 40 of 45 analysts already rate the shares as a Buy or better. I just don’t have the visibility to know what this company might do to better please investors than the results that it just reported - except to improve margins, and that is a consummation the CFO more or less deliberately ruled out on the conference call.Many analysts chose to raise their price targets for CRM shares. One doesn’t often see bookings growth of the magnitude reported for a company of this size. Honestly, one doesn’t often see bookings growth of 39% in a quarter for a company of any size. Most analysts who follow this name are far more interested in growth than in GAAP margins. And most analysts would never voluntarily elect to point out the unfavorable trend of GAAP margins or the dissonance of reporting that non-GAAP margins are improving, while ignoring the deterioration of non-GAAP margins.Salesforce has raised its guidance, as I will detail in the balance of this article. That said, the increase in guidance, consistent with a pattern of multiple quarters for this company, was questioned by some investors/analysts as inadequate. Some analysts took pains to make excuses for the company’s forecast for deferred revenue growth of 18-19% in the current quarter. The fact is that much of the “slowdown” in bookings growth is simply the impact of seasonality on billings, a subject on which the CFO has spent hours, and some of it has to do with the company’s relative performance in the year-earlier period, which showed a result above normal Q3 seasonality as it rebounded from a relatively muted Q2 bookings performance.I think investors who want in on these kinds of metrics do so with the risk of losing sight of the totality of the business merits of Salesforce. And therein lies the problem. It has proven to be very difficult for investors to achieve the kind of returns in this name that might fully justify its current valuation and perceived risk. Results can’t really be expected to improve at a faster cadence than they did last quarter. Over the past year, shares are up about 16%. They have done better than that on a year to date basis - up about 41% - but that result is mainly a function of the fall and then recovery of the shares in the wake of 3rd quarter earnings a year ago. By comparison, the IGV index has appreciated by 27% and the index is up by 31% YTD.I have speculated in past articles that part of the issue is that investors may have reached the limit of their patience in terms of ignoring stock-based comp expense. It is a real expense that does dilute current shareholders, and it continues to increase at a rapid clip. This past quarter, stock-based comp rose by 34% year on year. Essentially, all of reported non-GAAP earnings are coming from stock-based comp. Investors may simply not be willing to value those kinds of earnings as meaningful - or at least that might be the case as time goes by.All of that being said, it is important to recognize that this company's sales machine is operating more or less flawlessly, and my cavils are about the expense discipline and the use of stock-based comp and not its go-to-market strategy, product set or sales execution. Initially, in the wake of the earnings release, there was a flurry of discussion surrounding Salesforce's forecast for deferred revenue growth in this current quarter. As it happens, the company inherited $625 million of deferred revenue when it purchased Demandware last summer. Next quarter, that addition to the deferred revenue balance goes away - the accretion of Demandware deferred revenues is anniversaried - and thus, the math itself implies that deferred revenue growth has to come down by 600 basis points. There is nothing disappointing or suggestive or malign in that projection - well, that is unless one doesn’t like doing numbers. And that 39% bookings increase this past quarter - well, some of it was doubtless a function of the quarter seeing close activity that might have been expected to fall into future quarters.In any event, what is going to happen next quarter? Not the stated guidance. There are many uncertain things in the world, but the relationship between the forecast of Salesforce and the actual level of revenues and bookings that it subsequently reports is not one of them. In this particular quarter, the CEO said that he had “dreams of 25%” revenue growth for this current quarter, compared to the stated forecast of 23-24%. I would challenge any observer to imagine that if this CEO articulates such dreams on the conference call, the company will not figure out how to make those dreams come true.But to an extent, all of this is not much better than the calculus behind how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. What investors really want to understand is just how long Salesforce can continue its string of hyper-growth - in terms of years. They also are also likely to be concerned, at least at some point, about operating margin growth for this company, and about what must happen in terms of sales execution and product strategy to ensure that the company can achieve the kind of multi-year growth on which they are counting. I think I will foreshadow some of what I will detail in the balance of the article by quoting from a comment by the company CFO, “It is important to note that coming out of a strong second quarter, we are accelerating our investments in expanding our distribution capacity, new product initiatives and Trailhead. These investments are set up for the long-term growth while pressuring our near-term margins. Nevertheless, we remain on track to deliver a 125-150 basis point of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY18.” Putting that together with some reasonable expectations for growth in the balance of the year leads to the conclusion that stock-based comp will continue to rise and the GAAP reported income will fall. That is probably not a formula that will lead to share price outperformance in the near term. But it does produce an expectation for growth to stay higher, longer than current consensus expectations. The CFO, in an answer to a margin question suggested that over time, unit operating margin economics would produce mid-30% operating margins. But when that might be, how that might happen and how much the reliance on stock-based comp would be in that margin forecast were not subjects that were further discussed.There are more than a few ways to evaluate the success of CRM in a particular quarter. I prefer to look at the growth in the different clouds. Why? In terms of investing in this name, the key is how long hyper-growth can continue. The biggest concern investors have is how long the sales cloud, still 38% of the company’s total revenues, can maintain growth in the mid-teens. The latest forecast from Gartner, which I have linked here, shows that CRM's growth this year is expected to be about 15%, and total spending will reach $37 billion. Not all of that $37 billion relates to spending on the solution set that Salesforce calls its sales cloud. I think it seems fair to say in looking at all of the numbers that CRM is not really a saturated market, that it is growing at a reasonable cadence and that the company continues to take market share in the space, when viewed holistically.While to some it may seem less than intuitive to some readers, it is apparent that users these days have goals of refreshing their first-generation CRM solutions with unified mega-procurements that bring standardization and Big Data analytics to an enterprise. The mega-deals that Salesforce has been able to close are a function of user priorities to standardize on a unified approach to sales management. And the advent of Einstein, which can now be part of a project to bring technology to the sales force and to the call center, has probably been a major boost for CRM and a factor in differentiating its offering. From what I know of the subject, specifically, Einstein has already been instrumental in helping Salesforce close some of the mega-deals it reported on during this last conference call.While the assertion can’t be proven, I believe there is enough growth and market share opportunity in the space for Salesforce to keep growing its sales cloud in the mid-teens for some time to come. If there was one specific metric that was encouraging for holders/investors of these shares, it was the re-acceleration of growth in the sales cloud to almost 15% last quarter, a nice pick-up of more than 100 bps from the growth of the prior quarter. While from time to time some commentators fret about this company’s market share and competitive positioning in the wake of cloud competition from the 3 main challengers in the space, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), the numbers this quarter suggest that the leadership of Salesforce, in terms of sales performance, is not waning.The other clouds that Salesforce offers all did well last quarter. The Platform cloud has shown about 33% growth for the last several quarters and continued to grow at that rate last quarter. The company’s Service Cloud, its second-largest revenue source, showed the weakest relative performance, with growth declining from 24% to 20.5%. The marketing cloud, which includes Demandware and several other acquisitions made last year, grew by 57% last quarter, down from 62% in the prior quarter. Some of that is a function of the lapping of acquisitions, particularly including Demandware, that closed in the middle of July 2016. On an organic basis, the Salesforce marketing cloud grew by 36% this past quarter. That level of growth was several hundred basis points faster than the company’s closest rival in the space, the Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) marketing cloud. The marketing cloud probably represents the greatest growth opportunity in terms of TAM for Salesforce, and its strategy is working.In addition to the opportunities in the 4 major product families, Salesforce has a major growth opportunity in that its penetration outside of the Americas is far below what might be anticipated for a software company of this scale. At this point, the company gets 74% of its revenues in the Americas, 17% of revenue in the EMEA region and 9% of revenues in the Asia/Pac region. Growth in all geographies has been quite consistent for an extended period of time. It would not be terribly unusual to expect that growth outside the Americas might accelerate at some point, even if growth in the Americas region starts to moderate due to an increasingly greater scale of the company in this region.During this latest conference call, management spoke of a TAM for all of the offerings that Salesforce sells that has reached $100 billion. I am not a market research analyst, and I haven’t seen the kind of data the company used to develop that estimate of its TAM. But I think, overall, current evidence suggests that the company is likely to grow at faster rates, longer than is probably reflected in consensus thinking. The multiple growth engines of Salesforce are fully engaged and functioning. The investments that it has been and is making are producing the results expected. And that is one of the factors in the company’s valuation that wars against the lack of real profitability.This is a site that is focused on making readers money in the stock market. I do not provide advice or trade my own portfolio without some expectation of profit. CRM is a model growth engine. It does not appear, at least to this writer, as though it is a model investment or that it has a business model that is producing results that investors might crave. Well, as time goes by, in thinking about Salesforce as an investment, some may be tempted to analogize to the strategy of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that has many times been willing to sacrifice short-term profits in exchange for building franchises far beyond its perceived core competencies. But that, I am inclined to believe, is just the point. Amazon goes outside its core competencies to extend its growth franchise; Salesforce has doubled down on what it knows - and investors rebelled with their wallets when the company was publicly interested in changing that paradigm through the mooted acquisition of LinkedIn.The real problem with this company as an investment is that from the perspective of reaching GAAP profitability it is going backwards, and while not often discussed in the pages of most brokerage reports, the trend seems to be troubling investors. I have looked at all of the expense categories on a year-over-year basis. The prior sequential quarter was a Q4, which will inevitably produce skewed sequential comparisons for this company, and so, I have not included that analysis. Last quarter, on a GAAP basis, research & development expense grew by 44% year on year. Some of that level of increase is a function of the companies that were acquired by Salesforce over the last year, and perhaps the percentage growth will decrease going forward. On the other hand, the CFO talked quite specifically about the need to accelerate investment - and research & development is often an area of investment.Sales and marketing costs grew by 24% year on year, essentially in line with revenue. But the rate of increase seems likely to rise noticeably in the next few quarters-per the CFO commentary. The company obviously could build more infrastructure overseas, it has initiatives that it will need to fund to optimize the results of its Microsoft partnership and it is funding something called Trailhead which is a set of guided learning paths that allow users to develop what are described as Salesforce skills. The Trailhead initiative is a major undertaking with many modules, multiple trails and electronic super badges that showcase Salesforce skills.General and administrative costs rose 24% year on year. Why the company has to increase general and administrative spending at this rate is something I cannot determine. General & Administrative spending is 11% of revenues on a GAAP basis. I find it interesting, and useful at times, to look at companies in the space on a comparable basis. In this particular instance, I chose to take a look at Adobe. Just looking at Adobe’s spend ratios can be instructive. Adobe is a company with comparable size and comparable growth. But it has a far different opex spend profile and opex growth profile when compared to Salesforce. Specifically, Adobe’s increase in general and administrative costs last quarter was 14% year on year, and its general and administrative expense cost ratio is less than 9% - and Adobe is growing a bit faster than Salesforce.Overall, Adobe makes GAAP operating margins of 28%, while Salesforce cannot get much beyond breakeven GAAP operating income. That, I believe, has been and remains the issue that is holding back the progress of the shares, and is likely to continue to do so. And it makes valuation comparisons somewhat less meaningful than might otherwise be the case. But that said, read below for an analysis of how the numbers, both GAAP and non-GAAP, actually look.Salesforce has a current market capitalization of $74.4 billion. It is facing a rising level of outstanding shares, which grew by 3.2% year on year. This is what happens when stock-based comp is high and rising. Net cash is currently at $2.5 billion. That yields an enterprise value of about $72 billion. With forward 12-month sales reasonably projected at $11.5 billion, the EV/S is 6.3X. Given the continued strong revenue growth of the company, I think the EV/S is not an outlier and actually may be below the average ratio of EV/S plotted against expected revenue growth.Salesforce has a P/E of 62X based on the consensus for forward non-GAAP earnings. That isn’t particularly an outlier as those things go. Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), for example, with just slightly faster estimated top line growth, has a P/E of about 130X, again based on non-GAAP earnings. The problem for me, and I imagine many other analysts/investors, is that this company has no GAAP earnings and no prospects of achieving GAAP earnings anytime soon. That might have been OK if there were some indication that the use of stock-based comp was slowing, but quite the opposite is the case.Salesforce is a relatively mature company in the sense that it has 25k employees, a huge infrastructure and, at this point, a large base of users and deferred revenues. It is the failure to see any trends in terms of expense management at this point that I find troublesome. As I write this article this afternoon, several other hyper-growth companies are reporting their numbers. Most of these companies, with one glaring exception, do not make non-GAAP profits - and yet, I have written articles recommending their shares. The major difference, as I see it, without going through a detailed discussion, is that the companies that have reported today are showing encouraging GAAP expense trends. Until I see that happen at Salesforce, I simply have to point out to investors my perspective, albeit one that is not in congruence with that of almost all other publishing analysts.Salesforce has maintained its cash flow forecast for the full fiscal year, although certainly it ran ahead of that metric last quarter. Overall, the company is forecasting that it will see CFFO of a bit over $2.6 billion. Last year, capex was a bit more than $450 million, and it is has grown by 59% year to date. I assume that the cadence of cap ex increase will decline going through the year, but regardless, I think the company’s most likely free cash flow metric will be in the range of $2 billion. Even ramping that level up to project forward 12-month results still doesn’t provide for a free cash flow yield of much above 3%.For this writer, the sources of changes in cash flow are as important as the actual level of CFFO. So far this year, stock-based comp has represented 32% of CFFO. This compares to 28% of CFFO in the prior year. Put another way, the increase in stock-based comp was 53% of the growth in CFFO over the last 6 months. The other major items contributing to the increase in cash flow for the year to date are balance sheet items which are likely to show seasonal reversals before the end of the year. At this point, the items that would represent the best ""quality"" components of an increase in CFFO, deferred revenue balances and GAAP net income have not contributed to the increase in CFFO.I think it is reasonable to question just how much investors might be willing to pay for growth in cash flow that is generated by increased levels of stock-based comp, coupled with balance sheet items that cannot persist and are likely to reverse before the end of the current fiscal year.Investing, at least for me, is an exercise in considering alternatives. No doubt the results that this company posted were strong, albeit against somewhat weak year-earlier sales performance. And no doubt, the company’s revenue-generating outlook remains as strong as has ever been the case. But to a certain extent, with the shares already recommended by 40 out of 45 analysts who cover the name, the kind of performance that was posted by the company is the kind of performance investors have come to expect. At some point, I think investors are likely to do the calculations about the fundamental basis of earnings and take note of the lack of a trend toward expense management. I will continue to avoid these shares - not because of any disdain toward the company and its business outlook, but because of its decision not to focus on any kind of GAAP margin goal as a part of running the business."
4101283,103480,2017-08-23T10:46:23-04:00,"Salesforce posted $2.56B in Q2 revenue (+26% y/y), an acceleration over the prior quarter's 25% growth. Revenue beat expectations by $50 million.Quarterly revenue notched its highest level in Salesforce's history and implies a $10 billion run rate, the largest of any cloud application.Management raised FY18 guidance to $10.35B - $10.40B, up $100 million on both ends of the range compared to the prior quarter.Despite these achievements, Salesforce stock traded flat after-hours and remains reasonably valued on an EV/FTM revenues basis, significantly below other high-growth peers.","Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the largest cloud applications vendor, posted strong Q2 earnings after the bell on August 22, delivering the ""beat-and-raise"" that tech investors hold their breath for.For the first time in Salesforce's history, the company is on a $10B run rate - and Marc Benioff commented on the press release that this quarter proved Salesforce is on track for $20B - a target that Benioff has mentioned and affirmed time and again.Despite these beats, Salesforce is down small in after hours trading. Recall that Salesforce has consistently beaten earnings in every quarter of its life as a public company, and perhaps investors were hoping for a bigger beat.Regardless, the stock is still cheap at ~6x forward earnings. Generalist investors who rely on Salesforce's P/E ratio in the 400's and declare it absurdly overvalued are mistaken. Salesforce, unlike many other cloud companies, is profitable to begin with - and a large portion of its operating expenses is discretionary. The company chooses to continue investing in sales and marketing to fuel its growth, and at any point it can decide to scale back on this spend and generate wider profit margins (it has done this in the past, but decided to return to growth mode).With gross margins of 74% as of Q2, and still best-in-class in the industry, Salesforce is a long play in the software industry, and capable of immense profits when it chooses to begin capturing operating leverage. Many investors are currently betting against this titan and pioneer of the cloud industry, which creates a buying opportunity for a stock that has consistently marched upward through the years, on the back of strong results like this one.Let's run through Salesforce's Q2 highlights:The number to focus on, as with all high-growth software companies, is the top line. It's impossible to overstate the importance of Salesforce's top-line acceleration, as well as put it into context of its full-year guidance. Salesforce delivered 25% and 26% growth in Q1 and Q2, respectively, while the company is guiding to 23-24% total revenue growth in Q3 and Q4. Recall that the back half of the year, Q4 especially, tends to be stronger than the first half due to the expiration of IT budgets and the end-of-year buying pattern among enterprise CIOs. The relative outperformance in the first half relative to full-year guidance implies that Salesforce is well set-up to deliver results well in excess go guidance through the rest of the year.Now drilling into guidance:The pattern of steadily raising guidance is typical of Salesforce. It's a company that manages earnings well and has delivered beat-and-raise quarters without fail. Expect guidance in this quarter to be slightly soft compared to management's actual predictions, and for that guidance to come up slightly next quarter. This continual increase in guidance has acted as an important engine for the company's stock.Now turning to the intangibles:Each of Salesforce's cloud product families continued to grow nicely in Q2 - Marketing Cloud, in particular, reached $1B in run rate for the first time this quarter. The success of Salesforce's applications across many markets has given its brand a vaunted presence in the software industry and given it multiple levers for growth.Sales Cloud grew 17%, an acceleration over last quarter; Service Cloud grew 21%; Platform grew 32%; and Marketing Cloud grew 36%. See chart below:Figure 1. Salesforce Q2 revenue by productThe growth in Platform and Marketing Cloud is especially important, as they increasingly contribute more to growth (on both a dollar and percentage basis) as Sales Cloud, and to a lesser degree Service Cloud, become more saturated in the market. Still, as I have written in a previous article, new AI capabilities within those applications are driving increased billings and reinvigorating their growth.Salesforce also remains committed to delivering 125-150bps of operating leverage improvement in FY18. While this may seem meaningless for a company whose earnings per share are in the pennies, it's important to recognize that 150bps of profit attainment in a $10B revenue company means $150 million in incremental profits in one year, which is certainly a sizable addition to the company's cash generation. Salesforce is on track to continue delivering a carefully measured amount of operating leverage improvement each year, while still focusing primarily on growth.Unbilled deferred revenues (a measure of Salesforce's backlog extending beyond one year), reached over $10B as well, up 30% y/y. A strong long-term pipeline (even though the bookings haven't been converted into billings yet) is a strong signal for continued top-line performance.There's a lot to like coming out of Salesforce's first quarter, but for some reason, the market can't seem to love the stock.CRM data by YChartsSalesforce's valuation currently sits below its historical averages (see orange line above) despite the mild run-up in the stock, thanks to accelerating revenue growth that keeps the EV/FTM revenue multiple at fair levels. Recall that other high-growth software companies that post similar growth rates and worse profitability commonly trade at multiples of 7+. Workday (NYSE: WDAY), in particular, has perennially traded at 9x or above.Salesforce is the banner name in enterprise software, and investors would be wise to build a position for the long-term and wait for profitability to materialize in concert with continued growth across product lines.The next major catalyst for the stock is in November, when the company hosts its annual Dreamforce conference and typically makes large product announcements."
4101229,68315,2017-08-23T08:53:32-04:00,"Salesforce continues to grow at a strong pace.Off balance sheet unbilled deferred revenues are a source of future sales gains.The company is not very profitable, and investors should not take its non-GAAP results at face value.Salesforce could be a good investment, but only if it manages to increase its margins substantially.","Salesforce (CRM) is a high growth company that is not very profitable, though -- especially when we do not take the company's non-GAAP results at face value. Shares are rather expensive, but the growth could justify the current share price in the long run.Salesforce beat earnings as well as revenue estimates with its second quarter results that were announced on Tuesday evening:What immediately jumps out is the company's high revenue growth rate of 26% year over year -- Salesforce now has breached the $10 billion annual revenue run rate level for the first time.Due to Salesforce's subscription based business model the company has a huge amount of deferred revenues on its balance sheet:Deferred revenues of $4.8 billion were down $700 million from the beginning of the year, but up 26% year over year as well. Even better, the company's unbilled deferred revenues (contracted, but unbilled), which are not visible in Salesforce's balance sheet, were up 30% yoy to more than $10 billion.The high billed and unbilled deferred revenues, and their respective growth rates, show that Salesforce will be able to continue to grow its top line considerably over the coming quarters (and very likely also over the next couple of years): Management has stated that the company is on a clear path to hitting $20 billion in annual sales going forward.Despite Salesforce's strong top line growth, its profitability is rather meager: The company earned $0.33 per share in Q2, and that is only when we look at the non-GAAP results. Adjustments to GAAP results can make sense in some cases (i.e. one time costs for takeovers or one time gains on asset sales), but not everything should be excluded. Let's look at the adjustments Salesforce is making:From GAAP net earnings of $18 million the company got to adjusted net earnings of $241 million -- there is quite a difference between the two earnings numbers. The first major adjustment Salesforce makes is the amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash item that does not directly affect shareholders (except for a small book value reduction, but companies such as Salesforce are not valued based on their book value anyways).I feel that adjusting for that non-cash item is valid, and investors will likely continue to see more adjustments like that one going forward -- after all Salesforce still holds $1 billion in intangible purchased assets as well as more than $7 billion in goodwill on its balance sheet.The next big item Salesforce adjusts for is stock-based compensation: That is a non-cash item as well, but one that heavily affects Salesforce's owners -- the issuance of stocks and options to Salesforce's management and employees massively dilutes current shareholders, thus these expenses are very relevant for the company's owners.CRM Shares Outstanding data by YChartsOver the last ten years Salesforce's share count is up more than fifty percent -- if not for that massive dilution, shares would be trading at $140 right now (assuming the market cap would be equal to what it is today). We see that those stock-based compensation expenses heavily affect the returns shareholders are seeing, thus I feel it seems justified to not exclude those expenses. When we back out that item, Salesforce's non-GAAP net income would have been $67 million (or less than $300 million on an annualized basis) -- this shows that Salesforce's profitability is not very strong.Earnings are not the only way to value a company though, and based on other metrics Salesforce looks less expensive:CRM PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe company trades at 5.3 times next year's revenues, which is a little bit more expensive than the valuations of peers such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) -- those do not possess Salesforce's strong growth rates though.Based on a sales multiple basis Salesforce thus does not look very expensive yet, it is only slightly more expensive than peers that are growing at a slower pace -- if Salesforce could get its profitability up and earn the margins that Microsoft is earning, Salesforce would be attractive at the current level.Due to profitability being low (and even when we look at non-GAAP numbers, most of those earnings are made up by issuing shares to employees) that is a bet on the future though, and it is not at all a sure thing that Salesforce's margins will one day come anywhere close to the margins some of its peers are generating.Right now Salesforce is a high growth company, whose revenues, deferred revenues and unbilled deferred revenues are growing fast. It is quite foreseeable that the company's top line will continue to grow at a strong pace, but there is not much that lands in shareholders' hands -- neither in the form of growing equity on Salesforce's balance sheet, nor via stockholder returns in the form of dividends or buybacks.The constant share count dilution hinders share price growth, and right now Salesforce looks rather speculative: If the company can get its margins up, it could be a strong long term investment, but if profitability does not increase substantially, the company's strong sales growth rates are not beneficial for the company's owners.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and would like to read more from me, you can hit the ""Follow"" button to get informed about new articles.

Salesforce.com's (CRM) stock was recently down some 1.8% in premarket trading on what I believe to be yet another case of rich valuation pushing investors to cash in some of their chips despite robust performance -- exactly as I had called out yesterday.Credit: company's event pageOn the results of the quarter, the company once again impressed by delivering double-digit growth in all four cloud verticals, as I anticipated. Each of the three main geographic areas also posted over 20% growth, not unlike last quarter. On the deferred revenue side, a 26% YOY increase pushed the total balance to a sizable $4.8 billion that is nearly twice as large as 2Q17's total revenues, matching last quarter's growth pace.Farther down the P&L, GAAP gross margins on the much larger subscription and support side of the business reached 79.1%, a slight decrease compared to last year's 80.0% that I don't find concerning. More importantly, GAAP opex as a percentage of revenues declined once again, after a slight increase in fiscal 1Q18: 71.8% vs. 72.6% in fiscal 2Q17. As I have argued in the past and contrary to what many growth investors might find important, I would be more comfortable investing in CRM if the company was able to start producing positive GAAP net profits on a consistent basis as soon as possible. Controlling marketing costs and other opex items, in my view, is a key piece of this puzzle.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsElsewhere, cash flow from ops reached $1.6 billion in the first half of the fiscal year and compared favorably to $1.3 billion in 1H17. As a result of strong cash generation, gross cash now amounts to $3.5 billion, representing a bit over 5% of the company's total market cap.On the guidance side, expectations have improved on top- and bottom-line performance for the full fiscal year. Revenues are estimated to come in at $10.4 billion vs. consensus $10.3 billion, while current non-GAAP EPS outlook of $1.30 now matches Street's expectations. But considering the beat on fiscal 2Q18 expectations and a strong fiscal 3Q18 guidance, management's full year projections might prove to be too conservative. Largely as a result of heavy share-based compensation expenses, GAAP EPS is still expected to be barely noticeable: $0.08 for the full year at the mid-point of the guidance range (yes, CRM trades at 1,160x forward GAAP earnings).Salesforce.com delivered yet another outstanding quarter, although not to my surprise. Investors who believe in the story should be thoroughly pleased by the results, as the company seems to be heading in the right direction.However, not much has changed regarding my thoughts on the stock. CRM still trades at a rich forward earnings multiple of about 70x (2.6x forward PEG), which I believe could get in the way of the stock breaching into $100/share territory after such a strong print. In my projections, I see salesforce.com easily producing $1.5 billion in GAAP op profits by fiscal 2021. But even those results might not be quite good enough to justify a current market cap of nearly $70 billion.I continue to like Salesforce as a company, but not so much the stock.

4101165,52852,2017-08-23T01:10:07-04:00,"Earnings beat on most key metrics.Guidance was good overall, however Q3 billing guidance was below expectation.The fundamentals appears to be strong and the call was bullish so I expect the stock to bounce back from weakness.","Salesforce.com, inc. (CRM) reported FY2Q17 earnings on 08/22/2017, after the close. Overall, the print isn't as strong as I would like so I anticipate the stock will weaken slightly on 8/23 and then likely bounce right back (like last quarter) since the fundamentals appears fine and the call sounded bullish.Revenue for the quarter came in at $2.56B, slightly ahead of consensus of $2.52B, while EPS beat by 1 penny at $0.33 per share.Digging a bit deeper into the press release, ending deferred revenue beat estimates at $4.82B vs $4.69B consensus, and billing came in at $2.34B vs $2.17B consensus, implying a 26% y/y and 15% q/q growth rate. Unbilled deferred revenue was $10.4B, up 30% y/y. Non-GAAP operating margins was 14.9% for the quarter, which beat consensus estimates by ~600 bps -- not bad. Operating cash flow was strong at $331.3M vs. an expectation of $268.7M.Guidance, however, was a bit more mixed. Q3 guidance was slightly ahead at $2.64-2.65B vs. $2.61B consensus, while EPS was guided to $0.36-37 vs $0.35 consensus. For the FY (FY18 ended January 2018), revenue was guided to $10.35-10.40B vs $10.29B consensus, while EPS was guided to in-line at $1.29-1.30 vs $1.30 consensus. However, Q3 billing was guided to an implied $1.93-1.98B which is below consensus of $2.17B.The Call In the call, the CEO began by taking a political stand against hate groups, which most of the analysts applauded. That's the most interesting thing about the call because boy it was boring (as in nothing really new is being introduced). Interestingly, but unimportantly, the CEO noted that CRM is now the 1st enterprise cloud software company in history to reach the $10B revenue run-rate. It's good to know for your next cocktail party. Also, the CEO highlighted the importance of its AI technology, Einstein, which he described as ""a game changer"". Later in the call, the CEO said Einstien ""has hugely exceeded our expectations. And I would say from my perspective, it's already a material part of our results."" This is a material statement to me. (I have written about the importance of AI and cannot over emphasize how important it is -- make sure to check out my Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) AI articles for more information on the importance of AI to other tech giants.)It is clear that CRM is investing heavily in international markets. The COO noted that 40% of CRM's new hires this year have been outside of the US, and they went live on AWS in Canada in Q2. Later in the call, management described their international growth levers as ""just executing beautifully right now.""In the question section, we get a sense of what's on investors' minds (since sell side guys receives buy side questions after earnings, which sell side analysts are tasked with putting it in a more polite way -- that's just my experience on the buy side at least). It is pretty clear that Q2 is a boring quarter considering that the 1st question was on having an easier FX compare in the second half -- I really wish those guys could take care of those housekeeping questions for off the call.While earnings and guidance mostly came in ahead of expectations, Q3's billing was a bit weak vs. expectations. However, the call sounded bullish to me, with no notable execution, competitive or market issues -- it was in fact a very boring call from a ""news"" perspective. That is my impression at least - if you disagree (or if you agree) please let me know in the comment section. In conclusion, CRM is still the beast that it has always been. I simply don't see much for bears and bulls to fight over."

Analysts expect revenue of $2.51 billion and EPS of $0.32. The revenue estimate implies 23% growth Y/Y. Investors should focus on the following key items:Saleforce delivers enterprise software through the cloud that focuses on customer relationship management (""CRM""). Salesforce allows its clients to interact with their own customers via mobile devices, through the cloud, Internet of Things (""IoT""), etc. It derives revenue from subscription fees from customers accessing its enterprise cloud computing services and from professional and training services. The lion's share of its revenue is derived from subscription services. Therefore, its deferred revenue and/or backlog is a key metric to determine what is future revenue will look like. The following chart outlines the company's historical deferred revenue and Y/Y growth:Growth in deferred revenue over the past six quarters has consistently exceeded 20% and was as high as 31% for the quarter ended April 30, 2016. On a dollar basis deferred revenue was over $5.0 billion for the quarter ended April 2017, and its growth has been highly-correlated with revenue growth. If the company meets revenue and earnings estimates, but deferred revenue disappoints or its growth falls far below previous growth rates then it could hurt sentiment.Another metric that connotes the strength of the company's backlog is unbilled deferred revenue. It represents unbilled future bookings that have not been invoiced. At April 30, 2017, it was $9.6 billion, up 26% Y/Y.Some of the company's growth has been through acquisition. In calendar year 2016 the company made at least nine acquisitions, mostly in the artificial intelligence space. The acquisition of Demandware which provides e-commerce services was rather sizable at around $2.8 billion. It could take at least a year to integrate so many acquisitions, so the company's operating income margins could be skewed.I previously thought its gross margin would be less impacted by merger integration costs. The company's gross margin declined to 72.8% for the quarter end April 30, 2017 versus 74.1% in the year earlier period. The diminution in gross margin has not become a point of contention as of yet. The cost for growth through acquisition could be a hit to the company's long-term gross margins. CRM is priced to perfection. I suspect the company will meet or exceed expectations this quarter. However, its gross margins could be an area of focus in the second half of the year or early next year."

Should Salesforce.com beat top-line expectations of $2.51 billion, it will have done so for the tenth straight quarter since January 2015. EPS is expected to come in at $0.31 which, if achieved, would represent a healthy YOY improvement of 29%.Credit: Salesforce DevelopersI will not be surprised to see, once again, robust double-digit growth across Salesforce.com's cloud verticals and geographic segments. The company appears to be scaling very well and maintaining a good cadence of strong yet consistent top-line performance. In terms of comp headwinds, the lapping of Demandware's July 2016 acquisition should make fiscal 2Q18 look a bit less impressive compared to the past few quarters. But I believe the lapping effect should have been fully accounted for in sales growth estimates of 23%, the lowest expected increase since 2015.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsVery importantly in my mind will be whether Salesforce.com will be able to keep GAAP operating expenses under check (see chart above). While many growth investors choose not to emphasize margin improvement for as long as revenue growth continues to be healthy, Salesforce.com's rich cost base (recurring opex represented 73% of revenues last quarter) is one of the key reasons why I keep an arm's length distance from the stock. I would prefer to see this 18-year old company, no puppy by Silicon Valley standards, finally produce positive GAAP net profits on a consistent basis before considering its impressive $65 billion market cap justified.For a while now, I have been cautious on CRM. This is not to say that I'm bearish on the company and its prospects. But I find (1) the stock richly valued in the high double-digit P/E territory while (2) the company fails to trim recurring opex to improve profitability. Today, I continue to have the same concerns, even if the stock has inched +13% (in line with the broad market) since I first wrote a rather skeptical article about it, a bit over a year ago.Source: YChartsTo be fair, on the comparison against its fast-growing, software-based peer group, CRM's valuation might appear reasonable to some (see first graph above). If taking into account long-term EPS growth, CRM in fact trades at a relatively modest forward PEG of 2.6x that compares favorably to Splunk's (SPLK) 3.1x and Workday's (WDAY) 4.5x. One question in my mind, however, is whether even a strong print will pack enough of a punch to propel CRM much higher above current levels. Valuation has expanded over the past six months by nearly 10 turns on a forward earnings basis, back to 70x, since February 2017. And as I have observed recently, the current earnings season has been marked by stocks that failed to gain much lift even in the face of solid financial results. Case in point, peer ServiceNow (NOW) has seen shares trade sideways since the company reported a beat-and-raise late in July.After weighing the pros and the cons, I continue to stay away from this stock, even as I recognize that Salesforce.com's prospects appear to be solid. Shares seem to be fully valued and, in my view, will be challenged to push past the $100 mark in the immediate future.Note from the author: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow DM Martins Research.

4099107,103480,2017-08-15T13:19:07-04:00,"Despite rising valuations across the broad software and technology industry, Salesforce has traded stubbornly under 6x forward revenues, a bargain price to pay for its growth, scale, and relative profitability.The low multiple highlights investors' fear that Salesforce's market share has already reached a peak, and growth in its core cloud apps (especially Sales Cloud) will be constrained going forward.Salesforce Einstein, launched in Spring 2017 and embedded into Salesforce's core products, has already seen multiple high-profile deployments and adds new life to Salesforce's growth story.Einstein's applied AI capabilities offer revolutionary features that no other CRM can match.We'd recommend capitalizing on any pullback in the stock to build a position before AI-driven growth starts having material impacts on Salesforce's financials.","Artificial intelligence and machine learning, despite occasional scorn for being hyped-up buzzwords, are nevertheless two of the hottest topics in technology and the fields in highest demand within computer science. AI is not a new concept - Alan Turing worked on it in the 1950s - but for most of its history, it has remained largely an academic and theoretical concept, and not until IBM (NYSE: IBM) released Watson was there any ""real"" application of the technology.With Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) Einstein's release in Spring 2017, artificial intelligence has entered into the mainstream - not as a grad school thesis or as a niche experiment by a stealth startup, but as a user-friendly technology accessible to the millions of salespeople, marketers, and managers using a Salesforce application.Einstein is not a standalone product; it does not itself generate any revenue - essentially, it's an update to the majority of Salesforce's existing applications that make them smarter and more efficient. Einstein is a true platform technology, capable of powering and conceiving a plethora of other applications as the underlying, critical engine.This article will seek to reinforce the thesis that Salesforce's growth is not stale; rather, Einstein is just beginning to kick up a new growth spurt, and that investors should be paying a premium multiple for this proven software asset with multiple industry-leading cloud applications. Properly valued, Salesforce should trade around 7x forward revenues, more in-line with historical multiples, implying a price target of $107.Figure 1. Einstein promotional material, Salesforce websiteEinstein is a new embedded feature within Salesforce's existing suite of cloud apps, intended to leverage the internal data to make predictive recommendations for users. Salesforce had been interested in AI for a long time prior to launching Einstein - it quietly acquired deep learning startup Metamind in 2016 - always with the goal of shifting the focus from research and theory to practical applications.Here are a few examples of how Einstein functions within Salesforce products:As evident from the growing list of use cases and acquisition targets that comprise this platform, Salesforce had been driving plenty of resources, both organic and inorganic, toward the Einstein rollout.The relevant piece of information for investors: Einstein is priced as an add-on to most existing applications, though some basic features are bundled with certain applications like Community Cloud. For a non-free example: Einstein costs $50/user/month to use in conjunction with Sales Cloud. This compares to the standard pricing of $150/user/month for the Enterprise edition of Sales Cloud (other options include Professional for $75 or Unlimited for $300).Einstein effectively increases annual billings by 33% for Sales Cloud customers who opt in. For investors who had been fearing that Salesforce's core product was going to encounter a growth slowdown, Einstein is their answer.Figure 2. Einstein for Sales Cloud ($50/user/mo) in actionThis all sounds good in theory, but who's actually using this thing? Fortunately, there are a few large public deployments of Einstein that both validate the appeal of the technology for potential customers and prove the revenue impact of the product for investors. Here are a couple of examples:As can be seen from the above examples (and there are many more), Einstein acts as both a gateway into new relationships like Airbus as well as a way to squeeze more juice out of existing relationships like U.S. Bank. A unique asset like Einstein is a powerful tool for a software company like Salesforce that is already dominant in almost every market it competes in.It's no secret that Sales Cloud, Salesforce's anchor product, is losing some of its growth steam, which is part of the reason investors shy away from valuing Salesforce too richly. After all, it is already the most-used CRM application in the market. See below a chart from Salesforce's recent investor presentation outlining Sales Cloud's chart-topping market share:Figure 3. Sales Cloud market share evolution Having already cornered more than twice as much market share as its next-closest competitor (Oracle's (NYSE: ORCL) offerings include Oracle Sales Cloud and its legacy on-premise counterpart, Siebel), Sales Cloud has a tough road ahead, and the easiest avenue to continued growth is continued innovation.A value-added feature like Einstein, not seen anywhere in the competition, can help Salesforce finally pry away loyal users of Microsoft Dynamics (NASDAQ: MSFT) or Oracle Sales Cloud. It also bumps up billings for longtime customers who want to try on Einstein and upgrade their experience.With Sales Cloud comprising roughly a third of Salesforce's revenues, its continued growth is vital to the longevity of the company. Salesforce began reporting revenues by product line in 2015, and you can see Sales Cloud's growth tapering off and being overtaken by other products in 2016/2017:Figure 4. Salesforce revenue by productNote: professional services revenue (what Salesforce earns for installations and consulting) is not included and the product totals do not sum up to total revenues.In recent years, Salesforce has relied on its smaller clouds and its platform capabilities to drive its >20% topline growth Recall that Marc Benioff has pledged to hit $20 billion in revenues in ""a few years"", and to maintain >20% growth. Listing four key criteria to hitting this milestone, Benioff emphasized the importance of Einstein AI as a platform technology and as the engine that can drive Salesforce's future.Indeed, Sales Cloud growth stalled to 10% and 13% for the full years FY16 and FY17, respectively, but actually saw acceleration to 14% in 1Q18. No doubt some of this acceleration was due to the introduction of Einstein.Hovering around $90/share and seemingly unable to break past that ceiling, Salesforce is trading at an unassuming <6.0x forward revenues. Part of the reason that investors under appreciate Salesforce is their fear that Salesforce's own market dominance means that >20% growth cannot continue forever, and once Salesforce posts a missed quarter, the stock will lose all luster.This thinking, however, grossly undervalues the potential of Einstein. With its proven ability (as seen by recent high-profile deployments) to supercharge existing customers and land big new ones, Einstein - not just a blessing for Sales Cloud, but the entire application suite - reinforces and extends Salesforce's position as the leader in SaaS applications. Just as Microsoft's continued innovation in operating systems has made Windows the industry standard in its sphere, Salesforce's groundbreaking push into applied, non-theoretical artificial intelligence helps strengthen its position as the industry standard in enterprise applications.CRM data by YChartsWith shares trading below its historical average (on an EV/FTM revenues basis), and with Q2 earnings coming up on August 22, investors should use this opportunity to build a position in Salesforce before its revived growth potential becomes apparent again. Recall that 6x is not a particularly demanding valuation for a massive software company that generates strong operating cash flow - Salesforce's large-cap SaaS peers Workday (NYSE: WDAY) and ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) trade perennially at multiples between 8-10x, despite not having a splashy product introduction like Einstein in years.Salesforce has an unsullied record of beating expectations - it posts a beat-and-raise quarter every quarter without fail - and the combination of muted expectations for Sales Cloud's growth trajectory and the potential for an Einstein-driven snapback make Salesforce a comfortable long in the software space."
4089071,103373,2017-07-20T12:39:54-04:00,"Salesforce.com brought SaaS mainstream and beat out some very large competition.Its lead has been maintained despite heavy competition from multiple directions.Does its market dominance justify investing in the company, or is there more than meets the eye?","Salesforce.com (CRM) gets a lot of credit for its stupendous growth rate as the company keeps doubling its revenue at an alarming frequency, but the company doesn’t actually get enough credit for the number one position it holds in the steadily growing customer relationship management (CRM) software market.There are several reasons Salesforce.com’s lead in the CRM market - a sub-segment of the enterprise software market - looks unassailable.For starters, though we look up to companies like Amazon (AMZN), IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) for bringing cloud computing to the enterprise doorstep, it was actually Salesforce.com that took the software as a service market mainstream. It disrupted the traditional annual licensing model with a much easier pay-as-you-go model that reduced upfront costs and made software deployment a much easier process, because all you needed was an Internet connection and a browser to access the software on the cloud.Salesforce.com started using cloud in 1999, at a time when it was unheard of in the enterprise software industry. And it disrupted the market, its focus on staying put in the CRM market with a new deployment model allowing the company to quickly race past traditional players of the market like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) - a lead that it holds to this day.Source: GartnerAccording to Gartner, Salesforce.com held 19.7% of the CRM market in 2015. Though the numbers are yet to be released for 2016, it is reasonable to assume that Salesforce.com is still on top of the CRM world.Salesforce.com is an aggressive company. The fact that it barely makes anything at the bottom line but keeps its revenue growth at the above-20% level year after year is the clearest sign that this company puts growth above everything else.Salesforce.com often spends nearly half of its revenue on marketing and sales, and in the company’s own words, it expects the current trend of high marketing expenses in relation to revenues to continue for some more time.“We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost.” – Salesforce.com 2017 Annual ReportConsidering the rising competition with deep-pocketed software companies, spending nearly 50% of your net sales towards customer acquisition looks unsustainable. But what if someone told you that more than 90% of the customers you acquire will choose to renew the product at the end of their subscription period?From that perspective, spending half your net sales on customer acquisition doesn’t look that bad, does it? That’s because you are incurring a one-time expense to acquire a customer that has a +90% chance of renewing the service contract.This is exactly what is happening with Salesforce.com. In 2017, nine out of ten customers chose to continue with Salesforce.com, a renewal rate percentage that validates the management’s strategy and justifies its far-above-average marketing expense.As Salesforce.com’s revenue kept growing at a furious pace, the amount of money that the company was able to plough back on marketing kept growing as well. The more the money in the bag to spend, the higher the number of customers who can be brought in, and higher the number of products that can be sold.Though marketing expense as a %age of net sales dropped by a few percentage points between 2013 and 2017, in absolute dollar terms it increased from $1.614 billion to $3.918 billion in 2017.Select Financial Data from Salesforce.com 2017 Annual ReportThe question now is: is this growth strategy actually working - and sustainable?Let’s take a look at their marketing expense from another angle.In 2014, Salesforce.com spent $2,168 million towards marketing to increase its net sales by $1,020 million compared to the year before, a return of nearly 47%.In 2017, Salesforce.com spent $3,918 million in marketing in increase its sales by $1,724 million compared to the year before, a return of nearly 44%.If the competition were gaining on Salesforce.com, then the money Salesforce.com would need to spend to add each extra dollar to the top line would have gone up significantly, not just by a few percentage points.In short, acquisition cost per customer would have shot up if competition were breathing down its neck. That’s not happening.Moreover, with Salesforce.com’s revenue growing at the above 20% rate, the money available for marketing and sales also increases by 20%, which means more customers and more revenue at the top.Put that together with an extremely high retention rate and what you have is a highly sustainable business model that doesn’t actually make any money at the end of the day.That still leaves one question unanswered: how long is this sustainable for?Source: Salesforce.com BOFA- Merrill- Lynch Technology Conference PresentationWith the CRM market expected to continue its strong growth for the next five years, Salesforce.com stands to benefit immensely from that growth. There is enough room for multiple players in the market, and I expect Salesforce.com to keep its lead in the CRM market for several more years.This is not an easy investment decision to make. On the one side, high valuation could be justified by tremendous and consistent growth; on the other, there’s little to no money to give back to investors in the form of share buybacks or dividends.With growth projection looking as good as it ever was, the stock will continue to trade at a high premium. That leaves very little room for investors to benefit from capital appreciation because, at seven times sales, the market is already expecting Salesforce.com to keep its double-digit growth rate intact.Salesforce.com is a good company with a strong market position, but it is selling at a really bad price.CRM PS Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YCharts"

Olson was previously VP Products at Rally Software. Troan was previously Director at TheraSim and rPath.Below is a brief video from Salesforce about how it has used the Pendo system:(Source: Pendo io)The company’s customer base predictably includes many software-centric technology companies, as their business model success rests squarely on the ability of their customers to derive value from their software.Investors in the current deal in addition to Salesforce include lead investor Meritech Capital Partners (Rob Ward), Spark Capital, Battery Ventures, Contour Venture Partners, Core Capital Partners, and IDEA Fund Partners.Notably, most of the investor base (including Salesforce) invested in previous rounds and has continued to support Pendo’s capital needs, so indicates strong growth results and prospects for Pendo.Investment Terms and RationaleValuation for the current round was not disclosed, nor were there ‘whisper’ numbers in the tech press.Pendo has raised over $56 million in several financing rounds, with Salesforce participating in rounds A, B and now C.As the above video shows, Salesforce has been an enthusiastic user of Pendo’s user tracking and guidance technology and approach.The system was designed by product-centric people for software product-centric companies, and Pendo says its revenues quadrupled in 2016 as its customer base grew to hundreds of firms, no doubt helped by Salesforce’s testimonial.This highlights an important benefit that corporate investors such as Salesforce can bring to early stage technology companies: a ‘marquee’ customer that stands up in the industry and says ‘here is a promising new solution that we are using’ can be invaluable.Salesforce is also a ‘platform’ that many other software-centric companies use, so the effect is multiplied as word spreads that a new software company has a solution that others may use to improve their operations.The result is impressive, as Pendo stated that it ‘now tracks over 20 billion user actions and improves the product experience of over 22 million users every month.’Of course, those numbers are designed to be as large as possible, but Pendo has the chance to become a ‘category-defining company,' and now has the financial support and visibility from investors and partners such as Salesforce to propel it forward.Salesforce stands to gain an inside track by possibly influencing new product development at Pendo as well as a potential success story for its platform of offerings.It also likely has a right of first refusal for Pendo should the firm wish to sell at a later date.

4075669,98236,2017-05-23T12:07:38-04:00,"Last week, Salesforce.com reported the results of the company's fiscal Q1.It is clear that the company continues to achieve its operational goals and has gotten off to an early lead in terms of monetizing its AI platform, Einstein.But the problem is that the company is expected to be executing at a high level and to be beating the competition.The company has yet to turn the corner in terms of controlling GAAP expenditures and slipped a bit in that regard in Q1.The company's organic growth rate continues to trail off at a modest pace.","Yes, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) really did report the results of its fiscal Q1 the other day. Investors might never know that there was an earnings release in looking at Friday's share price movement. At the end of the day, the shares were down by about 0.4%. The shares were down a bit more than the IGV for the week as a whole. The earnings release really didn't seem to matter.In point of fact, the purpose of this article is to see if the progress of the shares can be correlated to anything particularly discernible in the growth of the business or if the shares have become a bit cut off from the operational performance of the company.I think that the shares are correlated with the company's performance. But while the company is performing at a high level, the high level at which it is performing already is baked into expectations. A company like this which has reached $10 billion-plus in annual run rate revenues and is still run by its founder and a very close associate of that founder (Keith Block) is by necessity a representation of the values and the personality of those men. The people who run Salesforce are committed to maximum growth and competitive success. That is not always the same as profit maximization or expense discipline. Marc Benioff is worth several billion, and while Keith Block's net worth is not of the same magnitude, his personality, after years running Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) sales, is hyper competitive and not very focused on costs.The purpose of these articles is to advise investors about the investment merits of different companies. And, part of that is looking at what investors, or at least a preponderance of them, seem to want from their investments. There is a significant cohort of investors who are focused on GAAP profitability, who abhor stock-based compensation and want to see free cash flow growth rise faster than revenues. That cohort is not likely to be happy with the performance of Salesforce in the near future.During the course of the company's conference call, management spoke to increasing its employee count by another 20% this year. While there isn't a precise correlation between employees and costs, it is a pretty decent guide. And, the company is not skimping on its other expenses. The Salesforce Tower now rising in SF will be the tallest building in that city and will wind up costing over $1 billion (Salesforce will occupy more than 50% of the space in the tower). Salesforce leased a significant amount of space (200,000 sq. ft or more?) in a building at 3 Bryant Park in Manhattan - one of the uglier structures in the city with its nasty green skin/blue skin. And, Salesforce recently leased six floors in the third tallest tower in London. The building is not particularly ugly and features a 70,000-fish aquarium. I think that the company's real estate strategy alone probably belies any expectation that costs are a point of focus at Salesforce.Over the past year, Salesforce shares have appreciated by a bit more than 7%. Over that same span, the IGV is up by more than 30%. Over that period of time, Salesforce has mainly bettered the performance it forecast. The company is now actually forecasting contracting top-line percentage growth for the balance of this year when compared to its results the last 6-7 quarters, and its GAAP earnings are forecast to be just a bit above break-even. When analysts talk about beat and raise quarters, and that indeed has been the characterization for this latest earnings release from Salesforce, they might do well to look at exactly that which they are praising.I would like to recommend Salesforce shares, and I suppose if I were a publishing analyst, the temptation to be part of the herd might be overwhelming. And, I would be the last commentator to suggest that Salesforce is following a misbegotten strategy or that its competitive position is eroding. I doubt that I would make many different decisions about strategy than has the management of this business - although I might feel that winding up atop the tallest building in San Francisco is not a really wise use of shareholder funds.There is a saying about the beer not getting colder. In a way, looking at Salesforce shares is like that. 39 of 44 publishing analysts rate it a buy, and if they have to contort normal financial metrics to develop price targets, they have been happy to do so. The company has a personal rooting machine in Jim Cramer. Mr. Benioff is a skillful promoter, and for the most part, conference calls and investor conferences are not marked by substantive exchanges.Investing in Salesforce shares fills a requirement for some institutions whose charter is to find market share leaders/gainers and to look for strong growth in a large-cap name. But that is not a requirement for most individual investors. Sometimes, the best company in terms of operational performance is not the best bargain for an individual shareholder, and I feel that this is one of those times.First of all, let's stipulate that Salesforce is a behemoth in its spaces and that it has done an excellent job in creating new spaces to dominate. It has staved off the evil day of regression to the mean for a long time and continues to struggle to do so. It has seized the opportunity of AI in a more forceful and dynamic fashion than competitors/collaborators such as IBM (NYSE:IBM). It has adopted the strategy that the enemy of my enemy, Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), is my friend. This company plays the game as well as anyone.The quarter that Salesforce reported last week was a ""strong"" one. The ""problem"" is that the results had been widely anticipated and really didn't represent a surprise to any observer. The other problem is that the company's growth in GAAP operating expenses reaccelerated, particularly on the research and development line and showed no progress in the other two categories. Some potential shareholders are waiting for the company to achieve an improved cadence in operating margins and simply are reluctant to buy the shares until they see progress. Suggesting that the company is increasing its research and development spend ratio in order to enhance it competitive moat and that the moat being built is likely to withstand competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and from Oracle is likely to be true. But not all investors accept that a company built on spending and not focused on margins or cash flow is an acceptable investment. And, therein lies the problem. The men who run Salesforce are committed to growth and to market share as first order priorities. They are far less committed to profitability and particularly less committed to GAAP profitability. That isn't going to change in the foreseeable future, I believe, and it limits the valuation of the shares to some degree.To be sure, some of the increased GAAP opex is related to the amortization of purchased intangibles, a function of the company's substantial pace of acquisitions over the past year. That is likely to abate in future quarters, unless of course the company makes additional significant acquisitions. But the increase in opex is real enough, and the guidance that the company has provided for GAAP earnings for the balance of the year doesn't suggest that controlling GAAP opex is much of a priority.On the other hand, the company continues to use substantial amounts of share-based comp as part of its cost structure which has the impact of creating a mythical level of reported earnings. While not wishing to join the debate on the subject, the fact is, that it is likely, based on the evidence at hand, that CRM shares are simply not getting credit for reported non-GAAP earnings which are built on the basis of stock-based comp. I don't want to suggest that this company is either unique or even excessive in the level of stock-based comp that it uses, but investors have seemingly refused to pay for non-GAAP EPS growth so long as GAAP EPS growth has basically stalled - and in this quarter gone backwards.The level of share-based comp as a percentage of revenues was a bit higher in fiscal 2017 than in the year before. It also showed a sequential increase as well. I have no doubt that management doesn't go out of its way to hand out stock rewards - it is a cost of doing business in a very hot job market, particularly in San Francisco. The hires going in the new towers that Salesforce has built or leased are likely to be reminded of the company's success every time they come to work and will insist on getting their share in the form of stock-based comp. But until stock-based comp shows some contraction as an expense metric, it is also likely to place a limit on the company's share valuation.Finally, the company really did not increase its guidance beyond the Q1 beat. While I don't find it particularly useful to look at those kind of metrics, if one is paying attention to the company's forecast, they will find that it is no higher for the next three quarters in EPS than it was before the earnings release. It almost certainly won't work out that way, I think, but it was another component of the inability of the shares to perform on Friday and is likely to constrain share price performance in the immediate future.A careful look at Q1 performanceQ1 performance for this company is a metaphor for its strategy. It is my impression that regardless of the reaction of the share price, management considered the operational performance of the last quarter to be exactly what it wishes to reprise on into the foreseeable future.Reported revenues increased 25% in constant currency. About 3% of that amount presumably represents Demandware leaving organic revenue growth at around 22%, the level forecast by the company for the balance of the fiscal year.At this point, the company has cash on its balance sheet of $3.2 billion. It has a convertible note that aggregates $1.1 billion which is dramatically out of the money (conversion price is $265/share) and which has a 0.25% coupon. The note is due next year. The company is forecasting that it will generate $2.6 billion in operating cash flow this year. CapEx last year was $500 million. So, it can fund the repayment of its convertible note and still have more than $4 billion available for acquisitions. I would be surprised if the company did not continue to be acquisitive and to look to accelerate its revenue growth with that kind of cash usage. Acquisitions will, to be sure, bulk up revenue growth modestly, but the kind of acquisitions this company will most likely seek will have negative impacts on margins as well. If investors are looking for sustained improvement in GAAP opex, the company's strategy is not likely to foster that kind of evolution.In the past, the derived bookings metric for Salesforce had been considered to be a telling metric. These days, it is not greatly discussed. But the fact is that while bookings growth was apparently better than some ""whisper"" number, it was less robust than used to be the case. Deferred revenue on the balance sheet rose by 27% in constant currency. Unbilled deferred revenue reached close to $10 billion and was up 26% over a year ago. About $450 million of the unbilled deferred revenue related to contracts associated with the company's Demandware subsidiary, which was acquired last summer.Just looking at the reported numbers, the growth in bookings was perhaps less than in some earlier years on a percentage basis. These days the company doesn't explicitly report bookings, but they can be readily calculated. Overall, deferred revenues didn't rise sequentially. That is one of the reasons for the relatively low (17%) increase in operating cash flow. It has been said that bookings significantly exceeded ""whisper"" expectations of low teens growth. Perhaps expectations really were for low teens growth in bookings, but it would be hard to validate that expectation looking at the share price before the earnings release. The company has forecast another quarter of relatively slow growth in bookings (17%). Much of that is the result of seasonality. Almost all of the company's contracts incorporate annual billings terms and the annual billing is typically either the first of the year or the first of the fiscal year for CRM. In addition, bookings are heavily dependent on the length of contract terms - the basic reason why many companies using SaaS revenue models have abandoned forecasting them on an explicit basis. It would, I think, be more transparent, if the company reported changes in ARR as a reasonable proxy for adjusted bookings - as it does not do so, one has to take the company's commentary at its face that 17% bookings growth is not an issue and hope that the metric re-accelerates as forecast in the balance of the year.As the CFO pointed out, over the years, the cadence of bookings has tended to be more and more seasonal and relates to the annual renewal billings that are heavily weighted at the end of the calendar year or the end of the company's fiscal year. That doesn't matter as much year on year.Overall, the on and off balance sheet buckets of deferred revenues has grown from $11.6 billion to $14.6 billion, including the $450 million of deferred revenue balance acquired through the acquisition of Demandware. That is 26% growth and about 23% organic growth and is certainly a strong number. The ""problem"" that the company is encountering, however, is that organic growth was 29% the prior year. I think that if deferred revenue growth continues to fall in percentage terms, it will be another tailwind in terms of share price valuation.As mentioned, GAAP expenses continued to rise. Sequential growth was highest in research and development, which was up 9% over the prior quarter. The company CFO suggested that some of the reason for the rapid increase in research and development spending was a reclassification of certain expenses from sales and marketing to research and development. Maybe, although it is hard to see that looking at all the numbers. Certainly, there was no improvement in GAAP expense ratios in sales and marketing, and that is a bit curious given the muted increase in bookings this past quarter. I am, myself, more inclined to believe that much of the speed-up in research and development expense relates to the build-out of the company's capabilities in AI (Einstein) and the staffing of a couple of the company's acquisitions in that area in the new fiscal year.The CFO said that CRM is in good shape overall (on expenses), but forward guidance is what it is, and even though it is set up to be beaten, it certainly does nothing to suggest that GAAP expenses are a significant concern for the company. Again, while I think that trying to stretch out the company's product footprint and technology leadership is an appropriate strategy, it is doing very little for the short-term share valuation.How smart is Einstein?OK, very smart. AI is fantastic technology and from much of what I have read and anecdotal checks I have been able to make, Salesforce probably has the most commercially viable set of solutions in the space. Basically, CRM sells AI as additional capabilities within three of its four clouds. I have heard of some very specific success stories within the sales cloud where the company consummated a significant sales cycle in less than a month and the customers have enjoyed an incredible time to benefit metrics as well. While I have mentioned and cited slowing growth as an issue for investors, I do believe that the modest growth improvement in the sales cloud, which grew 14% last quarter, an increase in growth percentage of about 80bps compared to both the prior quarter and the prior year, has something to do with the early success of AI solutions.Essentially, AI is being used at this point to tell sales people who they should be calling, when they should call, and what they should offer. It really isn't science fiction and enterprises are happy to use a technology like this to improve the productivity of their sales teams. If nothing else, being able to offer a CRM solution that is embellished with AI expands the moat, enlarges the TAM, and changes the character of the conversation from price to functionality. Many customers have heard about digital transformation without the slightest understanding of what that might mean for their business. CRM has moved quickly to exploit its set of solutions and seems to have found a responsive chord amongst both current and prospective customers. Obviously, AI can impact the utility of Service Cloud substantially, and over time, it will become the heart of Commerce Cloud as well.I think it is fair to say that Salesforce is doing an excellent job in terms of developing a strategy, creating solutions that implement the strategy, and in terms of its ability to sell its vision. It is executing well in each of the major product areas that it calls clouds. And, it is doing well in all of the geos - last quarter, its European revenue growth in constant currency reached 29%. But when you carefully look at the numbers, either in isolation or holistically, the percentage growth trend is slowly moderating.There are observers from time to time who keep wondering if Salesforce is going to be hit by market share losses, particularly in its sales cloud. Will AI be able to staunch the company's revenue growth moderation? Those are basically two questions. I think it is clear that Salesforce will continue to grow a bit more rapidly than the overall market for CRM solutions. The overall market is growing at about 12%, and Salesforce is growing around 14%-plus, and Salesforce Einstein is going to bulk up those numbers going forward.But as to the second question, I think the answer, at least at this point, is probably not. There really aren't enough data points and results to be dispositive on the subject. And, I doubt that situated as I am, that I ought to second guess management. It is, after all, able to second guess its own sales forecasts these days using Einstein. And, that brings me to the reasonable valuation for a company whose most likely growth trajectory will be to grow in the high teens percentage for the next several years.ValuationSalesforce is not a company with some kind of egregious valuation - unless all tech stocks are thought to have an egregious valuation. But that is not something to be considered in this article. At this point, with the shares closing at $88.70 and with the company reporting that it has 721.5 million shares outstanding, the market capitalization is $64 billion. (I am not going to use the potential dilution that might take place if all of the outstanding options are exercised, although some will point out that it is additional dilution. The average exercise price of the options is something on the order of $50/shares, and for those who wish to pursue that line, it is easy to calculate from the information in the filings. But most people do not use that metric and so neither will I). The company has a net cash position of about $1.4 billion, which takes the enterprise value to about $62.6 billion. The company is forecasting revenues of $10.3 billion. With those revenues, the EV/S calculates to be about 6.1X. While a metric of 6X EV/S does not make Salesforce an outlier in the world of companies with a SaaS revenue model, it is quite a bit above the mean relationship that can be plotted between growth and EV/S valuation.I will include the P/E calculation because it is used by many, not because I find it of great importance. Unless and until the company starts to improve GAAP profitability, whether it is reasonable to do so or not, investors will not give the company credit for chimerical non-GAAP earnings that are rising while GAAP earnings remain stuck just above breakeven. But in any event, the P/E based on the current $1.30 non-GAAP EPS forecast is 68X. The P/E based on the current consensus First Call consensus projection for fiscal 2019 is 53X. I doubt that anyone buying or recommending the shares these days is doing so because of logic that says the P/E is some bargain.So, finally, we come to the main event, free cash flow. I have actually seen one price target set by an analyst valuing the shares at precisely 23.7X CFFO. I admire the precision if not the product. The company is forecasting that CFFO for this year will reach $2.6 billion. The company doesn't forecast capex, but it was $463 million last year. It seems likely that given the expenses involved in fitting out some of the company's office addition, it might be reasonable to believe that capex could reach $600 million leaving free cash flow at $2 billion.Needless to say, the biggest unknown when it comes to forecasting cash flow for this company, relates to the change in deferred revenue. Einstein or not, forecasting changes in deferred revenue balances are tricky and relate to some elements not really controllable by the company. The company really has neither a lever nor an incentive to move that metric. Last quarter, deferred revenue balances fell more than they had the year before, and that constrained the increase in CFFO to 17%. On the other hand, the increase in the deferred revenue balance overall was greater than the company had forecast.Stock-based comp represented 20% of the cash flow this past quarter, up from 18% the prior year. Q1 is usually the highest quarter for cash flow and the lowest quarter for the stock-based comp as a percentage of the CFFO. Last year, stock-based comp grew to 38% of CFFO, up from 35.5% the prior year. It is likely that investors will not be happy to see that metric continue to rise and will less highly value cash flow increases derived from that source.In any event, the company on current projections is likely to have a free cash flow yield of 3.2%. Again, there are companies with lower yields and companies that don't generate free cash flow - the difference is both the trajectory and the level of growth.For many reasons, I would prefer to recommend this name than to give it a pass. But I simply don't quite get the investment case, hard as I try. The company is executing as well as it can. It has got an early lead on perhaps the most important innovation in IT in a decade or more. Its management team is experienced and committed. But if the numbers don't quite work and if the results of the numbers are inferior to other potential investments, one has to conclude that this is not a name from which positive alpha can be expected anymore over the next 12 months than the last few months.Yes, it could change expectations by strategic acquisitions, and more to the point, its partnership with Amazon could turn into something far more. But I can't really forecast those kind of swans whatever their color might be. Eventually, no doubt, CRM will grow into its valuation. But I think the prudent strategy is to wait for that and not try to force an investment case that has to defy gravity to a certain extent in order to work out."

It has recovered from the year low of $66.43 it had reached in December last year. Earlier last week, the stock had touched a high of $90.28.Salesforce's focus on AI takes me back to my discussion earlier this year with SugarCRM's Chief Product Officer, Rich Green. While there has been enough talk of enhancing the power of CRM with AI, there is still a long way to go before one actually witnesses case studies on worthwhile adoption of the technology. As Rich said then, there are several companies in the space trying to make a mark in the space, but very few have the required scale, investment, and expertise to really build general-purpose machine learning and narrow AI. The industry is dealing with two basic roadblocks in the space - first, the development of the technology and second, the adoption.Salesforce may be able to build out the technology, but deploying it and seeing people have their ""judgment questioned by insights generated by large machines will be a learning experience for individuals."" I still think that if the technology is built correctly, its adoption may not be as big a problem. Salesforce certainly seems to think the same."
4074638,68315,2017-05-19T08:07:47-04:00,"Salesforce beats on the top as well as on the bottom line.Guidance is positive, better than analyst estimates.CRM looks very expensive when we look at GAAP earnings.When looking at cash flows the company looks less overvalued.With strong growth CRM could grow into its current valuation.","Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) reported first quarter results that beat on the top as well as on the bottom line. The company's guidance going forward was a big positive as well, and despite the company's shares looking expensive on first sight, they might be a better value than many think.Salesforce's shares are trading at $88 right now, which is more than 30% ahead of the company's 52 week low, but just shy of the all time high -- Salesforce's shareholders surely have benefited from the market's rally over the last months.Salesforce's revenues hit $2.4 billion in the first quarter, for an increase of 25% year on year. The even better results were the big increases in deferred revenues (up 26% to $5.0 billion) and unbilled deferred revenues (up 26% as well, to $9.6 billion). After all these deferred revenues will become revenues at one point in the future, and as long as those deferred revenues are growing faster than the company's reported revenues, investors can expect (reported) revenue growth to accelerate in coming quarters.Salesforce's revenue growth outlook thus remains top notch, which is reflected when we look at the company's valuation:CRM PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsAt 7.3 Salesforce's price to sales ratio is the second highest among its peer group of major software developers [Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU)], but due to the strong expected growth Salesforce's forward price to sales ratio of 5.1 looks more in line with the others -- the higher trailing price to sales multiple thus looks justified due to the high growth rates.Guidance for the current (i.e. second) quarter sees revenues coming in at $2.52 billion, which would be better than the analyst consensus:Analysts have forecasted that revenues will hit $2.48 billion this year, as Salesforce's management sees sales coming in 2% higher, this should lead to some adjustments of analyst estimates in the next weeks, which could also lead to upgrades for Salesforce's shares.$2.52 billion in sales in the current quarter would also mean a new sales record for the company, which obviously is another good sign that could attract new investors.CRM PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsSalesforce's valuation looks very high at first sight, with a trailing GAAP PE ratio anywhere from a reasonable level. Even the company's non-GAAP earnings ratio is in the eighties when we look at trailing earnings.Lower forward earnings ratios reflect the high estimated growth rates, but look pretty expensive still.Looking at cash flows, we get a different picture: At $1.23 billion in operating cash flow Salesforce generated a cash flow yield of almost eight percent (when we annualize the first quarter cash flow), and due to pretty low capital expenditures the company's free cash flow is almost as high as its operating cash flow -- totaling $1.1 billion in the first quarter. Even if the next three quarters would see only half of that amount of free cash flow (i.e. $550 million each), Salesforce would be trading at just 22.5 times this year's free cash flow -- a relatively low valuation for a company that is growing pretty fast.The best way to value Salesforce thus maybe isn't via the earnings the company generates, but rather via the cash flows Salesforce is churning out.Due to its business generating vastly higher cash flows than net earnings, this might be a more appropriate way to value the company -- it also gets us to the conclusion that Salesforce's shares are not as overvalued as they look at first sight. As long as the company keeps on growing at a strong double digit pace, the company could easily grow into the current valuation.TakeawaySalesforce had a very strong start to the year: Beating revenue and earnings estimates and also announcing guidance that sounds very positive.This could lead to analysts upgrading their price targets, and new quarterly record revenues could also attract new investors.Based on GAAP earnings Salesforce looks very overvalued, but taking a closer look, we see that the overvaluation isn't that clear based on the cash flows Salesforce is generating.I believe that the company could grow into the current valuation over the next years, although Salesforce isn't a sure bet."
4074604,42751,2017-05-19T03:59:39-04:00,"Salesforce stock is having the greatest month in company history, reaching all-time highs.Earnings reported were record high revenues of $2.39B and matched the all-time high non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28.Salesforce estimates next quarter will be yet another record-setting financial performance with both all-time high revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share.","Earnings per ShareThe enterprise cloud computing company Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) reported earnings for the quarter ending April 2017 on Thursday, May 18, after market close. CEO Marc Benioff reported YoY increases in non-GAAP earnings per share (+17%) and revenues (+25%). The record-tying non-GAAP EPS was flat from the record prior quarter (0%) but revenues increased slightly (+4%) to an all-time high.Non-GAAP financial results are the only thing that matters with Salesforce investors and stock. The price - earnings ratio (TTM) for GAAP results is well over 300 and the non-GAAP P/E ratio is 80+. Actually, Salesforce has had huge cumulative GAAP losses over the years, which I have reviewed in a section below. GAAP fundamental analysis hasn't mattered in tracking the CRM stock price and now I'm wondering if non-GAAP matters much.This quarter was record-tying non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 and record revenues of $2.39 billion. The four-quarter earnings per share average through QE April 2017 is $0.26 with consistent results of $0.28, $0.28, $0.24, $0.24 for the past four quarters, in reverse chronological order.What is the Salesforce management guidance?Estimated QE July 2017 earnings per share (non-GAAP):Estimated FYE January 2018 earnings per share (non-GAAP):Earnings per Share Year-Over-Year Growth Rate (%)The non-GAAP EPS for the QE 4-30-17 of $0.28 resulted in a +17% increase year over year, from $0.24. This was the thirteenth consecutive quarterly YoY EPS increase for non-GAAP, but lower than the 4-year average of +28%. The most recent four-quarter average for the QE January 2017 was an outstanding +34%. Based on Salesforce management guidance, the next QE 7-31-17 non-GAAP EPS YoY % is estimated to be +31%.RevenuesSalesforce revenues over the years have been one of the great growth stories in the technology sector and much of the allure of CRM stock. Revenues (GAAP & non-GAAP) have consistently grown YoY at a strong pace since the quarter ending March 2008, when I started charting Salesforce financial performance! In fact, the quarterly average revenues growth rate since the QE 3-31-08 has been almost +30%!The most recent four-quarter average was +25% as the pace has slowed to below +30% since the QE 7-31-14. The growth rate has slowed as the denominator, the prior-year quarter revenues, has reached $1 billion (QE October 2013) and then $2 billion (QE July 2016). Now a record high $2.39 billion was reached for the QE 4-30-17.What is the Salesforce management guidance?Estimated QE July 2017 Revenues (GAAP & non-GAAP):Estimated FYE January 2018 Revenues (GAAP & non-GAAP):Revenues by Region and Cloud Service OfferingQuarterly revenues by both region and cloud service offering show the exceptional growth that is Salesforce. I include these charts almost as a testament to their incredible top line achievements. Segment revenues consist of Subscription and Support (92%) and Professional Services & Other (8%). The proportion of these revenues varies little and slowly from quarter to quarter.Return on AssetsThe divergence between non-GAAP and GAAP earnings, and therefore return on assets, is evident in the chart below. Non-GAAP ROA has been positive for many years while GAAP ROA became positive beginning QE July 2016 after many years negative. The only reason GAAP ROA is positive is because of a huge $230 million income tax benefit for the QE 7-31-16. I expect GAAP return on assets to return to negative, effective with the quarter ending July 2017.The Salesforce Divergence: GAAP Losses vs. Non-GAAP EarningsSince the QE July 2011, Salesforce has reported GAAP net losses for 20 of the past 24 quarters. The cumulative net loss has been $641 million. For example, since the QE 4-30-12, cumulative GAAP net losses have been $633 million while cumulative non-GAAP net income has been $2.22 billion!The reason for this discrepancy is that stock-based expenses are included in GAAP, but not in non-GAAP. In other words, GAAP net losses include stock-based expenses and non-GAAP net income is because stock-based expenses are not included. That is, officers and employees are provided stock incentives that are expensed for GAAP but not for non-GAAP. Therefore, non-GAAP earnings per share are always positive and growing, while GAAP earning per share are negative reflecting the stock-based expense.To show this in the simplest way possible, as in how these reconciling items affect both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share, I have included the chart below. On average since the QE 10-31-13, the following items have increased or decreased non-GAAP earnings per share:The past five quarters have seen an acceleration in the stock-based expenses and average $0.30. This can be seen in the chart below. The past four quarters have been $0.35, $0.34, $0.29, $0.26, $0.28, in reverse chronological order.Therefore, stock-based expenses have added over $0.20 per quarter to non-GAAP earnings per share and now upwards of $0.30. This is a reduction in GAAP earnings per share and hence the divergence is created and ongoing. Personally, I don't like this because the stock is traded on the top line revenues, which are both GAAP and non-GAAP, and then also on the bottom line higher non-GAAP earnings per share. This ignores the cost of officer and employee stock incentives, which is both a cost and dilution of the outstanding common stock.ConclusionFinancial Performance: Non-GAAP financial performance continues in an uptrend but year-over-year earnings per share growth is slowing. Next QE July 2017 is projected to be record-setting as is the FYE January 2018 for both revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share. GAAP negative financial performance is discussed in the section above.Financial Position: Financial position is adequate with a capital to assets ratio of 47% and has been trending slightly higher the past few years. Working capital is an astronomical deficit of $2.2 billion and has remained a deficit for 25 of the past 26 quarters with the all-time low now the QE April 2017. The current assets to total assets is 32%, which is higher than the historical average. The debt ratio of 4% is very low because a significant amount of debt is due within a year, which has caused the ridiculous negative working capital amount.Dividends & Stock Repurchases: There are no dividends and stock is repurchased or issued for the benefit of management.Capital Return Program: There is a capital return program for management via stock incentives, but not to you as an outside common shareholder.Stock Price: CRM stock is having the greatest month in company history, reaching an all-time closing high of $89.80 on May 15, 2017, and as of this writing. Salesforce is up a whopping +28% for 2017 and +13% for the 12 months ended. The stock has been in a long-term upward trend. With a stock beta of 1.64, this stock rocks for short-term fast traders.Stock Evaluation & Opinion: As a stock analyst said several years ago, fundamentals don't matter with Salesforce. The earnings are being diverted to the officers and employees via stock incentives with little hope of a decent dividend. Regardless, as an intermediate-term to long-term investor, I continue to consider CRM stock to be a Buy, compared to Hold or Sell. I continue Positive on CRM stock long-term, compared to Neutral or Negative. Salesforce beat these earnings estimates, next quarter's guidance is record-setting, and annual guidance was raised to new heights. You can play the stock for the big gains it has a history of, but be ready to bail out if this seeming house of cards ever comes down. In fairness, I thought this four years ago and nothing has happened but CRM stock to go up.(Graphs created by author using data from CRM)"

Last year, Salesforce announced plans to release its AI offering Einstein to users. Einstein is being developed as an integral part of Salesforce’s core platform and not as a standalone product, so that all Salesforce users will be able to access its benefits.Salesforce already has some predictive capabilities built into its platforms and those features are delivering impressive results. Within the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, its predictive audiences feature is helping marketers target high-value outreach and connect with users who are more likely to unsubscribe. Reports reveal that the technology has resulted in an increase of 25% average lift in clicks and opens. Similarly, Salesforce’s Sales Cloud customers have seen 300% increase in conversions from leads to opportunities with predictive lead scoring and customers of Commerce Cloud have witnessed a 7-15% increase in revenue per site visitor.Einstein will be used to reduce the need for customers to employ data scientists and instead will be using AI to automatically discover relevant insights, predict behavior, and proactively recommend the next best action. By building it within the platform, Einstein will rely on customer data from multiple media including Chatter, email, calendar, e-commerce, and other social data streams to continue to add to AI’s Big Data-based learning. AI models will be customized automatically for customers and the administrators will be able to include  Einstein-powered fields in any object, page layout, or workflow.The market is split between how successful Salesforce’s Einstein will be in comparison to its other competitors. Some believe that since Salesforce is building Einstein on its own platform, it will do well in the sales and marketing business applications, but may flounder in other business applications. Further, since the technology is aimed at becoming complementary to its core business, it may continue to lack the benefits of a standalone AI tool. Critics believe that even in its current state, Einstein may take at least another year-and-a-half to become a substantial product.It is also adding more arsenal to the AI portfolio through acquisitions. Last quarter, it bought mobile startup Twin Prime for an undisclosed sum. Founded in 2013, Redwood, CA-based Twin Prime helps mobile apps perform better. It has raised $12.5 million and was last valued at $25 million. Salesforce expects to leverage Twin Prime’s machine learning capabilities that analyze network data in real time.I think it should also look at acquiring marketing automation leader Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO). At $1.8 billion valuation, Marketo will be a big ticket spend for Salesforce, but it will forge it ahead within the segment to pole position. Marketo has more than 30% of the market, followed by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) at 16%.Salesforce’s stock is currently trading at $83.81 with a market capitalization of $60.16 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $84.48 in May last year. It has recovered from the 52-week low of $66.43 it had fallen to in December last year.Photo credit: Gwydion M Williams/Flickr.com."
4051529,98236,2017-03-02T13:09:24-05:00,"Salesforce reported the results of its fiscal Q4 Tuesday evening.All of the revenue metrics and cash flow showed very strong performance, beating prior forecasts.Profits were ahead of expectations, and cash flow, representing an enormous volume of contract signings, grew by 50%.Partially as a result of the strong volume of Q4 contract signings, the company projected a much slower growth cadence for Q1.The company slightly raised its fiscal 2018 estimates despite FX headwinds although much of the profit increase is coming from a higher level of stock-based comp.","CRM-Climbing a wall of worry in just a few boundsSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) announced the results of its fiscal Q4 the evening of 2/28. The quarter was strong as had been well advertised in advance. In reality, the results that were announced were pretty much what most observers and shareholders might have reasonably anticipated and were congruent with what I had expected as forecast in the article I most recently wrote on the subject.The company is doing very well in terms of revenue generation, very well in growing its cash flow and less well in growing reported profits. The shares are doing less well over the course of a year and a bit better over the course of the last few weeks. The shares ultimately reacted positively to the earnings release rising by about 3% on a day in which the market was strong as well with the IGV appreciating 1.7%.Overall, the shares are up 17% in the past year, which is decent, but quite a bit less than the move in the tech software index, the IGV. The shares have worked better since the start of the year appreciating 20% versus the 14% appreciation for the IGV.To come back to the article I most recently wrote, I had suggested that it would be difficult for CRM to satisfy investors. That obviously hasn't been accurate since the article was published, but to an extent, the same factors I referred to at that time continue to constrain the ability of the shares to produce meaningful positive alpha despite what many, myself included, would consider to be strong operational performance, particularly in terms of revenue generation in this past quarter.In looking back at what I wrote at that time, I find little reason to change many of the points that I made. This company continues to dominate its space and to enjoy a strong competitive position in its newer areas. It is actually enjoying some recrudescence of growth in its traditional Sales Cloud, perhaps based on product refreshes. And it plans to make some giant product announcements next week that may move its needle, or are, more likely, already part of the company's guidance.Unfortunately, all of that seems to be embodied in the current valuation. In total, 45 analysts report their ratings to First Call. Of that cohort, 42 rate the shares either a buy or a strong buy. One of the things that can lead to under or over-performance are changes in analyst ratings. The fact is that there are simply not many people to change their minds positively.The average price target posted on First Call is $94, and from what I have seen this morning, it may drift up a $1-$2 in coming weeks. I will go through some of the valuation metrics later in this article, but as I have pointed out before, stock-based comp, forecast to be just less than $1 billion prior to tax effects, will be the primary driver of reported earnings.This is a company firing on all revenue cylinders, but that may not be quite enough to produce positive alpha for investors. I think the shares are likely to perform in line with the IGV for the next six to 12 months although I also think there may be some potential for appreciation based on next week's product releaseSome thoughts about the quarterI will reprise a few of the headline numbers below. The company reported revenues of $2.3 billion and GAAP EPS loss of $.07 for the quarter. These numbers compare to revenues of $1.8 billion and GAAP EPS loss of $.04 in the prior year.Non-GAAP net income was reported at $.28/share based on 711 million shares outstanding, which compares to non-GAAP EPS of $.19 based on 683 million outstanding shares the prior year. The growth in outstanding shares year on year was 3.5%.Cash flow, on the back of strong bookings activity, rose 50% for the quarter to $706 million, with full-year operating cash flow of $2.16 billion, up 29%.For most observers, the sales attainment of the company was considered to be outstanding considering the combination of decent headline numbers and more than decent results in terms of the increase in both recognized and unrecognized deferred revenues. To what extent the over-attainment in bookings is a function of the seasonality in terms of renewals and annual billings is a bit difficult to assess.It was encouraging to see a significant re-acceleration in the pace of growth for the company's sales cloud, the company's largest and original product offering. Sales Cloud revenues grew by 13.5% in the quarter up a bit from the 12.5% growth reported in fiscal Q3. The other product areas grew at rates consistent with or better than growth in prior periods.Overall, deferred revenue booked in the quarter was $2.04 billion and that increased by 41% from the level in Q4 of fiscal 2016. For the full year, the increase in deferred revenues was $1.21 billion, an increase of 25% from the dollar increase in deferred revenue in fiscal year 2016. It is just difficult to avoid acknowledging that level of increase in deferred revenue last quarter. I had the occasion to write about the results of Workday (NYSE:WDAY) after their earnings release and to comment about the increase they had in the deferred revenue metric at the end of their fiscal quarter (15%). The CFO of WDAY spent a fair amount of time explaining why that really didn't matter and many analysts said the derived booking metric, which was 30% growth, was ahead of expectations. The derived bookings metric for CRM grew by almost 37% in the quarter, clearly, one of the more outstanding sales accomplishments seen in this space in the recent past.A tiny component of the growth was inorganic as the company has bought several smaller businesses in the last 12 months. It is even more impressive given the fact that CRM is 5X the size of WDAY. Again, how much of that outsized increase is a function of renewals and annual bookings is not disclosed and we do not know if there was any material change between this just reported Q4 and the year ago period - there probably was some.And ironically, some observers were unhappy that the forecast for Q1 reflected to a degree the significant level of bookings recorded in Q4. But the least that can be said is that there were no ambiguities about the company's revenue performance in the quarter - the beer for the CRM sales organization was as cold as it is ever going to get.As a result of the powerful increase in deferred revenues, cash flow from operations (CFFO) increased by no less than 50% for the quarter and 29% for the year. Again, there were seasonal factors at work in that performance which will not likely be repeated in future years. While the company doesn't forecast quarterly cash flow numbers, the strong performance in Q4 is almost certain to produce a far smaller growth in cash flow in Q1.Just looking at the company's forecast for its deferred revenue balance, which is for growth of 22%-23%, brings that metric to $4.87 billion. That is down by almost $650 million from the results of the quarter just reported and will constrain quarterly cash flow. In Q1 fiscal 2017, the decline in deferred revenues was only $293 million. It is likely, therefore, that CFFO will contract somewhat in the current fiscal quarter although full-year guidance is for cash flow growth of 20%-21%, which would take CFFO to about $2.55 billion for the current fiscal year.It also means that there is a strong probability that the derived bookings growth proxy will be below the number that had been expected by investors. As mentioned earlier, the bookings growth proxy was 37% this past quarter and with the forecast the company has provided for cash flow in Q1, it seems likely that the bookings growth proxy will be more in the range of 15%-20$ for that period. It really is just enhanced seasonality that will eventually settle out.Despite the strong revenue performance, there was no leverage at scale in CRM's quarterly results and that has and is likely to continue to put a cap on its valuation and its ability to produce meaningful alpha for investors. While some of the margin weakness is a product of the Demandware acquisition and headwinds from FX, I think it is fair to say that looked at holistically, the company has yet to lay out any clear path to consistent progress in terms of GAAP profitability.All of the following expense ratios are GAAP and they really aren't pretty, given the company's revenue performance. Gross margins declined by 200 basis points to 73% during the year partially due to a very modest mix shift, which saw service revenues grow a bit faster than subscription revenues. More important was the loss of deferred recognition due to purchase accounting conventions.Research and development costs rose by 100 basis points, although compared to the level of such costs at other application vendors such as Workday, they are very modest at 15% of revenues. Sales and marketing costs are still at very extended levels and their improvement in percentage terms of 100 bps was smaller in Q4 than in the earlier quarters of the year.General and administrative expense of 11% is rather high for a company of this scale. In general, application vendors with their complex contracts and large IP portfolios tend to have high general and administrative expense; this one is high enough to be an outlier.Overall, GAAP operating margins went from a minor positive number in fiscal Q4 2016 to a minor negative in this latest fiscal quarter; the company managed to post a $51 million loss after tax this past period compared to a $25 million loss in Q4 the prior year. In stepping back and considering the quarter as a whole, I think that the revenue performance was fantastic while the earnings performance was mediocre. I am still looking for the leverage at scale, which I think is necessary for the next leg up in the shares.The company is forecasting stronger performance for non-GAAP margins mainly because the stock-based comp metric is continuing its growth. Last year, non-GAAP margins rose by 78 bps, despite the fall in non-GAAP gross margins, which were constrained by the revenue adjustments required by purchase accounting. The company is forecasting that it will increase non-GAAP margins by 125-150 basis points. Quite a bit of that will be the absence of the revenue recognition adjustment in the second half of the year, which is why earnings are forecast to be more back-end loaded than has been typical.It also has forecast that operating cash flow will rise more slowly than revenues while deferred revenue growth will be greater than revenue growth. While not explicitly forecast, it is almost certain that stock-based comp is forecast to grow. Overall, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is forecast to be $885 million. Last year the difference was $680 million. It is, I think, reasonable to assume that most of that increase will be coming from stock-based expenses.That slowing growth syndrome - how does CRM avoid the perils of becoming a middle-aged software vendor?Despite claims to the contrary by Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), CRM remains, basically unchallenged, as the world's largest vendor of applications delivered through the cloud. There is no sign that it is going to be knocked off its perch anytime soon, either by Oracle or anyone else.There are two basic strategies that the company is following in trying to maintain its growth rate with annual sales forecast to exceed $10 billion. One of them is a strategy of significant product enhancement featuring both AI and analytics. That part of the strategy is one of the elements that will be on display with some level of specificity during the March 7th announcement.Management during the course of the call said that the Einstein capability already was having a noticeable impact on the company's ability to close large transactions and was a factor that drove Q4 performance overall and in the Sales Cloud in particular. Basically, at this point, analytics and Einstein are the company's growth strategy and its strategy for differentiation. The company made a dozen acquisitions last year and most of them had something to do with enhancing the capabilities in those areas that could be used across the different clouds.An article like this is not probably the best place to address the question of how successful the strategy can be or will be or how it serves to differentiate the products. I do my own anecdotal checks on things like product performance and user interest. At a worm's eye level, the people who sell Einstein and analytics and have to make the strategy work are pumped. That is to say the strategy is being well received and it is helping salesmen to close large deals and is even adding a sense of urgency to procurement discussions.I may feel that the company's share price will be constrained until there is palpable progress in terms of GAAP margins, but this company has done as good a job of remaking itself at scale as any I have seen. The positive case for the shares is that the growth rate seen at the end of the last fiscal year can be sustained because of the introduction of new products, including those that will be shown next Thursday.The other strategy is acquisition. Acquisitions accounted for about 10% of the company's reported growth last year - 250 basis points of revenue in total. As most investors recollect, the shares were pummeled in the wake of an aborted deal to buy Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). The on-boarding of acquisitions appears to have gone smoothly and in particular, the Demandware acquisition is producing more revenue than had been targeted.The conference call that was held didn't speak about acquisitions and it didn't touch on the new positions that have been established by two groups of activist shareholders. The company ended the year with $2.2 billion of gross cash and $1.1 billion of net cash, even after paying for 12 acquisitions. It is forecasting that CFFO for the year will reach about $2.6 billion and that free cash flow will be $2.1 billion. So, it has a substantial level of cash resources available with which to do acquisitions and it would be very surprising to me if that isn't the strategy it continues to pursue.The acquisitions it might make are going to continue to pressure margins given that most of the companies being bought will be loss making. I think that the activist investor groups are highly unlikely to see this company adopt a capital return program in the next year - and most probably longer. Investors who buy these shares are looking for the best large-cap growth name in the enterprise software business. They are not likely to find this management acquiescing in either a capital return program or endorsing a strategy that would lead to rapidly rising profitability metrics.ValuationFrom time to time, contributors to Seeking Alpha suggest that CRM shares need to be sold because they are too highly valued and because the company's growth is slowing and it doesn't make money. I have appreciation for some but not all of the points. There is, what might be called a scarcity value in this name as there just aren't other large cap, high growth names in the IT space and there are plenty of funds that need to fulfill their mandates.Writing Thursday morning, the shares are priced at $83.06. The latest financial statement shows a fully diluted share count of 700 million, an increase of 4.6% from the year earlier level. That yields a market cap of $58.1 billion. Net cash on the balance sheet was about $1.1 billion, which yields an enterprise value of $57 billion. The company is forecasting revenues of $10.15-$10.2 billion and that yields an EV/S of 5.8X. That is probably a bit less than average for top line growth that is estimated to be 22%, with a significant probability of upside.The P/E based on the company's non-GAAP forecast for the current fiscal year is 65X. I think it is fair to say that investors really aren't buying the shares because they have a bargain P/E. They do not and will not for some time to come.As mentioned, the company is forecasting that its operating cash flow is forecast to grow by 205-21% for the year and that would bring it to $2.6 billion. Capex last year was $464 million. The company is forecasting about $500 million of cash flow this year producing a free cash flow estimate of $2.1 billion. That produces a free cash flow yield of 3.7%, perhaps a bit better on a relative basis than other free cash flow yields in the space.The company is doing better in terms of revenue growth than some observers have allowed for. It has a reasonable strategy to defer falling revenue growth rates. If I were just grading it on the revenue and growth, it would surely get an ""A.""It has yet to focus on improving costs and while non-GAAP margins are rising, GAAP margins seem trapped within a narrow band. It simply spends lots of money to sell its products and while it has forged some impressive relationships with many large users, it has done so at significant cost. Part of the issue is the rapid growth in both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet deferred revenues, which are rising very rapidly and significantly distort the analysis of sales efficiency.The overall increase in deferred revenue, billed and unbilled of $14.5 billion for a company that reported total revenues of $8.4 billion is extraordinary. Sales employees of this company are getting paid, for the most part, on the creation of annual contract value (ACV), which tracks the proxy bookings numbers. It is one, although not the only reason, why sales expense ratios are high and GAAP profits are non-existent. Absent a more rapid cadence of profitability growth, I think the shares of Salesforce are unlikely to produce significant positive alpha going forward. Still a strong hold for me."
4050975,92586,2017-03-01T10:29:20-05:00,"The company did not disappoint investors when it released F4Q17 results and FY18 outlook last night.On the plus side, revenues continue to grow at a good pace, while salesforce continues to generate large quantities of free cash.On the flip side, a very large operating cost base and rich valuations keep me away from the stock.","After the end of trading on Tuesday, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported fiscal 4Q17 earnings that did not disappoint. Revenues of $2.29 billion met expectations, while non-GAAP EPS of $0.28 beat consensus by 3 pennies.Credit: InsightSquaredOn the guidance for FY18, it looks like the company and the Street are very much in synch when it comes to short-term performance. Consensus revenues of $10.5 billion reached the low end of the narrow guidance range of $10.15 billion to $10.2 billion. And management's projection of $1.27-$1.29 for EPS perfectly bracketed consensus $1.28.Before we talk about what makes CRM a risky proposition in my view (the stock's valuation and rich opex), let's look at what the company has been doing very well lately.First, Salesforce.com continues to deliver on top-line growth, a crucial piece of the puzzle for a company that needs to reach massive scale to justify the equity investment. CEO Russell Benioff claims to have ""the strongest portfolio of products"" ever. Deferred revenues have grown steadily to $14.5 billion in F4Q17, while Salesforce's smaller ""clouds"" (marketing cloud and Salesforce platform, together representing 33% of F4Q17 total sales) increased revenues at 45% YOY and seem to be gaining traction.I would point out, however, that F4Q17 was the second full quarter to include the results of Demandware. The company, acquired in July of last year, contributed $120 million to Salesforce's revenues in FY17. That said, Salesforce's organic top-line growth would have been a less exciting 24% for the year, in line with FY16 growth levels but considerably lower than FY15's 32%. For simplicity, I am purposely leaving out of this comparison the smaller acquisitions of Krux and Quip, and whatever contribution they might have had to total company results.Source: company's earnings presentationAlso, I was impressed to see operating cash flow reach $2.2 billion in FY17. This is a 29% improvement over FY16 that makes cash flow-based valuation of the stock seem much more reasonable. Net cash ended FY17 at $1.1 billion compared to $1.6 billion in FY16, a strong position despite a year marked by over $3 billion in acquisition-related outflows.On the flip sideWhile both the results and the outlook offer no reason for most investors to be disappointed with the company's performance, the stock traded as low as -3% after hours, only to recover along with a broad market that seems very optimistic this Wednesday.It is not hard to see, however, why CRM could be standing on the verge of a correction, a mild and short-lived one at least. Share prices have rallied about 20% YTD, in great part on the hype and expectations for a much stronger macro environment ahead. The stock trades at 63.7x FY18 non-GAAP earnings, which I still find aggressive considering the company is expected to operate at a GAAP loss this coming year.Also, and despite satisfactory revenue growth, Salesforce continues to spend a good chunk in operating expenses, once SBC (share-based compensation) is factored in. In FY17, nearly three-fourths of revenues were deployed to cover operating costs. This ratio has been falling over the years, but at a decelerating pace.Source: DM Martins Research, using press release data for actualsThe chart below illustrates my projections for sales and GAAP op margins through fiscal 2021.Source: DM Martins Research, using press release data for actualsNotice that the $1.5 billion in GAAP op profits that I project Salesforce to generate in about 4 years looks great -- but, in my opinion, it is possibly not enough to justify the company's current $57 billion market cap.TakeawayGiven the rich valuation, the large operating cost base and the recent stock price rally, I find CRM to be a bit too risky of a bet that could be sustained by optimism, but that also presents a good bit of downside risk in the long run.Follow me as I build a risk-diversified portfolio designed and back-tested to generate market-like returns with lower risk.

4050601,102273,2017-02-28T15:50:13-05:00,Adobe would provide key capabilities that Salesforce.com lacks.Adobe merger would make Salesforce.com the leader in the cloud market.Salesforce.com needs Adobe more than Adobe needs Salesforce.,"Ever since its founding, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has mainly sold customer relationship management [CRM] software to its customers, and its target customers were B2B companies. But things have been changing and Salesforce.com wants to help companies - both large and small - manage all aspects of their relationship with their consumers. In other words, Salesforce wants to help B2C companies in managing their entire consumer relationships.Salesforce.com has made substantial investments in acquisitions to bolster its capability in managing consumer relationships. It bought ExactTarget to help manage the on-demand marketing message to consumers. The Demandware acquisition took the relationship beyond just marketing communications by helping companies maintain an ecommerce storefront and complete retail transactions both online and in physical stores. The capabilities offered by ExactTarget and Demandware are important, but Salesforce is still missing a key capability in their marketing value chain.In an age where consumers expect to be presented with thought-provoking, engaging and graphically rich content across all media, Salesforce.com does not have the tools to help its customers create and manage compelling content that can be used across any communication channel. There's one company that is a global leader in those tools and that is Adobe Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).Exhibit: Adobe Annual Revenue and Growth Rate (Source: Adobe Company Filings)Exhibit: Salesforce.com Annual Revenue from Product Segments (Source: Salesforce.com Company Filings)In the fiscal year that ended in January 31st, 2016, Salesforce had total revenue of about $6.2 billion. If Salesforce and Adobe decide to merge, Salesforce would more than double its revenue and would be the largest and most powerful player in the cloud computing market.Exhibit: Marketing Workflow (Source: Author)I have shown a simple marketing workflow above. Adobe has products in all aspects of this workflow that can add enormous value to Salesforce.Let's start in the middle with the project of designing a marketing campaign. One task in this project is the creation of engaging content. This is Adobe's strong suite. Their flagship suite of products in this segment is the Adobe Creative Cloud. Multiple industry-leading products such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom are offered in the Creative Cloud.Salesforce.com had no comparable product to the Creative Cloud. As Salesforce.com moves deeper into helping B2C companies, the ability to create engaging content would be essential. Adobe's Digital Media business - Adobe Creative Cloud is part of their Digital Media business - would essentially create a whole new business segment for Salesforce with more revenues than its flagship Sales Cloud product segment.Exhibit: Adobe Digital Media Annual Revenue (Source: Adobe Company Filings)Adobe's Digital Marketing business unit can help Salesforce in the task of implementing a marketing campaign. Adobe Marketing Cloud - part of the Digital Marketing business unit - offers various tools to target customers across the web on both desktop and mobile, across multiple channels. Some products in the Marketing Cloud are Adobe Target, Adobe Social and Adobe Experience Manager.Salesforce.com's marketing business unit is the smallest in terms of both capability and revenues. Acquisitions such as ExactTarget and Demandware have bolstered that business unit in recent years. Adobe's Digital Marketing business would bring scale and scope to Salesforce.com that would take a very long time to achieve via organic growth.However, there is some overlap between products and capabilities in the marketing area. For example, the Adobe Campaign product can manage email marketing. Salesforce's ExactTarget does the same. Adobe has an artificial intelligence product called Adobe Sensei that brings machine learning and analytic capabilities to their marketing products. Salesforce has introduced a product called Einstein to provide AI capabilities to sales, service and marketing. But, in my opinion, the overlapping products and revenue in the marketing segment is limited compared to the new marketing capabilities that Salesforce would gain from the merger.Exhibit: Adobe Digital Marketing Revenue (Source: Adobe Company Filings)The Power of Adobe AcrobatThe benefits that Adobe's Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud could bring to Salesforce is very clear. Adobe's Document Cloud product powered by Acrobat - the product behind the ubiquitous PDF file format - is a dominant product used to create and share valuable documents across document-intensive industries such as government, financial services, pharmaceuticals, legal and insurance.Adobe Sign solution offers a green alternative and faster way to manage and complete contract workflows. The Adobe Sign product is integrated with Salesforce, but Salesforce can reap the benefits of Acrobat across all its product lines and pose a threat to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office 365. Adobe Document Cloud is part of their Digital Media product segment. Adobe Document Cloud is part of their Digital Media business.Access to New Customers and MarketsA merger with Adobe would open Salesforce to a new set of customers. Salesforce would get access to creative professionals, animators and photographers who help marketing teams create exceptional content. It would be extremely difficult for Salesforce to acquire these customers. The customers who are accustomed to using Adobe's products would be reluctant to switch to a different one even if Salesforce offered a product in the future.Exhibit: Adobe's Customers (Source: Adobe Company Filings)The reasons for Salesforce to acquire Adobe are clear:There are multiple hurdles to this deal. As of February 27th, 2017, Adobe's market capitalization is larger than that of Salesforce by about $2 billion. Even though the reasons for Salesforce to merge with Adobe are clear, the inverse is not true.Adobe has a very strong management team that has been firing on all cylinders. It has been posting good revenue growth and profitability. It has a clear vision of its future and has a large total addressable market (TAM) that offers further room for growth for many years to come.Exhibit: Adobe Digital Media Business Segment - Creative Cloud & Document Cloud (Acrobat) - TAM (Source: Adobe Company Filings)Exhibit: Digital Marketing TAM (Source: Adobe Company Filings)Also, Adobe's products exhibit stickiness and network effects - both on the creative and marketing sides - that will help as more subscribers use the products and join the network. The data gathered and analyzed for digital marketing purposes becomes more valuable as more customers use their products. Once customers are used to the product like Adobe Creative Cloud, there will be less attrition and so Adobe will spend less on retaining customers and could even expand their profit margins.On the marketing side, Adobe Digital Insights (NASDAQ:ADI) is an example of how data from a large network of customers can be leveraged to benefit the company and the network. According to Adobe, the analysis and insights published on ADI's website are based on 5,000 companies worldwide that use Adobe Marketing Cloud.Adobe has shown that it can grow organically, and if the strategic need arises, can make small, manageable acquisitions to enter new markets. Its 2016 acquisition of TubeMogul is a case in point. TubeMogul is a player in the video advertising market. It offers brands and agencies a platform to plan and buy video advertising across desktops, mobile, streaming devices and TVs.In short, given their market position, sales growth and profitability, Adobe has no need to embark on a very risky, large-scale merger at this time.From the hacked emails of General Colin Powell, we know that Salesforce had Adobe as one of their acquisition targets. Acquisitions like ExactTarget and Demandware point to more investment in building B2C capabilities. In 2016, Marc Benioff had openly talked about his dream to double the company in the next three to four years.The Adobe acquisition would easily accomplish that and would make Salesforce the biggest and most formidable force in sales, marketing and content solutions across a wide range of industries. Salesforce may need Adobe more than Adobe needs Salesforce. It would truly be a bold move if Salesforce tries to merge with Adobe.If you like my articles, please consider following me."
4074549,92586,2017-05-18T19:03:28-04:00,"Salesforce's earnings summary: a beat on top- and bottom-lines, a next-quarter revenue guidance that exceeds expectations and an increase in full-year revenue and EPS guidance.But GAAP opex as a percentage of total revenues, at over 70%, is back on the rise.Even on a non-GAAP basis, CRM is still priced at about 70x forward earnings, a very rich multiple.","A beat on top- and bottom-lines, a next-quarter revenue guidance that exceeds expectations and an increase in full-year revenue and EPS guidance. This was Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) fiscal 1Q18 earnings report released after the closing bell. The stock is up in after-hours trading, but not as much as the results would seem to suggest: +1.8%.Credit: Company's earnings presentationIn the most recent quarter, the company continued to deliver strongly across the board: double-digit growth in all four cloud verticals, more than 20% revenue growth in each of its three main geographic areas, 26% YOY growth in deferred revenues off a base that is now as large as $11.6 billion in fiscal 1Q17, and high-teen growth in cash flow from ops that reached $1.2 billion in this cyclically strong quarter.It is worth noting that Demandware's results should have positively impacted the YOY comps by possibly four to five percentage points on total company sales growth. Salesforce still has a partial quarter to go before it laps the acquisition of the e-commerce software company completed in July 2016.There was, however, at least one negative aspect in an otherwise wide range of impressive metrics. Salesforce's recurring opex (GAAP marketing and sales, R&D and G&A) as a percentage of total revenues has increased compared to the previous period (I'm using full fiscal 2017 in this case) for the first time in about three years. That ratio was 73.1% in fiscal 1Q18 vs. 71.4% in fiscal 1Q17, both metrics representing very high figures for a $10-billion/year revenue producer. There was a noted increase in research and development of 44%, with SBC (shared-based compensation) within that cost center nearly doubling YOY.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsI have expressed in the past my reservations over Salesforce's very rich operating cost base, and how not even aggressive top-line growth has allowed this 18-year old company, no puppy by Silicon Valley standards, to produce positive net profits on a consistent basis. See graph below.CRM Net Income (Quarterly) data by YChartsTakeawayI am thoroughly impressed by Salesforce's results, another in a series of nine consecutive revenue beats. Considering top-line health tends to be the key criteria to attract and retain growth investors, I'm in fact surprised that the stock is only up +1.8% in after-hours trading. Shares could climb higher during trading tomorrow.But I can't ignore the fact that Salesforce is still an eventual GAAP-unprofitable company that, after so many successful years of strong revenue expansion, is still guiding for barely noticeable net earnings of $0.07/share in the current fiscal quarter. Even on a non-GAAP basis, CRM is still priced at about 70x forward earnings, a very rich multiple.I like Salesforce as a company, although I wish it could be more diligent with opex management. With the stock up 26% this year so far and sitting comfortably at the peak of its 52-week price range, I will cheer the company on from a distance.Note from the author: I invite you to follow me as I build a risk-diversified portfolio designed and back-tested to generate market-like returns with lower risk.

4073128,42751,2017-05-15T01:31:49-04:00,"Salesforce stock is having the greatest month in company history, reaching all-time highs.
        Earnings will be reported this week and are expected to be strong, with the highest revenues and at least the second highest Non-GAAP earnings per share ever reported.
        Revenues have had an amazing multi-year growth rate, but Non-GAAP earnings per share growth rate is slowing.","Earnings per ShareThe enterprise cloud computing company Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) reports earnings for the quarter ending April 2017 on Thursday, May 18, after market close. CEO Marc Benioff is expected to report YoY increases in Non-GAAP earnings per share (+8%) and revenues (+23%). The Non-GAAP EPS is projected to decrease from the prior quarter (-7%) but revenues increase slightly (+3%).Non-GAAP financial results are the only thing that matters with Salesforce investors and stock. The price - earnings ratio (NYSE:TTM) for GAAP results is well over 300! Actually, Salesforce has had huge cumulative GAAP losses over the years, which I have reviewed in a section below. GAAP fundamental analysis hasn't mattered in tracking the CRM stock price.The estimated Non-GAAP EPS of $0.26 would be the second best ever reported, behind the prior quarter $0.28. This is after considering and adjusting for the 2012 stock split. The four-quarter earnings per share average through QE January 2017 is $0.25 with consistent results of $0.28, $0.24, $0.24, $0.24 for the past four quarters, in reverse chronological order.Estimated QE April 2017 Earnings per Share (Non-GAAP):Earnings per Share Year Over Year Growth Rate (%)The estimated Non-GAAP EPS for the QE 4-30-17 of $0.26 is a low +8% increase year over year, from $0.24. This is expected to be the thirteenth consecutive quarterly YoY EPS increase for Non-GAAP, but the lowest increase since the QE January 2014 decrease. The most recent four quarters average an outstanding +34%.RevenuesSalesforce revenues over the years have been one of the great growth stories in the technology sector and much of the allure of CRM stock. Revenues (GAAP & Non-GAAP) have consistently grown YoY at a strong pace since the quarter ending March 2008, when I started charting Salesforce financial performance! In fact, the quarterly average revenues growth rate since the QE 3-31-08 has been almost +30%.The most recent four quarters average +26% as the pace has slowed to below +30% since the QE 7-31-14. The growth rate has slowed as the denominator, the prior year quarter revenues, has reached $1 billion (QE October 2013) and then $2 billion (QE July 2016). The estimate for the upcoming QE 4-30-17 of $2.35 billion would be the highest quarterly revenues ever reported by Salesforce.Estimated QE April 2017 Revenues (GAAP & Non-GAAP):Revenues by Region and Cloud Service OfferingQuarterly revenues by both region and cloud service offering show the exceptional growth that is Salesforce. I include these charts almost as a testament to their incredible achievements. Segment revenues consist of Subscription and Support (92%) and Professional Services & Other (8%). The proportion of these revenues vary little and slowly from quarter to quarter. The previous section and chart are of more importance to me as a stock trader.Return on AssetsThe divergence between Non-GAAP and GAAP earnings, and therefore return on assets, is evident in the chart below. Non-GAAP ROA has been positive for many years while GAAP ROA became positive beginning QE July 2016 after many years negative. The only reason GAAP ROA is positive is because of a huge $230 million income tax benefit for the QE 7-31-16. I expect GAAP return on assets to return to negative beginning the quarter ending July 2017.The Salesforce Divergence: GAAP Losses vs. Non-GAAP EarningsSince the QE July 2011, Salesforce has reported GAAP net losses for 19 of the past 23 quarters. The cumulative net loss has been $636 million. This is while Non-GAAP financial results have been a positive net income.The reason is that stock based expenses are included in GAAP, but not in Non-GAAP. That is, officers and employees are provided stock incentives that are expensed for GAAP but not for Non-GAAP. Therefore, Non-GAAP earnings per share are always positive and growing, while GAAP earning per share tend to be negative to reflect the stock based expense.To show this in the simplest way possible, as in how these reconciling items affect both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings per share, I have included the chart below. On average since the QE 10-31-13, the following items have increased or decreased Non-GAAP earnings per share:Stock Based Expenses +$0.24Amortization +$0.08Other Adjustments -$0.01Income Tax Effect -$0.09The past four quarters have seen an acceleration in the stock based expenses and average $0.29. This can be seen in the chart below. The past four quarters have been $0.34, $0.29, $0.26, $0.28, in reverse chronological order.Therefore, stock based expenses have added over $0.20 per quarter to Non-GAAP earnings per share and now upwards of $0.30+. This is a reduction in GAAP earnings per share and hence the divergence is created and ongoing. Personally, I don't like this because the stock is traded on the top line revenues, which are both GAAP and Non-GAAP, and then also on the bottom line Non-GAAP earnings per share. This ignores the cost of officer and employee stock incentives, which is both a cost and dilution of the outstanding common stock.ConclusionFinancial Performance: Non-GAAP financial performance continues in an uptrend but year over year earnings per share growth is slowing. GAAP negative financial performance is discussed in the section above.Financial Position: Financial position is adequate with a capital to assets ratio of 43% and has been trending slightly higher the past few years.Dividends & Stock Repurchases: There are no dividends and stock is repurchased or issued for the benefit of management.Capital Return Program: There is a capital return program for management via stock incentives, but not to you as an outside common shareholder.Stock Price: CRM stock is having the greatest month in company history, reaching an all-time closing high of $89.04 on May 12, 2017 and as of this writing. Salesforce is up a whopping +30% for 2017 and a strong +17% for the 12 months ended. The stock has been in a long-term upward trend.Stock Evaluation & Opinion: With a stock beta of 1.64, this stock rocks for short-term fast traders. More importantly, as a stock analyst said many years ago, fundamentals don't matter with Salesforce. The earnings are being diverted to the officers and employees via stock incentives with little hope of a decent dividend. As an intermediate-term to long-term investor, I consider CRM stock to be a Buy. I am positive on CRM stock long-term, compared to neutral or negative. If Salesforce has a big beat on the upcoming earnings, this stock will go up to the stratosphere. If Salesforce results are about what the projections are, the uptrend will probably slow. You can play the stock for the big gains it has a history of, but be ready to bail if this seeming house of cards ever comes down. In fairness, I thought this four years ago and nothing has happened but CRM stock go up.(Graphs created by author using data from CRM)"
4070282,101848,2017-05-07T06:25:27-04:00,Salesforce.com is a leading provider of cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions to business and organizations with an average gross revenue stream just shy of 29% since 2013.Over 92% of CRM's revenue comes from corporate users of the Company's cloud computing services and related technical support that is fast becoming a sticky revenue stream.I would project a 12-month target price for the stock at $100 based on 2017 estimated earnings of $0.75/share.,"To set the stage, corporate spending on organizational and application software in the US hit $138.8 billion through the end of the 1st quarter 2017. The average quarterly expenditure in the category since the start of the official recovery from the Great Recession of 2007 in June of 2009 is $116.6 billion, which gives a good reference point on the critical role the Internet plays in the conduct of business. Application software continues to be a cost-effective investment in both efficiency and productivity. The Dow Jones US Software Index is up just shy of 17% on the year with a bullish positive break-out that began early last week that has sent support levels to a reading of over 77 (see Figure 1, below). By way of comparison, the S&P 500 benchmark is up just shy of 7% over same the period.Figure 1: Dow Jones US Software IndexSalesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is a leading provider of just such cloud software applications to business and organizations throughout North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Aided by a series of recent acquisitions such as SteelBrick (February 2016), MetaMind (April 2016), Demandware (July 2016), Quip (August 2016) and most recently Kruz Digital (November 2016), CRM has become a market leader in cloud software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. CRM has newly joined the exclusive ranks of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) in a very lucrative and high-growth technology niche.Figure 2: Salesforce.comOver 92% of CRM revenues come from fees collected from corporate and organizational users of the Company's cloud computing services and related technical support services. A typical subscription runs anywhere from 12 to 36 months with a range on the short end of a single month to as long as 60 months in duration. The attrition rate through the end of the Company's fiscal year (31 January) came to 8% to 9%. Total revenue for the period came to $8.4 billion, up a robust 26% year-over-year (YoY) in 2017. The average growth of revenue since fiscal year ending 31 January 2013 has been an even more robust 29%. Professional services, including mapping, project management, implementation services and training fees made up the remaining 7.6% of total revenues for the period.By way of comparison, Oracle revenues grew at an annual rate of 1.44% for a nine-month fiscal period through the end of 28 February 2017 on $26.8 billion and at 1.41% over the same period in 2016. For the first three months of 2017 total revenues grew at just over 2% for the period. Cloud and on premise software comprise 80% of total revenues. Oracle's revenue growth momentum has been conspicuously flat in comparison since 2012. Revenue growth for the Company's fiscal year ending the 31st of May 2016 contracted just over 3% YOY. In 2015 revenue growth contracted again, losing 0.13% YOY. In 2014 revenue expanded almost 3% YOY while in 2013 total revenue expanded by 0.16%. Oracle's recent year revenue is a far cry from the explosive growth potential so vividly on display by CRM over the past five years, signaling a cooling of its momentum growth of years past. Oracle hit a market high of $46.79 in mid-March only to flatline to yesterday's market close of $46.52 after slipping over 6% through the latter part of March-early April timeframe amidst a good deal of profit taking (see Figure 3, below). The stock is up almost 20% on the year, arguably more reflective of the momentum of software stocks as a group rather than actual company growth fundamentals.Figure 3: OracleAdobe presents a closer, less mature market comparison. ADBE's revenue growth rate was more comparable at 22% through the end of 2016 YOY, 16% through the end of 2015 YOY, 2% through the end of 2014 YOY, -8% through the end of 2013 and 4% through 2012. The company's digital media and marketing segments comprised just over 97% of total revenue for the fiscal year through the 3rd of March. ADBE has had strong investor support for much of the year to date which has driven the stock to an on-year high of $134.63. The stock is up 31% through Friday's market close (5 May), well above that of the Dow Jones Software Index (see Figure 4, below).Figure 4: AdobeRevenue broken down by cloud offering reveals the sales cloud platform retains the widest corporate usage both domestically and internationally being responsible for 39.5% of total revenue for the period, growing just over 13% YOY and 10% in 2016. The service cloud comprised 29.9% of total revenue and claimed a growth rate of 28% in 2017 and 38% in 2016. The salesforce cloud posted 18.6% of total revenue through the end of fiscal year 2017 and logged a growth rate of 39% for the period which matched its growth rate of 2016. The marketing cloud returned 12% of total revenue for the period and a growth rate of 43% in 2017 on top of a 29% increase in 2016. Roughly 11% of this growth was directly attributable to CRM's purchase of Demandware. Geographically, 74% of total revenue came from the Americas, 16% came from Europe and 10% came from Asia-Pacific.Market and sales expenses are critical components of the application software space and CRM uses the data point as a primary ratio of performance delivery. Through the end of the Company's fiscal year, market and sales expense came to $3.9 billion, or 46.7% of total revenue for the year. That number has dropped slowly but steadily since 2013 which produces an annualized mean of 51.0%. By comparison, Oracle's sales and marketing expenses grew at a more mature 18.15 in fiscal 2016, 16.9% in 2015, 16.6% in 2014, 16.0% in 2013 and 18.8% in 2012. Adobe's sales and marketing expenses grew by 33% in 2016, 35% in 2015, 40% in 2014, 40% in 2013 and 34% in 2012. Adobe's mean growth in the expense category came to 36.40% over the period.A $210.3 million tax benefit posted in the Company's fiscal year due to a valuation allowance related to the Demandware which provided an additional income, providing CRM with its first positive net income post of $179.6 million. Diluted net income as a result came to 0.26 per outstanding share.CRM closed today (4 May) at $86.52, up almost 27% on the year. The stock has posted a strong uptick, mirroring the Dow Jones US Software Index since the beginning of last week, finishing the day at a reading of 1.001 on its MACD chart. Investor support for the stock remains strong at a reading of 67. Today's market close continues to push against its upper Bollinger band, reaching an intra-day high of $87.13 before falling back to its $86.52 market close, down 0.03% on the day (see Figure 2, above).Over the course of time, SaaS platforms should be able to generate revenues at ever increasingly lower marginal cost from a growing and sticky user base, a trend that Oracle appears to have captured. The overall size and dimension of the future CRM's subscription and services segment will ultimately determine whether the company can indeed become the annuity-like business about which investors constantly dream-a stickiness CRM has a decent chance of achieving given current underlying fundamentals. I would project a 12-month price target of $100, creatively based on a mean revenue growth rate of 28.85% since 2013 coupled with a 2.57% annualized decline in marketing and sales expense for the period. I would project a break-out EPS valuation of $0.75 for the coming fiscal year based on a 13% annualized EPS growth rate since 2013."
4064975,101542,2017-04-25T12:17:13-04:00,"The idea that CRM was likely to experience lower than option-implied volatility for several months beginning from February has performed well, yielding a 39% absolute return, or 227% per annum.The prediction of range-bound trading has held up unexpectedly well, with the observed range much tighter than the $75-90 the strategy could tolerate while still producing the maximum potential payout.Trade economics in February benefited from volatility, elevated by the approaching Q4 2017 earnings announcement, though its actual impact was within the anticipated range.There was little benefit in delaying the commencement of the strategy until just before the earnings announcement.It would be better to wait before repeating this idea because options currently are not overvalued the way they appeared in February.","I previously expressed the view that Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was likely to remain range bound. The proposed implementation of this idea involved selling higher-strike calls at $90 and lower-strike puts at $75, and limiting the potential downside by buying options still further out of the money. This strategy was aided by the perception that the implied volatility of CRM options was rich relative to how the shares tended to move historically. It also was notably higher than that of its major competitors. The idea has performed well, earning a 39% absolute return, which translates to a 227% annualized figure. In this article, I will discuss the fundamental factors behind the idea's risk profile. I also will contemplate whether this strategy should be attempted again, given the current market environment. Finally, the question of the optimal timing relative to earnings announcement dates will be considered.Sold options forecast to be out of the money indeed end up worthlessThe idea involved selling two options and buying two options at market close on February 17:With shares closing at $83.79 on April 21, all calls' strikes are safely above the stock price and all put strikes are safely below. The strategy may be viewed as a combination of two vertical spreads, a call spread at $90-$95 and a put spread at $70-$75. I assume the position size of 20 contracts of each of the four options. This makes the amount at risk in either vertical spread equal to $10,000. Scaling the trades, potentially involving underlying stocks trading at wildly different prices allows one to compare results of strategies in options on these stocks within a single portfolio.All options expire out of the money, meaning that one will keep the entire amount $2,820 of initial proceeds. The following chart illustrates how this mark-to-market value was accumulated since the strategy was proposed as of the February 17 market close.Source: author's analysisRelevant news tends to emerge mostly around earnings announcementsFrom the fundamental standpoint, there are several reasons CRM share price moves. They include the release of new information about the underlying business or its growth prospects. The Q4 2017 earnings announcement on February 28 was expected to move the stock. In principle, statements by competitors, such as cloud-oriented plans of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), could have had an impact on CRM. The company could have chosen to update guidance mid-quarter. Everyday trading by informed (or speculating) market participants is another source of volatility.Despite the plethora of possible factors, the underlying belief was that, aside from everyday trading activity, there was only one specifically identifiable source of volatility: the Q4 2017 earnings announcement.The shares' performance supported this point of view. The stock price did not change substantially the day or the week preceding the earnings date. The largest positive return during the period occurred immediately after Q4 2017 release, with the following day seeing a 2.98% uptick. Interestingly from the perspective of the total return for a shareholder, CRM shares saw a very similar return of +2.85% over the entire duration of the strategy from February 17 to April 21. In other words, a single trading day from February 28 market close to the close on March 1 effectively encapsulated much of CRM news' information content over a much longer period.The analysis in February suggested that the impact of a typical earnings announcement was likely to remain within the bounds set by a 8.27% drop needed to reach the $75 strike of the sold put and a rally by 9.96% that would get to the $90 strike of the sold call, relative to February 17 closing price of $81.47. On this scale, the 3% move following Q4 2017 announcement can be safely called a non-event.Volatility, forecast to be lower than market expectations, turned out even lowerThe original article took the position that CRM options were overvalued - that is, priced using a higher than fair implied volatility. Market activity that occurred since then supported this view. The realized volatility, at 14.2% per annum, was much lower than the implied volatility of options being sold, 30.2% (mid-market) for $75 puts and 29.9% for $90 calls at February 17 close.Shares traded within a comparatively narrow range for the entire period the strategy was in progress, with daily closes being in the range of $81.35-85.34. This was far tighter than the widest range of $75-90 permitted by the strategy in order to produce the best outcome.Source: QuandlShould this strategy be repeated immediately?Back in February, April options had about two months left to go. The market valued at the money (ATM) options at the implied volatility of a little over 29% per annum. I saw the fair value at about 24%, meaning there was an edge of 5 volatility points for a net seller of volatility.If we were to construct a comparable strategy as of now, we might use options expiring June 16. As of April 20, I saw June 16 ATM volatility at about 26%, very close to where I perceived the fair value to be. In other words, taking ATM volatility to represent the typical level of the volatility curve, selling volatility appears unattractive.One way to quantify the skew and smile of the volatility curve is to consider the ATM strike, and then step $10 up and $10 down from this starting point. Given the curve in February (displayed in the first chart in the previous article), out of the money (OTM) calls were priced at implied volatility about 1% higher than ATM, while OTM puts were about 2% higher. I would describe this smile as relatively flat and the skew as comparatively weak.In comparison, as the following chart as of April 20 shows, the smile has become much more pronounced, as has the skew of OTM puts. ATM market-implied volatility stands at 26%. Calls OTM by $10 trade about 1.5% higher, while $10 OTM puts are a whole 5 volatility points higher at 31%.Source: author's analysisThis change in volatility smile might superficially appear to support selling OTM options. The larger smile and the much steeper skew for OTM puts do benefit the trade. However, at this point two questions must be asked:The first one is easy: Given transaction costs, I see a similar strategy done with June 16 options having a negative expected return. In other words, it should not be done.As for the second, I think the changed shape of the volatility curve reflects the elevated odds of large share price moves. Holders of OTM options, both puts and calls, are betting on arrival of news that would result in the stock making large moves compared to how it has been moving in recent months. The steeper skew is particularly disturbing as it may also reflect investors being worried enough to buy protection via OTM puts.In summary, the changes in volatility skew and smile are consistent with the market's belief in the share price becoming unstable in the coming months. I would not want to bet against it, and so I believe this strategy should not be repeated with CRM for the time being.Does the timing of earnings announcement affect implied volatility?Comments to the original article suggested that the idea's attractiveness was enhanced by the approaching earnings release date. A belief was expressed in the notion of ""volatility expansion."" Given that, in this type of strategy, the optimal expiration tends to be 2-3 months away, I am going to simplify the question and explore how the ATM implied volatility of April options changed as February 28 earnings announcement approached.Source: author's analysisThe above image says that volatility was trending down slowly prior to the earnings date, and then dropped off sharply. The rapid decline after February 28 is understandable, as a major source of risk was removed. Volatility did rise in the days preceding the announcement: it bottomed at 27.5% on February 21 and subsequently peaked at 29.6% on February 28. Yet February 17, the reference date as of which the idea was suggested, saw ATM volatility at 29.1%, only marginally lower than the peak on February 28.I think it is fair to say that having the duration of the strategy include the earnings date likely enhanced the idea's potential return. On the other hand, considering the volatility levels during the weeks preceding the earnings announcement, I don't think a delay in initiating the strategy until just before the news release would have been of much benefit. If locking in a higher level of implied volatility is of interest, the idea could be implemented just as well when it was proposed, or even a week or two earlier.ConclusionConsidering the prospects of Salesforce.com in February, I foresaw a dearth of share-moving news over the coming months. April options could be sold at implied volatility values that were likely to accommodate the price impact of the approaching earnings announcement. My analysis of the options market yielded a limited-risk strategy, consisting of selling puts at $75 and calls at $90, both being levels the share price was seen as unlikely to reach, and buying $70 puts and $95 calls to limit the potential downside. The strategy has returned the best possible result, a 39% absolute return stemming from retaining the entire amount of initial proceeds.The article originally proposing this idea resulted in a lively discussion. An interesting question was raised regarding the impact on profitability of having an earnings announcement within the time period covered by the idea, and whether one might prefer to initiate such a strategy immediately prior to the news release. Implied volatility of options of a specific expiration does drop once the earnings results have been announced. There indeed might be a slight pick-up in implied volatility just before the announcement. However, from the perspective of selling at close to highest values of implied volatility, I do not see an advantage in waiting. Similarly high, and potentially higher, sales proceeds might be obtained a week or two prior to the announcement date. Aside from maximizing the proceeds, there are numerous other factors involved in optimizing the expected return. I believe the fuller picture needs to be considered in deciding when to initiate the strategy. On the other hand, waiting till just before the earnings press release is published might be suboptimal.Aside from the possibility, that indeed materialized, of lower than expected realized volatility, proposing the strategy in February relied on the theoretical edge in the form of the market pricing options about 5% in implied volatility higher than the perceived fair value. Such advantage does not exist today for June 16 options with the comparable amount of time left till expiry, even though the relevant period includes an earnings announcement in May. Further, the current shape of volatility skew and smile indicates an elevated risk of extreme share price moves. A similar strategy commenced in the current market environment would actually have a negative expected return. I believe it would be better to wait for more favorable conditions, or a different perspective on the stock, before initiating another strategy in CRM options.Note from the author: Thank you for reading.

I will show why I believe that Salesforce will once again live up to its expectations.Before I begin my analysis, I would like to point out Salesforce's history of outperforming the consensus as well as outperforming its own guidance. In the last couple of years, I cannot find a quarter where they performed lower than was expected of them in terms of both revenue and EPS. They almost always see a small beat in one area and are in-line with estimates in the others. The following pictures show the recent history of Salesforce's Wall Street Estimates (grey), company guidance (red) and actual results (green) for both EPS and revenue (Source: Estimize.com).Revenue:EPS:As you can see, revenue has steadily been reported just slightly above expectations and shows a consistent uptrend. The seasonality is a bit more evident in the EPS reporting, noted on the chart above. But what the EPS chart does show is that management almost always gives an EPS guidance within a small spread between the low-end and the high-end Wall Street consensus.Therefore, it is safe to assume that both Wall Street analysts and the company itself record fairly conservative estimates. This creates the environment wherein a company can outperform expectations consistently and makes it easier to predict other earnings beats, but be aware that this could also result in chaos among investors when the company eventually misses earnings.Company guidance and Wall Street consensusDuring Salesforce's most recent earnings release, management gave a guidance for Non-GAAP EPS and revenue. It said that it expected revenue for the fourth quarter to be realized between $2.267bln and $2.277bln. This would be a year-over-year increase of about 25%. EPS was guided to come in at $0.25. The share count to calculate this with is 724mln.Wall Street currently expects $2.276bln worth of revenue on top of an EPS of $0.25.Fourth quarter revenueSo far Salesforce has seen increased year-over-year revenue growth numbers for each of its quarters with the most impressive one coming from this year's first quarter at 27.15%.Source: SalesforceAs you can see, thus far the average increase in year-over-year growth percentages have been well above 1% in each of the three reported quarters. But management currently guides for 0.7% a slower growth rate than last year, or a very small increase of 0.3%. Maybe this is still because of the somewhat underwhelming second quarter due to economic weakness (although it was still by all means a very decent quarter). Perhaps management is trying to keep expectations down. But I do not think this would be necessary considering the results of the most recent quarter were outstanding. Also, management's tone after the third quarter earnings release was very positive:Therefore I believe the guidance for the fourth quarter revenue is, once again conservative and that Salesforce will slightly outperform its own guidance, like it does most of the time. Considering third quarter successes, management's history of conservative revenue guidance, and Salesforce's recent growth trends I expect revenue to come in above the company's own high-end guidance. Considering all of this a year-over-year growth rate near 27% makes more sense, this would result in revenue of $2.299bln in the fourth quarter, about $22mln higher than expected.Net MarginThis time I will try to estimate EPS by going straight to the net margin.Source: SalesforceWhile the upcoming period is usually one of Salesforce's best performing quarters (in terms of revenue), the opposite is true when it comes to its net margin. While the overall net margin this year has been up quite a bit, except for a small decline during the third quarter, the fourth quarter usually has the lowest net margin.According to management's EPS and revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, it expects net margin to come in at 7.7%-7.9%. This would seem to fit in the usual fourth quarter trend. Because there is not really any indication that would result in unforeseen costs, I will take the middle of this net margin in my calculation. This results in an EPS of $0.25, meeting Wall Street's expectation.ConclusionI expect revenue to once again outperform consensus and guidance by a small margin. At the same time I expect the EPS number to come in at the high-end of company guidance.Understand that this is merely my estimate of this company's earnings and that an earnings beat doesn't necessarily mean that share prices will go up. Especially with a growth company like salesforce that beats estimates on a regular basis."
4048588,24992,2017-02-22T19:00:27-05:00,Company operating with a negative correlation between revenue growth and net income growth.Since 2010 employee stock plan purchases have generated 5x more cash for company than net earnings.$1.1 billion convertible note maturing April 2018 could have negative impact on capital structure.ChartMasterPro downward target price of $74.00.,"Shares of Salesforce.Com Inc (NYSE:CRM) are up about 28% over the past year. Current shareholders and prospective shareholders now have a decision to make. Should they buy and/or continue to hold or take their profits at this point. In my opinion, investors would do well to sell or steer clear of Salesforce until the price returns to a sane valuation. I outline my reasoning below briefly by citing the long history of relatively poor performance of the business, a looming debt event next April, the fact that employee stock plans have dwarfed net income since 2010, and, most importantly, the fact that the stock is trading at a massive multiple to the overall market.Financial Review: If Rising Revenue Won't Lead to Higher Profits, What Will?The thing that leaps off the page for me when I review the history of this company going back to 2010 is the seeming disconnect between revenue growth and net income growth. I ran the numbers, and there's actually a negative (r=-.354) correlation between revenue and net income since 2010, which is stupefying to me. It seems that, over time, the more this company generates in sales, the less profit it makes.I'd remind readers that we investors aren't compensated with sales. The source of long-term investor returns is income. That's it. It's what leads to growing book value, it's the source of sustainable dividends. Over time, rising earnings correlate nicely with stock prices. We care about net income. The fact that the company has just turned profitable for the first time since 2011 is great news. I'd just suggest that investors should wait for more evidence that the usual relationship between revenue and net income in fact exists at this company before buying the shares.In addition to the disconnect between revenue and net income, I'm nervous about the debt here. As the company itself says in its latest 10-K, ""we have a high level of debt, including the .25% convertible senior notes we issued in April of 2013, due April 1, 2018…""(10-k, pp.21). The convertible notes are worth about $1.1 billion, and by next April they will either lead to dilution or (in the company's words again) ""we could face constraints related to the terms of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our stock"" (10-k, pp.14). In any event, this looming hit to the capital structure is troublesome in my view.Employee Stock Plan: Getting By With a Little Help From My FriendsInvestors want employees to be engaged in the business and committed to the long-term success of the company. There's a great virtue when employees are engaged. Taken to an extreme, though, any virtue can turn sour and that's the case with Salesforce. Employee stock plan purchases have generated approximately $2.3 billion for the company since 2010 as opposed to net income which has generated approximately $-450 million over the same time period. When employee stock plan purchases represent far more cash in to the business, it obviously calls into question the reason behind the buoyant stock price.Valuing The Stock: How Much Growth To Bring Stock In Line With Market?Investors access the cash flows of a company by purchasing the surrogate for the business - the stock. Unfortunately, stocks sometimes get way ahead of the business' fortunes, as investors become exceedingly optimistic about a given company's long-term future. This is the case with shares of Salesforce at the moment, in my opinion. I'll attempt to point this out by analyzing what would have to happen to revenue and earnings (assuming the current net income margin) to make these shares reasonably priced (or at least priced the same as the current market).Holding all else constant (i.e. the stock price and the current margin), in order for Salesforce's valuation to line up with the current valuation of the market, revenue and net income would have to increase approximately 7.8 times. Obviously this future is a very long way off, if it's even possible.Technical SnapshotWe believe CRM is due for a pullback from its current level. On the weekly chart below we have identified seven price peaks from which the stock has sold off over the last three years. Each time the stock has climbed 10% above its 26-week moving average, it has become susceptible to a sell-off back down to the 26-week average. From the previous seven price peaks, the stock has traded back down to the 26-week moving average six times. The average price peak occurred when the stock was 13.7% above the moving average - CRM currently sits 10.9% above the moving average. From here we see the stock trading back down to the $74.00 level over the next six months.Today we will purchase the CRM 16JUN17 82.50 Put Options which will provide us with approximately 7x leverage on our short trade. Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a weekly close above $84.00.For investors in the shares we recommend you SELL to avoid any future drop in the share price.ConclusionCurrent investors are willing to bet on a very optimistic future where this company can continue to grow revenues rapidly and will start to grow net income in lock step with those revenues. In my view, the market is pricing these shares too optimistically. If the company starts to execute well, shares likely won't do much as rapid growth is already baked into the price. If, as is much more likely, some negative catalyst (perhaps related to the convertible notes) disrupts the business and the shares will react accordingly. Thus, investors who buy at these valuations face a negative risk reward outlook: not much upside if things go well, and a great deal of downside if things go poorly. For that reason, I recommend avoiding Salesforce.Com Inc."
4048356,41741,2017-02-22T12:51:46-05:00,"Activist might be taking a small interest in Salesforce.
        The activist playbook looks to be acquisitions.
        Which could be CRM’s best hope as its business looks to be slowing.","Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has a suite of potential activists that own starter stakes in the company, which could lead to bigger things. This includes the likes of Carl Icahn protege Keith Meister of Corvex Management, Barry Rosenstein's JANA Partners and Bill Ackman protege Scott Ferguson's Sachem Head Capital. While no activist has officially waged a campaign, it might not be long.Working against the CRM activist thesis is that shares are inherently expensive and that shares are up a solid 28% in the last year.Still, there might be more upside to extract if an activist leverages the buyout playbook at CRM, in particular, convincing CRM to make a strategic acquisition. Possibly taking another look at Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to further spur growth? However, that would've been a sizable, near $20 billion buyout, and one that would've been too risky. Recall that JANA Partners took a small TWTR stake in 2016. Last quarter it sold that stake and placed its bet on CRM.Other investors realized this and put pressure on CRM not to make a bid for TWTR. CRM has a history for looking at big name deals, including being in the running for the buyout of LinkedIn - which it lost out to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This is all part of CRM's quest to double the company's size in the next three years. However, this type of mentality could cause CRM to make a costly mistake.Rather, activists have likely had enough of CRM's aggressive acquisition spree and instead, will actually push for a bigger player to step up and acquire CRM. There is a precedent here as well, with there being serious interest in CRM during 2015, to the point that it hired advisors to field buyout interest.CRM has a major deal with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), using Amazon Web Services as its cloud infrastructure. This could lead to an even bigger deal with Amazon in the future - i.e. will Amazon buy up CRM? In the least, we could see Amazon spin off its AWS business and merge it with CRM.The push toward the cloud and the growth of the industry is a big positive for CRM. It's the market share leader for software allowing salespeople to track interactions. Yet, competition is rising as the likes of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), MSFT and SAP (NYSE:SAP) continue to encroach on its territory. The likelihood that CRM can keep up its rapid sales growth is waning. CRM feels that it can grow sales upwards of 30% and hit revenues of $20 billion by 2022. However revenue growth has already slowed from the near 40% in 2012 to 24% last year.The best bet is that CRM finds itself a buyout target for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Notably, if the likes of AMZN shows any interest in CRM, it could spur a bidding war. Any company that combines with CRM will be formidable in the cloud industry, and instantly get relationships with CRM's biggest customers, including General Electric (NYSE:GE) Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA).One possible opportunity for activists is expense cutting. Marketing expenses were nearly 50% of revenues last quarter. The activist playbook could involve exchanging some of that expected growth for profits.In the end, activists like to push for buyouts, but they won't be pushing for CRM to grow with acquisitions. Instead, the thesis is likely to get CRM bought out. Even Still, I'm not hopeful for an activist to show up. CRM looks destined to trade at an expensive valuation, riding on the hope of continued cloud growth. Yet, hope isn't an investing strategy and the company hasn't posted a profit since 2011."
4048054,102273,2017-02-21T19:53:07-05:00,Salesforce is betting on global retail market to spur growth.The company might acquire digital media creation software to bolster retail & marketing cloud.It could have nice upside from higher overage fees from retail gross volume in good retail environment.,"From the time of its founding, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) had set its sights on providing comprehensive Customer Relationship Management [CRM] capabilities across sales, customer service and support, and marketing. Over the years, it has bolstered its business with various acquisitions, but the Demandware acquisition is vastly different from the rest.Before acquiring Demandware, Salesforce would only help manage sales leads and sales pipeline data via its Sales Cloud or help in targeting the right customers via its Marketing Cloud or help businesses and their customers resolve service issues via its Service Cloud. Demandware acquisition inserts Salesforce into managing and completing its customers' in-store and e-commerce sales transactions. Thus, the success of Demandware acquisition is partially linked to the revenue growth of its customers.Demandware provides capabilities for both retail store operations and e-commerce. It counts many retailers and branded manufacturers as its customer, including L'Oreal (OTCPK:LRLCY), Carter's (NYSE:CRI), adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY), 1-800-CONTACTS, Barneys New York, Motorola Mobility, Kate Spade (NYSE:KATE) and Tory Burch. Since 2011, Demandware has grown rapidly from having 75 customers and 237 websites in 2011 to 331 customers and 1,506 websites in 2015. Many of its customers have multiple revenue-generating websites for various geographies, brands and channels, and so there are more sites than customers that are served by Demandware.Exhibit: Number of Customers and Websites Managed by Demandware (2011-2015) (Source: Demandware Company Filings)Exhibit: Demandware Customers (Source: Demandware Company Filings)Exhibit: Demandware Customers (Source: Demandware Company Filings)Customers in Apparel and Footwear segments accounted for 52% of the revenue for Demandware in 2015.There are two components to the Demandware Platform:Exhibit: Demandware Service Offering (Source: Demandware Company Filings)Demandware Digital provides capabilities to create and maintain a highly scalable online store. It provided ways for customers to maintain their mobile website and enhance shopping experience with in-store capabilities such as endless aisle. The Demandware Digital platform allowed for easy access to call center for customer support and for order management including order placement, modification, payment, returns and reporting.Demandware Store, which in 2015 was being piloted by a select group of customers, offers core point-of-sale capabilities, mobile point-of-sale and helped manage store operations.Demandware Revenue RecognitionDemandware's subscription fees for its e-commerce customers are based on a revenue-sharing model, in which customers pay a percentage of their total gross revenue that is processed on the platform. Each customer commits to a minimum level of gross revenue and thus Demandware gets a minimum subscription fee irrespective of the retail performance of its customer. This revenue model also ties it closely with the seasonal variations of its retail customers and to the overall health of the retail sector. Demandware would see a higher revenue due to overage fees in the fourth quarter (holiday season) since that is the highest revenue quarter for retailers.Salesforce could now see good upside in both revenue and profitability from these overage fees as long as the retail sector is healthy and its customers are benefiting from a healthy retail sector. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, overage fees represented 33.2%, 27.0% and 22.3% of subscription revenue, respectively, for Demandware (Source: Company Filings).Exhibit: Demandware Quarterly Revenue & Growth Rate (Source: Demandware Company Filings)Race to $10 Billion in Cloud RevenueCurrently, Salesforce is in competition against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to claim the ""prize"" for the first to attain $10 billion in annual cloud revenue. Historically, the Sales Cloud product has been the largest contributor of both subscription and support revenue. In fiscal-year 2015, Sales Cloud contributed about 43% of its total revenue. The slowing growth in its Sales Cloud product segment, which grew at about 10% year over year in fiscal year that ended in January 31st, 2016, makes it necessary for Salesforce to invest in other product segments to grow revenue.Revenue from Demandware is included in the Marketing Cloud product segment. Demandware has been rebranded as Salesforce Commerce Cloud. One can envision a time in the future when the sales for retail is broken out into its own separate category.Demandware allows Salesforce to capture revenue from the global retail market and thus can increase revenue as the retail market expands. According to eMarketer and IDC, in 2014, the size of the global retail market was approximately $22 trillion. The potential offered by the retail market is vast compared to the markets for e-commerce software market (~$10 billion) and the cloud market (~$50 billion) (Source: IDC and eMarketer). E-commerce sales (Electronic Shopping and Mail Order) have been growing at a fairly healthy clip in the U.S., crossing 10% of total retail sales (excluding motor vehicles and parts dealers) in 2014.Exhibit: NAICS Code - 4541 Electronic Shopping & Mail Order Total U.S. Sales (Source: United States Census Bureau Monthly & Annual Retail Trade)The revenue growth in the Marketing Cloud may be extremely critical to Salesforce to achieve its stated target of $10 billion in revenue by fiscal year 2018.Exhibit: Salesforce Revenue from Product Segments (Source: Company Filings)The good news may be that marketing cloud segment presents Salesforce with more opportunities to grow revenue. Marketing Cloud may be the perfect segment for Salesforce to derive faster revenue growth. It is currently the smallest of the product segments, and adding Demandware commerce platform to it could very well bolster its sales growth.Exhibit: Quarterly Revenue from Salesforce Product Segments (Source: Company Filings)In the increasingly complex and costly world of omni-channel retail, Salesforce may have found a new growth engine. Given the margin pressure and increased competition, it is becoming extremely difficult for retailers to justify continuous investment and upgrades to the on-premise sales and marketing systems. Demandware helps retailers of all sizes be more agile without the huge up-front cost of a software system.Demandware gets Salesforce closer to the global retail consumer and helps sharpen its customers' focus by providing a more personalized shopping experience. Salesforce had acquired ExactTarget in 2013 to gain capabilities around cross-channel, digital marketing solutions to help target customers across the channels of social, mobile, e-mail and the web. Sales transaction data from Demandware enhances that capability and helps target consumers with more precision.Demandware seems to be a shrewd acquisition. There are a couple of ways through which this Demandware acquisition and the Marketing Cloud product segment could grow:Give its sales and marketing roots, Salesforce may very well decide to enhance its marketing capabilities in the short term. That may very well mean more acquisitions and further industry consolidation. But, in the long run, it seems inevitable that it will become a one-stop cloud vendor for enterprise resource planning (ERP). Salesforce may already be setting its sights on $20 billion in revenue.If you like my articles, please consider following me."
4047930,101542,2017-02-21T14:12:32-05:00,"April 2017 options on CRM are particularly expensive, both relative to how much shares have been moving recently and compared to the company's major competitors.The result is a possible limited-downside strategy with 50% expected return per annum.Shares' behavior around earnings announcement dates, while volatile in the short term, results in returns of typically smaller magnitude when viewed over one-week time horizon.Even though Q4 earnings release tends to result in bigger price moves than reports for other quarters, the strategy is seen as well-positioned with a sizable safety buffer.","Options on Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) trade at implied volatilities far in excess of the level of realized volatility. The discrepancy is greater for CRM than that for all of its major competitors. In this article, I will propose a limited-risk strategy designed to take advantage of overpriced options and consider its risks in light of the approaching Q4 FY2016 earnings announcement and Salesforce's history.Salesforce April 2017 options are particularly expensiveAt the money options expiring April 21, 2017 were quoted at around 29% implied volatility as of February 17 market close. While slightly cheaper than 30.8% volatility of daily returns during the preceding two years, options are priced far in excess of recent realized volatility of 18%.To put this difference in perspective, we can look at other large software development companies and specifically, compare implied volatility of April 2017 at the money options to volatility actually experienced by their shares in recent weeks. For Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), a company with the somewhat similar level of options' implied volatility at 24.2%, realized volatility stood at 16.3%. This difference is also large, yet is smaller in percentage terms than that for CRM. For Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), the levels stood at 16.9% implied and 11% realized, a much smaller difference both in absolute and in relative terms. The picture for IBM (NYSE:IBM) was nearly the same as for Oracle, at 16.9% implied and 10.9% realized, respectively.Source: author's analysisQ4 FY2016 earnings: what might happen to the share price?The company is expected to report Q4 FY2016 earnings on February 28. The fourth quarter appears to be very important for the company. In particular, shares saw outsized returns the day following the announcement date, when Q4 FY2015 earnings were reported in February 2016 and also following the earnings release two years ago. However, the eventual changes in share prices were relatively muted, when looking at longer-term returns. The following exhibit presents, for a number of earnings announcements over the preceding two years:Source: Quandl and author's analysisThe takeaway is that the cumulative price move over the week following the announcement is typically unremarkable, while outsized returns on the day following the release date are mostly a particularly visible manifestation of a short-term rise in volatility. If one is concerned with share price moves on the order of 10% over a longer period, an earnings announcement is unlikely to bring about such a move all by itself.Designing a limited-risk strategyThe implication of options being viewed as overpriced by the market is to sell some. The idea is to sell put options struck at $75 and call options struck at $90. To limit the downside, $70 puts and $95 calls are to be bought. All expire on April 21, 2017. The number of contracts is meant to be the same for each option. Around the closing time on February 17, these options were quoted and analyzed as follows:Purely as an example, I will assume the size of 20 contracts of each option. If the strategy were implemented at February 17 closing prices, it would yield $2,820 in net proceeds. However, $10,000 would be required to maintain the resulting position, and so the capital of $7,180 would be tied down while the strategy remains in progress.The view is on volatility of SalesforceCRM closed at $81.47 on February 17. This is not far off the 52-week high of $84.48. Yet analysts are overwhelmingly bullish, with the median target price at $95. The proposed strategy, however, is meant to express a view on volatility, that shares will likely move less than implied by options' market prices. This is very different from having a directional view on CRM itself. Accordingly, option strikes are positioned roughly symmetrically around the latest share price.Risk analysisThe following exhibit presents the payoff at expiration as a function of the terminal share price.Source: author's analysisThe best case scenario is realized when shares remain between $75 and $90. Then, all options expire out of the money and the net proceeds of $2,820 collected initially yield a 39% return, which annualizes to 227%. Results get substantially worse outside of the $75-90 range, with break-even observed at share price levels of $73.59 and $91.41. Potentially the worst case scenario, losing the entire amount of the initial investment of $7,180 will occur if shares rise above $95 or fall below $70.I believe the best way to evaluate this strategy is by considering the expected return. Assuming the valuation model to be correct, the excess of initial proceeds under market prices over that under model prices is expected to be earned over the time remaining until expiration. This results in the expected annualized return of 50%. In an idealized scenario of being able to establish positions at mid-market prices, the expected return would improve to 71% per annum.Considering some extreme scenariosThe inner range of $75-90 corresponds to shares declining by 8.27% or rising by 9.96%. Viewed relative to February 17 closing price of $81.47, the break-even levels $73.59 and $91.41 represent a decline of 10.17% and an increase of 11.51% respectively.From the perspective of the earnings impact, historically the largest share price moves were seen the day following the announcement as discussed earlier. The break-even levels are positioned very comfortably, given the largest earnings impacts seen in the past two years.At this time, 43 trading days remain until the expiration on April 21. Hence, another way to visualize the risk of this strategy is to look at past CRM returns over the trailing window of 43 business days. The following exhibit highlights several instances when shares rallied or declined in excess of safety margins of the proposed strategy. In these instances, the share price declines exceeded the 10.17% drop to the lower break-even level or increased by over 11.51% distance to the upper break-even.Source: data from Quandl and author's analysisApart from several notable deviations, CRM returns over the trailing window sized at 43 business days remained within the break-even range on 74% of dates from 2015 and later.ConclusionA negative view on Salesforce options can be expressed by selling equal quantities of $75 puts expiring in April 2017 as well as $90 calls and limiting the downside exposure by buying $70 puts and $95 calls. Under a fair-value model, such a strategy is seen as having the expected annualized return of 50%. One key factor supporting this idea is that the market prices options on CRM higher than the recent price volatility would justify. Another is that the apparent over-valuation of April 2017 options is greater for CRM than for a number of its competitors.Note from the author: Thank you for reading.

4033267,98236,2016-12-29T12:53:12-05:00,CRM has been one of my less successful calls for the past year and has generated enough negative alpha to last a lifetime.The company's operating performance has been decent enough for the most part; but not good enough to satisfy investors.The elements that investors want to see in their tech portfolio simply haven't come together for this company in 2016.The company is dealing with a few difficult choices looking ahead that present some risks that not all stakeholders appreciate.The easiest end-game is a sale - but it is not obvious whether a sale might come and at what price.,"CRM - How will it satisfy investors in 2017?I confess that this has not been a fun article to write. I do not like to lose - and yet this has been one of my worst picks over the past year. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has not been the most satisfying stock to own in 2016. And I have owned it for much of the time. Some indeed might describe its share price performance over these past 12 months as that of an annus horribilis. The shares are down nearly 12% as I write this and have significantly underperformed the IGV index, which is up almost 7%. And lest I try to avoid taking blame for my own opinions, the shares have lost about the same percentage since I initially proclaimed my positive outlook for the shares in this forum. I got that one wrong - dead wrong this past year.After looking through some notes and assumptions about 2017, I have a hard time in forecasting that things are going to dramatically change. I am, perhaps, more optimistic than some regarding the outlook for this company's operating performance in the coming fiscal year. But as I walk down memory lane with you, I am wondering exactly what is going to change.The shares are cheaper, of course - quite a bit cheaper. They sell at an ES/S of about 4.7X, far less than they have historically. The P/E on non-GAAP earnings estimates is still 54X and the earnings are non-GAAP - the company does not yet make GAAP profits although that troubles me less than it does some. But the free cash flow yield, as I calculate it, is likely to be about 3.7% next year and investors seem to feel that they need more based on their expectation for growth.I make the case in this article that Salesforce could be bought - and I think that is a little bit more than wishful thinking. But I also make the case that this management team is likely to take risks in terms of acquisitions that some investors will not find palatable. The latter is more likely than the former.Should investors own Salesforce shares expecting positive alpha in 2017? I confess to being on the cusp of that decision paradigm. I want to say yes and I expect the company will do ""well."" But I am not quite sure that well is adequate for investors, particularly as I explain below. And I feel that the risk of an acquisition that displeases investors is not minimal. I guess in the parlance of the street these days, I find the shares to be a strong hold.I suppose I could say that misery loves company and the shares are recommended by 43 of the 47 analysts who publish their recommendations on First Call. But if you have been a reader or follower of mine, you can't take that to your wine merchant and order a bottle of Krug for the New Year's celebration. Perhaps by reviewing what went wrong with CRM as an investment this year, I might be in a position to see if I might be a better prognosticator. There is the old saying about those who are ignorant of history being doomed to repeat it. I am not anxious to enlarge my tuition bill in terms of learning what makes investors happy with regards to a name such as this.In looking back, the issue hasn't really been one of the company's operating performance. The company started its fiscal year by announcing a strong end to fiscal 2016 which ended 1/31 - overall revenues grew by 27% in constant currency and CFFO grew by 37% for the full year.The odds are that the company will announce something between a decent and a spectacular end to the current fiscal year, muted to a small degree by the rise of the dollar. I would be surprised to see the company not at least match guidance and the current consensus and most likely it will exceed estimates except for the impact of FX on its numbers. The company has been growing its derived bookings proxy by 25% throughout the year belying expectations of a growth slowdown. The company had a growth slowdown in July in the US and a growth speed-up the following quarter but the year has mainly passed without any high drama in terms of sales execution. One would be hard pressed in looking at the reported financial statements to develop material concerns regarding the trend of the company's business.For what it is worth, the company has beat expectations in three of the last four quarters in terms of earnings and it will wind up beating its initial revenue guidance for this fiscal year by almost 5%, much of it organically. It forecast non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.00 at the start of the year and despite absorbing several loss-making acquisitions and the substantial dilution it has dealt with through the use of stock-based comp, it will wind up earning $1.00 in non-GAAP EPS.And that, perhaps, is the first issue in terms of the company's performance this past year and represents a challenge to the share price going forward. Q4 now has an estimated average share count of 724 million compared to 690 million shares that were used at the time the company projected its Q1 results. When the company initially projected the fiscal year, it did so based on a forecast of stock-based comp of $1.01/share. At this point, that metric has grown to $1.17 per share in the company's most current projection. Stock-based comp is currently running at an annual rate of $1.32/share based on the projections for Q4. Regardless of one's views regarding stock-based comp, and I refuse to be as doctrinaire as some who comment about the subject as though it were a religious tenet, the fact is that investors are rebelling against the use of what they believe to be excess stock-based comp, not just for Salesforce but for all of the other names similarly situated. It is one of the dirty little secrets of investing in 2016 and it is a message that resonates in trying to forecast how to invest going forward. Institutional investors have simply declined to pay up for earnings increases that are built on the back of increases in stock-based comp. And given the demand for high-skilled technical staff, it would be almost impossible for a company like this to grow its headcount at required levels without providing a relatively significant level of share-based awards. It is a conundrum without a facile answer.What is the limit for investors? It is clearly not some bright line. In Manhattan, the Upper East Side always had a hard border at 96th St. Real Estate developers, one of the larger hospitals in the area (Mt. Sinai) and the press of population have pushed the border and will continue to do so.The issue of stock-based comp is more or less the same. How much is too much is not something that can be written down and it is probably based more on expected future dilution than any other single factor. The fact is that it seems likely that Salesforce pushed beyond the limits that institutional investors were willing to pay and it has now been reflected in compressed valuation multiples. That is not likely to change, so far as I can tell, in the near future.Profitability - an elusive goal that is all dependent on definition.Are you fat? No, really, are you fat? Or just overweight or obese or are your clothes just feeling a bit snug these days? The same issues bedevil investors and commentators in arguing about the profitability of this company.Is Salesforce profitable? I think it is because it generates lots of cash. Others have a different perspective. I think the best measure of profitability for a company like this is free cash flow and free cash flow yield. Companies are in business to make cash for their stakeholders. The accounting conventions that animate GAAP and non-GAAP earnings really do not help investors in determining which business is making the most cash for them.For many years, as companies such as Salesforce have grown to maturity, one of the metrics I and others have considered is that of free cash flow generation. This company has developed a very seasonal pattern in terms of generating cash flow. The fact is that it has pushed its users to contracts that bill once a year and are primarily on a calendar or Salesforce fiscal year basis. So, it collects lots of cash in its Q4 (last year about 28.5% of the total and even more cash in fiscal Q1 - about 45% of the total). Of course, that means it doesn't collect all that much cash the other quarters of the year. And it means as well that comparisons have been hard to judge. Not everyone has chosen to move to annual billing or to change their billing dates.So far this year, CFFO has increased by 21%. The increase is being driven by small but noticeable improvements in GAAP expense ratios (although the word small might be replaced by microscopic in terms of GAAP Q3 expense ratios). In addition, balance sheet items have contributed significantly to cash flow this year as the decrease in receivables more or less mirrors the decrease in deferred revenues.But the fact is that the increase in CFFO - and in free cash flow, which is up by an even less impressive 15% year to date - is probably a factor that has led to the compression of valuation metrics. Last year, CFFO grew by 37% and free cash flow rose by 51%.Will CFFO and free cash flow growth catch up to the progression of revenues and reported profits? The company doesn't provide all that much insight into those kinds of questions. Just how much of the slowdown in the growth of deferred revenues has to do with annual billings at this point is not easy to measure. Many investors do not like to consider changes in the growth rate of a sub-headline number as dispositive in looking at valuation metrics. I think, however, that the slowdown in the growth of CFFO and free cash flow probably has had more to do with the reluctance of institutional investors to commit to this name than is probably appreciated by many. And again, I would be hard pressed to develop a scenario in which cash flow metrics are likely to grow at accelerating rates in fiscal 2018.Market share - a less elusive goal - but what about those asymptotes?Yes, those nasty asymptotes make it difficult for a large company to grow its market share beyond a certain level without meaningful acquisitions. At this point, Salesforce has achieved a run rate of in excess of $3 billion a year from its sales automation offering. But looked at another way, which includes all of the things that Salesforce offers that are classified as customer relationship solutions, the company is likely to do $6 billion in that category of revenue this year with a market share of greater than 20%. The problem is that the market is only growing at 12% and the other competitors include SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) that are battling to retain their position in the space.In 2015, CRM had to grow business in its core space by 21% just to gain a single point of market share. And that was despite the long-term secular trend of SaaS displacing on-premise installations. Given that both Microsoft and Adobe are both growing faster than the market for CRM as a whole, the challenge for Salesforce to grow its revenues within its core business at a rate fast enough to achieve overall growth that is acceptable to investors is close to impossible. Readers would do well to consider just why it is that Salesforce has been on an acquisition spree. It has nothing to do with some loss of judgment on the part of management. It has everything to do with the fact that given its market share within the CRM space, the growth of the market and the competitors it would need to displace, it simply cannot grow fast enough to satisfy investors unless it enters new spaces. It is not a simple problem to solve, although Salesforce has done about a good a job as might be reasonable to expect an enterprise of its scale to do.Obviously, Salesforce sells a lot more besides CRM solutions and those businesses have made it possible for the company to grow just fast enough to sustain a growth rate that supports its current valuation. The company's marketing cloud, which really gets counted in the CRM space when market share data is compiled, has grown by 35% this year but a considerable component of that growth was inorganic (the acquisition of Demandware in particular, which contributed $42 million in fiscal Q3 revenues, which was more than half of the growth recorded for the quarter). The company has achieved growth of 42% in its app cloud and 29% in its services cloud. Both of these are relatively decent-sized businesses that will reach between $1 billion and $2 billion of revenue this year.It is hard to imagine that either of these two revenue streams will accelerate in terms of percentage growth going forward. When looking back at the company's share price this year, the issue that concerns many is not how well the coming is doing now - but how well it will be able to do in fiscal 2018 and beyond. It really isn't terribly surprising to see that while 43 out of 47 analysts rate CRM shares a buy or a strong buy, they also have forecast that revenue growth is going to decelerate from 26% to 21% in the fiscal year that starts in February. As the saying goes - that dog is not going to hunt.Salesforce is going to either have to grow faster than the consensus, it is going to have to increase earnings faster than that consensus or valuation paradigms are going to have to change. Given how most institutions are trained to approach managing portfolio risk, it is not too surprising that they have been challenged to want to enlarge their already sizeable holdings in this name.What's a mother to do?I have read many critiques regarding the role of management in this company and, in particular, the fact that the CEO has enriched himself. OK, I understand the issues although for better or worse the CEO of this company has really spent a fair amount of profits he has derived from his share sales on eleemosynary projects that seem to belie some of the more strident and personal objections to his course of conduct.But the point of this section of the article is to examine at a high level what choices management has in running this business. As an analyst, one sees the results of bad or inappropriate choices all the time. I have spent more than a few electrons suggesting that neither the management of IBM (NYSE:IBM) or Oracle has done a good job for their shareholders by making some of the choices they have. I think that the opposite can be said about the management of this business.There really aren't a whole lot of easy choices for this company to make if it wants to provide shareholders with results that justify current valuations. One choice is to do more of the same. That simply isn't going to work - the numbers I have presented earlier suggest that without transforming this company, growth is most likely to coast downward and fulfill the expectations of many investors who have reduced positions in this name over the course of this past year.It is my expectation that this company will do what it can to maintain its growth rate and if that means that it takes chances in terms of acquisitions that displease some cohort of the shareholder base, it will happen anyway. Management ultimately chose to abandon its pursuit of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) but I would not be surprised to see the company make strategic moves during the course of 2017 that may displease some.There is a saying that derives from an arcane source about ""their Lordships dying in the dark."" For those readers with an interest in such matters, the expression has to do with the saga of the passage of the UK Parliament Act of 1911 and has nothing particular to do with evaluating enterprise software vendors. For those with an interest in the matter, I shall be happy to elaborate further offline.But the saying is apt when it comes to what I foresee happening with regards to Salesforce in the course of the next year or two. Its management, I believe, is disposed to take whatever chances present themselves to avoid sliding into a slower growth profile. And by that I mean it is going to be looking to find inorganic revenue growth sources that it feels can lead to synergistic benefits even if that means taking on risks that some of its shareholder base feel are unwarranted.Between Keith Block and Marc Benioff, Salesforce runs one of the highest pressure sales organizations ever seen in the enterprise software space and there is no evidence to suggest that these particular leopards will change their spots. Indeed, now that the company has forecast revenues of greater than $10 billion next year, it has presented an aspirational goal to do $20 billion of revenue. It would be very difficult to see how Salesforce would be able to double its size in any foreseeable time period (of course, depending on one's definition of foreseeable) without making more than a few transformative acquisitions.Yes, Einstein (the company's AI capability and not the scientist) is a big deal and I am sure it will add revenues to the different clouds that would otherwise not be available. And yes, I suspect that Salesforce is now and will remain a leader in selling the technology across its various product offerings. But Einstein by itself is never going to take this company to $20 billion in revenue.This company is not going to die in the dark or perhaps better said to accept a slower growth future and if that means taking risks, it is more than prepared to do so. And if that engenders some level of shareholder discomfort, I believe it is prepared to deal with that eventuality. Part of the current valuation paradigm or valuation compression has much to do with that factor and it will continue to weigh, I believe.Other AlternativesOver the course of the past year or so, Salesforce has developed a pattern of commercial amity with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Several months ago, it was announced that new Salesforce applications would be available on an Amazon platform and that Amazon was the preferred partner for Salesforce apps. Earlier this month, it was announced that AWS will deliver five new service integrations and will make all Salesforce offerings available through AWS in Canada. Over time, that offering will be global. In other words, users will be able to buy Salesforce on AWS for the same price and with the same terms that Salesforce is available on Salesforce. It is more than a small sea change and one that is thought-provoking at the least. And there are other service offerings coming that involve joint products as well. Another straw in that regard is something called the Alexa Toolkit for Salesforce, which will let developers build voice-enabled experiences.One of the things to note in looking carefully at the cash flow data from Salesforce is that its capex has shown substantial growth this year enough so that free cash flow growth has fallen significantly below the growth in CFFO. CRM has developed a significant business in what it calls its app cloud, which grew by 38% year on year last quarter. The apps cloud basically is a facility that allows third-party applications to run on the Salesforce platform and to connect to the appropriate Salesforce applications. It is likely a very high-profit service to offer except that it is one of the major factors driving capex. Salesforce can't sell the apps cloud without data centers to run its platform and building data centers is a hugely expensive proposition.The other side of the story for Salesforce is that it is almost inevitable that AWS has significantly lower costs in expanding its cloud capacity offerings than the costs that Salesforce faces if it wants to build out infrastructure to maximize the growth of its app cloud offering. And AWS inevitably has a far greater geographic reach than Salesforce is ever likely to have.Could all of these straws make a brick? I certainly do not know. I know that a couple of years ago, it was well rumored that Salesforce was in play and could be bought by... well, at the time, I think the most seriously mentioned name was Microsoft but Oracle was not out of the mix and I suppose IBM was included as well. At this point, with Oracle having bought NetSuite, its interest in Salesforce as an acquisition candidate is low. I am not quite sure if IBM could readily pay $75 billion to buy Salesforce. Microsoft has seemingly gone its own way with LinkedIn and Dynamics. If there is a transaction, and one can't rate the odds of it highly, AWS would be the most logical buyer and would seemingly achieve the most synergies from such a transaction. It is the kind of bold stroke that seemingly appeals to the CEO of Amazon and it relieves Salesforce of having to deal with its dilemma. And it fills the largest hole that AWS has in its cloud offering.Amazon has never really made a large acquisition. So far its largest acquisition has been Zappos followed by Twitch. It would be a bold step and one that would inevitably lead to some unknown level of frictional costs. No one can imagine that the integration of a sizeable software company would be easily accomplished. But it would be easy to make a case for the economics of such a transaction even assuming a material share price premium.I wouldn't want to bet on it happening - but I would hardly be surprised to find out that something happened along these lines. I guess I just wish I could figure out to be the banker on that kind of transaction. Sadly, that is less likely still."
4026340,22445,2016-11-25T13:58:13-05:00,"Salesforce.com is still growing at a very fast pace; however, the stock is still ahead of the fundamentals.That's the reason for its underperformance over the past two years, and the reason most other SaaS stocks have also underperformed.Other than that, the company is doing great, but remember, great companies don't always make you money.","Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) had a relatively good quarter. EPS came in at $0.24 beating by $0.03, and revenue for the quarter came in at $2.14 billion (+25% Y/Y), beating by about $20 million. Not only that, but the company is guiding an increase in revenue of about 20% for FY18. Folks, does it get any better than this?Yet while the stock initially rallied, the rally faded fast. Also, CRM's stock has not performed well at all over the past several days. In fact, CRM has underperformed over the past couple of years. What gives?The first headwind is that CRM is still a very expensive stock. Over the past 4 quarters, the company has produced $0.91 in adjusted earnings. This means a trailing P/E of about 81, or about 67 on a 12-month forward basis. Given the stock pays no dividend, that is not cheap folks.Second, I think the market is slowly coming to its senses.CRM PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsThe market is not paying 9-16 times revenue anymore for the stock. For those that follow me, the Price/Sales ratio is one of the ratios I look at to see how expensive a stock is. And CRM at times has been a huge bubble.Granted the company is still growing fast, but perhaps the lower Price/Sales ratio might mean the market is expecting growth to slow in the future? Or perhaps, 20% growth is not enough to support the company's $50 billion market cap anymore? I think both.Third, another very serious headwind is shareholder dilution (chart below).CRM data by YChartsSo while revenue has grown by 100% since 2014, CRM's stock has only moved from about $58 a share at the beginning of 2014, to about $74 today. That's because the stock was diluted by about 14% in the corresponding time frame.The same applies to other stocks in the sector, such as Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) and Cornerstone (NASDAQ:CSOD).CSOD data by YChartsLooking at the above chart, one would think that something bad has happened to these companies. But the truth is that these companies are doing great; there is nothing wrong with them.WDAY Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsIn fact, WDAY's quarterly revenue has tripled since 2014, yet the stock is lower than it was in 2014. The reason is the same for all three stocks, they were a bubble to begin with.CRM PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsAll these stocks have been trading at stratospheric valuations over the past several years. The price of their stock was so far ahead, that the fundamentals have still not caught up with them.So basically, what's happening is, the market is giving the benefit of a doubt to these companies pertaining to their business model and prospects, but there are limits to how much these stocks can rise, before the fundamentals catch up to the price of the stock. That's the reason for the underperformance.Now getting back to CMR, I think that the stock will continue to underperform. And underperformance is the good scenario, the bad would be for the company to guide that it will be growing at less than 20%. If that happens, its stock might crash as it did in the beginning of 2016, when CRM plunged from $80 a share to as low as $52 in a very short time.Bottom lineCRM is a great company, however, it is overpriced. For some reason, the market is giving it a valuation much higher than it deserves. That has been the reason it has underperformed over the past 2 years, and that's the reason I think it will continue to do so.While I am not telling you to short CRM, please note that if the company's growth slows, then it might be a short. For the time being, if I had CRM, I would simply sell it and look at other options. The same goes for WDAY and CSOD."
4025604,23625,2016-11-22T14:33:46-05:00,Strong fundamental growth has contributed to the success of these stocks in recent months and weeks.Forcerank users' bullish sentiment to these stocks are reflected in steadily improving average user ranks and frequent top 3 finishes.A fundamental and technical breakout support continued upside as we enter the final weeks of 2016.,"Each week, Forcerank runs a variety of games covering different industries. What we have found, is that the top three ranked companies in their respective games deliver the biggest positive price movement for that week. This week, the winners feature popular names like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI) | Apparel: In an unprecedented move, Hanesbrands sits atop this week's apparel contest, ahead of retail giants like Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU). Forcerank users gave the clothing company an average ranking of 4.6 compared to 5.9 in the previous week. This jump is a testament to robust fundamentals but also weakness from the other names on the list. Hanes has been successful in this challenging retail environment as many of its products have become wardrobe staples. Sales growth in recent quarters have also been supported by a star-studded list of celebrity endorsements, most notably, Michael Jordan. Shares have otherwise struggled in 2016, but are setting up to breakout before the close of the year. Its volume profile over the past 6 months is consistent with a share price in the range of $25 to $26, up to 6% higher than its current trading price.Amazon | Ecommerce: Amazon finds its way back to the top of the ecommerce contest after a few weeks of subpar performances. The retail giant had been hit hard following the election results as many investors believed a Trump Administration would place trade restrictions that would greatly hinder sales growth. Amazon has almost fully recovered its losses and appears to be back on its way to $1000 price per share. Shares are now closing in at $800 where it will be met with a gap-up that needs to be filled. In recent news, Amazon is exploring the option of providing a live sports package for prime members. This is an unprecedented move as live sports have been the last piece of traditional cable packages that has not been replaced by a digital platform. Amazon's robust portfolio of products and services that continue to grow has put the tech giant in the driver's seat moving forward.Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) | Large Enterprise Software: Salesforce is closing 2016 on a strong note after the first 10-11 months were anything but that. Its third quarter results reported last week proved it can continue to grow at a rapid clip without making a big acquisition. Revenue reported a 25% increase from a year earlier with earnings up 14% over the same time frame. Forcerank users pushed Salesforce to the top of its respective contest in response to the report with the average user rank rising to 3.9 from 4.8. Shares are seeing a technical breakout from the report and will continue to show upside as long as fundamental growth remains strong.Disney (NYSE:DIS) | Media: Shares have been trending higher in the past month despite a weak third quarter report at the beginning of November. Large losses from ESPN are largely to blame for the results, but that hasn't had a significant impact on the stock. The breakout in mid-October caused a bullish crossover in the MACD and jump in on balance volume. Growth in its theme parks and entertainment businesses have offset ESPN woes. Disney is prepared to release several hit movies in the next month including Star Wars Rogue One and Moana featuring Dwayne The Rock Johnson. The company has also indicated that it's exploring the possibility of starting a 24-hour digital news channel. It's uncertain what Disney aims to gain from the move, but it's unlikely to be detrimental in the short term. On the theme parks side, construction of a new Frozen attraction in Hong Kong is about to get underway while an Avatar theme area is prepared to open in Orlando next year.NVIDIA | Semiconductors: NVIDIA surprised the market yet again after the chipmaker reported blockbuster third quarter results. Investors were under the impression that expectations had been set so high that there was no realistic way the chipmaker could produce a standout quarter. Lo and behold, the chipmaker shattered expectations on the back of strong growth in automotives, cloud computing and virtual reality. Shortly following the report, Needham & Co. upgraded the stock to buy with a $100 price target, about $15 above its current trading price. The stock is likely to see a slight pullback after gaining nearly 30% in Friday's trading session, but is still primed to edge higher in the coming weeks. The case can be made that a technical gap down must be made, but solid fundamentals should help sustain the breakout."
4013285,26891,2016-10-19T18:13:25-04:00,"A board member's email was hacked, releasing the names of a number of companies Salesforce was considering acquiring.Facebook now taking on food ordering, event ticketing and more in an effort to grow the ""stickiness"" of its platform.Should Apple take on Microsoft to be the next tablet sponsor for the NFL after the latter's contract runs out in 2018?","Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) board member Colin Powell had his email hacked and one of the documents released was a presentation for the board on potential M&A targets.The list included Demandware, which Salesforce ultimately acquired, along with LinkedIn (LNKD), which the company did try to buy, but lost in a bidding war to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The fact that these names were on the list gives validity to the documents, as the company has acted on some of them since May.Many names on the list were smaller, fast-growing tech companies, but some stood out while others were notably absent. For instance, Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) was on the list. I thought that was an interesting name, given its near-$50 billion market cap at the time. That would seem like a tough buy given that Salesforce had a ~$55 billion market cap in May.Now, the tables have turned even more dramatically, with Adobe sporting a $53.5 billion market cap and Salesforce being a sub-$50 billion name.How would the company pull off such a move? One would think a merger could technically happen if both parties were very interested, but it seems pretty unlikely.Another name notably not on the list was Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). Oddly enough, some may assume that Twitter's market cap was too high at the time, but it's quite the opposite actually. Twitter's stock bottomed in late-May below $14 per share.At the time, its market cap was around $10 billion. By August, it was back to $13 billion (when the rumors started flying), higher than Twitter's market cap for most of the 3 to 4 months prior to its lows in May. So it seems surprising to me that Salesforce wasn't more interested in Twitter from the beginning, although the lost bid for LinkedIn could have sparked the idea.It also brings me back to the notion that, if so many people turned down Twitter after hiring people specifically to scope out whether it's a worthy purchase, why did they all say no? Why should we invest in Twitter if none of them would?Facebook Broadens PlatformFacebook (NASDAQ:FB) has faced a lot of scrutiny over time. First, it was just a social media network that would likely go the way of Myspace. Then it was a question of monetizing mobile. Then CEO Mark Zuckerberg was acquiring companies with shares of Facebook, meaning for some it meant the stock was overvalued.And here we are today. The company has billions of active users across a number of platforms, has become arguably the premiere form of advertising, and aside from the momentum Snap (CHAT) is gaining with teens, has a moat that continues to widen.The company is working on A.I.-powered bots in its Messenger app to help users connect with businesses and just today announced it is adding ""food ordering, appointment request, event ticketing and quote functions to Pages."" Below's a look at what the changes mean for users:My first thought was, what does this do for companies like Yelp (NYSE:YELP) or GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB)? Surely, this can't be good news, even if Facebook's features don't gain traction.The problem with fighting Facebook is that the social media juggernaut has so many users. With more than a billion users out there, Facebook can scale so fast that the users of its new features could easily top that of another service, like Yelp for instance.What will stop Facebook from taking on a company like Trip Advisor (NASDAQ:TRIP)? I suspect nothing, if Zuck wanted to do it. Travel, reviews, booking. You name it and Facebook could likely succeed at it over time.The second thought I had after the competitive impacts, is Facebook's ""stickiness"" factor. Think about it like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The e-commerce giant's goal is to provide such amazing service and features that consumers feel they can't live without Amazon Prime.That's exactly what Facebook is trying to do too. If users leave Facebook like customers would leave Amazon, both companies would crumble, theoretically. Facebook needs to keep users engaged at all costs possible. That's why it buys its competition and rolls out services that keep you thinking, ""go to Facebook"" whether it's to book a movie ticket, chat up a friend or relative, or hold a meeting in Workplace.Investors can mull this one over:Facebook Should Fall To $67Facebook Is Worth $150, Not $67Should Apple Push Out Microsoft With the NFL?Unless there's a connection between National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell and Microsoft, there's no reason that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) couldn't theoretically win the next contract for the ""official tablet of the NFL,"" when the current one with Microsoft ends in 2018.But is it realistic that it will?Ever since New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said he's done with Surface tablets - ""I've given them as much time as I can give them. They're just too undependable for me"" - there's been rumblings about Apple being the next sponsor.For starters, the contract that Microsoft has with the NFL runs from 2013 to 2018, a five-year deal costing $400 million. Apple paid nothing and watched in-game commentators refer to the Surface tablets as iPads and now Belichick has laid out his feelings on the device.Why should Apple pay up though? It's getting all sorts of exposure without paying a dime! Microsoft paid $400 million to be mistaken for its competitor and have one of the most noteworthy coaches in the sport decry its product.I guess Apple's got so much money that it doesn't really matter. But $400 million is a lot of money and the return, at least from the outside, doesn't look all that great. It helps (for Apple anyway) that tablets are often times referred to as iPads, much like Band-Aids for bandages.I don't think taking up partnership with the NFL will hurt Apple. I just don't know if they really need to do it.Apple's New MacsApple is in the news for other reasons too, one being that it's expected to launch new Macs. According to Recode, Apple will introduce the new devices on October 27th.Previously, we talked about the company's new Macbook Pro, which is getting its largest overhaul in some four years. It's expected that Apple will introduce a 13-inch and 15-inch model, both featuring Retina Displays, touch ID sensors and a mini OLED touch bar above the keyboard.

4025106,31561,2016-11-21T07:40:06-05:00,Russell 2000 up 11 consecutive days.Dollar up versus euro for 10 consecutive days.Micro-caps now provide most upside.Dodd Frank cause of Ferocious Micro-cap Bear Market.,"Small-cap stocks have been on fire and micro-caps will soon join the party. The Russell 2000, the U.S. index which is exclusive to the much smaller listed public companies advanced for eleven consecutive trading days from November 4 through November 18, 2016, when it closed at an all-time high. Over the period the Russell 2000 increased by 13.0% compared to the S&P 500's increase of 4.6%.There are two post-election developments which have caused the Russell 2000 to substantially outperform the S&P 500:1. U.S. dollar strength - The U.S. dollar has rallied sharply against all currencies since the election. It has advanced versus the Euro for the last ten consecutive days. The streak is the longest since the euro became Europe's primary currency in 1999. The dollar's strong rally has created a fierce headwind for the U.S.' large multinational companies, most of which are members of the S&P 500. Small companies do not have this headwind since most of their sales are generated in dollars and in the U.S.2. Fiscal Stimulus - Upon fiscal infrastructure stimulus being applied the U.S. economy will be better insulated against a global economic slowdown. The large multinational members of the S&P 500 are more susceptible to slowdown of the world economy than smaller companies. Infrastructure spending will have more of an impact on the U.S. centric smaller businesses than it will have on large multinational businesses.The chart below depicts that the Russell 2000 went back to historical premium above the S&P 500 after being at a discount for almost all of 2016. The chart also depicts that low priced shares and micro-caps remain deeply undervalued. This is even though the micro-caps are even better positioned to benefit from the strength in the U.S. dollar and fiscal stimulus than the small-caps. The micro-caps and companies with low share prices had tracked the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500 through 2012. The index consisting of low priced shares diverged to enter a ferocious bear market that was caused by the SEC's implementation of the Dodd Frank Act. Under Dodd Frank brokers became criminally liable for the first time in the history of the markets for recommending high risk shares to clients. Therefore, the brokers abandoned the micro-cap and low priced shares markets. Assuming that Dodd Frank is repealed as promised by Trump brokers will once again be able to recommend micro-cap and low priced shares companies. Regardless of whether or not Dodd Frank is repealed micro-cap shares have plenty of upside.The above price chart for the Royce Low Priced Stock, Russell 2000 and the S&P 500 indices also illustrates the wide divergence between the micro-cap and low priced stocks and the indices with the larger company members. This divergence is one of the five bubbles that I had discovered that could potentially cause a crash upon any of the bubbles bursting. See my article ""Five Super Bubbles Increase Market's Vulnerability to a Crash"", October 16, 2016. There is no current or historical rationale that supports such a wide divergence. The math does not support the shares of micro-cap companies trading at a deep relative discount to the shares of larger companies for an extended period of time. Micro-cap companies by their very nature can potentially grow by double digits in an economy which is declining. Larger companies are constrained by an economy's growth rate.The chart above which includes the Royce Low Priced and S&P 500 indices illustrates that upon a correction or crash happening the shares that recover and go to new highs the fastest are the low priced shares. After the dotcom (left red shaded area) and Lehman (right red shaded area) crashes the shares of small companies recovered quickly and significantly outperformed the S&P 500 for several years. Because there is a law of mathematics the gap between the S&P 500 and the low share priced and micro-cap companies will inevitably narrow. My prediction is that the S&P 500 will correct significantly to the downside while the shares of the low priced shares and micro-cap companies will spike upward. Another possible scenario is the shares of the small cap and micro-cap companies rallying significantly and outperforming for an extended period to catch up with the S&P 500. Under either scenario, low priced and micro-cap shares win.The video below entitled ""Crash! & 90/10 Crash Protection Strategy"" provides more details on why the market can potentially crash. It also provides more details about how and why low priced and micro-cap company shares will outperform large companies in crash and recessionary environments.One of my core areas of expertise throughout my 40 years in the markets has been to find micro-cap companies which have the potential to be ten baggers; shares of companies that have the potential to multiply by 10 times in price and produce long term capital gains.While conducting research during the second quarter of 2016, I discovered a recurring stock price chart pattern or theme for all of companies which had share prices below $5.00. The strikingly similar pattern was that their two to three year share price charts depicted an ""L"". A stock price chart depicting an L was an anomaly during the first 39 years of my career.The L illustrates a stock being on a cliff, falling straight down off the cliff and after hitting bottom, leveling out or flat lining for more than a year. With the vast majority of most of the companies with low priced shares having the same L pattern, I concluded that the market for small and micro-cap companies was the most undervalued throughout my 40-year career. After all, I had never seen such a phenomenon.My newest quest is to find and recommend the 100 best of the micro-cap companies as soon as possible. The video below entitled ""Diverging Markets Creating Rare Investing Opportunities"" provides details about the sense of urgency. Micro-cap shares are ridiculously undervalued and are now on the verge of their share prices multiplying quickly. The plan is to also provide continuous coverage and buy and sell price limit updates on every company recommended.For a company to be recommended its share price must have the potential to increase by at least 300% by 2020. To be among the 100 the company must have a business model that is capable of producing steady cash flow from operations (CFFO). The video below is about how I utilized my CFFO expertise to discover two low priced stocks. The share prices of both subsequently multiplied by 20 times in less than five years. One of the companies, Think or Swim/Investools was acquired by Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD).Below are five companies that I am adding to my recommendation list. They all have L chart patterns. Since they are all deeply undervalued my limit prices for all five are significantly higher than where their shares closed on November 18, 2016.Accelerize (ACLZ) with a market cap of $26 million has grown its revenue for three consecutive calendar years. Based on its trailing 12 month financials its revenue will again increase for its year ending December 31, 2016. More importantly, for the first time in its history the trailing 12 months of Cash Flow from Operations (CFFO) for this 100% digital company were positive. Based on its latest market cap ACLZ is at a deep discount since its trading at one times revenue. ACLZ is in the position to become the Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) of digital marketing. Company has a 41 year old CEO founder who is very bright and is a visionary.Live Ventures (NASDAQ:LIVE) with a market cap of $48 million has grown its revenue for three consecutive fiscal years. Based on its trailing 12 month financials the conglomerate's revenue will again increase for its year ending September 30, 2016. More importantly, after reporting negative CFFO for its last 3 fiscal years LIVE has produced positive CFFO for its last four consecutive quarters. Earlier this month LIVE announced that they had acquired a company for cash and debt that would take their revenue to $160 million and net income to $20 million ($1.21 per share). LIVE's business model is similar to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.B) and has 33 year old CEO who is extremely disciplined. He reminds me of Buffet.First Choice Healthcare Solutions (OTCPK:FCHS) with a market cap of $28 million has grown its revenue for the past three consecutive years. Based on its trailing 12 month financials the revenue for this provisioner of healthcare services in the U.S. will again increase for its year ending September 30, 2016. FCHS produced positive CFFO for its 2015 Calendar year. If it had not been for an accounting quirk ($9.2 million profit from the sale of a long term asset as a negative line item on its Cash Flow Statement) FCHS would have most likely reported record positive CFFO for its year ending December 31, 2016. The shares are now trading at one time sales and at two times tangible book which consists of current assets. It would not surprise me if FCHS utilized its cash to repurchase shares.Intellicheck Mobilisa (NASDAQ:IDN) with a market cap of $28 million is a pure play for the protectionist and illegal alien deportation policies to be implemented by the incoming new U.S. President. The company is a developer and seller of handheld and online identification systems which authenticate Drivers licenses and IDs, etc. IDN is not yet profitable and its CFFO has been steadily negative. However, IDN's gross margins increased significantly to 75% in its third quarter of 2016 from 66% for its fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, based on comparisons of the company's 2016 third quarter with its last quarter of 2015, R&D and operating losses as a percentage of revenue declined significantly. Company recently announced that its newest product is capable of verifying the authenticity of drivers license via an online scanning. COPsync (OTC:COYN) with a market cap of $11 million has grown its revenue for three consecutive fiscal years. Based on its trailing 12 month financials its revenue will again increase for its year ending December 31, 2016. COYN is another pure play for the incoming new administration. The company developed and operates a real-time law enforcement mobile data information system in the U.S. It presently generates more than 85% of its revenue from Texas even though its penetrated only 9% of the state's municipalities. With Texas accounting for 2/3 of the U.S.'s Mexican border company is well positioned to increase its share in the state. Since the beginning of 2016 COYN has more than doubled the number of U.S. states which it has penetrated from eight to 18. The company has the weakest Balance Sheet and is burning more cash than any of the other four above companies. However, I am recommending it since I like growing automated services businesses that have a recurring revenue stream and very low attrition.The video interview below is about my finding an early stage private company and underwriting an IPO for the company when I was an investment banker. The company grew from less than $1 million to over $500 million in revenue and is presently listed on NASDAQ. The video is recommended since it explains the simple logic that I use to discover and recommend small fledgling companies.In SummaryDue to the plunge of the bond market and the spike in yields since the election the volatility and the risks to the downside have increased for large cap stocks. Until the bond market calms down and stabilizes all bets should remain off. Long-term positions for the following long-oriented ETFs, including the utilities sector ETF: (NYSEARCA:XLU), Dow 30 (NYSEARCA:DIA) and S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) should be avoided. The Dow 30 leveraged (NYSEARCA:DDM) and (NYSEARCA:UDOW) and the S&P 500 long ETFs (NYSEARCA:SSO), (NYSEARCA:UPRO), (NYSEARCA:VOO), (NYSEARCA:UUP), (NYSEARCA:IVV) and (NYSEARCA:IVE) have even more risk.Conversely, I am recommending that shares of the Royce Micro-cap Trust (NYSE:RMT) be accumulated. I am also recommending that Russell 2000 ETFs (NYSEARCA:IWM), (NYSEARCA:UWM), (NYSEARCA:URTY), (NYSEARCA:IWO) and (NYSEARCA:IWN) be held.For an overview about me and access to links to the subjects that I cover, including the digital economy, negative rates, perfect shorts, and micro-cap stocks please go to www.michaelmarkowski.net.

No one really.Tesla may need to raise $12.5 billion in the next ~26 months, according to one analyst.Piper Jaffrey's new teen survey polls 10,000 youngsters for thoughts on social media preferences, top restaurants and favorite websites to shop on.","Piper's Teen Survey Gives Possible Insight Into Future of TechPiper Jaffray's out with its latest survey that it takes among 10,000 teenagers. The concept is to get a better feel for what young people like, ranging from favorite handbag brands to top restaurants and (importantly for Eye on Tech) their favorite social media platforms.Perhaps with little surprise, Snap (Private:CHAT) garnered the top result, with 35% of the vote. coming in behind Snapchat is Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram, with just 24% of the votes. It wasn't that long ago that Instagram was the top dog on the list and in the spring finally conceded its grip atop the Iron Throne.Engagement at Instagram is up - which is good for Facebook - but engagement for its own platform is down among teens. Perhaps with Instagram copying some of Snapchat's biggest features and the subsequent growth that has followed will help buoy the social media platform.But the latest results could draw at least a little bit of concern considering that Snapchat continues to gobble up market share as the most preferred platform.Other notables included Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) grabbing 40% of the top votes for their favorite website for shopping, with Nike (NYSE:NKE) coming in second at just 8%. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) YouTube was the top platform for consuming video for 26% of respondents, edging out cable TV, which garnered 25% of the votes and gave YouTube its first ""victory"" over cable in this particular survey (which has now run for 15 years).However, YouTube came in behind Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which took a whopping 37% of results.So is there anything standing out at the moment?To me, I'm seeing Netflix and Amazon standing out - two stocks that have extreme bull/bear camps. While the valuations are high for each, the companies have strong moats and it looks unlikely that any particular competitor will knock them off in the foreseeable future. Even better is that today's young people are choosing these platforms as their ""go-to,"" meaning that in the future, if they stay loyal, profits and sales should continue higher, while hopefully the valuation becomes more reasonable as a result.With that being said, a pullback would create a much nicer buying opportunity than what we've got at current levels. Seems obvious, but it can be tempting to chase stocks like Amazon when everything seems to be going right. Currently at $823, it's sometimes easy to forget that just earlier this year shares traded for less than $500.Also Read:Why Facebook Is Ridiculously Overvalued4 Reasons Facebook Will Sustain Its GrowthNo Buyout for Twitter?Shares of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) tumbled even further Friday, falling 5%, and bringing the stock down about 16% for the week and more than 34% from its recent highs near $25.What's got the stock falling today also has Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) rallying on reports that the cloud giant isn't interested in the micro-blogging site after all. Twitter ""wasn't the right fit for us,"" CEO Marc Benioff said.So with Salesforce officially out, and companies like Alphabet, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Disney (NYSE:DIS) removed as well, who else is left for Twitter? As the stock would indicate, no one really.Did Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg really say that Twitter is ""such as mess - it's as if they drove a clown car into a gold mine and fell in."" He supposedly did within the past three years according to the publication, and that was in 2013. If he did say, he was very much on point - and honestly, not to ride the Zuck train here, but shows how much further ahead in tech he is than everyone else.Again, I don't know if he really did say that - although you can find the quote in a number of different places - but when we were all cheering and talking up Twitter, Zuck already knew it wouldn't last. Or at least it appeared that way.And now the company can't get anyone to buy it, even though it is now not too far from its all-time lows near $14. What does that mean going forward?It feels like now the stock is sort of trapped in no man's land. Maybe it's a worthy pick up if:A. It falls back to or makes new 52-week lows. It has value, but the price is the problem.B. Its user growth and revenue metrics accelerate.Addressing the second point, Twitter has seen its revenue growth rates quickly decline as user growth leveled out. Its revenue guidance for next quarter was more than 10% below analysts' expectations.If this year's presidential election cycle - which has been the craziest for social media by far - streaming NFL games, and the Olympics weren't enough to get Twitter's business moving in the right direction, I honestly don't know what will.And if that's the case, maybe that's what everyone else saw too. Everyone else being the supposed buyers that were around just a few weeks ago. If they don't want Twitter, why should we?Which Is It: Tesla Does or Does Not Need Cash?Just last week, after telling the Twitter world that they can expect a new product on Monday Oct. 17th, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said Tesla wouldn't have to raised capital in the fourth quarter due to its planned acquisition of SolarCity (NASDAQ:OTCQX:SCTY).It's still unclear if ""not necessary"" translates to ""don't need to raise, but we will,"" or if it means ""we don't need to and won't.""However, according to at least one analyst, raising capital isn't a question - the company will almost certainly have to. Again, Musk's tweet wasn't exactly specific. Not only are we unsure of how he meant it, but it also means that, technically speaking, Tesla could raise capital in Q1 and Musk would still be right.In my opinion, Musk was simply telling the world that strictly financially speaking Tesla won't be forced to raise capital in the fourth quarter. Whether or not it does is a different story.According to Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer, the company will need to raise $12.5 billion by the end of 2018. That's a lot of dough, especially considering that Tesla ""only"" trades with a market cap of $30 billion. So to raise that much money in the next ~26 months is pretty alarming, especially with the current levels of dilution Tesla shareholders are already going through.Should Tesla get to a cash-flow positive position, then the need to raise capital falls. But with so much going on, many wonder if the company will be able to do that any time soon.Aside from its SolarCity acquisition, which is losing money and burning a lot of capital as well, Tesla is rolling out its Model 3, expanding its factories and continuing to work on its Powerwall product.Hopefully in the company's upcoming quarterly conference call we will get more details to sink into.Also Read:Tesla: How Does 50% Dilution Sound?Tech Tidbits:Sony (NYSE:SNE) launched its VR product this week, and reports show that sales are going strong. For the record, it's got a higher rating on Amazon than both the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift (the latter of which is owned by Facebook) - although, it's still early in the VR race.Samsung expects to lose at least $5.3 billion from the Galaxy Note 7, which is now expected to be banned on U.S. flights.From Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) General Counsel Craig Stillman: ""I think we have a reasonable basis to believe right now that the impact is material and we're looking to Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) to demonstrate to us the full impact…If they believe that it's not, then they'll need to show us that.""Will Verizon still pay full price for Yahoo?"
4009891,98236,2016-10-03T21:07:00-04:00,"Dreamforce, the annual user conference hosted by Salesforce.com, starts tomorrow in San Francisco.These shows are extravaganzas with live entertainment and rowdy good times, but this year the convention comes at a bit of an epochal point in the history of the company.Shares have declined by 17% since their peak 4.5 months past based on both investor concerns regarding slowing growth and concerns about potential acquisitions away from enterprise software.The company is set to unveil its Einstein solutions that will, for the first time, embody AI solutions in production applications that are widely used.Quantifying the impact of Einstein is not possible currently. But over time, it will likely prove significant. That said, until the threats of disruptive acquisition dissipate, valuations should remain under pressure.","It seems as though Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has been walking under the clouds for most of this year. The title to this article comes from ""Annie"" and the song was initially performed in that show in 1977. It has been reprised often since that point, and it seems to do well as background music in commercials. And for CRM investors, there are lots of questions about whether the sun can finally come out for these beleaguered shares.There are some who take unrequited pleasure in the showers and clouds that have enveloped these shares since they made a peak at the end of May. Other investors have been simply looking for a more favorable entry point that takes some of the risk mitigated by decreasing valuation. Others still, like this writer, have had their mindsets disturbed by the company's forays (so far unsuccessful) outside what they and I regard as the company's core competency within enterprise software.This is the week of the company's user conference/convention, Dreamforce, and it is typically the largest such event sponsored by a single company. Conference passes are sold out at this point, indicating that attendance will be at record levels. The Analyst Day will take place on Tuesday, October 4. Might the Dreamforce conference be the where and when of the company's better share price future? (That also is the title of a famous American standard that comes from a classic show called ""Babes in Arms"" that was written by Rogers and Hart in 1937 and most famously performed by both Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland at different times. My own favorite rendition was that of Billie Holiday.) In the opinion of this writer, yes and no. OK, I do expect that the shares are likely to trade up, if only a bit in response to the announcements that I will try to preview below. But almost regardless of that, until senior management of this company steers the discussion back into the channels that relate to the here and now of enterprise software as opposed to some blue empyrean, investors are going to be dubious and I do not think valuations can return to historical levels.Investors, and this writer as well, are simply unpersuaded that buying Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) in order to use its data is a reasonable direction for this company to take. Even if the chance of really making a deal to buy Twitter is low, it is a distraction that risks de-focusing senior management. And investors are not much more enamored by CRM's unrequited romance with LinkedIn (LNKD). There may be a few more synergies than are apparent in a possible Twitter transaction - but a few more does not mean enough. And it is basically indigestible and unaffordable for CRM at this point. Making acquisitions such as that of ad data firm Krux to fill out the product stack in the marketing cloud make all the sense in the world for a company that is generating more than $3 billion in free cash flow and is looking to broaden its footprint to offset the slowing percentage growth in its older solution offerings.Every time the company makes threatening noises about attempting to unhook the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) merger transaction, many investors simply cringe. Devoting $26 billion or more of investment capital that CRM doesn't have in an attempt to create a solution that many of its customers may not want or can't afford or can't justify simply seems to many as though the CEO doesn't feel there's enough potential in the company's core business.CRM currently has an annual GAAP spending rate on R&D of $1.2 billion. That's about 12% of revenues forecast at this point for the year, and is down about 200 basis points compared to the fiscal 2016 spend of $946 million. And it is down even further from the 15% R&D spend of fiscal 2015. Size is a potential avenue for increasing and reallocating R&D budgets in absolute dollars, while maintaining enough spend to broaden the company's overall product footprint. But buying either LinkedIn or Twitter will likely hurt rather than help in achieving that goalThe tech world is filled with macho executives who can, on occasion, get carried away with their success and go off the rails. In the case of CRM, it is nice to have an aspirational goal of $20 billion of revenues in some finite time frame. And there really are some business reasons for CRM to get big - for one, it has to compete in many areas with much larger companies such as Microsoft, whose Dynamics is clearly creeping upmarket and achieving some key wins. But trying to find new worlds to conquer is really not a business that's optimized to maximize shareholder value. Until the CEO of this company gives up grandiose ambitions in favor of just sticking to his knitting, I think valuations for this company will remain under some greater or lesser pressure and the best that can be hoped for is a partly cloudy day.One thing that is sure to be on prominent display is the attachment of CEO Marc Benioff to so-called progressive causes. Some of the lengths being used to promote these causes are a bit beyond the pale to this 70-year-old conservative who tends to eschew these kinds of controversies in business life. On the other hand, 70 years old or not, I can recognize trends in the IT world when I see them, and that is really what Dreamforce is about, at least when it is making news about bathrooms.Just how many miracles and how much are they going to cost?I think by now many observers are aware that Dreamforce is going to mark the formal unveiling of CRM's Einstein. Einstein is an a set of AI solutions that will allow users to acquire the technology as part of mainstream applications for the first time. What does that mean to investors? I think to do a proper job explaining what is going on, a bit of background is in order. I realize that much of what follows is a gross oversimplification, which may well promote derision among some readers who are also users of various CRM solutions. But there are benefits to looking at things from a 30,000-foot level, especially in trying to develop an investment thesis. While the CRM acronym itself dates to the late 1990s, people have been trying to figure out ways to automate the tasks involved in managing customer relationships since the days of the ledger and the Rolodex. And from the days of the Rolodex until the present, the functionality of the systems hasn't changed much. The systems deployed today, now in the cloud, interoperating with lots of other data and utilizing technologies that have enabled both mobile and social media implementations, are still all about record keeping and task management. Many users do not like using CRM tools because it is tedious to enter just where customers are in their sales cycles - the tools available are still just large fact repositories. Salesmen want to sell and not be devoured by process, and CRM today is process run amok. It is a huge market that's worth about $30 billion in annual revenue this year, and CRM the company has close to 20% share. It is going to be difficult for CRM to raise its share regardless of the competitive virtues of its current product, because all of its competitors now have functionally competitive SaaS products. Gartner, in its latest report on the industry, for what it is worth, ranks Salesforce no. 1 by a wide margin as has been the case for years, but sometimes in the market it is enough to be good and affordable as opposed to expensive and great. The growth rate of the market in just the SaaS category has dropped to less than 25%, and it is likely that it will continue to drop. Some of that has already shown up in CRM's numbers, which partially explains why Marc Benioff has looked far afield for new worlds in which to engage.But if that is not an optimal or even an acceptable strategy. Finding and developing functional as opposed to process improvements in CRM can result in some very nice paydays indeed. And that indeed is what Einstein and AI in the CRM world are all about.A very brief view of AI as it relates to CRMFirst, as a caveat - almost all software companies of any size have defined efforts in the AI space. It is the next big functional thing in the software world. The cloud and its attendant consumption-based pricing and the move on the part of almost all vendors to move to subscription pricing models are all about process and infrastructure. Users do not really generate many new tasks, because their workloads run in the cloud. The cloud is cheaper than on-premise software infrastructure, and it is essentially infinitely expansible and frees up resources for new workloads, and in a way, it outsources many of the more mundane housekeeping tasks involved in the software space. But for the most part, people do old things in a new arena and pay for admission based on consumption rather than when they enter the park.AI is quite a bit different from that, and to the extent that the advertised returns are real, it has the potential not just to alter the world but also to increase the growth rate of IT spend. Now come on, what's more important to investors - the growth of IT spending or altering the world? It has been said in some reports that as many as 67% of CRM projects fail. (One can find reports that suggest that the above report cited is... well, they think it is an urban legend, to put it kindly.) Fail is defined as not creating quantifiable returns, and since CRM is about process improvement, at some point there are diminishing returns from improving processes through getting knowledge on the status of a given sales campaign with a specific customer. Regardless of the figures, it is clear that AI is a solution for many problems that have plagued businesses since they first started to keep track of their customer engagements using ledgers.Some market research companies have broad definitions of what AI is and have frighteningly large forecasts for revenue over the next few years (they call AI cognitive software platforms and applications). Another market research firm, using far more conservative assumptions, says AI spending will be $36 billion by 2025, with the most popular use case to be algorithmic trading. The market for the service will be enormous, and it will have a noticeable impact on the economy as a whole, on growth rates for IT spending and, most specifically, on CRM's forward growth rate assumptions.For readers unfamiliar with AI, it is basically the name that has been adopted to describe software that makes predictions made using multiple linear regressions. Again, please understand that while I have some background in the subject, I'm sure others will have more and accuse me of oversimplification. But remember, this is an article about investing in CRM, the stock and how its Einstein technology may change perceptions of future growth. To drastically oversimplify, regressions are essentially based on correlations and relationships. The queries sent through AI can be complex or they can be simple, although the simple ones are so intuitive that AI isn't really necessary to produce answers with high probabilities of being accurate.There are some who have called the technology predictive analytics, which was a red-hot investing area a few years ago. Many companies who sell marketing automation solutions which also have roots in AI technology have been swallowed. Notable acquisitions have included Omniture by Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Exact Target by CRM and Datalogix by Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL). These companies have used some facets of Big Data and artificial intelligence to send consumers targeted emails or social media blasts based on the probability that a reader actually wants to buy something that's being sold. That said, the correlations used by these primitive forms of AI are quite primitive and are not really adequate to promote a high level of accuracy. Accuracy in terms of predictions is dependent on lots of data points - it is dependent on testing for a wide range of potential correlations, and it is dependent on asking enough questions to get the right answers. There are multiple requirements in order to get AI applications to function and produce ROI. The data has to be stored in some structure similar to Hadoop so it can be readily accessed, dependencies versus independencies have to be established, and users have to understand that answers are going to be expressed in probabilities. I can't tell you that any particular red-haired, green-eyed male wearing a certain brand of shoes and more than 50 miles from home is going to rent a room at your hotel. I probably can tell you that in a target sample, some percentage of these individuals will want to rent a room in your hotel if they know it exists, and that they are most receptive to tweets or to Facebook communications. Like it or not, even the primitive software that has been available usually has some ROI, which is why users keep buying it, and it has been a factor in the success of companies such as Adobe and CRM that have engaged actively in the business.What are the specifics of what Einstein means to CRM's offerings, and how might that impact their revenue growth?To this data, there has been no real adoption of AI in the offerings companies have in terms of CRM and/or SFA. Users fill out the forms online, and the forms are collected, aggregated and used to make forecasts of sales activity, revenues, inventory levels and the need users have for various inventories. Einstein is set to start changing that. (I really haven't adequate data to compare Einstein to Watson. As people who have given their names to the technology, the individuals lived in much the same era without any interaction of which I am aware. I imagine that Einstein was more of a genius than was TJ Watson, but who can tell, and what difference would it make in any event? As solution sets, they are both important to their respective companies, but they are really not quite competitive in terms of the problems they try to solve. AI itself is based on a fairly standardized set of technologies that are, in turn, based on Big Data and multiple linear regression augmented by newer technologies such as Hadoop that are used as repositories to store torrents of data. AI has nothing to do with anthropomorphizing software.)Executives are going to be able to get projections based on data more than on intuitive guesses. How many cars will I sell at what price this coming Saturday? Einstein can calculate some range of probabilities for different cases more or less autonomously. What's the price for a car that maximizes gross margins or units or unit growth? Ask Einstein and get a reasonable data-derived answer. If I launch a campaign, who is going to be most receptive people in a certain neighborhood - people in a particular income bracket or people who have vacationed abroad twice in the past year? If the data set is extensive, then Einstein should be able to produce a set of probabilities that answer the question. Does it matter in terms of optimizing marketing spend whether I should use zip codes or other kinds of demographic data? That's something almost impossible to answer without lots of data and lots of the kind of analysis for which Einstein has been built. What percent of deals that are in contracts are going to close? I'm not too sure that there is enough data in the world to answer that one, but at least there might be some data-derived sets of probabilities that Einstein might produce. What's the result of the CEO visiting a prospective client versus the CFO? How do I optimize a compensation plan? There remains in 2016 huge amounts of decision making that is ad hoc, intuitive and not based on anything other than gut feels and emotions. Einstein will be able to start to change that - not seamlessly, not all at once and not in all situations. But data revolutions start slowly and take time to gestate. I guess that is not that different in the political world.At the moment, there is loads of data collected by CRM applications and really by many other sources that can be loaded into data repositories - warehouses if one prefers. But it is going to need broad adoption of AI to make that data useful. I expect that the company will start to offer modules connected to both its CRM and its marketing clouds along with a multiple number of third-party data sources such as Twitter, LinkedIn and wherever else data is available that will allow users to ask the questions they want and to get back answers that, while certainly not perfect, are also better than random chance. There will be capabilities to assess the accuracy of the predictions - a sort of closed loop. We are going to learn some more specifics about the solutions tomorrow. We will still not have enough specifics with which to develop any kind of reasonable expectations on which to build revenue models, though some are likely to try.I think it would be more than a little unlikely that the introduction of these capabilities would have either an immediate or a profound impact on the expected results for CRM. Most users are likely to ease their way into trying these kinds of capabilities rather than opting immediately for multi-seat deployment. There may be some positive drag, i.e., customers opting to buy Salesforce products because they will want to use Einstein capabilities down the road, but no one would know how to measure that, Einstein capabilities or not.Salesforce has a reputation as a strong marketing company; there are some who think it is more about marketing than substance, but that is not a discussion that can readily lead to a conclusion. But the message to be presented in San Francisco has been road-tested in various focus groups, and I imagine the result of Dreamforce and the concomitant Analyst Day are going to result in some positive buzz.Framing the proposition in some kind of quantitative fashion - can CRM, with its Einstein offering, achieve a 10% or 15% market share in the new pie of AI that is forecast to exist? Will it be a really new pie that is totally incremental to the company's revenue expectations? How much positive drag can Einstein capabilities create for the Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud offerings. Will it create some level of product differentiation in a space that has been otherwise commoditizing? I know I certainly lack the kind of input from any sources to attempt to answer those kinds of questions. I do think that CRM will be able to re-differentiate its offering and open some space between itself and contenders such as Microsoft, Oracle and SAP.According to many surveys as mentioned earlier in this article, CRM has retained its title as functional leader in the space, and these new capabilities ought to reinforce that leadership and prevent the company from losing market share to what appears to be perhaps a new level of price competition in the space. Being first to market with something that users want and which has measurable ROI is clearly going to have some measurable impact on the company's expected growth rate. But I have no tools to quantify that other than to offer some and enough to move the needle.CRM shares have been battered as of late. And the shares lost another 1% of their value today in the wake of a downgrade by Argus. Price target upgrades by analysts at BMO, CS and Deutsche Bank last week had no visible impact on the shares. While the company has an average price target from analysts of $94/share, which would be appreciation of more than 30%, it is obvious that no one really believes that is likely to happen anytime soon.And there are going to be many who think that the company, which still has an enterprise value of about $48 billion and an EV/S of 5.7X the current year sales forecast and of 4.8X the sales forecast for the fiscal year that will start on 2/1/17, is too highly valued. It would take more than a little to convince those commentators on this site that whatever CRM does will mitigate and turn back competition going forward. The company does have a cash flow from operations margin of more than 30% through the first six months of the year, and trending that result would see CFFO of $2.5 billion for the current year and free cash flow of more than $2 billion. That is a free cash flow yield of greater than 4%. Not a value level, to be sure, but a far different valuation picture from what these shares have seen historically.The shares made a peak of $84 at the end of May and have declined by almost 17% since that time, a period in which the IGV has appreciated by 7%. That is a huge amount of negative alpha to see in less than five months.I think the shares can, and are likely to, have a bounce in the wake of Dreamforce. But I think they will remain in valuation purgatory until senior management acts to lift the ceiling that has descended from the cloud - so to speak - through its own actions. I think CRM has a reasonable future of 20%-plus growth for several years, but not if it wanders into the uncharted waters represented by the potential acquisitions of either LinkedIn or of Twitter."
4024914,98236,2016-11-20T01:37:26-05:00,"Salesforce reported the results of its fiscal Q3 Thursday evening.The results were marginally above expectations in terms of revenues, more noticeably above expectations in terms of earnings, and the company presented a solid Q4 outlook.I expect, based on conference call commentary, that Q4 results will noticeably over-attain guidance and provide a solid foundation for share price appreciation.The future valuation of the company's shares depends on consistent over-attainment that is noticeable.The company has put together an extraordinarily deep portfolio of solutions, based both on acquisition and internal development that is greatly underappreciated by many commentators.","Salesforce - What to expect when you are expecting?Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) reported the results of its 3rd fiscal quarter Thursday afternoon. The results, fairly put, were a modest beat on revenues, a stronger beat on EPS and a nudge upward in terms of forward guidance. Investors liked what they saw and heard and the shares have appreciated a few percent, but they are still trading in a range. The shares finished Friday trading at just less than $78, up by 3.4%. They were $78 at the start of the year and were $84 way back at the end of May which has thus far been the high for the year. When I first wrote about CRM on this site, expecting the company to enjoy a great Q4-2017, the shares were $77. Q4 was great, the shares clearly have been less so. I still own them and I may just possibly not lose money on the position this year. Not my best job of stock picking.The shares first reached $80 more than a year ago and have done absolutely nothing since that time. The IGV software/tech is up about 11% since the start of the year and up about the same percentage since CRM shares first reached $80. That is called negative alpha and is not the way to run a portfolio. What is interesting, and pregnant with possibility, is that over that period, expectations and performance for Salesforce revenues have marched upward. The growth percentages year on year, contrary to many expectations, have remained remarkably consistent. Cash flow for the year is increasing significantly year on year-again, the impact of the company's shift to annual billings changes the seasonality of reported cash flow materially and the small decline in the CFFO metric this past quarter is not meaningful in that context.A year ago, expectations were that fiscal 2017 would see $8 billion + in revenues. And now, close to the end of the fiscal year, the company is anticipating that it will do…$8.4 billion in revenues. Some of the difference is inorganic-perhaps 1%-2% but the company actually grew a bit faster this year than it thought it would a year ago. I think it should be remarked that with the recent strength of the USD in the wake of the Trump election, multinational companies are going to start to see their revenues impacted in a noticeable fashion. For this company, the FX headwind is about 1%-1.5% of growth, some of which was a factor in Q3 revenues and more likely to be a factor in Q4.Salesforce gets about 26% of its revenues internationally, typical for most larger enterprise software vendors. The impact of FX on next year's revenues for CRM could be 2-3% of growth at current exchange rates.""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" is the name of a film from 2012. I was struck then with the title which I thought clever. I've never seen the movie-not my style at all. But the title is quite apropos of the question we should deal with and that is what are investors expecting going forward and what are the realities likely to be?No one buying CRM shares at this time should do so based on an expectation that the consensus numbers are going to play out. If they were to do so, the odds are that the shares would not produce positive alpha. The shares, as I will discuss later in this article, are priced to achieve greater growth in both revenues and free cash flow than is implied by the current consensus.For contributors on this site who like to bash the outlook for the company's shares-you're right-but only if CRM fails to deliver upsides to expectations. The last quarter was the company's free hall pass in which ""in-line"" served to soothe investors looking for something worse. Going forward, realistically the company is going to need to report growth above its current forecast of 21% for the shares to work. The shares are highly valued if observers look at the consensus or at traditional valuation models; realistically, whatever is written, neither the preponderance of investors or analysts are looking at any such thing. They are expecting beats and raises and hence hold the shares. Saying less than that is a sham.So, what did CRM actually report and what is it really expecting?The company reported total revenues of $2.14 billion up 27% in constant currency. Deferred revenues increased by 25%, unbilled deferred revenues grew 28% of which the acquisition of Demandware drove $360 million or 5% of the increase. Based on those numbers, derived bookings, which includes the changes in the deferred revenue balances adjusted for currency and for acquisition was up by more than 20%, a strong rebound from the bookings increase in the prior quarter.Non-GAAP EPS grew to $.24 compared to $.21 in the year earlier period. GAAP loss per share was $.05 compared to $.04 in the year earlier period. Stock based comp expense was materially greater in the quarter when compared to the year before, although some of that was offset by the income tax effect of the stock grants. Because of the acquisition, the company reported a substantial increase in the amortization of intangibles. Although not explicitly reported, the costs of the acquisition of Demandware and of other smaller acquisitions, all of which were losing money when acquired, had a significant impact on operating expenses this past quarter. GAAP operating expenses rose consistently with the growth of revenues, a better number than might be expected given the pace and magnitude of acquisitions.Cash flow from operations shrunk marginally as the impact of annual services billings which typically take place around the 1st of the year became more pronounced and because there was no sale of property in this quarter. For the first 9 months of the current fiscal year, CFFO has grown by 16% and should grow substantially in the quarter with the calendar year end. The company is forecasting full year CFFO growth of 21% which implies a much greater cadence of increase in Q4. Free cash flow contracted substantially due to an elevated level of capex. Free cash flow has grown by about 12% through the first 9 months of the year and is likely to show the same kind of gain as the forecast for CFFO.The company raised revenue guidance marginally and non-GAAP EPS estimates remained unchanged for Q4-2017. The company introduced fiscal 2018 revenue guidance of $10.1 billion, marginally greater than prior consensus expectations. Were results to come out that way, it would be another year of declining percentage growth even though the revenue base will reach the $10 billion plateau. My bet is that the company can and ought to be expected to over-attain its forecast and by a rate significantly above its over-attainment in fiscal '17. In the shortest term, that is the bet one makes in buying the shares at this point.What should investors actually expect?This is an article about CRM stock and not the fact that it is or is not a great business. There are doubtless readers who believe that the company's focus on growth as opposed to higher profit margins is a bad thing. That is a vanilla/chocolate syndrome that no amount of words from this writer will ever solve. Of course, the two things are related-but the fact is that 21% top line growth that has been forecasted for fiscal 2018, absent some material improvement in operating margins and/or free cash flow, will not propel the shares higher, or produce positive alpha, at least in my opinion.And putting the organization on a stringent diet in which investments in sales and marketing and research and development are constrained will have material impacts on promoting growth. It isn't very unlikely to happen-maybe about the same chance as that of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) saying something positive about the President-elect, and I think the current shareholder base would be unhappy if the company attempted to build margins by ceasing to invest in research and development and sales and marketing. The way to build margins for a company at this stage of evolution is gradually, i.e. by growing operating expenses a few dozen basis points less than revenue per year. Cutting or freezing opex would not lead to optimum results.As mentioned earlier, there have been articles on this site and certainly elsewhere documenting that based on consensus expectations, CRM shares are expensive. It would be a close-run argument to dispute that contention, even though the shares are less expensive than they have been and I would be happy to take the other side of the argument. But the upside potential for the shares relates to beating and raising-meaningfully and despite the title of one blog on the subject, that didn't happen in any material sense this quarter and hasn't happened this year. Hence the lack of share price performance. The shares did appreciate Friday, and lots of analysts raised price targets by some marginal amount but having waited a year, a 3.4% gain isn't making up for the last year of underperformance.Many investors still think of CRM as a CRM company. It is true that the company's largest product line is its sales cloud-about 39% of revenues in the last reported quarter. But the sales cloud only grew 13% year on year and that is actually a reacceleration of growth, brought about in part by acquisitions that overall flesh out the product offering significantly beyond that which is offered by the competition. The services cloud, the next largest set of solutions grew by 26%, the apps cloud grew by 38% and the marketing cloud, partially because of the acquisition of Demandware, grew by 46%-organic growth was 21% and that is perhaps, a number below expectations. This quarter, the company reported the stub of Demandware sales for part of the quarter in which it was owned by Salesforce. Demandware has a revenue model different from that of the rest of CRM in that it is based on the volume of transactions across the platform. I am not sure if the Commerce platform revenues will continue to be reported separately and to what extent they are to be considered as part of the marketing cloud.I do not really like to try to call quarters on this site. There are 44 publishing analysts listed on 1st call who estimate quarters. Having gone through the exercise for many years I am singularly aware of just how fraught it is to construct a model with the limited information at hand and hope that it works. But to the extent that I consider the shares buy-worthy, of course I have an opinion on the likely financial performance of the company in the quarter that will end 1/31.I think at this point, the quarter is likely to show very strong bookings growth, which will exceed the implied growth of 22%-23% currently guided by meaningful levels. I think the following response by Mr. Benioff to a particular query is worth quoting, ""Number two, in regards to specifically to our fourth quarter, we don't talk about this specifically but one of the reasons that we do have confidence around the fourth quarter is a certain percentage of that revenues (sic) is a kind of contracts we have already signed that is we know we are going to get bookings in the 4th quarter because we have signed these agreements. And so that is coming in."" While I take no responsibility for the diction of the reply which might be said by some to be close to incomprehensible, I think the substance is very much in concord with the anecdotal checks I have been able to make.I would probably rephrase Mr. Benioff's answer to say that simply there are a number of commitments, particularly those for multi-product solutions and those involving Demandware along with other CRM clouds, signed or otherwise, that CRM didn't recognize as bookings in Q3 because they were not at the standards the company sets in recognizing a booking. These agreements are thought by CRM management to have a very high probability of being recognized during Q4 because of the year-end billings cadence, as well as the implementation of multi-product agreements.CRM offers a very compelling set of solutions across its product offerings and it has developed a far more interrelated set of solutions than it has ever been able to offer which have allowed it to gain mind share, wallet share and market share on a consistent basis. It competes in growth markets-even the CRM space is still enjoying double digit growth and whatever issues may have emerged, briefly, in terms of sales execution abated substantially in Q3 and are likely to reverse in Q4. Simply put, I think entering the shares at this point with the expectation of a Q4 beat of some magnitude, by which I mean more than $10 million in revenues and quite a bit more than that in terms of bookings, seems a reasonable assumption.The future success and ability of the company to stabilize and grow its top line is all about new products from this point. I don't think that the company is losing share in the CRM space but I do think the CRM space is no longer growing as fast as it was. The solution sets now offered by the company thanks to the development of both an embedded AI layer as well as expanded functionality have led much stronger opportunity for top line growth than has been appreciated.The company introduced its AI capability that it calls Einstein a few weeks ago. AI has the opportunity to be a differentiator for this company. When I look at bookings last quarter, and their 20% annual growth, my reaction is that the company was able to achieve those results without any significant benefit from the two most important innovations that Salesforce has launched recently. The investment case for these shares is not that the company will achieve the results it had and is forecasting. That dog, as the saying goes, will not hunt.The case for these shares is all about new growth opportunities for CRM composed of internally developed solutions such as Einstein and intelligent acquisitions such as Demandware, and businesses such as Quip, Krux and Steelbrick that increase the TAM that is addressable in a way that is probably under-appreciated by some investors at this point. (Just briefly, for readers unfamiliar with the new technologies, Krux is a data management platform that can assemble data to help assist in audience segmentation and targeting and provide Einstein with much of the data it will need to produce useable/actionable intelligence. Quip is a productivity app/collaboration tool, designed for the mobile world. The Quip acquisition is a bit unusual for Salesforce in that it is a horizontal app that is mainly used for collaboration, but it seems wildly popular at this point. And Steelbrick which was acquired at the start of this year basically allows users to ""Configure, Price and Quote"" as part of the CRM process.I think that many commentators ignore the likely sales synergies that these and the company's other acquisitions are producing and will continue to produce in their jeremiads regarding their view that Salesforce is likely to experience slowing growth.Looking out beyond Q4 and its prospects, I think that the 21% growth forecast for fiscal 2018 by management during this conference call ought to be readily exceeded as the company's sales force becomes trained on all of the new capabilities and as sales cycles get underway. It isn't necessary for all of these new solutions to be home runs-simply that there are enough of them such that it seems likely that a couple will really move the needle. In the past two years, Salesforce has made no fewer than 13 acquisitions ranging from tiny to Demandware-I believe that there is more than enough ""there, there"" to turn around the quote about Oakland, CA attributed to Gertrude Stein, to make a significant difference for CRM and to provide it with on-going competitive advantages.(The quote, despite how it is most often used these days, was meant to convey what has been described as a ""painful nostalgia"" for the writer's home town which changed beyond all recognition when she returned to it after a long absence.)Competition, New Spaces and some urban legends that need addressingThe most important consideration here is the ability of Mark Benioff, Keith Block and the CRM team to out-execute their rivals. The company competes in very crowded spaces. It leads in the sales force automation space with a share of 45% at the end of 2015. The other 3 major competitors in the space, SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) each have shares clustered above and below 10%. The market appears to be growing, again according to the latest data at about 12%, although of course that consists of much faster growth for SaaS revenues and negative growth for on-premise revenues.I think it is important to put the competition from Microsoft Dynamics into some kind of perspective. I imagine that Microsoft is growing its market share with revenues in CRM rising faster than 12%. Most of its wins are simply not ones in which it is displacing Salesforce but competitive engagements in which the company is displacing more basic technologies, it is competing in the SMB space, no longer a focus for Salesforce, or in which it is extending its own penetration within an installed customer. And while Microsoft has had some high visibility wins vis-à-vis CRM, most notably at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) although to be fair they were basically barter wins rather than real take-aways.Whether or not CRM has a ""better"" set of solutions in what it describes as its sales cloud is basically impossible to determine. I imagine that in the real world, Microsoft Dynamics winds up being a bit cheaper and a bit less functional. The real competitive issue for Salesforce will come in a couple of years when the combination of Microsoft and soon to be acquired LinkedIn (LNKD) have a set of integrated deliverables. But CRM's secret sauce, so to speak, is the breadth of its product portfolio. Large users, like some of those cited by the company during the conference call this quarter as new users such as the major CPG client and major new clients such as Citi (NYSE:C) and PNC (NYSE:PNC) in the financial services space, are not likely making their decisions solely by looking at some feature/function analysis. Larger users look at that ""vision thing"" and they look at all of the newer capabilities that the spate of CRM acquisitions can deliver and make their choices based on that as much as just what they can get from a basic implementation of the CRM solution at the time they initially deploy it. It is one of those strengths that is impossible to quantify-but if you were to ask successful CRM AE's why they have won, that is a basic component of the equation.I think commentators who use textbook financial analysis paradigms as the basis for making their conclusions regarding CRM shares are simply ignoring what the company is all about in favor of looking at something that is of less relevance in terms of being the basis for a forecast, which in its nature is about the future and not about the past What CRM has been designing and which can be better appreciated by users rather than from my poor attempts to describe it, is a self-re-enforcing network that many customer references believe has made them far more competitive.The marketing automation market is said to be quite a bit smaller than the CRM space at least by the principle market research companies, but I believe that to be a function of definition. Given just how many technologies fall into the marketing automation bucket, I think that the TAM for the set of functionality that Salesforce addresses is at least as large as the CRM market and probably growing faster. I really haven't found a satisfactory set of statistics from any of the usual sources that is useful for this article. It is my belief, based on anecdotal conversations, that CRM ought to see a material acceleration in organic growth from its Marketing Cloud, particularly it gets to report all of the revenues from Demandware without taking the deferred revenue haircut that is obscuring current comparisons. Demandware was a company lacking both resources and distribution; CRM is a company with huge resources and lots of distribution. It should result in significant synergistic revenue benefits and accretive customer acquisitions.I will finally just touch briefly on CRM's Apps Cloud which might be considered the jewel in the company's growth cloud at this point with 38% growth and now representing 19% of revenues. At this point it is actually accounting for 1/3rd of the total growth the company is achieving and yet is not readily appreciated by many investors. Many companies talk about their partner Eco-systems and some of them have derived significant benefits from promoting open APIs that allow a user to take advantage of technology beyond that provided by the primary vendor. Clearly, at least to date, CRM has enjoyed the most significant economic advantage from the strategy. It would be tiresome to go through all of the many partners who use the CRM platform for their cloud offerings these days and how they made their decisions. Suffice it to say, there are some high visibility and some smaller vendors who use the Salesforce platform successfully. It is a significant strength that is not well understood by writers who insist on focusing on historical financial metrics as the basis for their analysis. While there are, and will be, conflicts between partner solutions and potential development and acquisition strategies (Steelbrick is thus far the prime example), over the course of years this has become a major, under-appreciated competitive moat for the company.Valuation-What it is now and how it is likely to evolve.As I commented earlier, over the course of this past year, CRM's valuation has compressed significantly and relatively much to my personal discomfiture. If I were a decent writer I would be able to say something clever at this point, but I have to leave all of the bon mots to the long dead like Dorothy Parker or H. L. Mencken. It just hasn't been a satisfactory stock to own this past year. I do think it worth noting two things here that should be considered. Any company like this, which is totally subscription based and is still growing rapidly is understating its revenues significantly, compared to vendors who book all or most of their revenues on the basis of perpetual sales. The company still has a renewal rate of 91%+ which has not changed in some years. So it is continuously increasing the value of its recurring revenue stream which is not easy to value on a traditional basis. The company comps its sales force on ARR and much of its financial management revolves around ARR.The company's huge base of unbilled and billed deferred revenues which has been increasing now for many years is a meaningful asset that ought to be considered regardless of what kind of analysis is being done. I am sure Graham and Dodd, were they to recast their analysis today would acknowledge that fact and would also look at the mis-match which is its product, between recorded costs and headline revenues. The second point is that in looking at a reasonable set of assumptions for next year, it is apparent that FX is more likely than not to hobble reported results for many multi-national companies by a visible percentage. Not purporting to call FX I will not try to evaluate its progression, but the trend in exchange rates is going to have meaningful impact on the results of many vendors and I expect to see that starting with Oracle's results when it reports next month.At any rate, the company now has a market capitalization of $53.6 billion and an enterprise value of $53.7 billion. It has a net cash balance of -$55 million although some of that was used to purchase the company's headquarters at 50 Fremont which presumably has a significant value not really reflected on the balance sheet. So, the EV/s based on company guidance revolving around $10 billion + in revenues is just over 5X. The shares were a bit cheaper during the trough of the tech wreck during this past February on a valuation basis, but this is one of their low points for that metric in the recent past.The company has a P/E, again on forward non-GAAP EPS of about 60X. And yes, I know that the company does not generate GAAP earnings and that stock based comp is a cost. So do all of the other holders and at least on a reporting basis, the shares are primarily owned by the CEO and by institutions and mutual funds who presumably know how to do that particular analysis.For the record, stock based comp represented more than all of the reported earnings both this year and last year in the last quarter and for the year to date. But I do not think that anyone buying or owning the shares is doing so based on the P/E of Salesforce as it will be some while before reported earnings start to achieve the level of profitability that this company can produce. While the consensus EPS forecast of $1.27/share is based on some margin level of margin enhancement, in the absence of further acquisitions, I believe that margin growth will be significantly greater than is reflected by the consensus and I expect that when management provides 2018 earnings guidance it will be noticeably above the current $1.27 consensus EPS level.Overall, stock based comp rose by 42% in this past quarter, partially the function of the acquisitions during the period. Stock based comp through the first 9 months of the year has risen by 33% and it is currently running at about 10% of revenues. How much the spike in stock based comp is related to the acquisitions in the recent past has neither been reported or discussed on the conference call.Operating expenses were unchanged year on year in percentage terms and gross margins declined by 200 bps, a function of the Demandware acquisition and its revenue model. This is actually a more positive attainment than might be appreciated based on the numerous acquisitions of companies who were significantly unprofitable and are still in the process of consolidation. I can't know the trajectory of potential acquisitions in future periods, but absent that, I suspect that margin growth will be beyond historic levels in fiscal 2018 as the rationalization of acquisitions coupled with significant revenue synergies have material impacts.The company is now forecasting operating cash flow growth of 21% for the year which would put it at $1.95 billion. The forecast at the start of the year was for CFFO of $1.99 billion and the difference was a function of the cash costs involved with consolidating the many acquisitions made during the course of the year. The company has seen greater levels of capex this year than in the past and so, free cash flow for the year based on the continuation of current trends is likely to be at about $1.5 billion. At that level, the free cash flow yield is a bit less than 3%.Again, depending on the cadence of acquisitions, I would expect that free cash flow might increase by about 40% or so next year because of the both operational efficiencies and the opportunity to improve the balance sheet of the acquired businesses. So that would put the free cash flow yield at a bit over 4%. I think many investors would think that is a very reasonable metric if the company can maintain a 25% growth rate in revenues and start to show economies of scale as it starts to consolidate some of its many acquisitions.Q3 was a decent quarter for Salesforce and its shareholders. I expect that Q4, when it is reported next February will actually show meaningfully improved financial metrics that can put a higher foundation under the shares."

Non-GAAP EPS of $0.24 beat expectations of $0.21 by three pennies.Full FY17 revenue guidance, raised last quarter to $8.3 billion at the mid-point of the range, was increased slightly to $8.37 billion. Perhaps more importantly, FY17 non-GAAP EPS guidance was raised from $0.93-$0.95 to $0.97-$0.98, roughly +4% at the low end of the range.Management introduced FY18 revenue guidance of $10.13 billion at the mid-point, suggesting a top-line increase of +21% -- a slowdown in the growth rate that is largely in line with my previous estimate of +22%. The $10.13 billion is a just bit higher than Street expectations of $10.1 billion. Later in this article, I will introduce my high-level income statement estimates through 2021, in which I suggest revenues should increase at a CAGR of 18% over the next 5 years and recurring GAAP op margin should reach 12.4%, up from FY16's timid 1.2%.Deferred revenue increased 23% YOY, compared to 26% last quarter - in line with an expected slowdown in the overall growth rate of the business. CFOA (cash from ops) increased only +5% YOY to $154 million, compared to an increase of +18% last quarter - which I find unfortunate, but not concerning.Despite the EPS beat, margin erosion continues to be one of my key concerns. GAAP total gross margin of 72.7% was nearly 2.5 percentage points lower YOY, and represented the lowest margin level that the company has reported since at least FY12. R&D and G&A increased YOY as a percentage of revenues, but relatively lower marketing costs kept total recurring opex mostly unchanged sequentially.Source: Yahoo FinanceA quick glance at valuation and fundamentalsIn June of this year, I published an article on Salesforce in which I argued that, ""to generate the level of earnings that it needs to justify the stock price, salesforce would need to push harder at scaling its cost base"". At that moment, the stock was trading at $79/share, $4 below the closing price as of November 17th and on par with the after-hours trading price. Is the company and the stock in a better position today?Let me turn to peer comparison.Source: Zacks and SEC filingsAs the tables above suggest, CRM continues to be one of the most expensive stocks within the software peer group, using whichever metric I choose to look at. On a 2016 P/E basis, CRM's 78.9x compares very unfavorably to the peer group's average 33.6x, while CRM's 2017 forward P/E of 59.1x is more than twice as high as the peer average 26.8x. Factor in short-term EPS growth expectations, and CRM still trades richly at a PEG (P/E over growth ratio) of 2.3x, vs. the group's average 1.7x, and only marginally better than Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) 2.4x. Adjust the PEG for net cash holdings, and CRM is still the second worst-valued stock within the peer group: 2.4x vs. the average 1.6x.From a fundamentals perspective, salesforce stands out on the upside for its high expected 2017 EPS growth of 33.7%. But the company still has an unattractive trailing ROE (return on equity), currently at only 2.2% on a FY16 basis, while net debt holding of about $600 million represents 1.3% of market cap.See my summarized, modeled income statement through 2021 below.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reports and SEC filingsPost-earnings thoughtsToday's beat and raise should bode well for the stock, as salesforce proves that a high-growth software company can deliver both on the top- and bottom-lines.In my view, salesforce needs to start leveraging its still-fast-growing revenues to generate the income that will justify the stock's high valuations. Personally, I feel very uncomfortable paying nearly 80x current-year EPS on the stock of a company whose sales I expect to grow in the teens, starting in calendar 2018. But after underperforming the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) throughout most of this year, CRM may be able to use this quarter's solid print to gather momentum and propel beyond the $80/share mark for the first time since August 2016."

        Three out of the four acquisition targets that Salesforce was considering in May have already been acquired or have signed a merger agreement.
        Does this shift towards larger acquisitions point to a potential slowdown in organic growth at Salesforce?","Earlier this week the Wall Street Journal reported on a hacked email from Salesforce board member and former Secretary of State Colin Powell that contained a list of potential acquisition targets for Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). The list and the notes associated with these targets was interesting on multiple levels. You can see the slideshow with the list of potential targets here.The presence of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) on the list was odd considering Adobe's market cap exceeds that of Salesforce. It turns out that Adobe was on the list as a valuation benchmark and was not exactly a target. It was also a little unusual to see companies like NetSuite (NYSE:N) Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) on the list as these companies focus on core enterprise software and would appear to be a better fit for companies like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM).In fact, Oracle is in the process of acquiring NetSuite but has run into some resistance from one of its largest shareholders T. Rowe Price, who is holding out for a higher price. Unfortunately for both T. Rowe Price and Salesforce, most of the cards in this game are held by Larry Ellison who owns nearly 40%of the company, down from a stake of 74.1% when NetSuite went public in December 2007. The tender offer for NetSuite has been extended through November 4th and I would be surprised if T. Rowe Price doesn't tender its shares by then. The spread on the NetSuite acquisition is 5.9% or 30.37% annualized according to our Merger Arbitrage Tool. NetSuite is one of the oldest Software-as-a-Service (NASDAQ:SAAS) companies and is from an era when the whole cloud jargon had not become common parlance.There are several other reasons companies like NetSuite and Workday may not be a good fit for Salesforce including the underlying technology, the culture and the business segment they focus on. Looking through the list, it looks like Salesforce was more serious about LinkedIn, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA) and Demandware having assigned code names to those prospects. The list was prepared in May and one of the acquisition targets on this list, Marketo, was acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $1.79 billion or $35.25 per share in cash. The deal was announced on May 31, 2016 and was consummated just 77 days later. Salesforce announced the acquisition of Demandware on June 1, 2016 and completed the acquisition just 42 days later.The acquisition of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) by Salesforce probably made as much sense to Salesforce investors as the LinkedIn (LNKD) acquisition to Microsoft investors. It was interesting to hear Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff sayOn the surface they are completely different businesses until you realize the reach these social networks have and the value a creative management team can realize.A company like Hubspot (NYSE:HUBS) might be a better fit for Salesforce considering the size of the company, its high growth rate and the fact that it is a marketing software company. Instead of owning the social networks themselves the alternative is to own the software companies like Hubspot and Marketo that allow marketing teams to manage their marketing campaigns across several channels and networks. For most large consumer focused companies, a social media strategy is essential and these marketing automation companies help companies manage their spend across various channels and attempt to quantify the ROI, which used to be incredibly difficult in the old advertising age.Salesforce has the opportunity to acquire several of these marketing automation companies as well as cloud software companies that are built on the Salesforce platform. Most of these companies are relatively small public companies or private companies. The fact that Salesforce is even considering large acquisitions like NetSuite and Workday potentially implies that they see organic growth slowing down and are taking a page from Oracle's playbook where Larry Ellison embarked upon a series of large acquisitions more than a decade ago to boost growth. Ellison's acquisitions were sometimes hostile (Peoplesoft) and at other times were of companies like Sun Microsystems that appeared to make little strategic sense to shareholders.Irrespective of what happens to Twitter, it will be interesting to see how many of the companies on this list will be eventually acquired by Salesforce or by one of the other ""interlopers"" mentioned in the M&A Target Review slideshow. One thing for certain is that these companies are likely to continue trading at a premium when compared to their peers."

But bigger companies like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) are milking this opportunity by going on a buying spree.Salesforce.com's AcquisitionsSalesforce.com already has spent $4 billion this year on seven deals. Its acquisition strategy has been skewed toward Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to fortify its new AI platform Einstein, which is to be unveiled in early October at Dreamforce.However, during the second quarter, Salesforce.com acquired companies in other areas as well. The largest of these is its $2.8 billion acquisition in June of e-commerce platform Demandware, which will expand its CRM offering with e-commerce capabilities that its customers have been asking for.In August, it acquired Quip, a word-processing application for mobile devices, for about $750 million after losing out to Microsoft on the LinkedIn acquisition. It also acquired enterprise analytics platform BeyondCore for an estimated $110 million. BeyondCore is an enterprise analytics tool that bolsters business intelligence with computational and statistical analysis. It was already integrated with the Salesforce platform.Paul Hamerman, an analyst at Forrester Research, suggests that Salesforce.com could get a boost from acquisition targets such as accounting-services firm FinancialForce and Zuora.Some analysts, on the other hand, are questioning if the acquisitions are masking concerns over its financial health.Salesforce.com's FinancialsFor the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Salesforce's revenue grew 25% over the year to $2.04 billion, above analyst estimates of $1.84 billion and its guidance. Net income was $229 million or $0.33 per share. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.24, beating analyst forecast of $0.22.By segment, revenues from Subscription and Support services grew 24% over the year to $1.88 billion. Professional services and other revenues were up 33% to $150.5 million.Salesforce ended the quarter with deferred revenue of $3.82 billion, up 26% year over year but down 5% quarter over quarter. Unbilled deferred revenue ended the second quarter at about $8 billion, up 29% year over year, including $300 million related to unbilled deferred revenue from the Demandware acquisition.Sales Cloud grew 13%, Service Cloud grew 29%, App Cloud and others grew 43%, while Marketing Cloud, which now includes the subscription and support revenue from Demandware, grew 28%. These numbers are marginally down from the previous quarter.By region, Americas grew 24%, EMEA grew 32%, and Asia Pac grew 29%.Salesforce has raised its full-year guidance again.

4003465,26891,2016-08-31T18:33:51-04:00,"Twitter co-founder Evan Williams says the company has to consider its options when it comes to a sale.The Apple tax bill fallout continues, as everyone from the U.S. Treasury to Silicon Valley takes exception to the European Commission's ruling.Salesforce tops earnings, but Q3 guidance is apparently not enough to boost the stock. Shares are down 8% in after-hours trading.","So Wait, Is Twitter for Sale?Shares of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) have been cooling off, after going on a strong rally for several weeks. The stock rallied from $16 to $21 in quick fashion, before declining to almost $18. However, on Wednesday, shares began making their way back to $20 on renewed optimism about a takeout.This time, it's not speculation that former Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Steve Ballmer and Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal will take the company private. Instead, the rally has legs thanks to comments from Twitter co-founder and former chairman and CEO Evan Williams.When asked about a potential acquisition for Twitter, Williams said management would ""have to consider the right options."" Hmm...So does that mean the company is considering a sale? After all, almost every company is technically for sale at the right price. In Twitter's case though, it's slowly starting to sound more like yes. Or at least maybe.But wouldn't management have likely considered a sale last year rather than bringing #JackBack, reorganizing the company and hoping for a turnaround? You would think they would have. Plus, the takeout would have happened at a better price. One year ago, shares were around $28 and the stock would have likely fetched a premium in the event of a sale.Noted analyst Bob Peck doesn't believe a buyout is the cards at the moment (at least as of August 3rd), although he hasn't ruled out one in the future. I believe that should the company's recent platform tweaks and new streaming deals fail to accelerate user growth and revenues, it will very seriously consider a sale.Companies with stalling metrics don't tend to attractive a bevy of buyers. Still, I would imagine selling out so close to the lows would be painful for both investors and the management.So What's Up With Apple?You may have noticed there was no Eye On Tech story for Monday and Tuesday. But given how important this specific story is in regard to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and future implications for other companies, it's worth a look even on Wednesday.On Tuesday morning, the European Commission ordered that Apple pay $14 billion in taxes to the Irish government after deciding that the company's routing of profits through Ireland was illegal state aid.From the news alert, (linked above): ""'In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1% on its European profits in 2003 down to 0.005% in 2014,' Commissioner Margrethe Vestager declared.""Apple and Ireland are on the same team here, and Apple has shot back to the E.U., basically saying it's tax revenues or jobs, you chose. To some, the $14 billion figure is absurd and investors surely don't want to see Apple settle and pay it.Settling is not going to be the case, and there's a number of U.S. companies in line hoping it doesn't work out that way either, because the European Commission won't stop with just Apple. It's hard to see where this will go following the appeals, as the EC really wants to set an example, I'm sure. This process will take years.While the jobs argument is acceptable, it does seem somewhat unfair that a company as profitable as Apple can pay a tax rate of 1% or less. What do you think? Let us know in the comment section.Rightfully so, the whole fiasco has also got the U.S. Treasury highly concerned about the precedence this could set going forward (and what it will do to its own tax revenues).Also check out:Salesforce Reports Earnings, Falls 8%Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) was about $5 from its all-time high of $84.48 when it closed for trading on Wednesday. Coming into 2016, long-term investors had watched shares climb over 360% over the prior five years, amassing a market cap of more than $55 billion.It's quite hard to argue with Salesforce's strong run. But as of Wednesday's close, the stock is up just 1.3% on the year - very unlike the growth stock run by CEO Marc Benioff that investors had grown accustomed to. They were hoping tonight's earnings report would change that course and burst the stock to new all-time highs.But that didn't happen.Despite growing sales more than 25% year over year and beating earnings per share expectations, shares tumbled 8% in after-hours trading. Should the stock open around its current trading price on Thursday, it will be down on the year, while the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) is up over 6% and the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) is up 4%.So what went wrong? It looks to be guidance. While the company raised its full-year outlook, its projection of $2.11-2.12 billion in Q3 sales came in below analysts' expectations of $2.13 billion. EPS forecasts also fell short.Apparently this warrants an additional 8% discount to the stock price. Salesforce is a high-growth, high-valuation stock, and right now, high-valuation stocks are being met with smackdowns when they don't blow out the number. Think Ulta Salon (NASDAQ:ULTA), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), etc.When high-valuation stocks don't blow investors' socks off, at least in this environment, they're not afraid to punish the stock. Salesforce isn't an exception. Around current levels, shares will be down about 13% on Thursday's open. Will that be enough of a sell-off to entice investors? We'll see. But if an overall market sell-off (even a moderate 3-5%) is in store, it will likely keep pressure on Salesforce.Opening near $72.50 will put the stock below its Brexit lows of late June, but still vastly ahead of its sub-$54 lows seen in February."
4003194,52852,2016-08-30T17:58:30-04:00,Biggest near-term driver will be making numbers - I've produced consensus estimates for you.Investors will care about how long core product growth will last.Investors will care about how will new products will expand TAM.,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is expected to report FY2Q17 earnings on 8/31, after the close. Below are the key metrics, debate points and my thoughts on how one should analyze these data points. If you find this article helpful, please follow me and leave a comment below.The biggest immediate driver of the stock will be making consensus numbers, followed by commentary that supports or detracts from bulls' and bears' thesis, or possibly introducing an alternative view (which is inherently unpredictable). The impact of making or missing numbers will be immediate, but the effects of the harder to quantify commentary will likely drive the stock until next quarter. Let's walk through some of the key points to prepare you for earnings.First, investors must be equipped with what Wall Street is expecting. Q2 consensus expectations are as follows: $2.02B sales ($1.87B subscription, $147M services), $0.22 non-GAAP EPS, 12.8% non-GAAP operating margin, and $1.896B billings. Historically, CRM only beats by sales by 1-2% so one would not be shocked given smaller tech companies tend to beat by mid-to-high digits. On EPS, the historical result is usually in-line to one or two cents above consensus - so if it is within these range, the stock would trade up modestly (all else equal). Now, bookings are probably the most important metric. CRM beat bookings by a whopping 12.9% last quarter, and up from 6.1% two quarters ago - so there is acceleration in terms of results vs. estimates.CRM also should provide next quarter and FY guidance. Q3 consensus expectations are as follows: $2.12B sales ($1.97B subscription, $153M services), $0.24 non-GAAP EPS, 12.9% non-GAAP operating margin, and $1.847B billings. Finally, for the full year, consensus estimates are: $8.30B sales ($7.70B subscription, $603M services), $0.96 non-GAAP EPS, 13.2% non-GAAP operating margin, and $9.384B billings. It is difficult to generalize here, but as a general rule, sales guidance should beat expectations for the stock to work.In general, analysts are expecting a beat and raise - the stock won't appreciate without it.There are some concerns around its 17% European exposure, which may impact results and guidance. I estimate CRM's euro and GBP exposure is estimated to have a 2-3% negative impact on deferred revenue growth. Brexit also is a concern, but by now, Brexit is a non-issue for most companies that have reported (and I suspect those who blamed Brexit are using it as an expedient excuse). In my experience, so far European exposure has not hurt tech stocks going into earnings. Also, the appreciation in the Yen is expected to help somewhat.Remember, CRM acquired Demandware (NYSE:DWRE), which will impact margins a bit sequentially - generally these are well telegraphed to Wall Street so there should be no surprise here. Commentary on synergies and such could be helpful.Let's move to growth drivers. CRM's longest standing and biggest product segment is Sales Cloud, which re-accelerated growth to 15% last quarter and is now ~40% of subscription revenue on an annualized basis. Its Service and Marketing Cloud businesses are growing at double the rate of Sales Cloud and should benefit from standardizing on the salesforce.com platform. These two are expected to be the core drivers with a long runway - if they say anything that shakes this belief, the stock will get punished. Investors will look for smoothing words that confirms their belief that the world is moving towards SaaS - a very real trend we are seeing across the board.Other growth drivers are its Force.com platform, Wave Analytics, digital commerce, IoT and artificial intelligence. Investors are looking to gain more insight in their new product strategy that could expand their TAM and better monetize its installed base. My view is that these are nice and they will give some optimistic commentary, but they probably won't matter much in the short-run (in the long-run, we will all be slaves to AI anyways, so who cares).Good luck."

Salesforce Einstein is the latest example of expanded product offerings. Einstein enables customers to be able to use artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to improve the customer experience across sales, service, marketing, commerce and more. In short, it is an attach to existing offerings that improves CRM's pricing power, driving continued sales growth.The company is the leader in cloud-based sales force automation, but Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Dynamics CRM Online is also a leader within this product category. On a go-forward basis, competition from Microsoft is likely to intensify with the recent acquisition of LinkedIn (LNKD).Dynamics is likely to be able to provide users with the superior experience because of tighter integration between the existing installed base of Microsoft Office applications (such as Word, Excel, and Outlook) and the CRM application.If or when Microsoft is able to integrate Dynamics with LinkedIn, Dynamics could become the go-to application for CRM as sales professionals utilize the integration to enhance referrals-based sales efforts.While CRM's sales growth rate (20+%) is expected to persist through FY18, the key risks are intensifying competition from Microsoft and other enterprise application vendors, and the current market-based valuation of the shares.At 4.94x FY18 revenue, 157x FY18 EPS, and an EV-to-FY18 EBITDA of 47.6, shares of CRM are pricey. And while the profitability-based valuation is skewed because of sales reinvestment, the F P/S relative to the growth rate and the industry is excessive. I would accumulate below $65 per share, preferably closer to $62.The Amazon of SoftwareCRM has about half the market capitalization of SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) and the same market cap as Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), yet CRM's pre-tax income is almost non-existent while ADBE and SAP are delivering a pre-tax income margin in about the 20% range.Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) and Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) are much smaller than CRM based on market cap and they both manage to deliver superior pre-tax margins. Consequently, CRM's revenue growth with minimal profit is reminiscent of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and thus the phrase, ""The Amazon of Software.""Data courtesy of Morningstar and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingSales are forecasted to increase 26% in FY17 on subscription and support sales of $7.8B and professional services and other sales of $614M. While SG&A expenditure is trending lower, during this FY, expense reduction gets CRM to about break-even with a significant tax benefit driving net income of $542 million and EPS of $0.80.FY18 is when CRM crosses the much anticipated $10B of annual revenue mark. While I and maybe a few other investors have hoped for more net income at the $10B level, I'm waving the white flag on my net income optimism for the foreseeable future. In my opinion, CRM is the sales company and net income will remain at roughly break-even for quite some time. This isn't necessarily a bad thing if sales continue to grow faster than the industry.Data courtesy of Morningstar and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingCash flow from operations is depressed because of the reinvestment of sales into operations, but CFO is significant enough for the firm to make tuck-in acquisitions. Consequently, I'm modeling $1.5B spent on acquisitions during FY18. Also, we are nearing the point where management may use capital to repurchase shares.Data courtesy of Morningstar and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingThe highlights from the balance sheet are mid 20% deferred revenue growth and management's use of excess liquidity to make acquisitions.Overvalued Shares with a Bear LoomingThe momentum indicators are showing bearish divergences and the price action appears to be showing signs of weakness. There is a pretty good chance we see a bear market of primary degree.Data courtesy of Morningstar , Bloomberg , and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingThe F P/E and EV/EBITDA indicate that the shares are pricey, but that is mostly attributable to the reinvestment of revenue into operations. The F P/S being at only a 1% discount to the industry suggests that the shares are a bit pricey right now, and I would accumulate on weakness."
4000279,59321,2016-08-17T11:57:35-04:00,The market is assuming aggressive and unrealistic projections for Salesforce.Marc Benioff is not aligned with shareholders and has participated in questionable related party transactions.Changes in compensation metrics should concern shareholders.Salesforce has engaged in many expensive acquisitions that should concern shareholders.,"Investment thesis:Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) looks like a 90s-era technology company with its questionable related-party transactions, its pie-in-the-sky valuation of 76.3x EBITDA, its increasingly aggressive acquisitions of many unprofitable and negative tangible equity companies, and a competitive landscape that is becoming increasingly fierce. Ultimately, Salesforce sells products that do not have meaningful exit costs, and with the CEO selling down over 60% of his stake, shareholders should be concerned.Business and industry overview:Salesforce provides software as a service (SaaS) in multiple forms to aid companies in managing their front office customer relationship functions. The appeal for companies to purchase software from vendors such as Salesforce, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is that these solutions do not require heavy capital investments in servers and other expensive infrastructure.Organizations are able to access the sophisticated infrastructure of the aforementioned vendors to help analyze relationships with customers, improve the reach and efficiency of sales efforts, among other front office functions. In the case of Salesforce, companies pay a subscription for the software and service, which Salesforce recognizes ratably over the course of the contract (typically 12-36 months).Unfortunately, the ease at which companies are able to access advanced business analytics from SaaS vendors has, in my view, commoditized these enterprise software products and has allowed for insignificant exit costs. According to Salesforce, ""Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources.""Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn:Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that it was buying LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) for $26.2 billion. This acquisition has serious negative consequences for Salesforce as LinkedIn provides Microsoft's enterprise software, Dynamics, with a potential differentiator that combines customer analytics with a proactive sales function. Currently, Salesforce does have a plugin for LinkedIn's Sales Navigator, a service that helps sales professionals locate leads and personalize their approach toward selling products. You can read the reviews for the Sales Navigator plugin for Salesforce here. The reviews cite many integration and pricing issues, with many of the reviewers giving the plugin a single star.To highlight the importance of LinkedIn, it is also very important to note that Salesforce made bids to acquire the company even after LinkedIn and Microsoft entered into an exclusive agreement.According to the Wall Street Journal:It is clear just how important an improved sales function is for Salesforce's enterprise software. With LinkedIn in the hands of Microsoft, and with the desperate bidding for LinkedIn by Salesforce, this suggests tougher roads ahead for Salesforce in an industry that is becoming increasingly more commoditized.Questionable related party transactions:In reading Salesforce's proxy documents and analyzing the company's various smaller bolt-on acquisitions, I found two instances of Salesforce acquiring companies in which Marc Benioff, the CEO, had an invested interest in: MetaMind and Quip. Regarding MetaMind, Benioff owned over 10% of the company and pocketed $6 million from the acquisition.With regards to Quip, Benioff participated in a $15 million Series A funding round in 2013. Both acquisitions took place in 2016, with CRM acquiring MetaMind for $48 million and Quip for an estimated $750 million. If I were a shareholder in CRM, I would be concerned about these two acquisitions as these transactions highlight a potential corporate governance red flag.Questionable increases in depreciation schedule years:Another red flag shows up in the amount of years Salesforce depreciates its computer, software and equipment assets. From 2005 to 2011, the company depreciated its assets between 3 and 5 years. Beginning in 2012, the company began depreciating its assets between 3 and 7 years. Finally in 2014, the company began depreciating its assets between 3 and 9 years. Depreciating its assets over a longer time period allows Salesforce to understate the amount of operating expenses it recognizes, thus potentially leading to an overstated EBIT and net income. Unless the assets really do have a longer life, this development is a red flag.Questionable acquisitions:Since 2011, CRM has acquired 11 companies, spending over $7 billion. Over that same time, EBIT margins have declined from 6% in 2011 to 2% in 2016, and gross margins have declined from 80% in 2011 to 75% in 2016. Return on capital (ROC) has also declined from 6% in 2011 to 1% in 2016. Taken as a whole, all of these metrics suggest that Salesforce's acquisition efforts have not been beneficial for its fundamentals and that management is not great at allocating its capital for the benefit of shareholders.Benioff's recent annual letter to shareholders highlights the importance that he places on growing sales significantly, but at what cost to shareholders? If ROC and margins do not improve, shareholder value will not have been generated. Below is a list of the companies that CRM has acquired between 2011 and now, with some of my associated notes.1. Assistly: Acquired in 2011 for $60 million in cash. Notably, this company had negative tangible equity at the time of the acquisition, and 78% of the purchase price was in goodwill.2. Radian 6 Technologies: Acquired in 2011 for $340 million in a stock and cash deal. Like Assistly, Radian 6 had negative tangible equity, and 78% of the purchase price was goodwill.3. GoInstant: Acquired in 2012 for $50 million in cash. 90% of the purchase price was in goodwill.4. Buddy Media: Acquired in 2012 for $740 million in stock and cash. 87% of the purchase price was in goodwill.5. Ripple: Acquired in 2012 for $50 million in cash. 90% of the purchase price was in goodwill, and the company had negative tangible equity at the time of the purchase.6. EdgeSpring: Acquired in 2013 for $130 million in stock and cash. 80% of the purchase price was in goodwill, and the company had negative tangible equity.7. ExactTarget: Acquired in 2013 for $2.5 billion in cash. CRM purchased ExactTarget for a whopping 109x ExactTarget's internally projected ""base-case"" FY 2014 adjusted EBITDA, and 100x management's ""bull-case"" adjusted EBITDA projection for FY 2014.8. Relate IQ: Acquired in 2014 for $340 million in a stock and cash deal. 85% of the purchase price was in goodwill.9. MetaMind: Acquired in 2016 for $48 million. Benioff owned more than 10% of MetaMind at the time of the acquisition, and he received $6 million in proceeds as a result of the acquisition.10. Quip: Acquired in 2016 for an estimated $750 million in stock. Benioff participated in the Series A funding round of Quip in 2013.11. DemandWare: Acquired in 2016 for $2.8 billion in cash. It may be worth pointing out that DemandWare did not choose CRM's proposal to make the deal part stock and cash, and the company opted for an all cash deal instead.The CEO is a serial seller of stock:Since going public, Marc Benioff has sold down over 60% of his shares (adjusted for the stock split in 2013), and his ownership has gone from 26% in 2005 to just above 6% in 2016. Why would investors invest in a company whose CEO and founder seemingly does not view his own company as a great investment?(Source: SEC filings)Changes in cash compensation philosophy:In Salesforce's 2007 proxy document, the company outlined its then philosophy towards cash compensation: ""Cash bonuses allow us to incent certain behavior, although this is not a significant management tool at the executive level. We do not believe that variable cash compensation plays a very substantial role in improving or changing executive performance.""However, just four years later, the company completely reversed its original philosophy towards cash compensation in its 2011 proxy document:Curiously, this change in attitude toward cash compensation corresponded with CRM's change in compensation metrics. In 2011, CRM changed its compensation metrics to focus on revenue, Non-GAAP operating income, and new business bookings. Just a year earlier, CRM's compensation metrics focused on revenue, operating income, and new business bookings. To showcase the magnitude of difference between Non-GAAP operating income and GAAP operating income, in 2016, Non-GAAP operating income was over 10x greater than GAAP operating income!Valuation:Valued 76.3x TTM EBITDA, the market is assuming beyond perfect execution of Salesforce's management. One way to gauge the fundamental assumptions that Mr. Market is forecasting for a company is to reverse engineer a DCF model.I can obtain the current enterprise value of CRM by assuming a pretty aggressive expansion in the company's EBIT margins between 2017 and 2025, going from 4% in 2017 to 8% in 2025. I also assume that sales grow at an aggressive CAGR of 25% over that same time frame.Assuming D&A and capex cancel out, and assuming working capital continues to be a source of cash inflow, the value of CRM comes in at a little over $58 billion when assuming a discount rate of 8%, and a terminal value of 3%, with the terminal value making up over 80% of the projected enterprise value. When backing out net debt, CRM's equity value per share equates to a little over $85, which implies just 7% upside in the stock.The market is assuming very aggressive assumptions for Salesforce, and the downside for the stock is tremendous when applying a more realistic multiple onto EBITDA. It is also important to consider that Microsoft actually made a bid for Salesforce for $55 billion back in 2015. A $55 billion valuation puts CRM's stock at $80, which implies 0% upside. Benioff refused Microsoft's bid, stating that his company is worth $70 billion, a valuation that requires even more aggressive and unrealistic assumptions.Appendix:Summary financials:DCF:"

Benioff put his money where his mouth is last week when Salesforce announced that it would be acquiring the word-processing app Quip for $750 million. This merger comes hot on the heels of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announcement that it had made its largest acquisition ever by agreeing to pay just north of $26 billion for the professional networking site LinkedIn (LNKD). It was also revealed that Salesforce had approached LinkedIn about making an acquisition offer, but the company was already far down the road in negotiating a deal with cash rich Microsoft. Microsoft also agreed to let LinkedIn to continue to run as a standalone business, which Salesforce may not have allowed. I believe Salesforce acquisition of Quip will enable it to compete for software market share against Microsoft's Office 365 product suite.Quip was founded by Facebook's former CTO, Bret Taylor and had raised about $45 million in venture funding before it was acquired. Benioff and Salesforce ventures had invested in the company before they decided to acquire it. The acquisition is unique because it highlights Salesforce push into other areas of the software business beyond its traditional customer relationship management software. Earlier this summer, Salesforce acquired an ecommerce company, Demandware, for just under $3 billion. Quip was originally a mobile only app, but has since added an app for desktop. Quip is very similar to Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Docs product as well as Microsoft Office 365, what makes it unique is its mobile first facing design. Users can create a document on the cloud as well as store it there, users to collaborate on documents through the cloud. Quip does not charge individual users for access to the platform, but it charges small companies $12 per user and large companies $25 per user. Quips list of illustrious customers include CNN, Facebook, and Electronic Arts.Salesforce's vision for QuipAfter the acquisition was announced, Taylor went to his company's blog to pen some thoughts on the deal. He said that Salesforce and Quip see eye to eye on the future of software; mobile based and accessible through the cloud. I believe Quip will be a great fit in the Salesforce portfolio of companies. Benioff is also a huge fan of Bret Taylor, even going so far as to say that he made the acquisition partly because,""It's been (his) dream to work more closely with Bret Taylor."" The experience Taylor brings to the Salesforce team, and the product that will enhance Salesforce's mobile facing product solutions will help Salesforce grow and win over more customers who are looking for a little more than just a CRM software provider. Quip will also enable Salesforce to compete with the incumbent in the word processing space, Microsoft. Taylor is also revered around the valley for his mobile expertise, he was recently appointed to Twitters board of directors.Competition from MicrosoftMicrosoft made history last month when it made its biggest acquisition ever by paying just north of $26 billion for LinkedIn. Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, posits that both tools to help business get work done, such as the Microsoft Office suite of products, as well as tools to connect workers, LinkedIn, are essential to business. After completing its acquisition of LinkedIn, Microsoft will be able to offer both of those components to its customers. This acquisition could help Microsoft steal some of Salesforce's CRM business. Sales people could harness LinkedIn to gather information about the people they are selling to and the business that they work for. While Quip will help Salesforce compete with some of Microsoft's product offerings, I believe the LinkedIn acquisition may threaten parts Salesforce's core business.The bottom lineMicrosoft and Salesforce will both try to use their acquisitions to try and win over each others clients, but I believe Salesforce has the upper hand due to its forward thinking cloud and mobile first strategy. Salesforce can also build out a new suite of tools to compete with even more of Microsoft's products since it has brought an amazing tech asset onboard, Bret Taylor, through its acquisition. Quip is a great acquisition for Salesforce and will bolster the company's success on mobile and cloud computing platforms."
4003717,98236,2016-09-01T22:41:45-04:00,"CRM reported the results of its fiscal Q2 Wednesday. While the headline results were in line, investors were disappointed with guidance for fiscal Q3 and the level of bookings.The company acknowledged that in the US there was late quarter weakness in closing transactions which was not seen in the other major geos.For the full year, the company actually raised revenue guidance and left its EPS forecast at consistent levels but did cut its cash flow expectations.This is not the first quarter in which CRM has had to acknowledge that it is not perfect and does not always achieve its objectives.Investors reacted strongly and drove the share price down 5% after months of the shares marking time. This presents investors with one of the better entry points into these shares.","CRM: The other side to the mountain topHow to lead into an article about the vagaries of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) shares in the wake of less than stellar quarterly report and less than stellar guidance. And I thought to myself that it reminded me of that famous song from the end of WWI, ""How Ya Go'in to keep'em down on the farm (after they have seen Paree)."" The fact is that the last several quarters for CRM have seemed as though the company was involved in holding a perpetual party. The company seemed to have repealed the rule of large numbers and had closed a succession of 9 figure transactions.The basic message was that there were no limits to what the company could accomplish. The frenetic atmosphere that was said to be that of of Paris in the wake of what was then called the Great War was similar to expectations for this company.And then came what in retrospect was an inevitable reckoning. Not a terrible quarter, not even a quarter that most of corporate America wouldn't do something unnatural to accomplish, but a quarter with some spots. And having seen Paree, some investors at least, refused to accept the truth that Salesforce.com is a real company and not a machine that spews out a certain set of ever increasing numbers at ever increasing rates every quarter.And there you have in a few lines what there is to know about the quarter just reported by SalesForce.com. No, the quarter was anything but terrible, but it wasn't the same kind of quarter that the company enjoyed reporting in its last several outings. There were no $400 million transactions about which to brag — just some pokey $100 million + deal. Bookings were just in line — although as seen below, the reality is a bit more complicated. And the sequential quarterly growth of all of the clouds were actually in single digits. Even worse, if you happen to work at the company, you actually have to get approval to travel and your expenses are going to get reviewed. Signs of middle age stress, I suppose.The fact is that many investors had become habituated to the spectacular, to the ascent to the mountain top — and this quarter was mainly spent on the other side of that mountain top.Salesforce remains the strongest software company competing for the dollars of users. But that doesn't mean that every quarter is going to be described by superlatives. Maybe investors after the past several quarters just thought that owning these shares was about the same as partying in Paris after the war. Owning CRM was sort of like life in the cool sophisticated Paris with its cafes and night life. It could only be fun. But this quarter was not fun — it was basically mundane and investors were not prepared for mundane.That said, it is my opinion that this is the time to step up and buy the shares understanding that the company hit a speed bump and that over time there will be others. Growth will re-accelerate and the valuation metrics, while certainly not a bargain are as low as they have been since tech wreck back in February.Somewhere over the rainbowSomewhere over the rainbow, way up high, there must be a company whose results beat expectations every quarter, that always guides up, that never uses stock based comp and can maximize profits and growth at the same time. Where such a company might live, I really do not know and CRM is certainly not that company.I sometimes write about my age, which is not extreme, but more than many in this business. But this company went through a growth slowdown at the start of this decade during which some quarters might have justifiably been described as ""horrible."" This wasn't even close to a terrible quarter — but it was one in which the company did not achieve all of its financial and business objectives.As is often the case, some of that is self-inflicted — the company didn't explain its vulnerability to both seasonality and to FX as carefully as it might have done. But that being said, this was a real miss as those thing go for company's who derive all of their revenues ratably.Short of having an informational advantage, there is no way to really know in advance on a consistent basis how companies that do large transactions at the end of the quarter might perform. You might have heard through channel contacts that business was difficult to come by but this company has 38,000 channel partners and knowing how a few were feeling would not really be dispositive in your quest to under the quarter in advance. You might have heard that sales reps were complaining at the end of July, but companies that have done $400 million deals might have closed another of those whales and it would have vitiated your conclusions. Particularly for most retail investors, who are disadvantaged to a significant degree in getting data that might lead them to a quarterly informational advantage, it simply does not make financial sense to play the game every quarter. Perhaps if you have a friend who works in finance and has global visibility and wants to share with you — but the consequences of that are really unpleasant. So don't do it and your friend who has a sales job is never going to have global visibility although he may give you some color and not much more than that.So that leaves investors with three alternatives. Ignore the shares entirely. The company has just proven — again — that it will miss but as can be seen from several brokerage reports from the keyboards of men whose livelihood depends on them at least purporting to know such things in advance, the miss was a surprise and they had an entire month to figure it out.There are some observers who believe that the interests of this management and its shareholders are misaligned. They suggest that investors should avoid the shares of CRM entirely because of this alleged misalignment.It is certainly true that there are prominent entrepreneurs, and entrepreneurs not located far down the 101 freeway, who have built extreme net worth's but who do seem to continue to have a problem with aligning their personal interests with those of shareholders. Maybe it's the water that laps Redwood Shores.From my own observation, Mark Benioff is simply not such a person. Wiki describes him as a philanthropist because he has been. The company's 1-1-1 strategy is a creation of Marc Benioff. The new children's hospital in San Francisco is a gift of the man and his wife. Around here, Carl Icahn, who is far richer than Mr. Benioff, gives wings of hospitals. (I have no intention to cast aspersions on Mr. Ichan's philanthropy. The two gifts were apparently equivalent in size and Mr. Ichan intends to give away his entire fortune at some point). In SF, the man just writes a check for the whole thing.There are reasons not to own CRM shares. Lack of GAAP profitability, slowing growth — maybe, a competitive environment, variable results — but misalignment of interest ought not to be a consideration in making a decision to purchase or not purchase these shares.This is not the place to engage in a protracted discussion regarding the merits of buying Quip — to me, it was the kind of acquisition that a company like this almost has to make if it wants to continue a growth trajectory. Obviously, there is a different side to that argument. But I think investors can and should look at the track record of Quip's CEO and decide whether adding him to the CRM stable might have been a good strategic move.There are observers, no doubt, who think that Salesforce paid for the start-up BeyondCore. BeyondCore is the kind of relatively small technology acquisition that makes me feel comfortable about my investment in CRM shares. I want the company to buy start-ups like that with my money and to put it together with other ventures in the AI field and develop a new stream of revenue. My strategy of keeping a position in the name long term is because of that strategy and not despite it.A second alternative is to only invest in the company's shares in the wake of a significant disappointment and understand that speed bumps are embedded in the road of all enterprise software companies.Or just buy and hold so long as you agree with the company's strategies in terms of reaching for growth, product innovation, market positioning and the like. I try to buy dips along with every other growth stock investor. That doesn't mean that I bought my position in the shares on 2/9 — that kind of stuff happens in movies for the most part. But I was able to buy some of my position below $70 and trade around it. But getting caught owning some CRM shares is more or less inevitable and nothing that leaves me too unhappy. The fact that CRM is just another software vendor that lives here in the real air and not over the rainbow ought not to be a surprise to investors and really shouldn't deter most kinds of investors from taking a position.What really did happen at Salesforce — or better, put why did it happen and will it repeat?Before embarking doing a deep dive, let me briefly reprise the operating results. For those readers who have written that I have caused them physical dislocation with the excessive length of some articles, I can be brief and the first part of this section will be brief. And for any other readers with similar quarrels with the length of my articles, I always close them with a bulleted section that has most of what you need to know. Just the facts ma'am as Joe Friday used to say.Revenues grew 25% and were marginally above the consensus. Remember this is a subscription model and reported revenues are less important than derived bookings. Total revenues were $2.036 billion including a $9 million contribution from the acquisition of Demandware.Deferred revenues were $3.8 billion and included the addition of $23 million from Demandware. Deferred revenues were up 26% year on year. Sequentially, deferred revenues fell by $200 million. Part of this is the impact of the move to annual billings which has meant that deferred revenues spike at one point during the year and then are likely to decline seasonally as the revenues become earned and leave the balance sheet. And part of the decrease in deferred revenues reflects FX headwinds. Since the company didn't specifically identify which component was which in terms of their impact, I do not know either, but overall, it was the decline in the deferred revenue balance that was the primary factor in the 18% decline in operating cash flow.I would say that statements from management to the effect that their quarterly underperformance was a surprise seem borne out by the rate of hiring during the quarter which expanded headcount by almost 10% overall on a sequential basis. Some of that increase was the addition of the personnel in some of the acquisitions; most of it was hiring. The company expected lots better sales activity than it got.The company did raise full year revenue guidance to take account of some recent acquisitions but again, revenues are not the most important indices of this company's sales performance. The performance was broad based; the slowdown in demand seen at the end of the quarter was surprisingly centered in the U.S.. The sequential growth, which is useful to look at for a subscription company reflects some of the significant slowdown the company experienced at the end of the quarter. The Sales Cloud saw just 4% sequential growth. The services cloud grew by just 6%. Even the fast growing apps cloud grew by just 8% sequentially.Cash flow, probably the most important metric I look at that tracks profitability declined significantly, down by 18% to $251 million. FX was said to be a material headwind which ate into the deferred revenue balance which is reflected in the cash flow presentation.In addition, there is now seasonality of invoicing — most annual subscriptions are paid at the start of the year and there were onetime costs associated with the acquisition of Demandware. Most of this company's cash flow is now generated from annual billings, usually at the start of the fiscal or calendar year which does explain some of material drop in cash flow as annual billings now account for 79% of total billings. 1 st half cash flow which includes the collection of most annual billings did rise 25% overall to $1.3 billion. The specifics of the impact of changes that were induced by FX were not discussed in detail but some order of magnitude can be seen by the comments of Mark Hawkins that FX will reduce estimates for total revenues by $100-$150 million over the full year. In the quarter, the decline in deferred revenues reduced cash flow by more than $206 million compared to a negative value of $22 million in the prior fiscal year.Overall, guidance was little changed. This was, to be sure, a disappointing quarter, at some levels. It was not terrible unless the meaning of that word has significantly expanded. As mentioned earlier, management took some proactive steps regarding expenses before the end of Q2 in order to protect its full year forecasts for EPS which remains unchanged at $.93 to $.95 and implies a very significant Q4 ramp (EPS going from $.21 to $.28) which will take some strong performance in terms of expense discipline. The company is forecasting CFFO of $2 billion for the year, which is a reduction of some modest level primarily due to the FX losses the company has sustained this past quarter on its deferred revenue balance. Just to get a bit more granular and look at some specific expenses, Research and development grew by 24%, sales and marketing grew by 18% and general and administrative expense grew by 39% reflecting some of the onetime transaction expenses involved with the mergers the company closed on. Overall, operating expense grew by 22% on a GAAP basis showing some signs of operating leverage with more seemingly likely. Stock based comp grew by 19% which is progress, at some level, given that total revenues increased by 25%. Overall, stock based comp is a bit below 9% of revenues, a level less elevated than that of some peers.The revenue guidance of $2.11 to $2.12 billion for fiscal Q3 is below the prior consensus which had been $2.13 billion. The decline in the estimate from the consensus level of $10 to $20 million is self-evidently primarily due to the FX impact on revenues which is probably $50 million this current quarter. That, coupled with one-time merger expenses that have not been removed from the pro-forma accounts, are the basic cause for the otherwise strange decrease in the quarterly EPS forecast for Q3 while the full year EPS forecast is remains unchanged.So, to wrap up this discussion, I think it is hard to describe this as a terrible quarter on any objective basis. Expectations have inflated, understandably, in the wake of two fantastic quarters. Seasonality, which impacts deferred revenues and thus impacts derived bookings continued to increase with the move to annual bookings that take place at the start of the calendar year. FX was a problem, particularly because of the sharp depreciation of the GBP. And the one-time costs, as well as the operating losses involved in integrating Demandware played a role in the disappointing quarterly results.But there were operating issues where in the recent past there had been none. This has not been unknown for this company and any other. Not having the facility, myself, to go over the rainbow, I just take these kinds of quarters as an indication that the best things in life have warts and inconsistencies. The company President Keith Block, and CEO Marc Benioff talked again and again about the strong pipeline and talked consistently about the impact of Dreamforce and some of the product launches that will during that October event. So there is an evident reason to think that there will be a rather steep ramp for this company in Q4 after a lackluster Q3. Messrs. Block and Benioff have been software salesman as they said on this last call since 1986. Being a software salesman, or a sales manager is a job that is likely over time, to leave people with innate optimism — the job cannot be done any other way and it should be recognized in that context. But investors would do well to avoid investing in companies where they neither believe the forecasts of the senior managers or believe that they have interests at variance with investors that are reflected in guidance and outlook.Some new Secret Sauces for CRMBasically, like any large software company, innovation and product introduction are the principle ways to avoid the results that Salesforce ""endured"" in fiscal Q2/ The CEO, in particular spoke at some length about some of the innovations that will be seen at the company's annual event called Dreamforce. So too, did some of the questioners on the conference call. The most important innovation is to be an AI product embedded with both customer relation ship management and the analytics cloud called Einstein. Since the specifics of the company's Einstein technology and its other new products will not be revealed until Dreamforce, I really have nothing much more to say than they revolve around a major commitment the company has made in AI. How Einstein might compare with Watson of IBM (NYSE:IBM) I really do not know. Needless to say, there is no way anyone at CRM would choose to be objective on the subject. How that will be manifested in a product is something for speculation at this point. The company does have a fair amount of market share momentum as is manifested in current data from both Gartner and IDC. It wouldn't surprise me to think that the shares will get a lift from analysts writing about enhanced growth rate prospects in the wake of what are described by the CEO as transformative product introductions.Will the company miss some metric again? The company is made up of humans and so it is likely it will have stumbles and misdirections from time to time. I would be surprised, based on the commentary on the conference call and the intonations of the people making the comments, if will happen in the next two quarters. As I said, if you do not believe that the men are telling the truth about their current pipeline, you have no business investing in this company. If, on the other hand, you believe that the company will stabilize its business in this Q3 at the levels forecast, and will then produce the stunning Q4 that is being forecast, it becomes very easy to say that investors ought to take advantage of the current 5% share price decline and step up to the name at this point.ValuationThe company's shares had done nothing for the better part of this year prior to today's compression and so valuation has perhaps compressed by a greater amount than realized by readers and potential investors. The shares are down a bit more than 5% YTD while the software index is up about 7.5% over that span. The company now has a market cap that is down to $51 billion and with a cash balance of $1.72 billion offset by $1.8 billion of total debt, the enterprise value is also $51 billion. That yields an EV/S of 6.1. The EV/S based on consensus FY 2018 sales (ends 1/31/18) comes to 5X. Still a bit high for some, I suppose, and very high if the company doesn't execute, but far lower than these values have been in the recent past. The P/E for the company based on non-GAAP earnings is 79X based on the current earnings and 56X based on earnings for fiscal year 2018. Again, high but not incredibly so. The company has forecast that it's cash flow will rise by 20%+, weighed down, to an extent by the recent decline of the GBP. At that rate, the company would generate CFFO of $1.950 billion and free cash flow of $1.6 billion. That is a free cash flow yield of 3.2% this year and probably something like 4.3% in FY 2018 assuming no material changes in currency that impact cash flow. Again, those seem like reasonable yields depending on what long term growth rate is assumed.The analyst consensus for FY' 18 is 21% top line growth. 17 out of 45 analysts label CRM a strong buy and another 26 label it a buy. The average price consensus target before today's share price action had been $97. It will probably be just a bit over $90 in the wake of this reported quarter. To me, that suggests that most analysts are anticipating significant levels of revenue growth acceleration beyond those forecast on yesterday's call. I would be surprised if this company weren't able to recover from the current stumble, and, including acquisitions which are likely to continue, the company should sustain mid 20% growth for several more years. The company does not appear to be losing market share in customer relationship management itself and had a 19% share last year almost double that of the next largest vendor. That space is thought to be growing 20% which in the cloud segment where Salesforce participates.CRM has significant opportunities both in terms of expanding market share and in competing in more rapid growth spaces in what the company calls its marketing cloud, platform cloud and service cloud and it is likely that its line of analytic solutions also have significant growth opportunities. While there is no data driven way to forecast forward growth rates for this company I think that the combination of massive levels of new product introductions, geographic expansion and expansion into new verticals can keep this company enjoying top line growth in the mid 20% range for some years with steadily rising non-GAAP margins. I think the pull back in the shares present investors with an opportunity to enter this name at less than some raging premium.Recapitulating the Investment CaseBuying momentum growth stocks tends to be a fraught proposition for many investors. They appear to be highly valued, their volatility is high and they are very subject to perturbations in terms of their outlooks. They are not, and never have been perfect companies living over the rainbow. But today's share price pullback presents an attractive entry point and one that investors should seriously consider if they are long term in their orientation."

I've been accused by some readers of being too negative in my Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) earnings analysis, but with the stock down 7%, I think I was on point. I hate to be that guy again, but someone has to say it: dear bulls, the party is over - you had a great run - now it's time for the bears come out and play.I wrote an earnings preview for CRM, so please read that first if you have not. If you find this article helpful, please ""Follow"" me and leave a comment below.Why are the company's earnings terrible? Well, let me tell you all about it - at least my interpretation of it.For the quarter, the headline revenue and EPS are within expectations, so nothing see here. Yes, revenue beat very slightly (~1%) and EPS beat by 2 cents, but that's not a surprise and won't move the stock.Let's look at what really matters: deferred revenues and billings. Deferred revenue missed at $3.82 billion versus $3.88 billion consensus, and billings missed at $1.86 billion versus $1.89 billion consensus. ""This is a slight miss"" you say, but billings have been beating estimates at an accelerating pace in recent quarters, which sent the stock soaring - one must view everything in context. Last quarter, the company beat billings by 12.9%, by 6.1% two quarters ago, and by 1.8% three quarters ago - so clearly, there is an acceleration that got the market really excited. To the best of my knowledge, billings never missed before (at least in recent years). When you go from that kind of bullish dynamic to a miss, trouble ensues - don't blame me, that's just how the market works.Moving to guidance, Q3 EPS was guided to $0.20-0.21 versus $0.24 consensus, while revenue was guided to $2.11-2.12 billion versus $2.12 billion consensus - so two misses. Next, for the FY, management reaffirmed their previous EPS guidance, which is to say they missed expectations ($0.93-0.95 versus $0.96 consensus). FY revenue was guided to $8.3 billion at the mid-point, the same as consensus - so considering the slight beat this quarter, this implies a miss in the second half. This isn't supposed to happen with a growth stock like CRM.Let's move on to the earnings call, which wasn't really helpful.In the call, management said they saw some weakness towards the end of the quarter in US. They did a review and are confident that everything is amazing (Translation: We missed our numbers, but the ship isn't sinking). They said all their deals are in still play, and that there were no issues with competitive losses. Management sounded very bullish on the call, but the optimism doesn't translate into guidance. They told a few feel-good stories, but you can give that to the birds and bees - I want numbers, that's what I want.In conclusion, in the grand scheme of things, this quarterly result probably doesn't matter, but bulls are in for a world of hurt until at least the next quarter. CRM is still a very strong company growing at a fast pace; the problem is that investors got ahead of themselves. The stock priced in overly bullish expectations that cannot be met, so the stock will get punished - no doubt about that.Perhaps the party can get going again at Dreamforce, where the company will reveal some new products, but I'm not counting on it."

3994767,26891,2016-08-02T17:47:17-04:00,"Samsung introduced its new Note 7. Salesforce shells out more than $500 million for Quip, adding to its recent cloud-based acquisitions.Instagram adds Stories to its features, a notable feature on Snapchat.Twitter's head of communication steps down, adding more churn to the company's management team. Fitbit tops EPS and revenue expectations.","Samsung UnpackedWill Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) be able to turn the tide in the smartphone market? Well, at least in the U.S. that is? Globally, the South Korea-based company shipped some 90 million handsets in the second quarter - 80% of which were smartphones - with an ASP of $210. This compares to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) most recent quarter, where it sold 40.4 million iPhones, although the iOS-maker toted a much higher ASP of $595.While Samsung may have a tighter grip over the global smartphone market, it hasn't dominated the U.S. market in quite the same fashion. Apple, which controlled 43.9% of the market, according to comScore, tops Samsung's share of 28.4%.For those interested, LG was third with a 9.7% share (makes you wonder where the other 18% is spread).Anyhow, Samsung is hoping to boost that share, as it unveiled its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone at its Samsung Unpacked event in New York. The large-screen device boasts a slightly curved 5.7"" screen and has packed in some features that it's hoping will appeal to consumers. It's got a stylus pen for its pressure-sensitive screen, retina scan and fingerprint reader, and a water-resistant display.""The premium end of the smartphone market is the part that's growing,"" said David Lowes, Samsung Europe's chief marketing officer. ""So we took a strategic decision to focus on the premium segment with the S6 and 7 Series, and they've done incredibly well for us.""So far, the strategy seems to be working, as revenues and profitability have seen a bump as a result. And while perhaps attacking the premium smartphone market is wise, it brings into question whether the company can start to erode Apple's market share or if it's fighting a losing battle.Some may argue that Apple's year-over-year decline in iPhone sales is a sign that it is working. However, others will argue that Samsung is not taking share so much, as Apple had an enormous year of upgrades in 2015, making for far-too-difficult comps in 2016. I think it's the latter, but the holiday season will be more telling. Apple's iPhone introduction in September will also be a key event to watch.Salesforce Snaps Up QuipThe M&A story line - following a number of headline-worthy deals on Monday - remains intact as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) gets in the mix as well. The company jacked up the final bid for LinkedIn (LNKD) by $6 billion or so, which was ultimately purchased by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for $26.2 billion.Shortly after that deal, Salesforce announced the acquisition of another company, Demandware (NYSE:DWRE) for roughly $2.8 billion in an all-cash deal last June. Now, Salesforce has announced that it will buy Quip for a reported $582 million in an all-stock deal.Given that Salesforce was prepared to spend big bucks on LinkedIn - like, way more than the roughly $3 billion it spent on Quip and Demandware - it shouldn't be too surprising to see the company going on a bit of a spending spree.It also shows where management's focus is. Demandware provides cloud-based digital commerce solutions, while Quip provides cloud-based word-processing and document-editing services.In other words, the company is simply building out its cloud-based solutions. No surprises there. The question now becomes, is there another company on Salesforce's radar and if so, who?Instagram Is Copying… Snapchat?Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) continues to gain momentum, particularly among the younger demographic. Last fall, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Instagram platform was the most preferred social media platform among teens, garnering 33% of first-place votes. That figure dropped to 27% in the spring, knocking the app from the top spot.Instead, Snapchat took over the leaderboard, albeit, barely with 28%. Still, it's an impressive move, considering the same platform garnered just 19% of first-place votes six months prior.In 2013, Facebook tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion. The idea (which didn't pan out) was met with a lot of opposition, with investors questioning how Snapchat can provide revenue, let alone earnings. (This argument went along similar lines when Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion, which was initially booed by Wall Street).At its latest funding round, Snapchat was worth around $20 billion, while estimates for Instagram have valued the property at more than $30 billion. Clearly, Zuckerberg is a genius.Although Snapchat is quickly gaining ground, that hasn't stopped (and won't stop) Instagram from being an ad-displaying machine. Similarly, it also won't stop Instagram from borrowing some of the former's success.The picture-sharing leader is launching Instagram Stories - yes, the strikingly similar feature found on Snapchat. ""They deserve all the credit,"" said Instagram's CEO Kevin Systrom. At least the guy's honest. He went on to say that, in so many words, every platform is great for something and that borrowing features from each one is both common and acceptable. They're used in different ways on different platforms.I like this guy - he tells it like it is. In any regard, Instagram is surely looking for a way to keep its users engaged. Not that it's doing a bad job by any means, as Facebook did grow revenues 60% last quarter. But still, the Zuck will want to keep all of his properties running at full speed and this is just another way to do so.Twitter Management Continues to ChurnTwitter (NYSE:TWTR) is no stranger to C-suite churn, but the latest departure is somewhat surprising, perhaps just because of how long she was there. Natalie Kerris, Twitter's head of communications, has left after just six months of working at the company.Leslie Berland, the company's chief marketing officer, will assume Kerris's communications responsibilities.The reason for her leaving is unclear, but it doesn't shed the best light on a company that has reflected a lack of control towards Wall Street. Twitter was struggling near the end of former CEO Dick Costolo's tenure and the board searched and searched for a new CEO.They insisted they wanted a full-time CEO, before ultimately bringing its founder Jack Dorsey back to the helm. Dorsey, of course, is the CEO of Square (NYSE:SQ) as well.In late-January, the company had four senior executives leave, while two new board members were added. Jeff Seibert, the company's head of consumer products as of September 2015, left his role in June for Twitter's new app, Fabric. Others, like Jana Messerschmidt, head of business development, and Nathan Hubbard, head of media and commerce, left in May.It doesn't help that Twitter's most recent earnings report missed revenue estimates and sales guidance fell well short of analysts' expectations.As much as investors are hoping that the company's platform tweaks and new streaming deals spur user growth and increase user engagement, it still seems like the company is searching for rock bottom; searching for the right people that can form a team to lead Twitter's recovery. With the continual churn, though, it's hard to say that that's happened. The question is, has Wall Street already priced it in?Fitbit Sees an After-Hours RiseShares of Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) are catching a boost after the close, currently up over 6% after the company reported earnings. Fitbit topped earnings per share and revenue expectations for the current quarter.Revenues climbed some 46% from the same quarter in the prior year, but gross margin slipped 500 basis points to 41.8%. According to the press release, gross margins were impacted by an increase in ""warranty reserves for legacy products."" The company expects gross margins to return to a more normalized level next quarter.Management expects revenues of $490 million to $510 million for next quarter and $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion for the full year.While margins were somewhat concerning, the explanation makes sense, and the guidance came in about where analysts expected. That, and the fact that the stock has been such a dog, has likely got shares moving higher in what many could call a ""relief rally.""Depending on where investors got long, the stock is either doing great, or doing terribly - most likely the latter. With a low of $11.65, the sub-$12 buyers have seen a double-digit return so far with the after-hours move toward $14.But with a 52-week high north of $50, many investors are likely under water on their investment. When Fitbit came to market, it toted remarkable, triple-digit revenue growth and showed its profitability potential. That and the booming smartwatch/devices market enticed a lot of investors.However, the story hasn't quite panned out as many had hoped. As of now, the after-hours gains are holding, and investors are hoping that the conference call doesn't reverse their fortune.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The deal generates an ROIC of -1%, which is lower than Salesforce’s 2% ROIC.We think it fair to ask both management teams how this deal is fair to investors. The answer for DWRE investors appears easy. The answer for CRM investors is not.","Under even the most optimistic integration scenarios, we believe that Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) proposed acquisition of Demandware (NYSE:DWRE) for $75/share or $2.85 billion represents an unacceptable transfer of wealth from CRM to DWRE shareholders. As noted in prior reports, Demandware is far from profitable. Salesforce is not much better. Our models show that more than $2 billion of the $2.8 billion purchase is an overpayment and a direct destruction of value for CRM shareholders.Salesforce Is Spending On A Profitless BusinessSince going public, Demandware's operations have focused on revenue growth with no regard to the bottom line. The company's after-tax profit (NOPAT) has declined from -$7 million in 2012 to -$38 million in fiscal year 2015. Conversely, Demandware's revenue has grown from $79 million in 2012 to $254 million over the last twelve months (TTM), per Figure 1.Figure 1: Demandware's Growing LossesSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsAcquisition Is A Misallocation Of CapitalIn a nutshell, Salesforce is paying $2.8 billion to acquire an unprofitable company (Demandware lost -$38 million in NOPAT in the last twelve months). The deal generates an ROIC of -1%, which is lower than Salesforce's 2% ROIC and well below the company's 9% weighted average cost of capital (WACC). To justify paying $75/share, Salesforce would need, at a minimum, Demandware's NOPAT (assuming no capex) to be $257 million or 9% of the $2.8 billion purchase price. At that level, the deal would earn Salesforce an ROIC equal to its WACC, which is still a low hurdle, but at least the deal would not destroy value.How Much Is Salesforce Overpaying?To get a sense of how much shareholder value Salesforce is destroying, let's look at some reasonable scenarios for how much the company can improve Demandware's business so that it generates some cash flow. First, we account for liabilities that investors may not be aware of that make DWRE more expensive than the accounting numbers would suggest.Next, Figures 2 and 3 show the implied stock prices that Salesforce should pay for DWRE to achieve a ROIC equal to its WACC, assuming different scenarios for revenue growth and NOPAT margins. In each of these scenarios, we conservatively assume that Salesforce can grow Demandware's revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets. In Figure 2, the revenue growth scenarios assume that upon acquisition, DWRE immediately achieves Salesforce's NOPAT margin of 2.1%. The current margin is -14.9%.Figure 2: Implied Acquisition Prices For CRM To Achieve 9% ROIC with 2.1% NOPAT marginSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. $ values in millions except per share amounts.The big takeaway from Figure 2 is that even if Demandware grows revenue by 50% compounded annually for the next five years, the most Salesforce should pay to ensure an ROIC equal to WACC is $11/share, or $2.4 billion (85%) less than the proposed purchase price. For reference, Demandware grew revenue by 48% in 2015, and consensus estimates peg revenue growth at 28% in 2016.Figure 3: Implied Acquisition Prices For CRM To Achieve 9% ROIC with 4.2% NOPAT marginSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. $ values in millions except per share amounts.In Figure 3, the revenue growth scenarios assume that upon acquisition, DWRE immediately achieves a 4.2% NOPAT margin, which is double CRM's TTM NOPAT margin. Even in this scenario, the most Salesforce should pay for DWRE is $22/share, or 71% below the actual acquisition price.In addition to significantly higher revenue growth expectations, both scenarios are made more optimistic by the high NOPAT margin estimates (DWRE's TTM NOPAT margin was -14.9%).The bottom line is that Salesforce's management should have some explaining to do to justify this acquisition at $75/share.Implied Synergies Are UnreasonableThe only reason for a firm to pay a premium over the market value for another firm is if the acquiring firm believes there are significant synergies attainable through acquisition. As the deal is constructed, Salesforce is paying a premium of $27.01/share (from 5/31/16 close price), or slightly over $1 billion above market price. Salesforce has yet to make any mention of the dollar value of synergies between the two companies.ConclusionUntil investors hold management accountable for intelligent capital allocation, they can expect companies to continue to destroy shareholder value without feeling any accountability to their investors. Given our analysis above, we think it fair to ask both management teams how this deal is fair to their investors. The answer for DWRE investors appears easy. The answer for CRM investors is not so easy.This article originally published here on June 2, 2016.Disclosure: David Trainer and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."
3977957,24276,2016-05-26T09:43:58-04:00,Salesforce will use Amazon Web Services to expand internationally.Salesforce is successfully arbitraging cloud service providers.Amazon is demonstrating its global dominance in the market.,"When Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) first started out, it was wedded to Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for database technology. It used Oracle cloud when that was starting out; there are constant rumors about Oracle buying Salesforce and the two companies still partner when that's in their mutual interest.But Salesforce has been steadily moving beyond Oracle's orbit. It has agreements to store data on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. And now it's making Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services its ""preferred partner"" as it expands internationally.Amazon isn't just big. Amazon is all over the place. It has 12 ""regions"" or data processing centers, and plans to add many more. This is becoming vital as governments demand that data on their citizens be held within their countries, even though keeping all your data eggs in one basket eliminates the redundancy Internet technology can provide.Redundancy would have been a good thing for Salesforce earlier this month, when outages in northern Virginia caused data loss, and CEO Marc Benioff had to personally take to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and apologize. Making lemonade from those lemons drew praise from Salesforce's analysts.People who follow the cloud market are always busy trying to claim that the cloud world is highly competitive, but in one way it's not competitive at all. No company can offer more geographical and processing reach to cloud customers than AWS. To keep growing at 27% per year, Salesforce has to increase its international presence, and thus a deal with Amazon was inevitable. By scaling its operations now among different cloud providers, Salesforce also limits its own capital needs and gives itself flexibility in future dealings with them.One name missing from all this is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which has become far more aggressive in seeking cloud customers under Diane Greene. The two companies were quite close nearly a decade ago, and there are always silly stories claiming Alphabet might buy Salesforce, but they haven't deepened their relationship now in nearly a decade. When that happens, and it seems reasonable to assume it will, that's another win for Salesforce, not Google, because it gives the company yet another provider it can play off the others.The point is that in addition to becoming a dominant cloud software provider to business, Salesforce is becoming the kind of customer that can demand more from its cloud suppliers, and arbitrage them successfully.If a technology company can get a lead and expand upon it, it becomes ever harder to catch as it scales. That's the root of the 90-9-1 idea, 90% of a market's profits going to a market leader, 9% to the second-place company and 1% to everyone else.In cloud services, Amazon is the market leader. In cloud applications, it's Salesforce."

I kicked off with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) earlier in June, arguing that the stock needs a catalyst, and that the company must prove that ""cloud has reached the scale that it needs to start producing not only top-line momentum, but also significant bottom-line contribution"".Credit: ZDNet.comToday, I turn to salesforce (NYSE:CRM). After having bounced back strongly from its YTD low of $54.05 in February, shares skyrocketed to over $82/share just ahead of the Brexit vote. The stock has since de-risked by about 6%, and is now down nearly 8% from its 52-week high.Following the recent events, is there good value to be realized in CRM? How does the stock stack up against the peer group?First, let's look at some numbers.Facing off the big players in softwareThe table below compares several metrics, from valuation to fundamentals, across the top 10 software companies by market cap: 2016 P/E, 2016 PEG and cash-adjusted PEG, price-to-book, next-year EPS growth, net cash as a percentage of market cap, trailing ROE, dividend yield and ""distance"" from 52-week highs (as I have gathered preliminary evidence that buying stocks on weakness may be a good value-based strategy).Source: DM Martins Research, using data from Yahoo Finance and FidelityTo help better contrast the differences across the peer group, I also created the ranking below:Source: DM Martins Research, using data from Yahoo Finance and FidelitySalesforce: high multiples and modest op margins point to an aggressive playUnlike ORCL, CRM looks much less attractive on paper. In a comparison to its large-cap software peers, CRM only scores above average in expected EPS growth, at a very respectable 39.4%. Its 2016 P/E of 85.4x suggests that the Brexit mini-crash did little to bring the stock's valuation significantly closer to the peer group's median of 20.9x. Even on a PEG (P/E over growth) basis, CRM's 2.2x is higher than the peer median of 1.7x. As I have argued recently, the market seems to be ""less willing to hold on to aggressive bets as of the past couple of months, and I wouldn't expect the trend to reverse in the face of an uncertain macro environment"".Source: DM Martins Research, using data from SEC filingsAs the graph above illustrates, salesforce has nearly tripled its revenues between FY12 and FY16. But the top-line growth rate has decelerated from the low- to mid-30s in FY13 through FY15 to a less exciting 24% in FY16. And even at the high end of management's guidance, this rate is expected to decline further in the current fiscal year to 23%. To be fair, salesforce is building up its services portfolio nicely, having introduced the Lightning console for Service Cloud late last year and announced the acquisition of Demandware (NYSE:DWRE) earlier in 2016. But the company's 84x forward P/E and 23% top-line growth compares unfavorably to the 32x forward P/E and 34% top-line growth of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), for example. Or even to cybersecurity ""sweetheart"" Palo Alto Network's (NYSE:PANW) 71x forward P/E and 34% top-line growth expectations. Is salesforce's growth really worth the stock price?Looking farther down the income statement, salesforce's GAAP op margins excluding non-recurring items (but including stock-based compensation) have only turned positive this past fiscal year, +1.2% vs. -1.5% in FY12. I believe that, to generate the level of earnings that it needs to justify the stock price, salesforce would need to push harder at scaling its cost base. Gross margins are not helping much, as total company GAAP margins have declined steadily from 78.4% in FY12 to 75.2% in FY16. And competitors, including relatively new but note-worthy players in the client relationship management space, like Microsoft-LinkedIn (NASDAQ:MSFT)(LNKD), are only likely to pressure margins further. The secret to increasing profits, therefore, may lie in operating expenses, as marketing costs have come down from 52% of total revenues in FY12 to 49% in FY16. But with revenue growth still a priority, I do not expect to see sales efforts scaling down significantly over the next several quarters at least.Salesforce, it seems, still has a long road ahead. Until I can reasonably project sustainable, meaningful profitability, I will remain uncomfortable paying such high multiples for CRM. Considering the likelihood that the market may continue to be cautious towards aggressive bets amidst macro uncertainties, I will keep a safe distance from the stock at these levels."

If you're looking for some good reads, try this post by Paul Greenberg or this post from Ray Wang. I don't intend to rehash what my colleagues have already said quite eloquently, but I do want to dig into Demandforce and the e-commerce platform category a bit more using some G2 Crowd data.Before I get into that though, there's a small amount of history that we need to understand, even though it is well covered in both posts I reference above. To understand the competitive landscape in the hotly contested e-commerce platform category (or what I personally prefer to call digital commerce, since we're not really just talking about isolated online store transactions anymore, but integrated interactions across any buying opportunity), a little bit of refresh is necessary. The commerce platform market is crowded, has consolidated to some extent already, and is increasingly tied to a company's customer experience strategy, which means that it is essential for it to integrate into CRM sales, marketing and service, as well as finance and logistics. In the world of CRM, the market, at least for upper-mid market through large enterprise, is dominated by Salesforce, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and to some extent Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) as it relates to digital marketing and customer experience. IBM (NYSE:IBM) competes in the commerce platform market and the digital marketing market as well. Consolidation between CRM vendors and commerce platforms started a few years ago, with SAP's acquisition of Hybris and Oracle's acquisition of ATG, so it's natural that Salesforce and Adobe would be looking to pick up a major platform for themselves. With Hybris and ATG off the table Demandware was a logical target (since it's the only one of the three that is cloud native and you might argue that it would be the best fit anyway) and rumor has it that both Adobe and Salesforce were at the table. With that background take a look at the G2 Crowd eCommerce Platform Grid. The link is to the live version, which, in case this is new to you, changes in real time based on the incoming reviews. For the sake of discussion, I've done a snapshot of the Grid as of 6/6/2016.On the Grid graphic the X axis is based on user satisfaction and the Y axis is based on ""market presence"" (NYSE:MP) of the product, see this page for more detailed explanation. Satisfaction is a fairly simple calculation that takes seven specific satisfaction metrics from the user reviews, calculates the average and then normalizes the scores. The only tricky part is that as reviews age less weight is put on older reviews so as long as a product continues to get reviews it isn't a big impact, but if for some reason the flow of reviews drops off, eventually the satisfaction score would be impacted. Market presence is a bit more complex as it is based on a calculation using an algorithm that uses a set of factors ranging from number of employees to product momentum.The two axes work together to provide a picture of the different products in a category. Satisfaction is a good indication of product quality and user experience. Market presence is an indication of impact in a market and is influenced by the size, age, growth, social impact and employee satisfaction of the vendor and product. A well established product would likely be higher in MP, but a smaller company with explosive growth, high employee morale and a product that is seen as an innovator in a market also could be higher in the rating. The examples in the Grid are obvious - Oracle, SAP Hybris, and IBM have strong MP but so does Shopify, Infusionsoft and Magento CE which are relatively smaller but have very good momentum.To compare the platforms from SAP, Oracle and Demandware then, you can see on the Grid the relative positions. While SAP Hybris and Oracle have a higher MP score, which shouldn't be surprising, Demandware, the smaller company by itself, has higher satisfaction overall. If you compare the three products in the ""compare"" view you can see the overall star rating and the seven satisfaction metrics like this:This is only a partial view of the page, there also are some reviews highlighted for ""Most Helpful"" Favorable and Critical reviews of each product determined by the crowd. As you can see in this comparison the areas where the vendors being compared are rated higher are colored green, so Demandware outscored the other in five of the seven metrics - meets requirements, usability, maintenance, support, and ease of doing business. SAP Hybris was higher in setup and product direction. The comparison also breaks the reviews out into three company size bands and highlights the top five industries represented by the reviewers. Both these numbers are a reasonable proxy for the product's customer base, obviously increasing in accuracy with a larger sample size.Market presence is directly impacted when a company is acquired. We don't make any changes until the acquisition closes of course, but when a much larger company buys a smaller company, it's very likely that the MP score will move up some. It's very hard to predict how much, but it consistently happens.As my colleagues have pointed out commerce is the transactional core of the experience a customer has with any business that sells something to them. It is also an extension of the business process and as such needs to be integrated with the customer and product data, across the rest of the enterprise from CRM to Finance to logistics. The customers are looking for a simple, integrated experience and do not see what a company might call different ""channels."" There is only one channel, it just uses many different methods for the customer to interact with the brand. To provide an integrated experience for the customer a company has to have integrated people, systems, data and processes. It's easy to see why Salesforce (and Oracle and SAP) wanted to purchase and integrate a commerce platform into its customer experience solution."

That's why Form 4s exists.The SEC needs to mandate disclosure of a 10b5-1 plan's parameters to facilitate transparency.,"""The prettiest sight in this fine, pretty world is the privileged class enjoying its privileges."" That line from Philadelphia Story (or High Society for the more musically inclined) is also relevant to why following insider data is worthwhile for investors.When the U.S. Congress legislated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that mandated company executives file stock trades in their own firms with the Securities Exchange Commission (which the Act also birthed), it had no delusions that the mere act of registering their actions would keep insiders from profiting from the unfair advantage they had trading their own shares.The concept that ""sunshine is the best disinfectant"" was expected to halt the more blatant illegal insider trading activity execs had practiced leading up to the stock market crash of 1929. But the newfangled SEC's job was not to stop executives from making money trading their own shares. If an insider's trade filed via a Form 4 at the SEC seemed to cross the line between what was considered legal and illegal insider trading, shareholders had the right (and now the disclosures) to question what the executives knew, and when they knew it.Smartly, no precise definition of illegal insider trading was penned into the 1934 Act-or ever. If there was a precise definition, execs would exploit loopholes in the language. Instead, it was expected that lawsuits would generate a body of legal precedents that would grow over time, consistent with the ever evolving financial environment. And so it has. And so it is. Insider trading lawsuits still spark headlines and debate today, over 80 years after the original 1934 Act.But there is still no fine legal line between legal and illegal insider trading. Instead, there remains a large grey area executives trade in that separates easy profits from a potential prison term-or, more commonly, simply disgorging profits back to their firm if it's determined they overstepped.The recent example of an insider making a remarkably prescient trade that got us thinking about this grey area again came from Thomas Ebling, Chairman, President, and CEO of DemandWare (NYSE:DWRE). DemandWare rocketed over 60% in the past week after Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) offered to buy the firm at a huge premium. That's a nice achievement for any company head. In Mr. Ebling's case, he also pocketed an additional $1 million plus from a purchase he made just over two months ago.Now, a million dollar profit for an exec in his own stock isn't news. It happens every day. But looking at just how Mr. Ebling managed this casual seven-figure open-market bonus certainly made me go ""hmmmm"".After four years at the helm of DemandWare, Mr. Ebling suddenly initiated a 10b5-1 buying program on March 23rd. This, after he had been disposing shares consistently over most of his tenure via a 10b5-1 selling program.During 2015, Mr. Ebling disposed of 60,000 shares of DWRE via his automatic selling program, with the last sale occurring on August 6, 2015 for $59.33 a share. That was twice the number of restricted shares he received in 2015 as part of his stock-based compensation plan, meaning he was continuing his behavior of reducing his total holdings of DWRE each year. Again, nothing odd there.The fact that Mr. Ebling suddenly bought shares in the open market late last March, however, was a stark reversal of behavior. Even more interesting was that he did so by doing it via a newly established 10b5-1 buying program. These are rare, and generate an ""AB"" transaction code in our insider histories.10b5-1 programs are overwhelmingly used by executives (often at the urge of their general counsels) to dispose of shares without being accused of selling while in possession of material, non-public information. It's one of those loopholes in regulations that allow insiders to schedule sales during times when trading windows would otherwise be closed to them. And they are a dime-a-dozen, illustrated by the commonplace ""AS"" transaction types in our insider histories.There are valid reasons insiders set up 10b5-1 trading programs. If a founder has all their net worth tied up in their stock, it may be perfectly logical to trickle out set amounts of the massive holdings at set times during a year without caring at what price their stock is trading for.But why would Mr. Ebling need such legal cover when buying shares? He bought DWRE late March for less than $35 a share. That was a 40% discount from the price he sold his last share at the prior August. He could have simply bought in the open market without initiating a 10b5-1 program for the logical reason that he believed his stock was way oversold given its fundamental prospects.To go through the added effort of expressing mere fundamental bullishness via a 10b5-1 program is interesting at the least. To heck with the fact that his purchase under the plan was made a mere week before DemandWare's Q1 was closing-making it silly to argue he did not have a good idea of how his first-quarter conference call would go. The real question that's begged is whether Mr. Ebling made the extra effort because he had a whiff that his firm was a likely takeover target?If his 10b5-1 buying program specified that he was planning to continue buying shares at set times in the future on a regular basis, well, that's a good reason to have initiated the plan. But regulations don't require that insiders make the details of their 10b5-1 plans public, so all investors know is that he managed to pocket over $1 million from one very well-timed trade.Embracing the greyDon't get us wrong. We're not accusing Mr. Ebling of acting illegally. To the contrary, we thank Mr. Ebling (and insiders everywhere) for playing on the darker side of the vast grey area between legal and illegal insider trading whenever possible. That is why investors should look closer at insider filings than they do now.Personally, we're continuing to do research and back testing to incorporate this sort of nuanced trading behavior more strongly in our InsiderBot auto-ratings program, so transaction like Mr. Ebling's generate timely investment intelligence instead of merely being an observation in hindsight-as this one admittedly was for us.So the primary takeaway from interesting behavior like Mr. Ebing's is to pay attention to it. Insider trading disclosures were mandated precisely so the average investor would have a more level playing field with company executives that can't help but know more than them about their companies' prospects. You can't know what they know, but you can see what they do. Don't get upset by insiders trading well. Feel empowered by the Form 4s they file.We supply Seeking Alpha with Daily Round Up articles every day to help highlight when high dollar value insider transactions are also significant. For the next week, we're also posting our more comprehensive new ""Daily Reports"" via Instablogs. These reports list all the stocks that had insider activity the prior session--with each stock clearly labeled with our proprietary company ratings.There is a second major takeaway from Mr. Ebling's behavior, however, and one that we at InsiderInsights feel very strongly about:The SEC should mandate disclosure of a 10b5-1 program's parameters. Ditto for any subsequent changes in them.These disclosures should further be made public within the same two-business-day deadline as the trades made under the plans-perhaps as a lengthy footnote or attachment to the electronic Form 4 itself. This would hardly be an extra burden for insiders. 10b5-1 plans are already penned and filed somewhere. Disclosing them would only take a few more clicks of the mouse when a Form 4 is electronically filed at the SEC.After all, insider filings were mandated specifically to make executives' transactions in their firms more transparent. Not having transparency for the parameters of 10b5-1 trades seems obviously to go against the intent of the original legislation, and offers execs a loophole of opaqueness that has undoubtedly been exploited since 10b5-1 programs became de rigueur around 15 years ago.Certainly Mr. Ebling would appreciate the opportunity to prove to his investors that they have absolutely no reason to arch their eyebrows at his 10b5-1 purchase in March by making the details of his plan known. Our only complaint, though, is that we did not read a deeper significance into this trade at the time. And Mr. Ebling gave everyone more than enough time to follow his lead."
3972254,98056,2016-05-06T08:49:13-04:00,"Salesforce.com's top line just keeps on growing, but how long can they sustain it?Forward PE ratio is ridiculously high, and there's only one thing that can bring that to normalcy.When that moment comes, it will be time to jump on and hang on.","I didn't expect Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) to keep its top line trending upwards for so long - especially with their sky-high customer acquisition costs - but that's exactly what they've been doing. The company carries a lot of unappealing baggage, but their business prospects are sound - something that was validated recently by IBM's (NYSE:IBM) buyout of Bluewolf, one of the largest Salesforce.com consulting companies in the world.That brings us to these burning questions that are still unanswered from my last article : Can Salesforce.com keep growing at the breakneck pace that we've seen over the last few years? When will they turn profitable? And the most important one of all - is it worth investing in a company that is trading at an eye-popping 60 times forward earnings while at the same time reporting net losses for five years running?The Case for Salesforce.comLet's take a couple of steps back and see where the business really stands. Salesforce.com is the leading customer relationship management provider in the world. This is something nearly every business requires because it helps manage customer workflows and lifecycles. It is pivotal to any marketing strategy, and is the linchpin that turns a random customer base into a cohesive data set that can be acted on to generate revenues. From that perspective, it is a basic service that no company should do without.Within that critical business niche, Salesforce.com dominates the space over companies like SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Together, these four companies commanded nearly 45% of this market as of 2014.Source: CRMsearchAs use of technology increased over the last ten years, the CRM market has exploded as well, and the industry was worth more than 23 billion dollars in 2014 after growing at double digit rates in the half decade leading up to it. Gartner is now forecasting the market to grow at 14.8% CAGR through 2017.Salesforce.com - being positioned early on as a cloud software (SAAS) - is in a perfect position to take advantage of the growth in the adoption of cloud-related services. Irrespective of how fast the market grows beyond 2017, these four companies have more than 50% of the market sitting outside of their control - and that's something that will form a barrier to growth down the road.Source: CRMsearchInnovating Harder Than The CompetitionSo the business case for Salesforce.com is very clear. The industry is growing, and the company will grow along with it - until it hits a saturation point, which is what I'm waiting for.But the company is not sitting on its laurels until that happens. From being a top SaaS player, Salesforce.com is now becoming a ""force"" to reckon with. Force.com - their recent PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) offering - allows developers to complement the core functionality of the Salesforce platform by developing custom apps for their specific business needs.Source: Salesforce.comAs you can see, their current suite of solutions not only includes App Cloud, Force.com and IoT Cloud, but also analytics and social elements.The transition to offering a robust suite of support services around its core customer management and marketing solutions has been a significant one that will further strengthen its leadership position in this space. I can only say that their gain will be SAP's and Oracle's loss because this market should have rightfully been theirs considering their expertise in this area.Unfortunately for them, Salesforce.com came in strong and steady from behind. And with each passing day they continue to expand their moat and simplify the customer-facing side of every business that uses their products and services.Investor-speak: Again, What about Profitability?Although I don't have any doubt that Salesforce.com's top line revenues have a splendid runway moving into the next decade, I cannot say the same with respect to their stock. At 60 times forward earnings, their double-digit revenue growth rate has already been priced in, and whenever that top line slows down, stock price will inevitably take a big hit.Their bottom line can increase significantly the moment the near-50% marketing-related expenses are brought down - as I outlined in Salesforce.com: The Big Profitability Challenge - but they are not going to do that until they hit a wall with respect to new customer acquisitions; and when they hit that wall - which they will at some point - that's when I would jump in.I never thought I'd see myself saying this about any company, but I want to see a slowdown in new customer acquisition before I can recommend a BUY for CRM. Until then, this is a very good stock at an extremely risky price point - one that should be high on your watchlist for when the moment arrives.If you like my work, please follow me by clicking the button right next to my name at the top of this article.

Salesforce plans to use its technology to further automate and personalize customer support, marketing automation and many other business processes.During the earnings call, Salesforce said that it wants to be an AI-first company. Early this year, it released SalesforceIQ Inbox that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to work with users, emails, calendars and CRM data to recommend actions to be more efficient in the sales, service and marketing processes of their companies. This product was created using its $390 million acquisition of RelateIQ in 2014.There is, however, stiff competition in the space with IBM, Google, and Microsoft trying to provide AI as various cloud services that can be used within apps.Among other strategic highlights, Salesforce has entered into a strategic agreement with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). It is now Amazon's company-wide customer platform, and it also plans to use more Amazon services in the future. Salesforce also has landed deals with Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), among others.Its stock is currently trading at $81.02 with a market capitalization of about $55 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $82.90 following its third-quarter results announcement in November last year. It had hit a 52-week low of $52.60 in February in reaction to the market's anxiety on weaker results being announced by Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA) and LinkedIn (LNKD) that created broad concerns about the state of the Cloud Computing sector. It recovered soon after its second-quarter results and reinforced that the cloud is just fine."

Over the past nine years, only three times have they gone below a 30% revenue growth.If you looked at revenue growth alone, you'd find it hard to resist investing in the company, but here's the real story:Don't bet on them! Unless...Those familiar with the business model of Salesforce.com will know that any potential investor's enthusiasm will die out quickly once they know how profitable Salesforce.com is. Or, in their case, isn't!While digging through some research material for this article, just for fun, I Googled ""when will Salesforce.com be profitable."" Do you know what I came up with?""Salesforce does the unusual and posts a profit - Fortune""For 4Q 2015 ended April 30, the company posted a net profit of $4.09 million against a quarterly revenue of $1.511 billion. That gives it an EPS of 1 cent per share. Finally!But I soon saw that it was a unique quarter that actually broke their trend of consistently posting losses.Somehow, adding $80 to $100 million to the top line year over year doesn't seem to help their profitability.The point here is: no matter how big they grow, there seems to be no tipping point for economies of scale to kick in.I have to say here that this, in itself, is becoming a trend. Companies that are aggressively growing their top line revenues are ""forgiven"" for not being profitable, and their price to sales ratios are extremely high considering that they're actually losing money quarter over quarter and hand over fiscal.For an investor, this strategy of putting money into companies that post consistent losses as they hunt for top line growth seems - at least to me - a highly risky proposition. This is not something an occasional investor might know, to be honest. They'll read a few analysts' takes on the company, see that growth is being highlighted, and put their hard-earned money into companies that have zero room for error with respect to investor judgment. And I think it's unfair that the advantage in these scenarios always goes to the company instead of the investor. After all, aren't the shareholders the reason stock prices are up there in the first place?Salesforce.com is the perfect example of that. Look at the way their stock price has been growing over the past year and you'll know what I'm talking about.Digging deeper, though, I noticed something else. The reason Salesforce.com wasn't profitable was that the bulk of its revenue was being spent on marketing and sales.Marketing and Sales is Half Their Cost of Revenues, But Everything Else Looks ""Normal""First, let's see where their money is coming from. This is from their 10-K for the fiscal 2013, but it's still relevant:So, essentially, their user fee plus Tier 2 customer support accounts for all of their revenue. That's the typical -as-a-service revenue model and in line with industry norms.Nothing unusual there.As for geo distribution of revenues, things look good: 74% from a market not dependent on foreign currency vagaries and the threat of the strengthening dollar.Nothing out of the ordinary there, either. But what about...Attrition Rate?The attrition rate, or churn rate, for subscribers has been in the 8-10% range for the past two years. Within the SaaS industry, a sub-10% rate is considered to be normal and 5-7% is considered good.So there's no real problem with attrition rate at Salesforce.com, but something about the content of their annual report reeks of copy-paste! Just compare their 2016 annual report with the one for 2015.I realize it's a silly point to linger on, but to be honest, I just think they're not too bothered about attrition rates at the moment, but since they're at an ""acceptable"" rate according to industry standards, we'll just let it be for now.Operating MarginsThis is where the problem starts to rear its ugly head.It's a little perplexing to see a leading technology company posting consistent losses, because technology is inherently a high-margin business. Companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (GOOG; GOOGL) have impressive margins in the range of 18-25%, and even IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Rackspace (NYSE:RAX) - companies that have been tagged by some to be on a deathly downward spiral - have double-digit operating margins.GOOG Operating Margin (TTM) data by YChartsAs I dug even deeper, I found something that rattled me. Salesforce.com has consistently been spending up to 50% of their revenue towards sales and marketing.To put it in another way, to acquire every dollar of revenue, the company spends 50 cents. Add to that the cost of revenues, and between 70 and 75% of their earnings are already wiped out.From their 2015 Annual Report:And Here's The Biggest Flaw With That Business ModelThe lifeblood of any technology company - the developers and researchers - are left with a small 25% stake that they need to share with stockholders.Not good. Not good at all.For a technology company, CapEx, obviously, and R&D, are key areas that need regular reinvestment. These are the areas of investment that can set the future direction for the company and keep competitors at bay.As you can see, only 18% of their top line is being spent here.With all the other overhead expenditure thrown in, it's easy to see why the company can't be profitable if it continues this pattern of expenditure.Why Spend So Much On Marketing And Sales?At first glance, it would seem that an attrition rate under 10% and a revenue growth rate of over 30% wouldn't warrant a 50% of revenue spend on marketing and sales. Even if they cut their customer acquisition spend to 25% of revenue, they should still be able to grow faster than their attrition rate. Correct?But that's not the way the company sees it, unfortunately.Investor-speak: The Salesforce.com Sales Force ConundrumThis is a tricky situation to be in. On the one hand, if they cut their new customer acquisition spend, their top line will take a hit, and that's going to be disastrous for their stock in the short term. On the other hand, by keeping up this unsustainable spend on inorganic growth, they sacrifice the sorely needed investment into areas like talent acquisition, product development and infrastructure.The thing that really confounds me is why they're not, at least, dipping deeper into their debt bucket to support the latter three of what I've outlined above. LTD as of the end of the last reported quarter was at $1.2 billion - not excessive for a growth company.Do they continue to think growth always upstages profitability?The big question from me to management is this: Why is your sales force so expensive, Salesforce.com?And these are the ""baby questions"" that are born of that big poser:These questions burn me up, to be honest. If I were a CRM investor, these are the questions I'd be throwing at management during earnings calls, not tepid questions about Systems Integrations.The only analyst who touched on the topic of operating margins was Walter H. Pritchard of Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., but even that didn't sound like he was actually questioning the CFO, Mark Hawkins:Don't you think that sounds a bit too soft a line of questioning for a company that's making consistent losses year over year?In fact, throughout the entire Q&A session, I just felt like everyone was in a congratulatory mood and completely ignored the burning issue at hand - profitability.So, unless they do something about their spend on customer acquisition - or at least justify why that's the best (continued) course of action for the company, I would not continue putting my money into CRM.Please follow me, and I will commit my every waking hour to finding the best and the worst of tech, retail, e-commerce, automobiles and much more."

Are they also hurting his company?Previously called ""the Ron Burgundy of tech"" for only pretending to be progressive, Benioff is now deliberately attracting conservative ire. ""The business of business isn't just about creating profits for shareholders,"" as he wrote last year, but ""about improving the state of the world.""But since Benioff became a crusader, he hasn't done nearly as much for shareholders as before. Shares in CRM are up just 9% in the last year, and net income for the last four quarters, including this April's ""blowout"" quarter, totals minus-two cents per common share. It's top-line growth - 26% year over year to over $1.9 billion for the April quarter - that keeps the stock flying. The law of numbers says that, over time, that growth rate is going down.Keeping that growth going requires that Salesforce go well beyond its CRM niche. Salesforce is now engaged in putting all kinds of applications into the cloud, where both the company and its customers can benefit from cloud economics. It is no longer tied to the Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) database technology, but is working closely with both Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) as well.So long as Salesforce's stock performs, shareholders are not going to complain about its CEO's tilting at windmills, but as noted, it's no longer performing as it did. A Benioff profile in The Wall Street Journal this spring quoted former Gen. Colin Powell, a Salesforce director, warning Benioff to ""be careful how far you climb up the tree"" because ""it will expose your backside.""Is Salesforce's backside exposed?Conservatives in Benioff's crosshairs insist it is. Josh McKoon, sponsor of a Georgia law Benioff's activism saw vetoed, called him ""the ringleader"" for CEOs ""who use economic threats to exercise more power over public policy than the voters who use the democratic process."" North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory called what he's doing ""high risk,"" saying ""a great disconnect exists between the corporate suites and Main Street.""Stephen Bainbridge, a professor of law at UCLA, has blogged that ""I think it will be nearly impossible to put the business/economic conservative and social conservative/Reagan Democrat wings of the party back together."" CEOs like Benioff ""live in a bubble that rewards left of center activism.""Living in a bubble, ignoring democratic processes, and disconnecting with Main Street concerns are all serious charges, which have nothing to do with Salesforce's current financial performance. But business history is filled with the ghosts of companies like Control Data that focused more on corporate activism than on shareholder value.Is Benioff now treading that road?"
3929046,98236,2016-02-25T10:37:43-05:00,"On Wednesday, CRM reported in-line EPS and a modest beat in Q4 revenues.Below the numbers, the company's bookings and cash flow growth were at a level that could be called heroic.While guidance in terms of earnings and revenue next year is just a small increase, bookings growth and cash flow seem poised to continue their strong ascents.The company signed the two largest deals in its history last quarter, which, of course, did not contribute to revenues and were a drain on earnings.It seems evident that the company's multi-product strategy is working and is a key factor in accelerating revenue growth beyond anticipated levels.","IntroductionOn Wednesday evening, salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported the results of its fiscal Q4 and full-year fiscal 2016. The headlines might seem ho-hum to some in that EPS was in line with the prior consensus at $0.19 while revenues for the quarter of $1.81 billion were just greater than a 1% beat over the prior forecast. But most investors and analysts who are familiar with the company want to look at some other metrics in evaluating the quarterly performance.On-balance sheet deferred revenues grew by 31% year over year in constant currency. Unbilled deferred revenues reached over $7 billion, up over 25% for the year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $459 million, up 38% year on year, while for the full year, operating cash flow was $1.612 billion, an increase of 37%. In addition to the strong performance metrics achieved during Q4, CRM introduced its guidance for the current fiscal year that was at either the high end of the range or was above prior estimates.CRM is estimating revenue growth of 21-22% for fiscal-year 2017. That is about 100 bps above the prior consensus. The company is also introducing a forecast of non-GAAP EPS of $0.99-1.01 for the year, a bit above prior estimates. Perhaps, more importantly, management is forecasting on-balance deferred revenue growth of another 25% with operating cash flow growth of 23-24%. The forecast for Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.23-0.24 is noticeably above the prior $0.21 consensus forecast, almost totally a function of higher margins. Management pointed out on the earnings call that there is an extra day in this year's quarter, February 29th, that adds about $20 million to revenues and decreases on-balance deferred revenue by a like amount. Its forecast of Q1 revenue, adjusted for the extra day, is basically in line at $1.89 billion at the midpoint.The shares rallied in my opinion, not so much because of the actual print or guidance, but because of the sub-headline numbers. Most people who look at this company are going to look at bookings as more important than reported revenues and at cash flow and free cash flow metrics as being more important than reported earnings. There are no totally accurate statistics regarding expectations for either expected CRM bookings or for its cash flow expectations. But I would be reasonably sure that the company guidance for those metrics is significantly greater than many investors and analysts had heretofore estimated.I will discuss some of the valuation metrics later in this article. But in the wake of the 9% after-hours share price increase, even with the company's impressive attainments in terms of revenues, profitability and cash flow, no one is going to consider CRM a value name. 40 analysts cover CRM, and it is going to be reasonably hard to disguise the kind of performance this company has been achieving for some time now.For me, salesforce is a quintessential momentum growth story that just keeps getting better. The company remains my favorite large-cap tech pick and while risks abound in the tech world, if any company is going to be able to weather the reefs and shoals of these stormy times, this would most likely be the one.AnalysisI have recently written two articles regarding salesforce that expressed my positive evaluation of the company's strategy and its execution capability. I don't think it is either necessary or efficient to reprise much, if anything, in those reports. So I will focus on a few other topics that were seemingly of some interest during the conference call that followed the earnings release.I believe the paramount questions on the minds of most conference call listeners had to do with how a company of this size has been able to accelerate growth these past quarters and how or if the macro threats expressed by many other companies in the IT space might impact the forecast.There was a bit of a strain of sour grapes among a couple of questioners. One man wanted to know why growth wasn't faster or projected higher. I think common sense might have better suggested to the questioner that after a quarter that dramatically thumped business estimates - by that I mean bookings growth - it is simply not prudent to imagine that every quarter will achieve halcyon results. The company closed two nine-figure deals this past quarter. I am reasonably certain that it has never before closed a nine-figure deal, and I think some observers might be surprised at CRM's average transaction size. The success this company had in executing against its strategy to sell multi-cloud deals and increase average transaction size ought to be the headlines of the quarter. Of course, that will not be the case, but multi-product deals are the way forward for salesforce.com.No one is going to forecast that a company like this is going to close nine-figure deals with any regularity. And even if it actually does happen, no one is going to forecast such events on any consistent basis in the midst of the worldwide economic turmoil.The largest single deal that the company closed this past quarter was with an insurance vendor. On the other hand, it is well known at this point that AIG (NYSE:AIG), one of the world's largest insurance companies, is a sick company with sever operating problems and that it has shut its IT acquisition spigot very tightly. So, is the deal CRM closed in the insurance industry an outlier or is the insurance industry or other segments within the financial service vertical still a great business opportunity for software vendors? Obviously, the large deals did nothing to add to CRM's revenue last quarter, and the expenses that are recognized when deals closed probably did impact operating margins a little bit. Furthermore, these days CRM has moved most of its customers to an annual billing cycle such that the greatest proportion of renewals falls at the end of the calendar year, making sequential Q1 comparisons a bit meaningless. When I hear smart analysts ask questions whose answers are self-evident, I don't really imagine they are searching for information, and I do imagine their opinions are not likely totally objective.One interesting data point management spoke to on the call was that at this time 72% of its customers only have a single salesforce product. It would seem self-evident that one of the company's major growth opportunities will be to expand its product footprint within its installed base.But the other two questions remain. I suppose the easiest way to answer how this company is achieving a growth resurgence and how did it have such significant bookings attainments in this past quarter is to say the stars aligned. As the CEO pointed out, all of the products and all of the geos exceeded forecast in the same quarter. Something like that doesn't often happen to any company and no one is going to forecast that kind of result at the start of a quarter. Murphy may not rule the universe, but it is a rare quarter indeed that his ugly hand is not seen in evidence somewhere. I think another factor here is the growing footprint of CRM's product offering. Of course, its business segment that it calls sales cloud remains the dominant revenue contributor. But the fact is that the company's sales cloud grew by ""only"" 12%. It was the performance of the newer clouds such as applications, marketing, and analytics that drove the upside in bookings. But more than that, it was CRM's increasing ability to sell multi-product deals and to deliver enterprise platforms to users that was the significant factor for the company to achieve greater revenue and bookings growth.While the specifics of the nine-figure deals weren't discussed in any detail during the conference call, they were both multi-year and multi-product. As one reader has pointed out to me in his comments, CRM still does not provide users with solutions in all enterprise IT categories, but apparently the growth of its footprint is significantly changing the perception of the company by CIOs and more to the point CEOs. At some level, I have to suggest the figures speak for themselves as does the commentary by the principal managers of CRM.So the other issue of significance relates to the potential for CRM to weather the macro storm if it really develops. I can't and won't use my poor tongue and fat fingers to add my voice or some non-structured data to the cacophonous dialog as to whether the economy is now or is going to be in a recession. CRM's shares, even after their recent rally and their after-hours performance, are still down by more than 17% since early December of 2015. Plenty of commentators have attempted to explain the poor performance of these shares by suggesting their vulnerability to a recession. Other commentators have attempted to link the performance of CRM to the performance of other companies' selling subscription and/or SaaS IT solutions.I will step out on a very broad limb and suggest that if there is a real recession in the US and in the EU, it is going to have a visible impact on CRM. As the CEO pointed out a couple of times last evening, the company sells transformational products to ""C"" list executives. I will bet any odds that there will be fewer transformational projects launched in a recession than would otherwise be the case. If a customer is fighting to keep his or her enterprise above water, that customer is going to be far less interested in a transformational project that by its nature can't and won't produce exceptionally rapid payback. I've personally gone through just too many of these heartbreak experiences where users talk about reduced and revised budgets or priorities, board pressures, the need to get multiple sign-offs or that their dog ate the contract and that the lawyers had not approved their e-sign application.But putting aside recessionary concerns for the moment, if that is possible, the fact is that this company completed the strongest quarter in its history and obviously the sales forecasts have to reflect the kind of momentum that CRM has built in the field.I think the other salient point to mention is that the company now has $11 billion of total booked and un-booked backlog and a revenue forecast for the 2017 fiscal year that is just a bit greater than $8 billion. This writer spent more than a few years living and working in the south, and there is a phrase that sums up CRM's current position that seems relevant: ""They have the cool confidence of a Christian with 4 Aces."" Backlog, sales momentum, product success - it would be unusual to find a management that was not in love with its prospects under those circumstances and the fact that the team at least recognizes that there is a macro risk out there is about all that might be anticipated.Some Valuation Metrics And The Investment Case For The Shares At After-Hours PricesCRM has an enterprise value of about $46 billion in the light of its after-hours price action. So, the shares are now selling at about 5.7X EV/S with a forward P/E of about 68X. The company has forecast that it will generate about $2 billion of operating cash flow this current fiscal year, which is more than 3X its estimated non-GAAP earnings. Net stock-based comp. makes up most of the reported non-GAAP earnings. It is, however, just a bit more 25% of the operating cash flow that is being forecast for fiscal 2017.Capex for this company is not substantial. It was $68 million for the last quarter and $284 million for the year. On the other hand, it often makes cash commitments that it describes as ""strategic investments,"" and last year, it bought 50 Fremont St., a large SF office tower which gives the company room to expand its global headquarters. The cost of the Fremont St. acquisition was something greater than $600 million although the impact on last year's cash flow was less than that because of the specific details of the transaction. The company made $367 million of strategic investments in the prior fiscal year, up from $94 million in fiscal 2015. So, depending on some definitions and excluding unknown real estate transactions and unknown strategic investments, it would be reasonable to anticipate that free cash flow next year might be in the range of $1.7 billion. So, the company has a ""free cash flow yield"" of about 3.7%.No one is buying CRM's shares because they are perceived as deep value or GARP. The argument apparently is for how long this company can sustain a 20%+ top-line growth rate and how high can it push operating margins.I think the results of this last quarter - both quantitative and qualitative - strengthen the case that CRM can grow revenues by between 15% and 20% for at least the next five years. I think the massive growth in cash flow suggests that as revenue growth slows down and renewal deals become a greater part of the revenue mix, operating margins can readily top 35% or more. The company already has operating cash flow margins in excess of 25%.I leave it to readers to decide if it makes sense for them to discount cash flow streams in future periods back to present value. I think the valuation is well supported on that basis - the argument will then be about stock-based compensation. On the other hand, simple math does suggest that in five years, CRM ought to be able to reach an earnings run rate $8.00-9.00 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Depending on the terminal growth rate investors want to assume and the attendant multiple of the shares, I think the case for an investment in CRM is quite apparent.Image Source: SF Gate Blog"
3976396,98236,2016-05-19T14:58:09-04:00,Salesforce.com reported another quarter in which revenues and earnings beat expectations.The company increased revenue guidance but left its EPS forecast in the same range.The company's operating cash flow grew by 43% year on year.The company's inclusive bookings metric rose by 37% year on year.The company increased it GAAP operating margins by nearly 300 bps.,"Evaluating CRM's Q1 resultsOK, I have liked Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) for a long time now and have been at pains to express my thoughts in this forum. So maybe some readers will want to correct me for what they might think is my prejudice. At this writing, the shares are trading up another 5% and have made an all-time high close to $83/share. I'm not going to try to suggest that I know what the shares are going to do for the rest of this week or in the next week.I try to make sure to remember that I wasn't favored with a prescience gene, sad though that is. And I'm cognizant that the purpose of writing articles is to look at whether the companies about which I write can produce significant positive alpha for extended periods. Once upon a time, Josef Stalin wrote an article called ""Giddy With Success."" Needless to say, the article was not about CRM or computers - for those of you with an interest, it was about slowing the spread of collective farms.But the point I'm trying to make here is that despite the string of exceptional quarters that the company has put together, it is well to try to stick to quantitative methods of trying to evaluate the company. The answer is the same. Investors looking for a large-cap growth story in IT can do no better than CRM and that's likely to persist for some time.CRM as an investment is the closest thing there is in the IT space to a company that amply rewards long-term shareholders. I obviously have no idea as to the results the company will post in its fiscal Q2. After all, the quarter isn't over until 7/31. But I think the likelihood is that once again, the company will significantly beat what I regard as conservative guidance. And that's probably true for this year as well. Today, tomorrow or whenever - investors should bite the bullet and start to establish a position.I'm hardly unaware that CRM shares are volatile and not defensive. They have a current beta of 1.2X. The shares were $54 as recently as February 9 of this year at the bottom of the tech panic. There have been many recent articles on this site prophesying that we are in for a sharp pullback in the SPY or other indexes. If you feel that there's a significant risk of a significant market pullback, you should not be buying shares in CRM or almost any other name in the IT segment. In such a scenario, CRM shares might produce positive alpha but a negative return on your investment.I have said that my prescience gene is inactive. And ditto for my omniscience gene. But I will try to do an analysis that might suggest that far from being expensive, CRM shares are far cheaper than most observers imagine. I believe that some of the naysayers will have to find a different name on which to pick and that some of the more dubious observers might be disabused of their preconceptions by an analysis of this quarter's beat.If investors want to put together a large-cap growth portfolio with an IT component, I really think there's nothing quite like this company. The only comparisons that I can recollect, perhaps ironically, would be Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) at the apogee of the tech bubble and SAP (NYSE:SAP) during the rise of its ERP platform, R3. How the mighty have fallen.Let me say at the start that many readers refuse to accept that companies that have a business model in which they sell a variety of multi-year contracts and collect revenues ratably ought to be valued significantly differently than a company that collects all the money for its sale upfront. Investors who own REITs have seemingly made the adjustment to looking at operating cash flow rather than GAAP profits because the value of the REITs is in the ongoing cash flow as that is the source of the returns that these companies provide.And in looking at the other part of the income statement, it seems rather perverse to want to compare the revenues reported by this company, which come in ratably over several years to other companies who take all of their revenues from the sale of a product upfront. The biggest beat for CRM this quarter wasn't in reported revenues although the company did beat a little in that metric to be sure but by the massive increases in deferred revenues and especially off-balance sheet unbilled revenues.I think it's worth noting that the largest transaction CRM sold this quarter was another nine-figure deal with a major financial institution. Like the two prior nine-figure transactions, this deal provided the company with little revenue this quarter, some increase in deferred revenue and the most significant part of the transaction was reflected in the non-billed, off balance sheet deferred revenue. In looking at this company, that bucket is surely as important a metric to look at as are the other more traditional sales metrics.I will try to use another real estate example. Two developers build identical buildings. One sells the apartments as condominiums and collects all the cash and goes home. The other developer rents out the apartments on lease terms of different durations. In some cases, the building owner gets paid for the lease up front. In other cases, the building owner signs a multi-year lease and bills for the initial year at the time the deal is made. Occasionally, tenants go month to month. How should I report the revenues and expenses for each developer? How should a financial institution evaluate the worth of the building?I do not imagine anyone would suggest that I compare the results of selling out a condo development to the results of a rental building by taking all of the costs of the rental building when it is built even though the revenues will come in over a multi-year time span. While the headline numbers for CRM have a modicum of interest, the core numbers of any analysis of this company ought to be the growth in bookings and the generation of operating cash flow, which are far more indicative of the strength of the business than reported revenues and reported earnings - GAAP or non-GAAP.The headline numbers and a bit moreSo far as it goes, CRM had a decent quarter in terms of traditional financial metrics, as I will detail below. But it really had a much better quarter in the metrics such as bookings and cash flow, which are far more appropriate metrics to arrive at an objective valuation for the shares.CRM reported a revenue increase of 27% as reported and 28% in constant currency. That growth rate was actually an acceleration from the 25% as reported growth rate achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 (ended 1/31/16). Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share grew by 50% year over year from $.16 to $.24. So far as it goes, GAAP net income rose more than nine-fold although it still was just 2% of revenues. Overall, GAAP R&D expense declined from 15% to 14% of revenues year on year while S&M expense showed some operating leverage falling from 49% of revenues in fiscal 2016 to 46% in the current fiscal year.In terms of product lines, the sales cloud enjoyed exceptional growth for a product of its scale and longevity rising 14.6% year on year, significantly above the estimates of most observers. The success of the sales cloud was a principal driver in the company's over attainment. On the conference call in response to questions, the company CEO, Marc Benioff, suggested that the accelerating growth of sales cloud was the result of product refreshes and even, perhaps, the result of some excitement regarding the company's nascent AI offerings in the sales cloud. I really don't know if that is the entire explanation and I would suggest as an alternative or an adjunct that by this time, CRM's sales cloud is getting all the marketing/sales advantages that inure to category killers.The Service Cloud grew by 33% year on year, the App Cloud grew 45% and the Marketing Cloud only grew by 29%. All of these numbers were great, but the apps cloud growth of 45% was most so. The exceptional performance of the apps cloud is indicative of the momentum that CRM is achieving in selling its platform and infrastructure as the foundation of choice for many other smaller application software vendors. While it is hard to say with any degree of confidence, it is my belief that the application cloud, over time, has the opportunity to become the largest revenue generator amongst CRM's current product lines and I believe its potential growth remains underappreciated by many investors.I have seen some articles and reports on this company to the effect that its growth rate would inevitably slow down. Of course, the opposite has been the case thus far. What I think is misunderstood is that CRM's opportunities in the applications and the service cloud are probably greater than the opportunities have been in the company's sales cloud. As it happens, the company's allegedly mature product line, the sales cloud, has seen accelerating growth. CRM is likely to remain a growth company at rates significantly above those forecast despite the so-called law of large numbers or the concept of reverting to the mean.While it's difficult to quantify, the company probably has filled barely over a third of the total potential application stack. There are almost certain to be other clouds that will continue to be layered on what this company has already done and which are likely to sustain growth rates for a significantly longer period than is appreciated by the critics of investing in the shares of CRM.When the headline numbers actually mask the growth achievements of the businessWhile CRM achieved a reported revenue growth of 27% that actually understates the productivity of the company's sales operation. Not by all that much, to be sure, but the bookings metric which excludes the increase in the off-balance sheet unbilled contracts increased by 28% year on year. Overall, the company now has almost $12 billion of booked business on and off the balance sheet. In the quarter, overall bookings rose to $2.12 billion compared to $1.547 billion in fiscal 2016, which represents growth of no less than 37%, really a most remarkable statistic. (I calculate bookings by taking reported revenues and then adding or subtracting the change in on-balance sheet deferred revenues plus the increase in off-balance sheet deferred revenues.)Some interesting comparisons of note: Oracle had product revenues last quarter of a bit less than $3 billion. Product bookings for CRM totaled $1.98 billion, or about two-thirds of the product bookings at Oracle. To get that $3 billion of product bookings, Oracle needed 135,000 employees while CRM had a workforce of but 21,000. Yes, Oracle has a large maintenance base and indeed maintenance is the largest stream of revenues and profits that Oracle has (52% of revenues and really more than all of the profit) but I think the differences in the relative efficiency of the revenue generating machines is simply remarkable.These days the number of personnel required to provide maintenance support has decreased significantly as many automated tools are common. Perhaps another number that is yet more striking is that Oracle spent $1.9 billion on sales and marketing to sell $3 billion of product. CRM spent $900 million on a GAAP basis in sales and marketing to sell $1.775 billion of product. It is apparently a lot easier to sell CRM product these days than it is to sell Oracle products.The SAP comparisons are equally, if not more invidious, for that company. SAP had product revenues during its first quarter of $1.32 billion. The company has 75,000 employees. Sales and marketing costs were $1.44 billion for the quarter. I think the numbers make further commentary about the SAP/CRM comparison superfluous. I think that the economics of spending more on sales and marketing than is being produced in product revenue absent some outsize build up in deferred revenue is really very questionable.It is just very hard to maintain looking at these types of comparisons to maintain that CRM has an unprofitable business model or alternatively that Oracle or SAP are somehow more efficient than CRM. What is even more remarkable is the fact that CRM has a much narrower product line than either SAP or Oracle. CRM doesn't sell ERP, it doesn't sell HCM and it really doesn't sell standalone BI. In the categories in which it does compete, it is dramatically outselling its two major competitors by some significant amount although absolute statistics are hard to come by. It appears that CRM is taking market share from both Oracle and from SAP at an accelerating pace.I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that much of the reason for the dramatic differences in sales efficiency is that the business models of SAP and Oracle oblige them to try to cover the waterfront with application software solutions that have to have some degree of integration. That's going to have to be true as historic SAP and Oracle users migrate to the cloud.Integration is the largest single factor in trying to sell complete application stacks. And so, the basic inefficiencies of trying to be all things to all people will continue into the cloud environment for these companies to say nothing of the expense and effort of trying to support a multiplicity of disparate code bases that are apparently not yet completely integrated. While many observers both on and off Seeking Alpha maintain that CRM has a flawed and unprofitable business model, considered a bit more analytically, the exact opposite is true.Parenthetically, SAP's deferred revenue declined by about $60 million in its quarter that ended 3/31 while Oracle's deferred revenues in the quarter that ended 2/28 rose by $24 billion. CRM's deferred revenues rose by $207 million in its quarter that ended 4/30.Is cash king or is it the flawed accounting conventions that rule?There are no prizes available for guessing how I come down on that question. Now there are those investors who will say, ""I understand the analysis that you have done and even though it is quite unconventional, I will accept the fact that CRM actually has the far more preferable and profitable business model when compared to its legacy competitors."" But still, it barely reports profits and somehow that just doesn't feel right.As I have tried to mention the reason that CRM doesn't report profits is not because there are no profits to report but that the accounting system that CRM uses is deeply flawed and sadly misrepresents the real profitability of the company's business. A much better way to evaluate CRM is to consider both the growth and the sources of the company cash flow and free cash flow metrics.Operating cash flow for the quarter reached $1.05 billion, up from $735 million in the year earlier period. That is a growth of no less than 43%. Before anyone asks, part of that increase is the ongoing switch to annual buildings that occur at the start of the calendar year. But that was a negligible factor last quarter. By far the largest component of the $300 million year over year increase in operating cash flow was the decline in A/R balances, which remarkably fell by no less than 50% in fiscal Q1 when compared to the end of Q4.Quarterly revenues in Q4 were $1.81 billion and were $1.92 billion in this just reported quarter. Now it is a remarkable accomplishment to be sure and one that begs for a theory as to how revenues go up sequentially while receivables drop by 50%. In the real world, the only way that happens is when the quarter in question is exceptionally linear and there is no pressure to close deals at the end of the quarter.Of course, there is some seasonality reflected in the numbers that is dependent on when the company does its billings, now 79% of revenues, but not enough to account for a 50% drop in receivables. The inference that I might draw is that the company is very well set up indeed for a strong Q2 than will handily beat expectations and likely let the pipeline grow in what is historically the smallest quarter of the year.The company has forecast an increase in operating cash flow growth of between 25%-26%. That would bring that metric to $2 billion for all of fiscal 2017. Free cash flow in fiscal 2016 was $1.38 billion. (I'm excluding the purchase of the company's new headquarters in the calculation.)The company does not forecast free cash flow but based on Q1 capex of $83 million, my estimate for that metric would be about $1.65 billion or up 24% from the prior year. That too is likely to prove conservative although needless to say, the benefit in cash flow that was derived from the drop in receivables cannot be repeated in the balance of the fiscal year and is likely to go the other way. I think it is significant that a company that has top line growth of close to 30% with all the cash consuming demands that such growth brings can achieve a cash flow margin of just less than 25%. It suggests just how great is the cash generating capacity of this business model whenever growth moderates.ValuationValuing unicorns is never easy. By their nature, unicorns are unique. On conventional metrics, the company has an EV/S of 6.4X, a P/E of 82 times non-GAAP EPS estimates and its free cash flow yield is 2.9%. Many readers will ask how long does CRM's over-performance have to last to justify its current valuation? As I have suggested before, it is not that the valuation is too high but that the accounting system that is used is far off-base.I have a modest proposal to see if we can make better sense of this company's current valuation and why that valuation is well warranted. As some readers may be aware, Jonathan Swift of Gulliver's Travel fame was the first author to title one of his essays ""A Modest Proposal."" The title has been used many times since. After all, most observers think it is the best satirical essay ever written in the English language. Obviously, it is not about computers or the arcane world of accounting conventions. In 1729, when Dean Swift wrote the piece there were no computers and misbegotten accounting such as the South Sea bubble was just emerging.For those of you with the interest, A Modest Proposal was a plea for the government of that day to alleviate the suffering of the native Irish and to provide them with a modicum of justice and rights. The essay was fantastic but its policy proposals lay dormant for almost 200 years until the Easter uprising.My proposal has nothing whatsoever with the Protestant Ascendancy of the treatment of the Irish in Ireland. My proposal is that we add back stock-based comp to expenses and use overall bookings in lieu of revenues. In the just reported quarter that would have added $200 million to revenues and added $189 million to operating expenses. But as most observers realize this is a very seasonal company and bookings are at their lowest point in Q1 and ramp through the year.Last year bookings - bookings for on-balance sheet items were about $7.7 billion and overall bookings for the year, including the increase in non-billed off balance sheet bookings came to a bit over $9.7 billion. CRM doesn't provide all of the figures that would be needed to most accurately forecast total bookings but with the results of Q1 in hand along with some guidance, overall bookings for this company during its fiscal year 2017 will probably reach to between $12-$12.5 billion and that is a conservative estimate I believe.In any event, using bookings instead of revenues will add about $4 billion to the revenue calculation. Just to be fair, it would probably add about $400 million to commissions. On the other side of the ledger, the stock-based compensation expense for the year might total over $800 million. It was $593 million last year and it was $189 million in the April quarter. Overall, making those changes would increase pre-tax profits by $2.8 billion. The company estimates a normalized tax rate of 35% so net income would be $1.8 billion greater than the current forecast. The company has 687 million shares outstanding. That works out to an additional $2.62 of earnings to add to the current estimate of $1.01.Such a change in the company's financial reporting would bring the EV/S from 6.4X to 4.65X and it would bring the P/E down to 29.7X. Those are still not bargain basement numbers but the company is still growing at almost 30% and just raised guidance.There are going to be readers who question the methodology used in deriving the numbers or who question the relevance of the numbers that I used overall. OK, my proposal was not all that modest, but then again neither was that of Dean Swift. It isn't going to happen any time soon. And I confess that the numbers are broad estimates and are not meant to be precise. For me, it is just a way of looking at this company and providing far more accurate estimates of key valuation estimates than are otherwise available.The preponderance of new price targets from those analysts who have changed them so far today is in the range of $100/share. That's conservative as it should be. I think a 30X multiple on the earnings adjusted as I have suggested is as reasonable as any other price target and that yields $108/share.Summing UpCRM reported another blow-out quarter last evening that showed revenues above estimates. The company chose to raise revenue guidance minimally and to leave EPS forecasts alone. The company had a very strong cash flow quarter and management raised its forecast for that metric as well.But beyond just the headline numbers, the company had a spectacular growth in bookings. The way I calculate that metric, including the increase in off balance sheet deferred revenues, bookings growth was 37%.The company's line of business numbers proved to be very encouraging as well. Its initial product, sales cloud, showed accelerating growth at 14% and its Apps Cloud line of business grew by 45%. I think many investors and observers still underestimate the potential for the Apps Cloud and other emerging new products for this company.The company did achieve a 300 bps increase in reported GAAP margins and much of that growth was in the context of rising sales productivity. I think the trend of rising operating margins will continue now for the foreseeable future.I realize that traditional valuation metrics still portray CRM shares to be a very expensive investment. I have proposed another way of looking at the company's operating results that takes account of the company's mismatch between when it records revenues and expenses. Overall, such an exercise leads reported profits to more than treble. While still not a value name, even when using my proposed way of looking at the company's adjusted valuation metrics, I think that even GARP investors might want to think of making commitments in the name. CRM shares continue to be my strongest recommendation in the large cap IT space."

It is becoming a cloud applications company dependent on no one.The company's first move beyond Oracle was a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to use its Azure cloud. Now, for its Internet of Things offering, the company is using Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). That service launches later this year.At the same time, it's moving into other cloud verticals. There's a government cloud for testing and deploying government-related services quickly and at scale. It has gone on an acquisition binge, buying MetaMind and Implisit Insights. It is working to cross-fertilize ideas among its various verticals, building a single Consulting Partner Program.All these moves are based on a new vision that investors need to understand. We have moved out of the infrastructure and platform eras of cloud, and we're now in the application era. While rival Oracle buys applications in order to choke customers for bigger profits, Salesforce builds new application spaces and then seeks customers to fill them.As with Amazon, this means investing ahead of revenues. It means forgoing current profits in the name of growth. Like Amazon, Salesforce runs at roughly break-even, depending on cash flow and investment to keep it going. For the fiscal year ending in January for instance, the company had positive operating cash flow of $1.6 billion, up from $1.1 billion a year earlier.It's also true that, as in the early days of Amazon, or the Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) ""Fail Whale,"" things break down. It can mean an embarrassing apology, but it also may mean a buying opportunity for those who understand the difference between growing pains and a heart attack.Salesforce.com is doing all this for the same reason as Amazon, the old doctrine of ""get there fustest with the mostest."" Just as a general may say every moment lost is worth a thousand men, so in cloud, every day lost can mean the loss of a billion dollars in business down the road.This is bound to be controversial. The top line may be growing, but the bottom line is not, and that may make the stock appear overvalued. Right now, Salesforce's shares are valued at about 8.5 times revenues against 6.5 times for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT).None of it makes sense unless you understand the company's true story and can describe it in very few words. Amazon is e-commerce infrastructure, Alphabet is search-and-find, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the user experience, and Microsoft (MSFT) application software.Salesforce.com is not a CRM company, it is a cloud applications vendor, which brings the full economics of cloud to its customers. They don't just buy capacity and they don't just buy a platform. They buy a cloud solution to thorny business problems, which can accelerate the growth of even the stodgiest business.That's powerful stuff. Ignore the price and buy the stock."

But cloud is the fastest growing segment within IT. The researcher claims that in 2015, $128 billion or 60% of IT spending growth was spent on cloud technologies. By 2018, it predicts that all IT spending growth dollars will be attributed to the cloud. Recent results by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have shown the importance of cloud technologies. Last week, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported its quarterly results and outlook that continued to prove the dominance of cloud-based offerings. During the quarter, the company signed two nine-figure deals and more than six hundred seven-figure deals across multiple industries - translating to over $1.81 billion in quarterly sales. Clearly, there is no stopping this force.Salesforce's FinancialsFor the final quarter of the year, Salesforce's revenue grew 25% over the year to $1.81 billion, above analyst projection of $1.79 billion. EPS of $0.19 was in line with the market's forecast for the quarter.By segment, revenues from Subscription and Support services grew 25% over the year to $1.68 billion and Professional services and other revenues were up 28% to $126.7 million.Salesforce ended the year with revenues growing 24% over the year to $6.67 billion. Net loss reduced from $0.42 per share a year ago to a loss of $0.07 per share for the year.For the current year, Salesforce expects revenues of $8.08 billion-$8.12 billion with an EPS of $0.99-$1.01. The market was looking for revenues of $8.08 billion and an EPS of $0.99. Salesforce expects to end the current quarter with revenues of $1.885 billion-$1.895 billion and an EPS of $0.23-$0.24. The market had forecast the quarter's revenues at $1.86 billion and an EPS of $0.21.Salesforce's AcquisitionsUntil recently, Salesforce had been focused on improving its analytics offerings. Acquisitions made earlier last year were indicative of its focus toward that segment. In the recent quarter though, Salesforce appears to be making a push within the marketing segment. Currently the marketing cloud service is the smallest business within Salesforce's cloud segment. Recent acquisitions could help increase its contribution to the business.In December it announced the $360 million acquisition of SteelBrick. SteelBrick offers Quote-to-Cash software that helps configure price quotes. Quote-to-cash is a suite of backend applications that automates the process of generating quotes, contracts and billing. It allows the sales team to create customized pricing through a selection of features, components and add-ons that go into a proposal to the buyer. Prior to the acquisition, Salesforce relied on other partners such as Apttus to provide these services. SteelBrick has a portfolio of over 350 customers including Cloudera, Jive, Marketo and Nutanix. With the acquisition, Salesforce will be able to add value to its CRM offering.Last year, Salesforce also acquired four person start-up MinHash for an undisclosed sum. Founded by Oracle and eBay alumni, MinHash's services operated like a virtual assistant for marketers. The platform could scan through multiple media resources to identify trends and create marketing campaigns.But not to leave analytics behind, earlier this month Salesforce announced the acquisition of PredictionIO, a small startup software maker that works on predictive applications. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. PredictionIO makes open source software for machine learning apps and allows developers to build apps for data analytics and predictive work. Salesforce will leverage the acquisition to enhance SalesforceIQ's machine learning capabilities. It also will add to Salesforce's already rapidly growing analytics arsenal to capture the Business Intelligence and Analytics Software Market - a market projected to grow 8% annually to $26.8 billion by the year 2019.Its stock is currently trading at $69.72 with a market capitalization of $46.29 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $82.90 following its third quarter results announcement in November last year. The recent quarter's results have helped the stock recover from the 52-week low of $52.60 it had reached earlier this month. The stock had fallen in reaction to the market's anxiety on weaker results being announced by Tableau (TBLU) and LinkedIn (LNKD) that created broad concerns about the state of the cloud computing sector.Clearly, Salesforce has put those concerns to rest."
3965287,98236,2016-04-14T12:20:00-04:00,"Salesforce.com's non-GAAP accounting presentation has received much attention and much negative commentary from SA contributors in recent weeks.The company does enjoy a modest benefit from excluding stock-based compensation from its earnings presentation.The company pays a far larger penalty in using a misbegotten methodology to account for the economic value of what it is actually selling.In trying to look at the real earnings of this company, its real margins and earnings are far more robust than might be imagined.","What more can one possibly write about CRM that hasn't already been written?This article isn't going to be a forecast of how well Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is doing or about all of the company's opportunities - well I confess, I did sneak a bit of speculation in about that. But CRM is a very well covered name with 40 analysts projecting revenues and earnings. And for what it is worth, most recently, several analysts have said positive things about the company's prospects both for this quarter that will end in a bit more than two weeks and for the intermediate term. There really is very little that I might add to that discussion.There is a certain genre of typically ""B"" movies that are typically set in a high school in which the class bully picks on some nerdy guy and accuses him of being strange and nerdy. Most often, because that is the way of American films, somehow the nerdy guy finds friends and together they go and finish off the bully. Usually the nerdy guy winds up with the beautiful women... But not always.I sometimes think that in reading some recent articles on SA with regards to CRM's accounting strategy as though I were witnessing that kind of phenomenon, although needless to say, CRM is not one of those weak, nerdy looking characters that was always getting picked on.Let me specify from the start that I along with everyone else who owns or is thinking about owning CRM shares knows that the company derives a substantial component of its earnings from stock-based comp. It isn't all that hard to find the exact statistics and in case any of you might be wondering, stock-based comp for this company was $593 million gross or $534 million net of the excess tax benefit.Now quite surprisingly compared to the thesis advanced by several SA contributors recently, net stock based comp declined last year by 4% or $23 million when compared to the net amount reported for the prior fiscal year. Looked at another way, stock-based comp was 8.1% of revenues in the past fiscal year, down from 10.3% in the year before. So, whatever else is true, in looking at stock-based comp on a comparative basis, it is declining and not increasing, not the hallmark of a company with a strategy of using creative accounting.For the record, I think, and always have thought that stock-based comp is an expense and it can and often does dilute shareholders' equity. I suppose I could write about some of the issues with regards to the FASB rule covering stock-based comp. There are different academic points of view as to whether or not using a method, that method in which volatility enhances the value of an option grant is really measuring the right thing. There is much to read on the subject and I will not bore readers with any of it. I will accept that FASB 123 is the bible on the subject and it shouldn't be challenged.But I would think that no one, really, and likely not even the FASB itself would think for a moment that their regulations cover all situations or are holy writ without reasonable expectations of change and modification or the right of challenge. Fact is, I think the job of developing a prudent investing strategy that can maximize alpha is to find areas in which conventional accounting rules simply do not reflect the economic situation of the company being analyzed. It is easy, for the most part, to point out the obvious. It is a bit harder to look at the obvious and the surface and then to try to penetrate below that which appears on the surface.Software companies, like almost every other classification of enterprise, are constantly changing and evolving. As more and more software companies sell their products on a subscription basis, ultimately, I expect there will be calls for the FASB to develop new regulations that better portray the economic realities of such transactions. That is really the purpose of the FASB.I will try to show in the balance of this article that far from Salesforce.com stretching the envelope or using creative accounting to present a distorted and positive view of its operations to investors and other stakeholders, the exact opposite is true. The company is creating a massive store of value that is not recognized in any traditional fashion. At some point, one assumes, the FASB will promulgate certain regulations that do a better job in trying to evaluate the economic impact of subscription bookings and revenues. There are actually proposals that will change how subscription revenues that arise over multi-year periods might be treated in the future. But for now, I will simply write about what is rather than what is likely to be.I am not a shill for CRM or its share price. Like it says in the disclosure, I have no current position in the name and no plans to start a position in the next 72 hours. And regardless of anything else, CRM is covered by 40 analysts. There is nothing that my poor tongue might articulate that is going to change the price of CRM shares in one direction or the other noticeably. And having watched companies in the enterprise software space for more years than I am willing to recollect, I can guarantee all readers that at some point in the future CRM will run into some problems.Enterprise software is the quintessential black swan space so I don't know what the company's problems might come to be. But the company's bookings growth will miss expectations, someday. And the company's margin expansion will stall someday. But that someday is far from now and will not be related to creative accounting. There are more than enough ways for software companies to mess up without having to raise old chestnuts regarding aggressive accounting.CRM does a relatively complete job in discussing the potential costs of the stock-based compensation that it grants. I'm really not too sure as to how it might do a better job than it does. For those so inclined, you can go to page 10 of the company's last financial presentation and see all that you might desire to see regarding stock-based comp and its excess tax benefits.I'm really not so sure that GAAP results need to be ""dug out"" as SA contributor Vincent Groenewoud suggests in his recent article. I generally have the conception that ""digging out"" implies that the required metric is not easily visible. But my goodness, on the very first page of the earnings release, it says that Q4 GAAP loss per share was ($0.04) per share and for those who have tender vision, the GAAP caption leads the non-GAAP earnings caption just the way the FASB likes it. I suppose I might stop there and then this would be the shortest article I have ever written and spare a few tender eyeballs.But the fact is CRM actually tries reasonably hard to present a realistic, as opposed to contrived, picture of its operations. Management was more than a bit giddy during its conference call discussing the results of its fiscal Q4 that ended 1/31/16. Is it possible that the presenters were all a bunch of thespians trying out for roles in some TV business corruption drama? Or might it be that management thought they had just achieved one of the best quarters at scale ever seen in the IT space?Needless to say, I think it was the latter. Why? Pretty simple actually. CRM CEO Mark Benioff who is pictured as some facsimile of the devil minus his horn and tail in the recent article I cited has a long history in sales. Keith Block, who is the President and Chief Operating Officer of Salesforce is a rather well known sales executive with a lengthy background at Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). For better or worse, these men live, eat, breathe and talk about selling large deals at CRM.I would think that their interests and those of the shareholders are very closely aligned. And interestingly, when someone else says that they aren't and that Mr. Benioff is earning too much from CRM at the expense of stakeholders, the company acts quite rapidly to assuage such criticism. Jason Aycock, SA News Editor, ran a piece on Mr. Benioff's compensation the other day in which he noted that the proxy statement recently issued by CRM disclosed that Mr. Benioff's pay declined last year and that for the current year, CRM's compensation committee decided to lock in Benioff's salary at $1.55 million and his cash bonus at $3.1 million.Now as it happens, Mr. Benioff was said by Forbes to be worth $3.9 billion. Does someone actually think that a man worth $3.9 billion is fixated on his compensation, regardless of whether it is $39 million or $33 million or some other number? I'm going to address Mr. Benioff's sales of CRM shares below, but I will simply say that so far as I might be concerned, if Mr. Benioff was able to achieve the results that the company posted last year for $39 million, I would prefer to see him earn $78 million just to see what that might accomplish for a higher payout.I realize that many readers will not agree, but at this point, Mr. Benioff is just not doing it for the money. He doesn't need all the money he has and he is in the process of giving what he does have to various charities. Not really the hallmark, I should think, of someone who might countenance using creative accounting to mask the actual stake of the business that he has created, but in the words of that quintessential New Yorker who has made a gift of his persona to the nation through his candidacy for our nation's highest office, ""whatever.""When it all comes together as it did last quarter, the people who run CRM do not try to hide their light under a bushel basket. They shout their success from the rooftops. And yes, when they read their press release, they actually manage to tell any listeners who care that they had a GAAP loss and when one pursues the detailed financial reconciliation it starts with GAAP earnings.Let's make a huge assumption and believe that neither Mr. Benioff or Mr. Block or CFO Mark Hawkins are neither fools or knaves. In point of fact, these are brilliant men, the best of the best so to speak. Mr. Benioff invented the concept of Software as a Service, more or less, and has built a company and has made himself terribly rich in the process. Mr. Block was the heart and soul of Oracle's North American Sales organization for many, many years when it really could and often did achieve stunning sales performance. And Mr. Hawkins, well he has been a leader in various financial organizations in the IT world for such companies as Autodesk, Logitech, Dell and HP.Is it actually conceivable that these men know what they are doing and believe that GAAP metrics present a seriously flawed picture as to CRM's financial performance? Mr. Groenewoud suggests in his article that the heavy institutional ownership - 88% - in the last reporting period is a potential risk. Might it instead be that institutional investors and management and for the very limited difference that it makes, this writer as well, actually do not believe that CRM has a problem with creative accounting? Instead, the problem, at least so far as I see it, is slavish devotion to a set of rules from the FASB that were drawn up long before the emergence of companies in the IT world that sell their services very differently than all that has come before?What is a sale?No, that isn't really a joke or a trick question. For those of you old enough to remember President Clinton's trouble defining the word ""it,"" here comes another one of those problems. Most of the time, defining a sale is not a particularly difficult undertaking. Your company sells another company something of value and your company sends the customer company both a product and then an invoice. That creates both a sale and an account receivable. Later, if it all works out, your customer pays for the product or the service extinguishing the A/R, which then becomes converted to cash. For many years, that is the way the software industry was - or was it really?I'm not talking about the parlor games that malignant managers in the IT space have played in order to game the system. IT has relatively high values that can be created by the most gossamer of ""real"" facts and hence the space has attracted fraudsters and charlatans for as long as it has been around. I once had a conversation about Larry Ellison and Oracle's ingenious ways of stretching the last month of a quarter to 35 days. My client told me at the time that was what he expected Oracle to do, what he was paying Oracle to do and not to bother him by suggesting Oracle used aggressive accounting.Speaking now as a long-time analyst, it was always fascinating to see how men and women would check their commonsense at the door and come up with schemes to baffle the unwary - including this writer from time to time. From a sheer entertainment point of view, the scam cooked up by Powersoft and Sybase probably was the most fun to watch - although I don't imagine it really was that entertaining for many investors. More than a few companies used to engage in end of the quarter barter transactions.Since these companies had agreed to merge, it really didn't matter just how much Sybase ""sold"" to Powersoft and all of a sudden, Sybase seemed to need loads of PowerBuilder licenses. In other cases, ""sales"" were made to companies who everyone knew could never pay. The ""sale"" was recorded in the quarter in which it was needed and then when the ""customer"" couldn't pay, it was written off as a bad debt. Informix made a regular practice of selling its software to Russian banks at the time of the 1998 financial crisis. Needless to say, that ended badly.My favorite experience in watching a sale that wasn't had to do with Peregrine who would religiously send software to IBM (NYSE:IBM) at the end of the quarter, then take it back and send even more of it out again the following quarter. For that trick more than a few people went to jail but it was great fun watching from the sideline. To a certain extent, Sarbanes-Oxley has actually done what was intended and there are fewer outright frauds in the IT space these days, but one must be ceaselessly diligent.And now we come to Salesforce. Salesforce reported revenues in Q4 of $1.81 billion and for the full year, its revenues were $6.67 billion. Is that really the economic worth of what Salesforce shipped? Of course not! Why, well Salesforce only gets to record the monthly invoices that it generates for its service even if the contract it signs with its customers is for multiple years. The reason CRM broadcasts its changes in deferred revenue and its changes in unbilled deferred revenue is not to confuse things but so that investors and anyone else who might be interested can observe what the company actually sold during a particular quarter.CRM could report a quarter of excellent sales and poor bookings and that would be far more disturbing than if it reported a quarter with poor sales and excellent bookings. And almost everyone who follows the company or owns the shares knows that and believes that and it is the fatal flaw at the heart of Mr. Groenewoud's arguments. The performance metrics that CRM publicizes are not misleading but are the exact and the only exact way to understand the economic health of this company or any other company that uses a subscription model to sell.Philanthropic donations are really not nefarious devices to enrich donors at the expense of shareholders.Many contributors and investment advisory services have commented about insider sales at CRM. It's a popular topic for disclosure. Of course, the sales have happened, but in this case, the question is why? For the most part, Mr. Benioff's sales of CRM shares are to fund his donations to charities. Since 2010, he and his wife have contributed $250 million to local children's hospitals in the Bay Area.He has also focused his contributions on other Bay Area charities including UC San Francisco, the Exploratorium museum of Science and Human Perception and the Campaign for Hope SF. For those readers who listen to Salesforce conference calls, almost unique amongst the companies that I follow, anyway, there is always commentary about the company's 1/1/1 plan. Recently Mr. Benioff and his wife pledged another $100 million to a new $1.5 billion children's hospital at UC San Francisco.I really have no particular idea as to the man's personality. Maybe he is mean to his animals or neglects his kids - I don't think so, really, but maybe. But if someone wants to understand why the man sells Salesforce stock, the first place to look would be to consider how he is able to fund his rather significant charitable contributions. I will leave you with Mr. Benioff's commentary regarding philanthropy: ""Those fortunate enough to become rich should give their money away now rather than to wait until they're finished making money to figure out what to do with it.""I'm sure that not all of the readers of this article will be persuaded that Mr. Benioff's sales of Salesforce stock are motivated by his adherence to such a goal, and I'm equally sure that the man is not wearing a hair shirt or living in a hovel or driving a nasty car. (Although maybe he is - in one article, I read he says that he eschews fancy hotels for Airbnb (AIRB) accommodations to save money for shareholders.) But I confess that I do find it a bit off-putting to see a decent entrepreneur chastised for making contributions in accordance with his personal philosophy.OK - enough of the moralizing, let's get back to the main point here and explore the intricacies of how Salesforce does their business and whether it presents some misshapen picture of its success?Almost 40 years ago now, I worked for a company that sold computer terminals that would work with IBM systems to a large variety of blue-chip clients. We would sell hundreds of thousands of these terminals to substantial and less substantial users who mainly wanted to lease the terminals, associated printers and their controllers from us. Needless to say, the company I worked for was not a bank and lacked the financial resources to provide lease financing to all of our clients. And so, we would take the leases to different banks and see how much we could raise by assigning the future payments.Of course, that was one of my jobs, which is why I know about what happened. There was, to be sure, an education process in terms of getting the financial institutions comfortable with the life of the product, but it really didn't matter all that much since the contracts we sold were ironclad. In the event, the credit losses were minimal and by the end of my time in Oklahoma, we had more offers from financial institutions to buy the leases than we had leases to sell.Now why am I spending so much time and space writing about something that happened almost 40 years ago? Pretty simple. Our company took the transaction with the financial institution as a sale and got to report all of it in the period in which the terminal was shipped to the customer and in which he signed an acceptance certificate. There were times when users were unwilling to sign four-year leases - the standard term of the contract in those years - there were all kinds of reasons for that. Then I had to work harder and get the financial institution to advance us more money than the discounted present value of the actual lease. And when that happened, we couldn't take revenue, despite having received the cash, for anything beyond the guaranteed term of the lease.Fast forward a few years and system integrators sprung up both in terms of funding federal sales and in terms of funding sales to commercial clients. It is still the case today, that most sales to US government agencies are done on paper from large SI's and leasing companies. The government contracts for several years of fixed payments, the SI essentially finances the lease and usually finds a third party to fund the entire transaction so the vendors in the consortium can get paid upfront. Needless to say, the vendors in the consortium take the payment from either the SI or the leasing company and record it as a sale. It is a sale, really.Now let's take a look at what CRM - and for that matter every other subscription revenue company - actually does. Just to make this as simple as possible, I will take one of the nine-figure transactions that Salesforce booked last quarter. This particular transaction was a seven-year lease with guaranteed payments in excess of $400 million. It is with one of the most creditworthy institutions in this country, an absolute rock solid credit and a household name. How much revenue did Salesforce recognize for that transaction in the period it took place?I really don't know precisely since I don't know the day on which the contract was executed, but Salesforce charges for its service agreements by the day and that is all the revenue it can recognize in a particular period. But given the nature of things in terms of determining the size and longevity of the arrangement, it probably took place within the last 10 days of the quarter. In that case, Salesforce probably got to recognize something less than $2 million of revenue in the period the customer signed the contract and accepted the product. Somehow I think most readers intuitively understand that when a company has to defer 98% of the revenue that it has sold on a specific agreement with the best credit in the nation, the accounting system that mandates this treatment is profoundly misrepresenting the profitability and the scale of CRM's business.If CRM took the lease to a bank and sold it on a non-recourse basis, it could recognize all of the revenue upfront. That later transaction is self evidently less profitable to CRM than signing a lease and retaining all the benefits of ownership after the expiration of the initial term of the lease. CRM's lease retention rate since it has reported such things has been significantly above 90% and most of the churn is really the result of the company's customers downsizing or merging. Very few people throw CRM systems away after one year or three years or even after seven years unless the organization gets smaller or no longer exists.There is a very simple exercise that I invite readers to do and see if it works out in terms of their own understanding. CRM for fiscal 2015 had reported revenues of $6.67 billion and a GAAP loss of $47 million. But I think we have determined that the revenue number presented seriously misrepresents the value of what CRM sold. In point of fact, the actual value of what CRM sold was not $6.67 billion, it was actually something like $8.1 billion, which represents both the monthly billings that CRM sent to its customers plus the amount of contracts signed that either have been paid for upfront or contracts for which the service will be paid for over time. Again, according to what I know, these are ironclad contracts - no outs, no contingencies, no future deliverable - you pay, we supply the service. CRM sales management is said to be very clear on what it will and what it will not accept as a long-term contract.Let's take the exercise a little further and see where that gets us in terms of ""real"" earnings. This company had a gross margin on subscriptions last year of 81%. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume that the gross margins on the additional revenues were the same, surely a very, very conservative estimate. The company recorded a marketing expense of $3.239 million, which was 52% of subscription revenues. Much of that expense is really not variable, it is salaries and administrative costs, advertising and promotion and the like. The only variable part of S&M is sales commissions. I'm going to get wild and woolly here and suggest that incremental sales and marketing costs are going to be 20% of incremental revenues, which is about $480 million.So, trying to look at this in a fashion that is similar to what would happen if the Salesforce solutions were sold and not leased would add $2.4 billion to revenue and perhaps as much as $940 million to cost. That would bring pre-tax GAAP profits to more than $1.5 billion for fiscal 2015. I'm not sure what the tax rate would have been on that, but for the sake of this discussion, let's use a 35% tax rate. And that leaves a bit over $1 billion in after tax GAAP earnings, or about $1.50-plus in EPS.I'm sure some readers will feel uncomfortable with such an exercise, but really even that calculation is too conservative as it allows for no recognition of residual value at the end of any lease period which is almost certainly measured in the billions of dollars overall due to the stickiness of what Salesforce and every other subscription company is selling. The truth is, we really do not know yet just how profitable these companies will be. But I think that far from CRM using creative accounting to mask a deteriorating situation, it is using accounting methodology that masks just how profitable this company already is. One may think that a P/E of 50X is still high for this kind of a company. And that brings me to the penultimate section of my little tale.Is it inevitable that the growth rate of large subscription companies must slow down?Mr. Groenewoud's article states that ""growth is slowing with little hope for it to return to previous levels."" At one level, that seems a reasonable contention. The amount of ""service"" that a company like this has to ship in order to sustain a constant level of revenue growth obviously has to rise at greater and greater rates simply to keep the same growth rate. Simple math. And indeed, that is exactly what the consensus revenue forecast says. It uses something like company guidance to forecast a 22% growth rate in the current fiscal year and then diminishes the growth rate in the following year to 20%, which is actually a little bit higher in dollars than the revenue growth rate forecast this year. Almost every analyst alive would use that kind of methodology to avoid unnecessary explanations of how a company at scale can continue to grow at similar growth rates year after year.I have no urgent desire to attempt an in-depth analysis of how this company can keep growing at rates of higher than 20%. But unlike Mr. Groenewoud, I think I at least have to look at how growth happens for a company like this. Regardless of what the CEO of Oracle has to say on the subject, it is almost certainly true that this company has dominated and will continue to dominate the market for cloud-based sales automation solutions.I just want to call out some numbers from the earnings conference call that might illuminate a couple of points. This company divides its revenue into several buckets. The core business, Sales Cloud, had 12% growth in the quarter and that is up a few hundred bps from the prior quarter. Service Cloud grew at 35%, marketing Cloud grew at 31% and Apps Cloud and other grew at 43%. So, CRM's secret sauce is that it introduces new products year after year after year. If it were still just selling sales cloud no one would even consider this a growth story. I think most analysts today think that CRM competes for less than 40% of the available enterprise stack. But that doesn't mean that this lion won't continue to grow.Right now, from what I have heard, marketing cloud is the easiest application to sell and the one driving the ultra-large deals. Mr. Benioff may have an ugly beard but he has a very, very shrewd brain. I think it really isn't a stretch to imagine that this company will steadily increase its product footprint and try to sell its installed base on new clouds and sell new clouds to new customers. I can't and won't tell you that everything this company does will turn out successfully. Indeed, if it did, I would feel that it wasn't making adequate use of its franchise. The company is now entering the AI space where it will have to develop a strategy to be successful in what appears to be a very hyped market space with very high expectations.But I think that Mr. Benioff, and the rest of this management team have some idea about what it will take to insure that growth does not tail off and that the company will develop new clouds on a consistent basis. Right now, the big new thing for this company is analytics, which shows up in ""other"" - 43% growth, albeit from a de minimis number. I really wouldn't bet that there won't be a HR cloud or a payroll cloud or even a Supply Chain Planning cloud. I'm not quite sure as to what kind of product is intended for AI other than to imagine it will be some other type of cloud. That is, at the end of the day, the DNA of this company. Like the announcer says in the Geico ad, it is what they do.Some final thoughtsI have seen more than a few recent articles on SA that prognosticate CRM is going to blow up and that it is misleading investors by use of creative accounting. I think the accounting is the opposite of creative, it unfairly and arbitrarily reflects a much less accurate picture of this company's economic strength than is warranted by the facts. Yes, stock-based comp is a cost and everyone knows it. And yes, this company's non-GAAP presentation benefits from the exclusion of stock-based comp as a cost.But many commentators simply refuse to understand that the nature of this company's business, by which I mean its subscription model, dramatically understates both the scale and the profitability of what this company has achieved. In fact, even at this point, no one really knows just how profitable this company can be, since no one has yet to determine the real economic life of the service the company sells. Selling the same service to the same customers again and again and again over many years is outrageously profitable.I have tried to go through an exercise to determine just how large and profitable this company already is, or perhaps better said would be if it used accounting treatment that is standard in many other areas of the IT industry. The results will, perhaps, excite some disdain, I suppose, but also may surprise some readers as well.The best of Mr. Groenewoud's argument is about the potential for CRM to suffer from slowing growth. That could certainly happen and if company guidance is to be believed, it is already happening. But in the real world, that simply isn't a typical evolution of how hyper-growth companies evolve. Many software companies will use their cash flow to fund inorganic growth. That hasn't happened to any degree at Salesforce but it surely might.But regardless of CRM's potential for inorganic growth, the company will find new worlds to conquer and indeed it already has. Not everything that Salesforce does in that regard is going to work just as not every quarter that Salesforce prints is going to be a blowout. But along the way, CRM has made one very successful acquisition on which its Marketing Cloud is based and has mainly avoided quarterly accidents.Like all IT companies, CRM is going to have some quarters that are better than others. I wrote in the wake of earnings last quarter that the beer for CRM would never be colder and so by extension I must think that this quarter which will end in a couple of weeks will be less of an upside than last quarter. That might concern some analysts and investors. But there have been suggestions of late that maybe there is some super chiller for beer out there and the quarter will actually be a significant upside.But I do believe that a quarter will come that significantly misses the company's targets and forecasts. That will be the time to consider the growth prospects for this company. CRM valuations will not fall because people think that its accounting is aggressive. The shares will fall when someone builds a better mousetrap and sells it at a lower price. Thus far, and for the most part, it is CRM that is selling the better mousetrap. And I have seen no evidence that suggests to me that anyone is even close to disrupting the opportunities of CRM."
3964326,89446,2016-04-11T08:09:34-04:00,Misleading performance metrics hide complete lack of profitability.Growth is slowing with little hope for it to return to previous levels.Valuation implies a highly unrealistic view of the future.A drop of over 50% in the next 1-2 years is likely as reality sets in and institutional owners bail.,"Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) loves to talk growth statistics and non-GAAP profit measures during results announcements. Generally, actual GAAP measures need to be dug out of the filings as management mostly communicates with investors in terms like ""non-GAAP earnings,"" ""Deferred Revenue,"" and ""Un-billed Deferred Revenue.""I have written about Salesforce in the past, and have spent some time explaining the accounting treatments Salesforce applies (here, and here). I also tried to shed light on the use of the non-traditional accounting measures used by Salesforce. In my view, Salesforce is one of the companies that has been front and centre in this game, although there are more and more companies reporting figures which are far from actual GAAP results. The gap between GAAP and non-GAAP at Salesforce has increased over the past few years and this is often indicative of management scrambling to report attractive looking measures despite deteriorating underlying fundamentals.The reality of Salesforce's results are that they have shown impressive revenue growth, but so far no profits (on a GAAP basis). The revenue growth has also come down over the past years as can be expected once you surpass the 5 Billion USD mark in revenues.Growth, but at what price?The question, though, is not whether Salesforce is growing. It clearly is. The question is how fast it can continue to grow in the near future given the increasingly competitive landscape. Also, what will the margins be a few years down the line and will the end result warrant the current 50 billion USD market cap.Let us have a look at the revenue development over the past few years to get a feel for the growth:Source: author's work based on company's annual reportsPlease note that the FY 2017 guidance comes from management, not from analysts, indicating that management itself foresees lower growth, at least for the coming 12 months. The trend is clear: growth is leveling off and the days of 30%+ growth are over. Salesforce hopes to achieve 20% the coming year.Let's move on to margins as reported by Salesforce through its quarterly filings. This is where we face a choice of which metric to use. Salesforce prefers to report results in terms of ""adjusted earnings"" or ""Non-GAAP earnings."" I prefer GAAP earnings as it adds back the expenses associated with stock awards, an essential part of compensation.On a net profit basis, Salesforce has not turned a profit, ever. For the coming year, Salesforce has guided to non-GAAP earnings of 99 cents per share. However, GAAP EPS guidance is a loss of 2 cents to 0 cents. That's correct, Salesforce essentially is guiding for another year of no profits for ordinary shareholders.Listening to management, I get the feeling that talking about these actual results is somehow frowned upon in the Salesforce community. ""It is not about current results, because we are investing for the future"" they seem to be saying. However, this has been the story for years. With growth now decelerating, improving margins becomes more urgent than ever. So why is Salesforce not cutting costs now that it has a substantial recurring client base? Surely, Salesforce management is operating the company in the best interest of shareholders?Part of the truth I believe lies in the competitive dynamics of this industry and the way incentives are structured for management. The SaaS CRM industry is dominated by a few large players (Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)), but is increasingly being targeted by a large number of smaller players presumably attracted by the growth rates in this space over the past few years. These new players seem to offer somewhat similar cloud based solutions at a significantly lower cost than Salesforce.As Salesforce essentially sells subscriptions with a typical duration of 12 to 36 months, the renewal rate is of crucial importance to them, as this is where they face ""leakage"" of customers to alternative providers. While the attrition rate so far has hovered around 10%, the question is how long they can keep it there with the current marketing and sales machinery in place, let alone if they would start cutting back on expenses in that area. That is why Salesforce has enormous marketing expenses and is spending substantial amounts on sales commissions and employee stock options, as these are critical in keeping the show going and the employees motivated.As a side note, stock awards and options is one item, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, but included in GAAP earnings. Salesforce has taken the position that it constitutes a long-term incentive and therefore does not affect the performance in any particular period and hence should be excluded from expenses. However, a quick glance at this item over the past 5 years shows that it is in fact recurring and growing and hence it seems to be part of the cost of doing business. It seems to me that in order to retain talent, Salesforce uses this as a part of the compensation package, and if it were to drop this expense, it would have to replace it with a cash salary or risk losing its employees.Here's a second reason why I believe management prefers to continue to invest heavily in growth rather than focus on improving current profitability. Let's say Salesforce would somehow dramatically improve profitability from 0% to a net margin of 10% over the next 2-3 years (unlikely, as competition will put intense downward pressure on prices), while growing revenues from the current 6.7 Billion USD to 10 Billion USD. That would then imply a net profit of 1 Billion USD, which would mean that 2 years into the future, Salesforce would sport a P/E of 50 based on current stock prices.Management knows that in order to achieve a net margin of this magnitude, it needs to slash costs and that would slow growth even further. Suddenly, the question of valuation becomes inescapable as the earnings announcements cannot get around the fact that growth is slowing while the sky-high valuation implies aggressive growth for the next 5-10 years. At the current valuation, Salesforce would need to quadruple its sales to get to a more reasonable Price to Sales ratio of 2.I do not believe in complicated financial forecasts when it comes to companies like Salesforce. My above approximation is not fancy, but it gives a feel for what needs to happen for Salesforce to escape a dramatic fall in market cap. Let us continue on the basis that Salesforce will be able to turn a 1 Billion USD profit in 2 years' time and let us assign a 20x P/E multiple to that (generous, as growth is unlikely to be more than 20% by that time).That gives us a valuation of 20 Billion USD 2 years from now. Now, let's take a discount rate of 15% (again, generous considering the risk associated with an investment like this). That gives us a valuation today of 15 Billion USD or a 70% downside from current prices. While it could turn out a little worse or a little better than the above scenario, I think this stock has run its course and investors that get in at current prices are setting themselves up for large losses.So why has the share price not fallen already?The vested interests in keeping the share price where it is or higher are huge. Institutional ownership is very high for this stock (over 85%) and most of the institutional investors cannot sell a substantial portion of their holdings without causing a price drop.Source: nasdaq.com ownership summary CRMI partly think institutional holders may be waiting for a stronger market to gradually offload shares. Another effect often at play is that institutions simply hold this because they track an index and they have to include it. However, as the price goes down, they need to sell to adjust their holding in a market cap weighted index leading to further share drops. This is a reflexive pattern that can continue for a while and often leads to an acceleration of the fall of a share price.The CEO is also one of the biggest shareholders. He has been selling down his stake for years, and at a rapid pace. It would be very disappointing for him indeed if the price at which he sells would fall from current levels and so all efforts are aimed at presenting Salesforce as the ultimate growth story. And that is why the earnings announcements focus on the rosy opportunities that lie in the future and on non-traditional measures of profit, not on current actual earnings.The following overview of insider buys versus sells is illustrative:Source: nasdaq.com ownership summary CRMThere is a transfer of wealth taking place here, in the form of employee stock being sold into the market, mostly to retail investors. The cost basis for employee stock is often very low, so for them selling at current prices makes sense as they lock in large profits and monetize part of their compensation. If you buy this stock as an investor today though, you are facilitating their exit, but at current valuations, your prospects of selling at increasingly higher prices appear to be dim.I advise shareholders of CRM to be careful. Try to visualize what you think Salesforce will look like a few years down the road and check your assumptions based on the fact that this is already a maturing, and increasingly competitive industry. Then come up with a valuation for what such a company realistically would be worth to you and compare that to the current valuation of the company.I look forward to hearing your thoughts on Salesforce's valuation in the comments section below, as I'm curious to gain insight into other investor's decision-making process.Over the next few months I will write reports on multiple large cap companies that I have identified as having an unusually large divergence between GAAP earnings and non-traditional measures, such as adjusted earnings and non-GAAP metrics.

In some cases, the market tends to crush the stocks which underperform even slightly on their earnings, while in some other cases, it is most generous as it anticipates huge profits in the far future even as the Company struggles to report profits in its current state. The latter often turns into a case-study of irrational exuberance.Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) recently reported its FY'16 and fourth-quarter 2016 earnings. Below are the key earnings highlights:Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO of salesforce, said,So yes, everything looks amazing for salesforce.com. The growth rate of CRM will put any and all fears of a global recession to rest. After all, the customer success platform has leading companies from across the globe as its clients.But as the list of positives continues to expand, investors need to become even more cautioned and focus on the finer details which may adversely affect the Company in the future. Nobody likes to be caught unawares in the stock market.Powerful Guidance, But Where Is The Profit?Why would you want to invest in a business, which boasts of strong business framework, market leadership but still struggles to report a profit. For Q4, the Company reported a GAAP loss per share of ($0.04) while for the full-year 2016, it reported a loss per share of ($0.07).However, the management seems hell-bent on enforcing in everybody's minds its profitable non-GAAP numbers. When you consider non-GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth-quarter, the number comes in at $0.19; a huge mark-up from the comparable GAAP data. For FY 2016, the non-GAAP diluted EPS is $0.75 against a loss of ($0.07) on GAAP basis. Here I would like to ask: Why at all have GAAP if companies are not even using them? Why believe the non-GAAP data when it can be distorted? I do not say it without basis.The data presented above has been taken from the Company's latest earnings. Upon a closer look, it can be seen that the management is using a relatively very-low tax rate in computation of its non-GAAP earnings which is boosting the data. For Q1 GAAP EPS, it expects a tax rate of 80% while for FY17 GAAP EPS, a tax rate of 105% can be expected. For its non-GAAP numbers, it suffices with a long-term projected tax rate of 35%. Fair?? I think not. Should it be higher? Definitely.The same data above also says that the Company does not expect to be profitable in 2017 as well on GAAP basis. The wait for the Company to report profitability has just been extended.Don't Be Too Impressed With Free Cash FlowIn my previous analysis on salesforce, Salesforce.com Cannot Defy Gravity Anymore, I discussed extensively why investors needed to understand the revenue structure and FCF of this Company. This time too, I wish to share the finding related to FCF.While the market goes gung-ho about the 58% YoY growth in FCF, the figure has been buoyed by the deferred revenue growth. But, we are still in the dark as to when the deferred revenue will actually be realized. As for the unbilled deferred revenue, the figure has been pumped to $7.1 billion, from $6.7 billion at the end of October 2015.The Company describes unbilled deferred revenue as the ""future billings under our non-cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue."" The Company has $7.1 billion worth of revenue tied up in contracts that are yet to be invoiced. The figure is consistently ballooning, and the shareholders are placing blind faith in the management, instead of asking for the record date of this revenue.I am waiting for the Company to release its Annual Report 2016 to obtain a better understanding of what the management intends to achieve, if not profitability. Will market leadership alone help in the long term, if there are no bucks to show? I don't think so."
3927176,83756,2016-02-24T23:00:08-05:00,salesforce's breathtaking revenue growth so far.The expectations built into the stock.A look at sales growth base rates.,"On Wednesday, salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) announced some rather astounding sales numbers. Namely, fiscal year 2016 revenues came in at $6.67 billion, representing a 26% year-over-year increase. In after-hours trading, the stock jumped roughly 8% to about $68 per share. Needless to say, the revenue performance at the business has been great in the recent past.Investors, however, must always remember that the performance of their investment (in stock) is determined by business performance as well as purchase price. Namely, it is important to understand what is already baked into the purchase price.The purpose of this article is to provide a simple framework for reverse-engineering some of these expectations and an objective way to assess the odds that these expectations will come to pass. I will illustrate this using the following assumptions:Implications of the assumptionssalesforce's current market capitalization (using a $68 per share price and 664 million shares outstanding) is about $45 billion. Compounding this at 10% for 10 years implies a market capitalization of $117 billion 10 years down the line. Under our assumptions, this is at a 3x revenue multiple, which yields revenue of $39 billion at the end of our 10-year period.Revenue for the most recent fiscal year was $6.67 billion. For this to grow to $39 billion over 10 years, sales need to grow at a rate of about 19% compounded annually.Base ratesLet me sum up what we have done so far. Under the assumption of a 3x terminal revenue multiple (which in itself has assumptions about net margins and future growth built in), for a buy-and-hold investor to realize a 10% compounded annual return on salesforce stock purchased at the current valuation, revenue must grow at the rate of 19% annually for the next 10 years.Thus, what remains to be done is to handicap the odds for this revenue growth rate. One way to do this is to do bottom-up research by evaluating the size of salesforce's addressable market, possible terminal penetration, speed of penetration (say, using past growth rates), etc. The problem with this method is that it is very subjective and prone to optimism and overconfidence bias. Moreover, it doesn't really give one an idea of the odds that are being dealt with.By far the most effective method to mitigate these issues is to ignore the individual case and look at the statistics of the class that the case belongs to. In other words, look at the percentage of companies in the past that have, from a base of about $7 billion, been able to grow sales at 19% or higher for 10 years. That is, examine the base rates.The following data is extracted from a Credit Suisse research note. The data is that of sales growth rates (in 2014 dollars) for companies in the S&P 1500 over a 21-year period from 1994 to 2014. For a revenue base in the range $6-13 billion and a 10-year period, there were a total of 1,251 data points, out of which only 51 were able to grow revenue greater than 15% annually (for ten years).Let me put it a different way. Based on past data/base rates, there is a 96% chance that salesforce will not be able to grow revenue at 15% (or higher) annually for the next 10 years. That is, there is a 96% chance that an investor buying now will realize a return less than 10% on the stock over the next 10 years.Parting thoughtsLet me emphasize that the above discussion is centered around certain assumptions. In particular, the terminal revenue multiple has a significant effect on the calculations. Moreover, different investors have different hurdle rates (the above discussion uses 10%).Readers should take the discussion and play with their own revenue multiples and hurdle rates to see what numbers they get. However, let me point out that a rational investor should very carefully analyze the choice of revenue multiple and the assumptions embedded in it. High revenue multiples have implicit optimistic growth rates or margins built in - so consider yourself forewarned!Personally, I think returns from salesforce will be sub-par over the next decade. Of course, readers might think they can ride the stock while the business delivers >20% growth rates and then dump it before the inevitable slowdown. Let me point out that this sort of dancing in and out ahead of the crowd is practically impossible to do consistently, and is more aptly labeled ""speculation"" rather than ""investing."""
3856596,98236,2016-02-02T13:33:34-05:00,"CRM shares off by more than 5% today on rumors of a significant customer loss in the last quarter.CRM shares are off by more than 18% since the start of 2016.Anecdotal checks suggest that Salesforce enjoyed another unusually strong quarter.I expect significant upsides in bookings, backlog, revenues end EPS compared to current consensus estimates.The company is continuing to develop strong sales momentum and to significantly expand its addressable market by enlarging its product footprint.","The shares of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) are down by 18% so far this year and they are down by 15% since I proclaimed it my best large cap idea for 2016. Not the best of recommendations, thus far.Obviously a piece of that performance is the market decline the first month of trading. And that decline has focused on names in tech that are considered to have high valuations and even more specifically focused on companies that sell cloud based solutions. Salesforce ticks all of those boxes and today the shares are under special pressure because of a rumor that the company has lost a large deal.At this point, with the books closed on the quarter, anecdotal checks have suggested to this writer that the company's Q4 that ended on January 31st, turned out to be a halcyon quarter overall for the company. Of course no one I chat with has global visibility and people who chat about the industry often have axes to grind, but I think the consensus I have heard is that Salesforce.com has enjoyed a truly remarkable quarter. I would be surprised if this company didn't lose some large deals. CRM is a big company now with an annual revenue run rate approaching $8 billion and at that size it is inevitable that the service they sell will displease some users and that some competitors will be particularly aggressive in pricing specific deals.That being said, I think that their results will show a very impressive list of wins including one of the largest if not the largest of the Telecom companies in central Europe, a number of banks both in this country and in Europe and a breakthrough deal in the regulated utility area that apparently displaced an installed and functioning SAP (SAP) installation. Unlike some of the other software vendors, I believe that business for CRM was strong in both their European and Asia/Pacific regions with over attainment spread around the globe.Another contributor recently published an article regarding CRM that focused on its cash flow and other sub-headline operating metrics. I tried to address some of those issues in the piece I wrote back early last month. Rapidly growing cloud companies are not going to generate lots of cash - and the more rapidly they grow the less cash they are going to generate. Like every other cloud vendor, CRM needs to build out lots of infrastructure and the higher the company's growth the more infrastructure it has to build. It would, I suppose, be happier for investors if the asset CRM has created, i.e. its service agreement and the associated infrastructure needed to execute the service agreement, was located higher up on the balance sheet as a receivable or better yet as cash. But the fact remains, from a financial perspective, CRM will be collecting rents off its operating assets for many years to come and its balance sheet is not a reflection of that phenomena. CRM has an asset base that is going to be able to generate cash for a decade-it will be able to produce far more cash as an installed service provider than many observers either credit or are willing to believe. CRM shares are not denying gravity at all; for cloud software companies gravity needs to be redefined.Looked at another way, it is my belief that CRM created lots and lots of assets last quarter and if that turns out to have hobbled reported cash flow it is a good thing-investors ought to want to see this company maximize ACV signings and to the best of my knowledge that is precisely what took place. Cash flow and particularly free cash flow, are simply not the appropriate way to analyze cloud software companies; if investors and observers feel the need to remain in denial of that point eventually the world will turn such that the validity of the observation will become evident.I think that the reasons for CRM's success are still not totally evident to many readers and investors. I tried to comment on the company's technology, and particularly on its multi-tenant architecture, in my prior report; some readers supported what I was trying to point out; others didn't. Multi-tenant architecture, however, is but one of the secret sauces offered by CRM.I think another point I ought to make is that the company has extended its footprint far beyond its roots in sales force management. Even users, apparently, do not appreciate the breadth of what Salesforce can offer these days and its sales training stresses its enterprise capabilities as well as the specific benefits of its particular solution offerings. No, it doesn't offer a full suite or anything like a suite of ERP applications. And there are users who believe strongly that buying integrated solutions is the right strategy. But over the years the company has simply extended its offering so that it really is not about just sales force any more. Its offering include what it describes as its Service Cloud, its Marketing Cloud, its Analytics Cloud and even offerings that are not really mainstream such as its Chatter and Community Cloud as well as nascent offerings for clouds such as that based on Internet of ThingsAnother key point to me is that I think many investors simply don't realize the extent to which many users are thrilled to consume a flexible service such as is offered by CRM and don't want to buy and own software. Because CRM offers its customers services, and not software, it is frequently in a position to achieve one month turn around between the time a user orders an installation and the time the installation is installed and starts to operate. It isn't as though there aren't situations in which owning software might not make sense for the particular circumstances of an individual user. On the other hand, one month installations of complex application software are unknown in the on-premise world.And finally something more intangible than the rest of the above factors is the company's flexibility and openness to new processes and new ways of doing business. CRM has the flexibility to negotiate large deals in weeks rather than months and is far easier to do business with, at least so far as I can determine, than its stack competitors. Most users really appreciate that in a software vendor and it is a hard culture to maintain.The company announced today that it had promoted its VP of Sales, Keith Block, to COO. Mundane, ordinary-perhaps but the fact is that after a long and successful career at Oracle, Mr. Block has instilled the best elements of that culture while retaining the factors that have made doing business with CRM unique.It is my belief that the 5% share price decline seen thus far today in the wake of rumors regarding the company's loss of a customer have set up an ideal situation and a favorable entry point for a trade or an investment. I would recommend taking advantage of the enhanced risk/rewards of the shares at current levels."
3827976,84276,2016-01-22T12:32:07-05:00,Salesforce.com continues to impress the market with a strong surge in revenues.Investors need to ask: How long before the company becomes profitable?Several points indicate that the stock may be a good exit at the current level.,"Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) has been scaling new heights consistently as the market rewards the company for posting phenomenal revenue numbers. Even as the overall market scenario turns ugly, the stock shows strong resilience as it trades at $69.50, off roughly 16% from its all-time high.But, for all the reasons discussed below, I'm ""extremely cautious"" on the stock. And investors, existing and potential, should look into these before they make their next investment decision pertaining to the world's fastest growing cloud enterprise.Salesforce's Free Cash Flow Needs To Be Understood WellThe market is being too generous toward the company which recently posted a FCF (quarterly) of $37.87M. I would totally understand if the market appreciated the stock following increasing FCFs. But the latest free cash flow figure is at a four-year low, and for a company like Salesforce, it is hard to call what the next figure will be.I have always believed that the market doesn't like uncertainty and tends to sell off in such circumstances. The bulls have indeed remained very patient, pushing the stock price higher and higher, but their patience and strength can be painfully tested in 2016.Another reason why I believe that the free cash flow figure may be hiding something is because the company states it as a non-GAAP measure. This gives the management an unwatched, uncontrolled liberty to distort figures. Also, the company has been forcefully focusing on non-GAAP data, stating that competitors also do it.For the quarterly period ended Oct. 31, the company's FCF figure was derived by omitting certain expenditures, which could have lowered the value by a big margin. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in its Fiscal 2016 Third Quarter Results states that,""The capital expenditures balance does not include our strategic investments, nor does it include any costs or activities related to our purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, and building in progress - leased facilities.""With this method of presentation, the company has the freedom to mark up or mark down the FCF data, which cannot be in the best interest of the stockholders.Management Fails to Provide Clarity on Deferred and Unbilled Deferred RevenueApart from the free cash flow figure, another thing that irks me regarding the management is how it keeps us in the dark about the deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue.The Company states,""We present constant currency information for deferred revenue, current and noncurrent to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations.""I must point out here that the market needs a time period for a fair and most accurate assessment of the business, and the management always keeps that part hidden.For the deferred revenue data shown in the image above (source: Q3FY16 Report), the statistic has been cleverly stated as current and non-current. Current normally refers to time periods of less than one year, so that is acceptable. But for the non-current deferred revenue data, I believe that investors would immensely benefit from a detailed revenue structure on the basis of time horizon.The company states unbilled deferred revenue as the ""future billings under our non-cancelable subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue."" While it lends comfort to some extent with the non-cancelable clause, it is still not helpful given that there is no information from management as to how far in the future this revenue goes. Therefore, investors and the market will never know when the unbilled deferred revenue will actually get recorded as deferred revenue, making it even harder to value the stock.Apart from business analysis stuff, this data also holds importance as the value has ballooned from $5BN in July 2014 to $6.7BN in October 2015. And going by the trend for the past several quarters, this value is unlikely to go down.Could it be a trap? It definitely could be.You Are Buying While the CEO is Selling His StockYes, you read that right. While the market is going gaga over the stock, the CEO and several leading officers have been using the buying frenzy to offload their shares.Upon taking a look at the latest SEC filings of the company under the Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership, we find that Marc Benioff (CEO), Maria Martinez (President, sales and customer success) and several other senior management officers are booking out of their common stock.If the biggest stakeholders in the company are consistently selling their claim, it is definitely a red flag for the investors.Conclusion - Exit or Stay AwayNo matter how you look at the above points, it is hard to form a positive view on the company. If understood completely, these points only make investors nervous about the future of the company which is unprofitable even after 15 years of existence.The argument for the non-profitable case can be that the company has been using the cash generated to expand, but investors need to quickly see some money before their patience runs out. They haven't been paid any cash dividends, and going by the management commentary, there won't be any for the foreseeable future as well.So, my best advice to investors would be to either exit the stock when they can or select other valuable stocks to put their money into. There are things, crucial things, which remain hidden from the general public. And such a story very rarely ends well."

Some of the obvious beneficiaries in those areas include names such as Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW), Tableau (NYSE:DATA), Cloudera (Private), Palentir (Private) and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) And I'm going to be fascinated to see how Nutanix (NTNX) does with its IPO as solid state storage continues to displace spinning discs in more applications. There are plenty of other trends that one might write about. I have little doubt that Hadoop will continue its penetration of the data base space and that Hortonworks (NASDAQ:HDP) will be a significant beneficiary. I recently wrote about the trends I see in natural language processing and how they are likely to affect growth at Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN). But if someone forced me to write about a single trend that is still overarching, and is still driving the most disruption in the industry, it would be the continued and accelerating trend toward cloud-based applications.I do not purport to be an industry analyst. There are plenty of able minds at Forrester and Gartner who put together incredibly detailed compendiums of trends within the IT space. But if you poll any sample of people engaged in trying to sell software at the start of 2016 they are going to tell you that this will be the year in which the large, enterprise class deployments go cloud across the board. And when investors look to ways to profit from cloud, the one name that has to leap to the top of any list is going to be Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM).CRM is one of those names about whom the adjective ""peerless"" actually is not hyperbole. It's 17-years-old at this point and it has accomplished as much in that brief time than as many far more established software vendors have been able to achieve. The fact is it invented a category and that it has been able to take that advantage to create loads of value for its shareholders and for its customers. And just as a confession - had you asked me when the company went public if it could ever grow to this magnitude I would have been more than a little doubtful.Just to give those unfamiliar with its accomplishment some basic idea of what the company has achieved here is a brief synopsis. In the 2010 fiscal year (CRM fiscal years end on January 31), CRM generated sales of $1.3 billion. Last year sales reached $5.4 billion and this year they are projected to reach $6.65 billion. Since FY 2010 earnings (non-GAAP) have ballooned from $80 million to $341 million in the last reported year. The company is forecasting non GAAP earnings of $505 million or $.75 in EPS this year, up almost 50% from the levels of fiscal year 2015. Operating cash flow also is on track to grow by close to 25% based on company guidance. It has actually grown to 37% year to date and it is significantly more than double non-GAAP EPS. In addition, unbilled deferred revenues, which is one of the principal components of the bookings metric, the most important proxy for growth at this company has also been projected to increase by at least 25% this year according to company guidance.Needless to say share price performance has come close to matching the exceptional growth in operating performance of this current fiscal year. The shares have increased just about 34% during 2015. Since the start of the decade the share price is up more than 4X. Forty-one analysts provide earnings estimates for the company in the current quarter and their average rating is 1.8 on a scale where 1 is a strong buy. On the other hand, the consensus price target for the shares is just $90 which is only 14% above current levels and which suggests some modest valuation contraction.I suppose under the above circumstances a few questions might be worthwhile posing. The biggest one of those is how are investors going to make money on this name when it has already enjoyed such a fabulous run of results and it's so well covered by admiring analysts. There also are going to be issues of the company's competitive differentiators going forward and of its unheralded growth opportunities. Simply put, it's my belief that the company projections are quite modest and that the company can continue to enjoy spectacular growth for another several years based on routinely unheralded competitive advantages and market place dynamics.Before the guffaws reach ear-shattering proportions, I really am aware of the law of large numbers. I am old enough to remember the tech bubble and I have the scars to prove it. I'm well aware of the adage that trees do not grow to heaven. And I have no belief that CRM is going to increase its revenues by another 5 times in the next six years. But I do think the company can at least triple its size - and perhaps grow a bit more than that - depending on acquisitions (it has made no fewer than 33 acquisitions in the last decade - the acquisition of ExacTarget is really the foundation of the Marketing Cloud offering and other acquisitions have substantially broadened the company's solution footprint) and it will almost surely enjoy dramatic increases in profitability as its installed base matures. Also, 20% compounded top line growth over the next six years...hmm, isn't that mighty ambitious? What kind of software company can enjoy that kind of growth as it approaches the $20 billion/year annual run-rate in revenues? It's important to note that in some regards CRM is still a relatively small company. Its revenues are projected to be $6.6 billion this current fiscal year (ends 1/31). By comparison, the two largest competitors that compete against CRM, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP), have revenues of $38 billion and $21 billion, respectively, and the overall market space is still enjoying mid to high single-digit growth. So, I really do believe that CRM is capable of growing at an average of 20%/year for several years to come with a terminal growth rate over that span probably still in the mid teens.And that brings up the inevitable issue of valuation. I will not spend a huge amount of time and electrons trying to prove that CRM is ""cheap."" It isn't if one uses traditional screens. Even using the non-GAAP EPS forecast of $.99 for the soon to be current fiscal year yields a P/E of over 100X. The EVS is much more reasonable at 6.5X but no bargain. By comparison, Oracle has a forward P/E of about 13X with an EV/S of 4.1X while SAP has a forward P/E of 19X and an EV/S of 4.4X.But consensus five-year earnings growth forecasts are expected to be about 8% for both SAP and Oracle and more than 30% for CRM - and as I will try to show I think the consensus earnings growth forecast for CRM is substantially under-estimated. I think that CRM is just now seeing the benefits of the operating leverage that is available in the wake of its recent rapid growth. I think that no one, myself included, is able to easily or accurately plot the leverage a company the scale of CRM will achieve as its installed base matures and renews its service subscriptions. As I will try to demonstrate a bit later, CRM has one of the ""stickiest"" customer bases in the world due to its software architecture. The consequence of that stickiness has yet to be really demonstrated in the company's income statement. Over the next several years, however, I think the benefits of renewals will start to propel reported EPS and cash flow at quite spectacular rates - far more than 30% at any rate. CRM is cheap in my estimation because its forward revenue forecast is too low and because its forward EPS forecast is much too low.CRM continues to enjoy several advantage over its traditional competitors - even those that now say they offer cloud-based software. This is not the time for a lengthy debate over the advantages of what is called multi-tenancy. Trying to describe the technology simply is a very slippery slope. But basically the heart of the Salesforce technology is what is known at an instance of the software can supply the needs of multi tenants. The data are stored in a shared database, but each client has access only to its own information. The entire application is described by what is known as metadata, instructions that describe various aspects of how the application works. Clients who want to customize the application they have bought can create and configure new metadata that describes new screens, database fields or desired behavior.Oracle does offer multi-tenancy in its 12C database. That being said, however, Oracle Cloud applications are not designed for multi-tenancy. They would have to be completely rewritten so that they would have totally new code bases to conform to what most consider multi-tenant status. That would be a really daunting task and one that would have a huge impact on the cost of Oracle support  - for Oracle, not for its customers. SAP uses a single tenant model in which each client has its own instance of software that can be configured through metadata or other means. A single tenant model is going to inevitably be much more expensive and time consuming to customize which might be fine for companies such as SAP and Oracle that essentially sell software in order to win support contracts. Users on the other hand, when they understand the difference, are typically much happier to subscribe to a service than to buy software and that has been and remains the competitive differentiator between CRM and its traditional competitors.Another telling advantage that CRM has is that it's simply not all things to all people. There has been and probably always will be on-going debates in the software world about the advantages of best of breed when compared to some kind of unified and integrated solution. At one time the advantages to an integrated solution were significant enough such that most large users were willing to give up some functionality and some degree of competitive differentiation when they implemented customer facing software in order to buy software that always looked the same and which would be somewhat familiar to users in different divisions and different functional organizations. GE (NYSE:GE) is a primary example of such a customer. Even today GE will buy just about anything that Oracle sells. If Oracle's new products are not exactly the functionality that GE has looking for, the corporate dicta has been that functionality is less important than software integration.While over the years CRM has become more and more mainstream, many of the largest potential users have held out against wide adoption of enterprise applications from CRM just because it does not offer tightly integrated solutions in all the software categories large companies need to implement. We have reason to believe that the tipping point has been reached in this long debate and indeed we expect the next several quarters at CRM will be marked by an increasing number of super-size deals that prove that multi-tenant architecture is becoming a telling competitive advantage for the company and that having a significant number of best of breed solutions - these days it has six different clouds - gives users the comfort they need to buy enterprise deals from CRM and ignore some of the so-called advantages of integrated solution suites.Another growing competitive opportunity for CRM is the increased verticalization of its offerings. Almost all software companies of any size say that they have tailored their applications for specific industry verticals - the amount of that verticalization typically is correlated with the size of the opportunity. The multi-tenant architecture that is the heart of the CRM technology stack makes it far easier for CRM and its developer/partners to create applications that are optimized for the use of a single vertical. Perhaps the least heralded of the advantages that CRM has been able to exploit is what it calls Force.com which is a platform as a service (PaaS) offering that allows developers to create multi-tenant add-on applications that easily integrate into the main Salesforce.com application. Obviously other large vendors such as Oracle and SAP offer PaaS capability - it is easy to see, however, why multi-tenant architecture makes life far simpler for developers who have embraced the Force platform and are now using a tool called ""Lightning."" Lightning is now in the public domain so that customers and developers can rapidly build applications for responsive web interfaces.One of the benefits of the CRM architecture for users is that it requires far less in the way of professional services than is the case for implementing almost any other competitive software - even the offerings from SAP and Oracle that are called cloud but are really more hosted. CRM gets a bit less than 7% of its revenues from professional services. By comparison Oracle derives something over 10% of its total revenues from professional services  - while that is not intended to be an apples to apples comparison it does suggest that it costs far more to implement and customize Oracle products than is the case for CRM. Based on what I know, I assume that CRM's consulting partner revenues also are far below those of its large integrated application competitors but there is no way anyone can possible view those numbers.Suffice it to say, I think that multi-tenancy and its adjuncts remain a significant competitive differentiator for CRM. I think that large users, despite the passage of lots of time, are just now coming to appreciate the benefits that multi-tenancy and its corollary product structure means for the efficiency and cost of their own applications, and that despite the fact that both Oracle and SAP are trumpeting their own presence in the cloud, CRM will continue to enjoy significant advantages in competing with those companies for at least another five years and probably more than that.The other factor that I would stress to investors is that CRM is at or close to an inflection point where its reported earnings start to benefit tremendously from the renewal of its installed base. At some level, the SaaS financial model is likely to be incredibly profitable for the vendors. One comment that was made long ago by Larry Ellison of Oracle is that the CRM architecture is like a roach motel  - it is easy to check in but impossible to check out. While not wanting to debate the point it is obvious that because of the multi-tenant architecture that CRM uses it is very difficult for enterprises to ever migrate their data from the CRM platform. This means that renewal rates for CRM are likely to remain in the mid 90% range and as the average age of its installed base rises, both gross margins and net operating margins are going to significantly escalate, in my opinion. Analysts are currently estimating that revenues will grow by less than 22% in fiscal year 2017 but the earnings growth estimate is for 32%. A lot of that is going to relate to the maturation and renewal of the company's installed base regardless of the actual growth in the company's base of live customers.To sum it all up, I think CRM has multiple competitive advantages based on its multi-tenant architecture. I think these advantages are of sufficient magnitude to enable the company to continue to take market share from its principal application competitors, SAP and Oracle. I think as the company exploits both its PaaS business opportunity and new vertical opportunities in its installed base it will be able to grow substantially faster than its current 22% target. In the past 90 days, EPS estimates have grown by 4%. I think that next year's $.99 estimate will be exceeded by 10% or more while its revenue growth estimate and its billings growth estimates will both be significantly exceeded as well.CRM's share price has enjoyed strong performance in 2015 in the context of a flat market. I think it will continue to handily outperform the average of its peers in 2016 and years to come."
3721096,69645,2015-11-30T13:49:38-05:00,Salesforce.com's recent earnings show the moat the company is starting to create compared to other cloud service providers.The company's ancillary businesses such as ServiceCloud will continue to propel the company's revenue surpassing targets.Our price target on the stock over the next six months is $90.,"As a global SaaS applications provider, Salesforce.com's (NYSE: CRM) revenue growth continues to outpace the overall market for cloud application spending as results for its third quarter of fiscal 2016 came in slightly ahead of internal forecasts. The company saw strong operating results over the past quarter, with 24% revenue growth and the company looks for revenue to increase 20%-22% in 2017 over 2016 projections. Concomitantly, results showed modest operating leverage despite continued heavy investments in customer acquisition and product development. Salesforce.com's leading position within the cloud services and applications market is a large reason why the company has a wide moat as not only sales organizations continue to utilize the platform but as the company starts to enter the financial services communications and compliance fields.Salesforce.com runs a very attractive business model through the cloud as subscription-based applications and information services will be the future of information technology and the ""Internet of Things"" as organizations continue to control their data off premise. Subscription revenue (93% of total revenue) grew 24% vs. the prior year to $1.6 billion. The service cloud, marketing cloud and platform segments grew at a combined rate of 37%, taking over the mantle of growth from the maturing sales cloud, which grew at a comparatively modest 10%. Under our estimates, Salesforce has been a catalyst for enterprises shifting spending toward cloud applications. Moreover, as the revenue mix continues to tilt more heavily toward large enterprises, the model will benefit from a low churn rate (9% in the quarter), which we expect to decline even further over time. As cloud products from competitors such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) catch up to Salesforce, price competition alone will not be enough to pry customers away from Salesforce.We are encouraged by the operating leverage in the quarter, particularly as revenue growth continues to be north of 20%. Because many expenses (for example, customer acquisition costs) are recognized up front while revenue is recognized ratably, operating leverage will accelerate more quickly when revenue growth slows. Non-GAAP operating margins expanded 221 basis points to 13.3%. We are encouraged that management is able to streamline operations without compromising top-line growth. The long-term model still calls for operating margins to reach the mid-30s as revenue growth stabilizes.The company operates as best in class with EPS growth expected to grow over 30% over the next five years and gross margins north of 75%, one of the best within the cloud market. Sales the past five years have grown over 32% and the ubiquity of their services throughout the world's largest multinationals is unparalleled. Technically speaking, the company is in sound footing with the stock being 1.66% above its 20-day MA, 4.89% above its 50-day MA and 11.95% above its 200-day MA. The company was recently a product of a wedge up formation in a tight trading pattern but recently broke out of that pattern due to impressive earnings results. We will have to wait and see where the stock progresses to over the next six months (see figure 1).Figure 1Our fund estimates a price target for the company at $90 and there is no reason why this company cannot exceed excess returns on capital for the next 20 years. We are increasing our fair value estimate to $90 from $70 to account for an increase in moat rating and consistency of gross margins. We project a 18.5% CAGR over the next five years as the firm gains share in the customer service segment of the CRM market while continuing to increase its share of the automation market. There also is the growth of ServiceCloud, a customer support system all through the cloud, priced at a very high premium given the technology, giving Salesforce.com excellent positioning among premium cloud providers. Adoption of Force.com and related services also should boost revenue growth while contributing to improved customer retention. Operating margins will remain depressed in the near term as management continues to invest in a larger sales force to drive growth. Margins will resume expanding once the sales force stabilizes and should reach the high-20s during the next seven years as a wider suite of services reduces customer attrition and the firm gains scale in selling and administrative expenses. Returns on invested capital and return on equity should rise in line with operating margins, enabling the company to comfortably exceed its cost of capital. Revenue contribution from new products also should be a positive for the firm's longer-term growth rate. In particular, our fund is encouraged by the fact that the firm has four cloud products that generated more than $500 million revenue last year. We also are optimistic about the company's newest product, the Analytics cloud, which was launched at the Dreamforce event in late 2014.HeadwindsSalesforce.com faces several risks as it attempts to diversify into new revenue streams. The opportunity to sell marketing solutions in the cloud may be substantially smaller than what management and we believe. There is also concern that the premiums associated with ServiceCloud cannot be maintained given new entrants within the cloud around professional services. Additionally, companies looking to deploy PaaS solutions may look to larger, more established companies with a more robust infrastructure, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Finally, traditional on-premise enterprise companies such as Oracle, HP (NYSE:HPQ), Dell and SAP (NYSE:SAP) are embracing cloud technology and business models, diminishing Salesforce.com's first-mover advantage.Quality ManagementCo-founder Marc Benioff has served as CEO since 2001 and chairman of the board since the company's founding in 1999. Previously, Benioff worked in sales, marketing and product development roles for 13 years at Oracle. Overall, the interests of management, directors and shareholders are aligned.With respect to capital allocation, the firm has been quite prudent, investing heavily in sales and marketing to support revenue growth that we believe enhanced return on capital. Furthermore, management has often chosen to forgo near-term accounting profitability in favor of higher spending that, we believe, generates excess shareholder returns.We continue to have a positive view of Salesforce.com's historical capital allocation with respect to its ongoing business, and we are less cautious than we have been previously about the firm's acquisitions. Over the past several years, the firm has spent more than $3 billion on acquisitions, using a combination of cash and stock. In particular, some of these acquisitions are supporting the company's aggressive push of its Marketing Cloud products, particularly with its $2.5 million purchase of ExactTarget which has become the foundation of the company's Marketing Cloud. While some of these initiatives may be delaying profits, we believe the integrated product strategy is likely to make Salesforce.com the most significant provider of cloud products for the foreseeable future.Figure 2Our price target as indicated earlier is $90 for the next six months with our yearly target near $97. Continued growth will continue to propel Salesforce.com higher and despite continued operating losses, we believe these investments will launch the company to new highs. Our fund is long CRM."
3711586,66283,2015-11-24T17:56:14-05:00,Salesforce continues its dominance in the latest quarter and is a stock to own.The company's efforts on reducing costs and increasing profits is extremely admirable.We like adding a small position and averaging down on dips.,"OverviewToday, we want to take a refreshed look at Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) after its Q3FY2016 earnings report. Our last look took place in September after its last round of earnings, and we want to examine our thesis for this FY as well as update our pricing model with any changes. We will start by reviewing the latest earnings report, revisit our FY2016 catalysts, and update our bull/bear case.Our thesis for the company has been that this FY was clearly to begin a shift from the high-growth environment where top-line revenue growth was crucial to a more mature business that begins to focus on the bottom line more, create more profits, and consistent, sustained growth. That evolution is crucial, we believe, to the company being able to really make its way to a long-term investment. Yet, valuations have still been too rich for us. Price/book was at 12x when we first started investigating, came down to 10.5x in the last article, and is now at 11.3x after the stock has risen nearly 25% in the last three months.Earnings AnalysisThe company's latest report was a solid beat. Revenue came in at $1.7B, beating expectations with a non-GAAP $0.21 EPS versus $0.19 expectations. One of the best signs was a 24% revenue gain, and the company continues to click. In our last article, we admitted:The other really great sign was the company raising its guidance once again. The company has made it a habit over the last couple quarters of continuing to up its guidance. Here was CEO Benioff on the increase in the latest call:With that revenue, the company would grow by another 20-22% next year...incredible. The company continues to be an excellent source of growth, but as we have noted previously, we are more intrigued by CRM starting to turn all this growth and revenue into some bottom-line benefits.How Did The Company Do On Its Profits?Salesforce executed its best GAAP operating income with over $40M in the latest quarter, and the company has made three consecutive quarters of positive operating income. Here was the company on the success of not only turning strong growth, but also turning profits:One of the biggest improvements is to see SG&A drop as a part of revenue. The cost of doing business has been a criticism of Salesforce because the company has paid a lot to get its revenue. Two years ago, the company was at 66%, 60% in the last quarter, and in the latest quarter, that number was down, below 59%. It continues to move in the right direction. The rate at which operating costs grew was 16%, in line with the previous quarter and being outpaced by revenue again.The company also is seeing a lot of improvement in the type of revenue it is seeing with more and more deferred revenue, which is a much healthier type of revenue stream. That growth was at nearly 30%, beating the 29% from the year prior and coming in at nearly $3B.Right now, we like that the company is keeping costs in check in relation to sales, and that trend is very positive, especially considering that we know competition is clipping on its heels.Let's turn to reviewing out thesis for Salesforce for this fiscal year.Thesis ReviewTo start, let's take a review of our FY2016 outlook for Salesforce. As noted, my thesis for CRM revolves around the idea that the company has begin to make a shift in the past few quarters with a lot more conversation coming from the company and CEO Benioff noting the bottom line is becoming more important. We believe that this shift will reinvigorate the company (and that has already happened this year along with continued growth at a faster pace than we expected). The combination of revenue strength and profit strength will develop a very strong message for this company and attract investors of many different types.As we have noted:To put things in perspective for investors, revenue growth is expected to come in at 23-24% this year now. How does that compare to the last few years? 2011-2014 revenue growth was 37%, 35%, 33%, and 32%. Growth slowing down is definitely not a bad thing necessarily as long as the company can begin to show profitability. Growth has been better than many expected it would be in 2015, but the company still is generally slowing down in what type of top-line growth is possible. Comps get harder is one, and as those comps grow, it is naturally harder to make significant revenue growth. That is not all a bad thing as the company will still have the ability to grow, but we believe as those comps slow, investors will start to focus more on profits.In the TTM, the company is for the first time clipping with a positive operating income at $60M, and while it still has a long way to go to get a GAAP operating margin that is of anything decent, it is on the right track. As we saw in the latest quarter though, costs are not rising with revenues any longer. The company continues to see positive margin growth, and we believe that this is really intriguing for a catalyst to continue to propel the company's value.As CFO Hawkins noted:The other major factor that we noted to watch for in the FY is the ability to start to create a more diversified revenue stream. So far, the company's SaaS business has been the dominant revenue maker, but the company has invested into a lot of other products. The one that we are most interested in is the Analytics Cloud, which is a major development in big data for the company to offer to its users.As we noted previously:Salesforce is pushing to create a business ecosystem that can overlay on the CRM base and create a significant SaaS environment that can interconnect products, beat competition, and make them more powerful. The Analytics Cloud makes this very interesting for CRM. What we like best about Analytics is that the system rounds out its business. This exchange between Benioff and an anyalyst in the latest call spells out how we see this:What we like about where Salesforce is going is that it is pushing into a business ecosystem over just being a crafty, useful CRM product. Where we see it going is to create an economic moat by integrating a series of in-house products that connect data to sales to project management. This strategy should derive back to the money makers for the company a la Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). We also really like that the company is doing both structured and unstructured, which is a nice advantage (if they can pull it off) because most are focusing on one type or the other.Conclusion - The Bull Case And The Bear CaseTo us, our bull and bear case remain the same right now. The company's business life cycle is starting to shift and mature, yet, the company's need to generate profits to properly mature as a stock as well. As revenue growth declines, the investor type will shift, and CRM will need to prove that the company that represents the future of tech can also represent meaningful profits. Otherwise, it will remain outside the conservative investor's gaze, which will keep things in check once we start to see revenue dip below the 20%+ levels. In the last report, we questioned, though, if the strength of the company's earnings justified 76x future earnings, 8x sales, and 10.5x book value. Now, we are looking at 82x, 8.5x, and 11.3x.To me, these levels are still so expensive to invest. The company's strength is undeniable, but does that strength translate into long-term stock returns if I buy today?Last report, we wanted to wait and see, and missed on 25% of gains. We continue to believe that the company is very expensive to buy, but it continues to perform at an amazing clip that cannot be denied. Starting a small position and averaging in on dips would make it very interesting. We believe any dip of 10% or more would be a must buy for this stock."
3698556,24663,2015-11-19T09:08:22-05:00,"MSFT, SAP, and ORCL had the chance to buy CRM earlier this year for what seemed like a pricey $50 billion.After CRM's fiscal third quarter and outlook, CRM's valuation has now well surpassed that level.There's a good chance that CRM will keep going higher.","Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported fiscal third quarter earnings and provided fourth quarter guidance that shattered expectations. Its stock then jumped almost 6% to new highs, thereby giving the company an implied market capitalization of $53.5 billion.Of all the many things that investors can take from both Salesforce.com's performance and its stock reaction, the biggest takeaway for me is that big tech was dead wrong about the company.$50 billion proves to be cheap for Salesforce.comBack in the first quarter of this year Salesforce.com was at the epicenter of M&A speculation, with reports that several of the technology sector's elite was willing to dish out $50 billion for the company. However, big tech quickly nipped that in the bud, with SAP's (NYSE:SAP) management saying the acquisition would not happen because ""of the valuation of the company.""Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) CFO went so far as to say that if a competitor were to acquire Salesforce.com, ""it would be helpful to us."" And lastly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also reportedly saw the company as just too expensive.While these remarks all seemed negative for Salesforce.com at the time, it does appear that Salesforce.com is quickly getting the last laugh. Furthermore, if its current trajectory continues, there's a good chance it will become even more valuable.Why Salesforce.com could become even more valuableThe reason is because Salesforce.com continues to execute and thrive in the near $25 billion customer relationship management, or CRM, market. Actually, Salesforce.com dominates the $11 billion of this $25 billion market that is created from software-as-a-service, or SaaS, applications. By 2018, this will be a $20 billion market according to Gartner, or approximately 40% of the expected $50 billion that the SaaS enterprise application market will generate by 2018.Nevertheless, Salesforce.com is taking the SaaS and CRM market by storm, and continues to grab market share while the rate at which on-premise CRM solutions transition to SaaS-based applications accelerates. In Salesforce.com's third quarter, the company continued to grab share as revenue soared 24% in an overall on-premise and cloud CRM market with low double digit growth.Furthermore, Salesforce.com entered new businesses that could accelerate its market share gains even faster. The company recently launched cloud software services aimed directly at the healthcare and financial industries, thereby showing how Salesforce.com still has room to penetrate new markets with the cloud despite being on pace to achieve record revenue of $8.1 billion for this fiscal year, ended February.All things considered, the future is bright for Salesforce.com in a fast-growing industry with the highest market share. While Salesforce.com does have competitors in the SaaS-based CRM market with Oracle and SAP, those two companies grew CRM revenue just 2.6% and 7.2% year-over-year last year, respectively.Given how quickly on-premise IT and business solutions are moving to the cloud, and the fact that SaaS remains the largest segment of the cloud, one might conclude that Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP passed up a golden opportunity to grab a market leader in what looks to be a very promising industry. Fortunately, their loss is your gain, as Salesforce.com stock is now in uncharted territory and looks poised to trade significantly higher as shareholder sentiment remains high and its business prospects have never been better."
3539536,66283,2015-09-29T09:41:43-04:00,"Salesforce had another impressive quarter of earnings growth, margin focus, and new product expansion.The strong valuations on Salesforce continue to make me question an investment, but the company's dominance and maturing continues to be intriguing.Right now, we want to see some drop of 5-10% to add a new position.","OverviewWe reviewed Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in May again, and we wanted to revisit the company after its last round of earnings in August as well as other developments have occurred. Our thesis on CRM has been that the company is no longer the exciting high-growth tech name (in the eyes of investors) and is turning into a more mature tech business with less erratic growth and more attention turned towards creating profits and sustained growth. When we last looked at the company price/book was around 12x, and we believed that valuation was too high. Price/book has come down to 10.5x.Today, we are looking to review our overall company thesis and assess that in the terms of their last round of earnings.Thesis ReviewTo start, let's take a review of our FY2016 outlook for Salesforce.As noted, my thesis for CRM revolves around the idea that the company has begin to make a shift in the past few quarters with a lot more conversation coming from the company and CEO Benioff noting the bottom line is becoming more important.As we noted:To put things in perspective for investors, revenue growth is expected to come in at 22-23% this year. How does that compare to the last few years? 2011-2014 revenue growth was 37%, 35%, 33%, and 32%. Growth slowing down is definitely not a bad thing necessarily as long as the company can begin to show profitability. They are the right track for sure. The company's operating margin in the TTM is nearly breakeven, and it is at the highest level it has been at since 2011.As Benioff has noted:The other major factor that we noted to watch for in the FY is the ability to start to create a more diversified revenue stream. So far, the company's SaaS business has been the dominant revenue maker, but the company has invested into a lot of other products. The one that we are most interested in is the Analytics Cloud, which is a major development in big data for the company to offer to its users.As we noted previously:What we like about where Salesforce is going is that they are pushing into a business ecosystem over just being a crafty, useful CRM product. Where we see them going is to create an economic moat by integrating a series of in-house products that connect data to sales to project management. This strategy should derive back to the money makers for the company a la Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). We also really like that the company is doing both structured and unstructured, which is a nice advantage (if they can pull it off) because most are focusing on one type or the other.The final focus area for FY16 has to be the continue rising competition for the company. Everyone from Microsoft to IBM want to have a bigger piece of the cloud computing and CRM product world. As CRM products that are cloud-based have become an integral part of nearly every business, CRM has a pipeline to cloud-based products of many sorts. Competition has realized this and moved quickly to move against them. What we have seen, as a result for CRM, is that the cost of Marketing and Sales has risen extensively.In the latest earnings call, the company was asked about this topic from Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse:This comment echoes what we are seeing from the company in that they are spending/investing heavily to keep their products top-notch, battle competition, and also keep earnings in focus. That comment, to me, is really a microcosm of the company right now.As we take a look at earnings and recent news, we want to look at these key factors for our investigation.Earnings UpdateThe company's last round of earnings were once again pretty strong. They beat on earnings and revenue again and saw revenue growth of around 24% year/year. Revenue came in at $16.B, and the company raised its outlook for revenue to $6.6B. The company continues to be unprofitable in GAAP accounting, but overall the quarter was pretty strong. Deferred revenue growth was at 29%, which is a solid rate in comparison to actual growth. The Marketing Cloud saw a really strong push in the last quarter with twice as many deals as the previous year. The Service Cloud grew 40% year/year, and it is becoming another great add-on to the CRM/sales focus.How about the earnings movement for the company?The company turned an actual operating profit last quarter of $33M in GAAP accounting. In this quarter, the company noted a 170 basis point increase for non-GAAP operating margin. In GAAP, the company came in at $20M. Back-to-back quarters of true operating earnings are definitely exciting to see. A positive sign is to see the SG&A costs continuing to drop. SG&A is down to nearly 60% of revenue, which is significantly lower than previous levels. Two years ago the company was clicking at 66%. Dropping that SG&A or at least having grow at a lower rate than revenue growth is crucial to getting that bottom line where investors will want it.One of the best signs of attention to profits and pushing for positive and growing ROIC was that the company's growth of marketing and sales was only 18%. The company saw a 15% jump in those operating costs last quarter, and they moved to 16% in the past quarter. That rate, though, was not as strong as their 23% jump in overall revenue. Again, no part of operating costs outpaced revenue growth - a positive sign for a company that's moving towards maturity.The company's stronger than expected growth is pretty positive as the comps the company is coming up against are strong and they continue to outperform. The deferred revenue growth also is quite impressive as another 29% jump in revenues that will likely be on the books is a positive trend. That level outpaced the previous quarter's growth of 25%. Some analysts take this number to mean too much, but if it's trending up, not down, it will mean more future business, not less (and that's a good thing).Right now, we like that the company is keeping costs in check in relation to sales, and that trend is very positive, especially considering that we know competition is clipping on its heels.The next area of focus for us is the Analytics division. While Service and Marketing are really clicking and creating a lot of value, I believe that data analytics can push the company into a completely different realm and interconnect these products into a winning ecosystem.Here were some comments on it during the latest earnings call:The company still is not breaking out performance numbers for Analytics for now, but it is looking at least anecdotally very strong. We would like to see some break out on this product, but things so far seem very beneficial. The company is integrating the product with other services as well as other technologies, and overall, analytics will definitely be an interesting driver moving forward. More exact numbers rather than ""cheerleading"" will help our assessment though.It was a strong earnings report that seems to show the company performing at a high level and delivering on a lot of key areas. Competition is rising, but the company's analytics combination is going to be a very beneficial aspect of their business that we believe will help them continue to grow.Conclusion - The Bull Case and The Bear CaseTo us, our bull and bear case remain the same right now. The company's business life cycle is starting to shift and mature. Yet, the company's need to generate profits is crucial to generating free cash flow, which is how the company can be judged. We believe the company has a lot of upside if they can start to produce some earnings growth, but right now, revenue and investment is looking very good. The question for investors is that right now you still have to pay 76x future earnings, 8x sales, and 10.5x book value. To me, that is still quite expensive, but this is really one of the most interesting companies in the industry today. The strength of the company is undeniable, but does that strength translate into long-term stock returns if I buy today?22% YTD return versus a market that is not pleasant is one of those signs of the strength of this company. The more time I spend looking at their strength and the ecosystem they are building, the more I like it. I'd like to see one or two more quarters of operating costs dropping in relation to sales as well as some more actual numbers in Analytics.Overall, though, I may be intrigued by adding a small position on the next drop of 5-10% as the company's dominance and excitement looks really great still as they are seamlessly moving from tech baby to tech giant."
3511246,48411,2015-09-15T11:38:55-04:00,Salesforce.com is out with news that it has greatly expanded its Analytics Cloud flexibility when it comes to total platform optionality.This move allows it to catch up to competitors but also will continue to make its product ecosystem one that captures and retains - a good move overall.I'm bullish this news and see this seemingly minor update being reflected in the financials in the immediate term.,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is out with news that it has greatly expanded its Analytics Cloud flexibility when it comes to total platform optionality. That's right, Salesforce is deploying its Analytics Cloud - to this point essentially a stand-alone BI, across its entire model and infrastructure and it's doing it in ways that it hasn't before. Salesforce is looking to create more of a model overlay out of its BI solution rather than a secondary platform app that requires platform switching and translation of data inputs. I think this is going to be meaningful to the Salesforce model in several ways but mostly in that this will establish its BI as much more of a useful tool and it will make more apparent the value prop of what is actually a really effective tool within the Salesforce umbrella. Both matter.So, it's not hard to understand why Salesforce wanted to do this. In fact, really Salesforce had to do this. As much as this was an offensive move, and I'll get to that, this was most definitely a defensive move as well. Maybe this was defensive primarily. First, Salesforce was behind competitors in fully integrating its BI across its platform. Most notably (as of late) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been able to establish the overwhelming value of its young BI solution, Power BI, as it focused equally as much on how the BI fits the total productivity platform ecosystem versus how to create a useful BI solution. What use is BI if the use cases are being limited by the BI being relegated to an inconvenience? I mean, it's not like having a BI in a secondary window is the end of the world but it's just so much easier when you can have BI dashboard and BI tech integrated into the platform already being used.So that part isn't hard to understand. Salesforce did this because it just makes sense. Its entire platform now becomes much easier to use and much more useful - again, both matter. With this integration it's now possible to overlay dashboards from the Analytics Cloud into other parts of product umbrella, and new ""Wave Actions"" allow users to be actionable on dashboards according to the outcome being addressed and/or moved along. Basically, in an example given from Salesforce - if a manager finds that his or her team has a retention issues within a specific account he or she can assign tasks/new reps/extra care to the accounts from within the exact same app in which he or she found the issues (via data filtration and analysis). Yes, prior to the recent update this wasn't able to be done. Once assigned, the actions can be engaged with outside the Analytics Cloud platform from other platform arms. So Salesforce is effectively created an easier ""transaction window"" for its entire platform and the Analytics Cloud.In that sense, the update to the total platform will be offensive for Salesforce. Salesforce, maybe more so than any other company currently - although Microsoft, as noted, is catching up quickly, has done well to make sure that its product ecosystem is always a two plus two equals five value prop. Put simply, it's always been more helpful to be totally immersed within the product ecosystem than to use Salesforce as a point solution provider within a broader sales-focused productivity suite. Of course this has done well to saturate customers in Salesforce product and with that to trap customers within the Salesforce ecosystem (Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) does this really well from a non-enterprise standpoint). In addition to retention bump and the barrier to exit created the fairly consistent ARPU lift that comes from this expression of the ecosystem value prop hasn't been harmful to Salesforce financials either, to say the least. This only furthers that. What essentially every data/BI player in the game has shown (have you seen the growth rates at the BI pure plays Tableau (NYSE:DATA) and Qlik (NASDAQ:QLIK)?) is that more BI equals more happiness which equals accelerated growth rates on better retention. What part of that equation doesn't deserve a Nobel Prize in economics/equity price management?As Salesforce can better express its ability to make ""smart suggestions"" via its BI uncovering needles within the haystack I only see it embellishing what it's already doing well. I think this was a natural and fluid move for the company and one that should be immediately, as in within the next two quarters, reflected in the key metrics. Expect overall financials to get a bump from increased product saturation as well as greater retention. I think a tertiary benefit of making the BI 1) more visible overall and 2) more value-prop visible is that more seats will be sold for BI. Users don't know what they need until they're shown and I think this does exactly that, it will show more users the way. So overall while this might have seemed like an obvious move, my guess is this was customer suggestion/complaint driven, it's a move that will bring quite a bit to the table for Salesforce none the less.Good luck everybody."
3487606,48411,2015-09-03T10:05:27-04:00,Salesforce.com has acquired private market digital experience and engagement consulting firm AKTA.This is on the heels of several recent consulting-focused acquisitions that in particular have a focus on mobile.Is Salesforce simply being defensive or is the company looking to launch a new vertical?,"What is Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) doing with its most recent acquisition of AKTA - a Chicago based digital experience and engagement consultancy firm? Salesforce, which isn't really in the consulting scene and wouldn't traditionally be thought of as an acquirer, at least not in my opinion, isn't disclosing terms of the acquisition but my guess is it paid a pretty multiple for the takeout. I know that in this space, at least based on comparable private side transactions - even despite the go-public market opportunities slowing/being less lucrative, that multiples have been to the high end and bordering on extreme. So with that in mind, what is Salesforce doing?I think that Salesforce is looking to create an in-house mobile consulting vertical and I think that it has been quietly getting aggressive with this endeavor as of late. If it isn't thinking about launching a separate vertical, which it should be, it's definitely looking to beef up its in-house capacity for consulting. The capacity beef-up is for sure mobile-focused for obvious reasons. Salesforce, being smart and being a leader, realizes that being able to provide design and development expertise for enterprise (and maybe SMB here in the near term) is becoming more of an expectation than it is a luxury.The AKTA acquisition comes close on the heels of acquisitions for smart-tech companies Kerensen Consulting - the company provides business consulting, cloud solution management and digital customer experience services, Toopher - a startup that developed a mobile app for two-factor authentication that people can use to successfully log in to web services, and Tempo - a smart calendar provider. All of this recent activity can't simply be a coincidence considering the company's noticeable absence of activity for the niche dating back to a few years prior to its last acquisition in 2011 of Model Metrics.So, these moves could be looked at as Salesforce taking a defensive posture to a potential mid-term threat. In that case, I view the spending as positive as I think that defending market share and obsolescence is always a good thing. But again, I don't think Salesforce ever does anything strictly from its back foot. I have to believe that the recent rapid fire M&A has to be offensive as well. Yes, Salesforce has its always searching, always partnering Salesforce Ventures arm but I read this as more than simply a venture extension. I just think that Salesforce is seeing some real commoditization of its core platform CRM, if you can call that its core platform anymore, and that it wants to breakout a heavier core weighting to analytics and consulting. The acquisition spree will help with that. Kerensen is a big factor that I'm considering in my overall thesis here especially when coupled with Salesforce's marketing focus for the Salesforce Analytics Cloud.I could see Salesforce deploying or at least testing a new service, which it might not even brand in the early going, in Europe or in small pockets of its enterprise book to test take rate and pricing. While speculative, this could be the beginning of something big. If Salesforce decides to go the other direction and use these companies as drop-in tech or model overlays to existing platforms that's not exactly a bad thing either. Again, Salesforce has been aggressive in buying some best of breed new-tech (Kerensen isn't new-tech but it is best of breed) and is constantly aware of new direct and indirect competition - HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) I think is going to become a real problem in the mid-term. Spending to ""acquire R&D"" via simply buying existing, proven tech isn't the worst idea.As I've detailed in many articles before, I always keep an eye on private tech deal flow to see what the next ""big thing"" is that might be coming to the public markets. With Accenture also being particularly active in the mobile-focused consulting niche I definitely view this side market move by Salesforce as not an isolated event. I'm watching Salesforce closely to what it decides to do with all these new (expensive) toys because what it decides to do could be the catalyst for the next leg higher for its equity. I'll report back if I hear anything from the private side during the course of my normal tech consulting.Good luck everybody."
3458376,24276,2015-08-22T12:51:52-04:00,"Analysts are screaming buy salesforce and taking their targets up.But CRM is still at break-even and its growth rate is slowing as numbers get bigger.There are horses for courses, and this one won't run on today's muddy track.","salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) managed to break-even for its latest quarter and the people cheered. Numbers for the quarter ending in July show the software-as-a-service company broke even on revenue of $1.62 billion. That was up 24% from a year ago, and sent the stock up 2% in the after-hours after the stock market's worst day in years. Brokers and analysts put out buy ratings and took their target prices higher in response.Still, at $70.35, you're now paying seven times projected sales of $6.6 billion for the company. It's easy to argue that, given expected growth rates, that might just be 5 times next year's revenue, or that profits are just around the corner. (The company is projecting a small loss for its third quarter, ending in October).But these are the kind of projections you see in a market where greed dominates and everyone wants growth. We're not in that kind of a market right now.The saving grace in all this for CRM shareholders is that a fall in the shares could, possibly, make the company affordable for a buyer like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Oracle still has a market cap of $171 billion, against $47 billion for salesforce, but drop that CRM market cap to, say, $40 billion in a general downturn and it might just become affordable, since salesforce runs primarily on Oracle hardware. But even that assumes that salesforce falls from here in order to create a take-out premium.CRM acknowledged talking to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) about an acquisition earlier this year at $55 billion, which would have been a fat premium over even the current valuation. salesforce has an agreement to run its software on Microsoft's Azure cloud. According to the news story, CRM's CEO Marc Benioff demanded $70 billion and talks broke down.These days Microsoft is more interested in using its own numbers to dismiss salesforce's success, claiming it has the most valuable cloud by adding revenues from Office 365 to its Azure numbers. Microsoft has a funny way of defining cloud, including any software that runs in a cloud as cloud revenue when it is, in fact, software revenue. But salesforce also calls itself a ""cloud"" company when it's doing the same thing.If you think we're heading for a prolonged market downturn, even a correction (which still requires several hundred points more downward pressure on the NASDAQ to get 10% below its 5,218 peak), you might even want to consider a short on salesforce here. I don't play short, but the move seems obvious. A lot of the highest-flyers in the investing universe, like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), were hammered hard by the latest downdraft, and salesforce should not be immune to such pressure.My own view is that the market is going to bounce back at some point, and you will get a better entry point for CRM then. But the company is not going to grow to the sky, and the stock is built for a specific market attitude that is not in evidence right now. This horse will not run well on a muddy track, and it's raining."
3459036,91235,2015-08-21T17:36:38-04:00,"salesforce has undeniably generated incredible returns for investors over the past several years.Whether or not these returns are substantiated by the company’s fundamentals is up for debate.From a risk-return profile, investing in the company is like flipping a coin: Heads you win big, tales you lose big.As such, fundamentalist investors should stick to their guns and search for more promising investments.","Investors' memories tend to fade in and out fairly often. Looking back at the tech bubble of 2000 and the financial crisis of 2008, there's been a strong recovery every time, although it's taken a few years. Nowadays, it seems that the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis is just about to wrap up, and investors are venturing out to take new risks.If the tech bubble of 2000 has taught investors anything, it's that when the valuation of a company begins to separate from the fundamentals (including the company's growth prospects), the danger of a collapse in share value grows with the excessive valuation. Some current companies are beginning to show signs of that trend as this article is being written, especially some technology/software companies out there. One of these companies that has generated more than a 1,575% return on investment for investors since its IPO is salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM), a current darling of Wall Street.As investors can note from the stock chart below, the company's share value has only begun experiencing its enormous upside within the past few years, post-2008 financial crisis. Since, then, save for a few bumps along the road, the gravy train has been chugging along non-stop.Source: Morningstar.comBut recently, the stock appears to be losing some of its steam. In the trailing twelve months stock chart, salesforce.com's stock only gained about 15%, and during this period, waves of volatility buffeted the share price by as much as 10% in either direction. The slowing of this growth is in part due to an overall decrease in investor confidence in the stock market, but it also could be partially due to a decrease in confidence in the company itself.Source: Stockcharts.comIt's not particularly hard to see why this might be the case. As investors know, the company's business model is based on the selling of subscriptions of its software to entities of various types and sizes. These subscriptions are from a variety of different applications that the company markets, including its Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Community Cloud, Analytics Cloud, and its development platform, salesforce1. salesforce's Community and Analytics Cloud are its most recently developed products, while the others form the core of the company's revenue stream. As a result of the company's multi-tenant architecture that it uses as the backbone of its applications, the company is able to quickly scale up its business.At first glance, it appears that the company has been doing rather well over the past several years. In fact, ""rather well"" would be an insulting understatement. Over the prior four years, top line growth grew at an astounding CAGR of 34.2%; at the same time, the company was able to maintain margins at a relatively constant rate. The top line CAGR is (mostly) in-line with the CAGR of investors' return over the same time period, so just from this metric, investors may believe that the company's current and prospective growth justifies the stock's return and its corresponding overvaluation.However, when diving into the financials a bit further, investors will find that the company is less financially sound than its top line growth would imply. For one, although the company's margins have been relatively stable over the past few years, these stable margins have also yielded stable negative bottom line results, which is not uncommon with these hyper-growth companies. The negative bottom line has taken a toll on the company's retained earnings, which have been in the red zone for quite some time. To continue to fund its growth without diluting shareholders' investments, the company has opted to substantially increase the amount of debt in its capital structure. Of note is the company's issuance of 0.75% and 0.25% Notes which it used in part to fund its acquisitions. As of the company's most recent 10-Q, debt made up 59.1% of the company's capital structure. From this heavy debt load, investors are also able to note that the company's current ratio is below 1.0, and its working capital is negative.So there's a lot of risk involved, and it's no surprise that Morningstar has grouped this company into the ""speculative growth"" category. The company's current business strategy is not exactly helping either-it now is moving to target larger customers, which possess more reward (in terms of potential subscriptions) but also more risk, mainly due to the fact that it is more difficult for a larger corporation to adopt new software. The company also continues to take losses on one of its product segments, ""Professional services and other,"" which currently has a COGS that exceeds the segment's top line.As I've done with many of the previous companies I've examined, it's important to step back and examine the stock from a risk-return profile perspective. From what investors can see here, we have a classic case of a stock with high risk and high (potential) return. Keep in mind that with software companies, the competitive moats are often thin and shallow, and the fundamentals of salesforce.com do not indicate to me that its competitive moats are particularly strong. With its highly leveraged capital structure, any downturns that salesforce experiences will have a profoundly negative impact not only on future growth but also on investor sentiment (momentum stock characteristics). As such, in my opinion, the risk-return profile is about 50-50 in either direction, and in a large amount. In effect, investing in salesforce.com is tantamount to flipping a coin.To beat the market, investors need a company that has the probability of generating more upside than downside. Unless the company begins to deleverage, turn that accumulated deficit into retained earnings, and transition more top line growth to bottom line growth, fundamentalist investors should stay away from this company. Find an investment that will yield better odds of return than heads I win, tails I lose."
3410996,48411,2015-08-06T16:55:36-04:00,"Salesforce.com is targeting Instagram-focused advertisers and marketers with its new tools intended to increase efficacy of advertising campaigns and engagement management.I think this is a really smart move in that Instagram isn't being utilized to its full potential because of a shortfall in management tech.Like its base platform CRM engine, I think Salesforce.com plans to use its Instagram tools as a launch point for a suite of social specific, individual platform solutions.Continue to be long salesforce.com.","Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is out with news that it has expanded its Marketing Cloud suite to include tools specifically intended to increase efficacy of Instagram (NASDAQ:FB) advertising campaigns and Instagram/social engagement management. Salesforce.com is looking to, in this instance, provide the picks and shovels to the gold miners rather than leasing the underlying land, which it does with its generally considered global CRM platform. I think this is a really, really smart move by Salesforce.com, speaks to its sense of awareness, innovation and willingness to lead, and should be hugely beneficial for retention going forward. I'll explain.Sticking with our gold rush theme, Salesforce.com has always been good at anticipating where the prospectors were headed next in search of the next great nugget find. It has been especially good at being able to do this first - which has provided it some obvious advantages. In Instagram, Salesforce.com sees the next great advertising and marketing platform. One that's expected to ""represent over 10% of Facebook's global revenues by 2017, including 28% of all US mobile revenues (source: salesforce.com Instagram Marketing Cloud PR)."" You can imagine this makes Instagram and integrating it into the greater Salesforce.com Marketing Cloud a near-priority number one.So that's just what salesforce.com did. And if you take a quick read through the capabilities and integrations you'll see that it did this very well. salesforce.com has created an all-inclusive, one stop shop that has real substance and aesthetics that should position it to be the engine of choice for executing Instagram and broader social campaigns (right now that's essentially limited to Twitter - which also is highly integrated into the lead Marketing Cloud suite) going forward. I think this creation and integration is meaningful as of right now but should grow in relevance as time goes on.As Facebook dials in its (Facebook-app) News Feed and with that continues to require more and more user relevant content in order to be presented (in the News Feed, to the user) it essentially is shrinking its exposure/discovery funnel while increasing the underlying efficacy of the content being fed to the user. Of course, this has many benefits and drawbacks to an advertiser/marketer. The biggest drawback is that the advertiser/marketer has less a chance at blanket-coverage discovery potential. Put simply, the advertiser/marketer is unable to mass market as well or at all. That's where Instagram comes in.Instagram is presented in a real-time feed without a filtering process. Of course the user has to ""follow"" the account for it to be presented in the user's general feed but the point is that there's no distribution wall or filter in front of the advertiser/marketer outside of initial capture. With Instagram having a heavy focus on hashtags this makes data gathering and eventual customer capture easier to do. The point is that with Instagram, an already discovery based platform, advertisers and marketers simply have more control and more easily accessible data. This is largely why Salesforce.com is making the investment into Instagram-tailored efficacy tools for campaigns and engagements. Salesforce.com is seeing a secular growth toward usage of Instagram by advertisers/marketers in that going forward they might not have better options for achieving discovery. Again, I think this is a smart bet.Now, the argument could be made that Facebook will still be the primary advertising/marketing platform or that Twitter might be on the comeback in the future or even that a new medium like Facebook's Mentions platform might be the eventual discovery winner. All are fair points. But that's the beauty of what Salesforce.com has done. If its CRM platform, and everything that has been spun off of that - using that as a central platform, has shown us anything - it's that salesforce.com is never quite done optimizing and that the company rarely establishes anything simply for the set purpose it appears to have been established for. I think Salesforce.com is going to run-out the Instagram-tailored offering, show some success, prove out some take rate, and eventually expand the toolkit out further to existing/not yet invented platforms down the road. It just makes too much sense to do once having already paid for the infrastructure. The risk of the endeavor, the capex associated with the buildout, has already been taken which levers up the social focused new addition to the Marketing Cloud to the reward side.All told Salesforce.com is smart in trying to front run the much larger need (on a volume basis) for something, anything, to help dial in a currently loose advertising medium. For all the benefits that Instagram brings to advertisers/marketers and all the leverage that can be had from the expansive hashtag use the fact is that the platform itself isn't being utilized to its full potential. To that I think anybody having ran a campaign on Instagram can agree. This should go a long way into helping service that need. Who knows - it might be a launch point for an entirely new revenue segment directly tethered to social specific platforms.I continue to recommend a long position in Salesforce.com.Good luck everybody."
3390115,78265,2015-08-04T10:45:08-04:00,"Salesforce.com offers returns that are lower than the risk free rate.The company is consistently unprofitable in spite of revenue that grows rapidly and ""smoothly."".There are other companies available in the space that actually generate profits. We recommend investors in Salesforce consider switching to one of them.","Share of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) have climbed about 34% over the past twelve months, which we believe says more about the market than the company. The shares are priced manically and we believe investors would do well to avoid the name over the next 2-3 years. Our reasoning is pretty simple: The company makes no money and is priced at a very large premium relative to its profitable peers. We outline our case against Salesforce.com below.Operating ProfitsThe first thing we do when analyzing any investment is to consider the level of operating profit the company can generate relative to the amount of capital employed. Our reasoning for this is straightforward enough. If a company can't generate sufficient operating profit (which are the source of all shareholder wealth) relative to the capital entrusted to management by owners and (increasingly) creditors, then there's no point. If you make more on your capital in a risk free bond, you'd be better off investing in that.The operating yield at Salesforce.com is ~-1.06%, which is about 3.27% below the current risk free rate! The increasingly levered balance sheet (where long term debt currently stands at about $1.27 billion), generates a return that doesn't match the risk free rate!Source: Company filingsThis performance is fairly bad, but the past four quarters have actually been goosed by two events that won't recur. First, the company earned about $36.6 million in the most recent quarter from a lease reduction. In the absence of this, the negative yield would have dropped from -1.1% to -1.8% on capital. Second, the company managed to reverse some of the valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets. Since valuation allowances are basically the company expressing doubt about its own profitability, we consider their existence problematic. The fact that the company managed to reduce the VAs somewhat is good in the short term, but won't help much in the medium term.A critic will likely complain that this analysis is backward looking. That's a fair point as far as it goes, but it largely misses the point. The point of these exercises is not to offer a history lesson in the recent behavior of a company's profitability. The point is to offer the first step in a gap analysis between where we are and where we need to be. Specifically, in regard to Salesforce.com, we require an operating profit of ~10%, given all the risks we know about with this name. Since the company generates about -2% consistently, we know we're far off from considering this to be an acceptable investment. Exercises like these allow us to quantify the gap in performance that we'd need to see eliminated before we would consider this to be an investment. The gap is about $472 million. In other words, holding all else equal, if the company improved operating profit by $472 million, we'd reconsider our position on Salesforce.com.We also note also that the past four quarters continue Salesforce's (proud?) tradition of being rewarded for sales growth as profits continue to languish. Revenue rose 14.6% over the four quarters, while profits remained elusive. This, of course, prompts the question: What level of revenue will be required for this to be a profitable company? This is a serious question for us because the operating performance of this company makes no sense to us. It was profitable back in 2011 (it earned $64.47 million on $1.65 billion of revenue). Revenue has trebled since then and the company is now losing money consistently. This will come as a surprise to some investors who pay a large premium for revenue growth, but the sustainable source of shareholder wealth is actually earnings. Earnings are the source of dividends and book value growth through retained earnings.Peer ComparisonInvesting is at heart a relativistic process. Investors are constantly faced with questions about what to do with their capital. Should they buy a government bond or a very risky technology company shrouded in a hopeful future and not much else? Should they buy a retail store or an airline? Should they buy railcar manufacturer or a retail store? The questions seem endless and an investor needs to work out for themselves what is the most appropriate way to invest their capital. For that reason, we thought it would be worthwhile to compare Salesforce to some of its peers. To keep the comparison as simple as possible, we've chosen other cloud hopefuls, Oracle and SAP. If we expanded this to include other names, the conclusion would be basically the same. Although Salesforce.com is priced at a premium to its peers, it has the poorest operating performance. Specifically:When investors pay more for less, they're taking positions that are more risky, not less risky. If an investor wishes to participate in the cloud space, they could do so in a more diversified, less risky way with a company like Oracle.Source: GurufocusConclusionSalesforce.com continues to offer poor performance relative to both its peers and the risk free rate. It is about $470 million of profit (not revenue … profit) from what we would consider to be an acceptable operating yield. If we were shareholders, we'd dread any news of growing revenues from this company, because it's in the very peculiar position of making greater losses on higher revenue. We could go on and on, but we believe these reasons are sufficient. Investors in Salesforce.com were lucky to buy a business that is rewarded for revenue growth and not much else. We recommend they get out sooner rather than later."
3276855,89446,2015-06-24T06:44:34-04:00,"Salesforce reports billions of deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue.
        Investors need to ensure they understand what these measures represent and when they will convert to revenue.
        Credit risk is an important consideration.
        Ageing of both metrics should be disclosed to enhance investor understanding.","In an earlier article about Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) I discussed the main differences in Salesforce's GAAP and non-GAAP numbers and the reasons behind presenting the two different measures. Going into detail on Salesforce's financial statements and earnings release statements inevitably leads to noting the substantial amounts of deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue. These are two concepts that require some additional effort to evaluate, but it is crucial in evaluating a company such as Salesforce that contracts years into the future and bills its client in advance for services provided.In this short follow-up article I will spend some time delving into these two measures.Where does it belong?First off, it's important to recognize that deferred revenue is a liability from the perspective of the company booking it. This is because it has invoiced for the service, but is still to perform the service. It therefore records the deferred revenue on the balance sheet as a liability, and as it provides the service over time, it will write down the deferred revenue while recording revenue in the income statement. Deferred revenue is a current item, meaning that it is generally expected to materialize within the next 12 months (i.e. the service is expected to be delivered, leading to full recognition of revenue in the income statement).The main reason why Salesforce is able to book contracts as deferred revenue is that the contracts it has with its clients are non-cancellable. They also do not provide for refunds.Unbilled deferred revenue is one step further from being recognized as revenue, as these are services that have been contracted, but not yet invoiced. This also means it is probably more than 12 months away from delivery. This is not a GAAP measure and is therefore not included anywhere in the financial statements, however it is routinely mentioned in Salesforce's earnings releases. The main reason for that is most likely because it gives investors a feel for how much revenue Salesforce will be able to invoice over the next few years. An important fact to realize here is that this is revenue that is most likely at least a year away from recognition, and that it will first go through the deferred revenue (as it become current) stage, before moving to the income statement. Graphically, one can think of it as a pipeline as follows:Let's say Salesforce sells a 3-year subscription for its cloud service to a client, which the client will start using immediately. It is then able to invoice the first year, and books that as deferred revenue while also recording a receivable until the cash is received. The remaining 2 years of service that was contracted remains in unbilled deferred revenue, until it can be invoiced and delivery starts. Once the service is actually delivered, the revenue can be recognized and moves from the deferred revenue stage to the revenue stage.The key problem with the unbilled deferred revenue metric is that Salesforce does not provide a breakdown of the ageing of this item, even though this item has ballooned to $6 billion as per April 30 of this year.GuidanceOne important point to keep in mind for investors therefore, is that it is much easier for a company such as Salesforce to predict its revenue far into the future than for most other companies, because it has contractual arrangements with their clients that often cover multiple years. This also allows them to adapt to a downturn in time, because management can see it coming multiple quarters in advance. This in turn means that stock prices will be driven almost entirely by guidance for the next quarter and year combined with analysis of the two deferred revenue items, rather than an analysis of the previous period. In that setting, one needs to think of unbilled deferred revenue as the stuff (unbilled deferred revenue) that Salesforce's sales team pushes into the pipe on one end which will give an indication of the amount of stuff that will come out (actual revenue), a few years later. The fact that Salesforce does not provide ageing for the unbilled deferred revenue item leaves us in the dark as to how long exactly that is going to take, however the deferred revenue stage, gives us a heads up when its less than 12 months away from revenue recognition.Credit riskAnother important point is that all of these measures are almost entirely decoupled from cash. A contract that has moved from unbilled deferred revenue to deferred revenue was moved there because it was invoiced. This does obviously not mean it was also paid for and there is nothing in the financial statements that will allow us to see whether it is. The further the revenue is away from actual recognition the higher the credit risk is. Every investor needs to understand that while Salesforce's future revenue is highly visible long in advance, that does not imply it is guaranteed. A downturn in the economy or even just a glut in a sector that Salesforce has many clients in, could leave Salesforce with a pile of worthless contracts (and subsequent write-downs of unbilled deferred revenue and deferred revenue).ConclusionSalesforce provides off-balance sheet measures such as unbilled deferred revenue in their earnings releases to give investors a flavor of what can be expected. Investors need to make sure not to confuse these items with actual revenue as it solely represents a right to deliver this services in the future and then bill for it (and hopefully receive payment). Tracking cash from operations, while correcting for items such as the employee stock plan is therefore a more conservative measure that will allow investors to analyze the drop-off rate at the pre-recognition stages. Because Salesforce has been growing quickly over the past few years, it is currently difficult to reliably do so, but this is where investor attention should be as the company becomes more stable. In order to provide a better insight into the pace at which the unbilled deferred revenue will reach the income statement, Salesforce should disclose the aging of this item."
3322125,48411,2015-07-13T17:23:46-04:00,"We’re now inside 48 hours until the salesforce.com (CRM) Salesforce Analytics Cloud goes live in French.On the heels of this go-live I think it an appropriate time to evaluate salesforce.com’s Euro move, specifically with a focus on France and making France a Euro-hub.I break out what investors can expect from this in the near and mid-terms; both are good by the way.I also discuss the news that Slack and salesforce.com are finally coming together with an official integration.","We're now inside 48 hours until the salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) Salesforce Analytics Cloud goes live in French and on the heels of this go-live I think it an appropriate time to evaluate salesforce.com's Euro move, specifically with a focus on France and making France a Euro-hub, and what investors can expect from this in the near and mid-terms. Both are good by the way.So, about three weeks ago salesforce.com announced that it was acquiring Paris-based Kerensen Consulting. Kerensen is ""a leading cloud consulting firm in Europe - the company provides business consulting, cloud solution management and digital customer experience services to help European companies transform their businesses through the power of cloud, social, mobile and data science using the Salesforce Customer Success Platform (SOURCE: salesforce.com Customer and Partner France PR)"".I think this is a great bolt-on acquisition, gives salesforce.com access and control over a net promoter with some clout and name recognition in-country, and allows Kerensen to benefit from having the resources behind it that only a company at salesforce.com's size can offer. Synergy, growth pull-forward, and the post-acquisition company (Kerensen) being exponentially more equipped make this a great France adoption driver. That's a great place to start.At the same time as announcing the Kerensen deal salesforce.com also announced that it was opening its second R&D facility in France. While largely a surface PR move a headline grabber the substantial degree of R&D now in-country in France also shouldn't be overlooked. France and specifically the City of Paris has been and will continue to invest gobs of money into helping along the country's ""national digital economy"" and ""digital policy"", according to Muriel Pénicaud, CEO of Business France. Business France is a national agency tasked with supporting the international development of the French economy, responsible for fostering export growth by French businesses, as well as promoting and facilitating international investment in France.salesforce.com's investment into both physical infrastructure and overhead into the country, inclusive of all the risks that come with it (adoption risk, extra buildout (like language translation needed), negative FX impact risk, etc.) isn't a coincidence in my opinion. I think smartly salesforce.com is looking to ride the national support tailwind being provided in the country. While I'm not intimately familiar with French policy or exactly how this tailwind will help drive salesforce.com's initiative I can say with confidence that supportive government isn't a bad thing. Now having in-country focused, in-country cultivated R&D capacity of size expect salesforce.com to have an accelerated schedule of French-based platform upgrade announcements. I think salesforce.com views France as a total land grab, as it should, and will increase directed (and maybe overall) spending to the country's operations. Good for salesforce.com and good for investors.But there's also what salesforce.com has done in advance/in conjunction to this planting of the flag in France. salesforce.com is one of the tightest tech companies I follow when it comes to integrations of its platform, including the ""back-door"" integrations that have become so necessary in today's SMB/enterprise solution world. By tight, I mean it as a company watches what is being integrated ""off platform"" either by use of Event Brokers or outright custom integrations VERY closely and is VERY good at somehow finding ways of making these not work as intended. Lately, I've noticed this becoming a bit lax.I've heard recent reports or users being able to use Cloudpipes to integrate salesforce.com very closely with other non-platform integrations as well as users being able to ""layer"" integrations into salesforce.com - such as using Hubot within Slack once integrated via an Event Broker like Zapier. I'll explain.Cloudpipes is an app that basically allows a user to create their own SMB/enterprise solution by forming a Frankenstein's monster of sorts - ""piping"" together solutions that best fit the user's needs. This allows a user to take their most used apps and turn them into a super app of sorts.Hubot is a bot that automates certain functions in chat rooms, which I've found to be especially useful to automate chat translations when using Slack (which is the chatroom for SMB's/enterprises and friend groups who don't want any of the traditional chatroom limitations from other chatter apps). Of course, this would come in handy if I'm American (which I am) doing business with folks in France who speak French (which I am and which they do). This basically gives me the ability to speak French and the French counterparts the ability to speak English, a major language barrier and workflow barrier removal. Guys, I can't tell you how huge this has been and what this has done for even simple tasks. This matters.Still, the fact that I have to execute the integrating of all these parties is a deterrent of sorts and does create friction to overall execution. But, salesforce.com is working on this - according to Slack:From roughly the time that Slack came out of beta users of salesforce.com have been calling for an official (and deep) integration between the two solutions. Now, I know there's a faction that loves Chatter and Communities but I'm not one. I think an official integration would make ""layer"" integrations SO much easier and would remove quite a bit of the friction from doing so. Of course, this would expand salesforce.com's use cases and with the BI and analytics unit now going native French in language (48 hours from now) that's going to matter exponentially. salesforce.com has a seriously opportunity to aggregate market share in the early going here and I think if it were to announce an integration in the immediate term this would be hugely helpful to that effort. Still, even without expanding its ""official"" integrations salesfore.com even unofficially relaxing on what is allowed to back door integrate is a bit step forward in the right direction.Overall I think investors can expect big things coming from the company's Euro expansion and it can expect the Euro hub being in France to be a move that's looked back on a few years from now as a major moment in salesforce.com history. The company looks to be committed to the initiative and has tailwinds and first move advantages that should help it establish a leadership position early. I think if salesforce.com were to move forward with integrations, some have been suggested, that would be even more helpful to the efforts overall. The bottom line here is that the Euro expansion efforts are meaningful and investors should be watching the French success or failures closely because they should set a proxy for next country and total Euro development.I continue to recommend a long position in salesforce.com.Good luck everybody."
3312615,24663,2015-07-08T19:07:19-04:00,"Brean Capital upgraded CRM with a buy and $85 price target.This target represents upside of just 21% and gives CRM a valuation that's well above where big tech was rumored to acquire it.This is very bullish given the increased competition by ORCL, which could cause headwinds for CRM.","Brean Capital upgraded shares of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) to buy on Tuesday, and hiked its price target by $9 to $85. At that price, Salesforce.com would have a market capitalization over $55 billion, more than the price big tech was reportedly shopping it at. While Salesforce.com has certainly been a fast-growing company over the years, there are three logical reasons that investors need to consider about this new price target, and why Salesforce.com might not be a buy.Big tech thinks it's too muchLet's jump straight to the point: Brean lists a number of upselling opportunities and macro reasons for the upgrade, but to invest in Salesforce.com is to be particularly bullish on its place in the customer relationship management, or CRM, space through its software-as-a-service, SaaS, cloud offerings. By 2018, $20 billion of the CRM market will come from SaaS-based applications, up from $11 billion this year, thereby giving Salesforce.com the driver seat thanks to its accelerated growth and leading share in the market.There's just one problem, and I discussed this issue back in May: Big tech all thinks that Salesforce.com is too expensive. Salesforce.com was at the epicenter of M&A talk earlier this year, at a $50 billion valuation, and at least three big tech companies rumored as acquirers all said the price was too high. Keep in mind, big tech is known for overspending, especially in the cloud. Therefore, it raises some eyebrows when Salesforce.com is seen as too pricey for the richest of companies.Source: boomi.comGranted, there are a couple of potential reasons. First, Salesforce.com's growth in infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service hasn't been nearly as great as in SaaS. Those two industries are seen as great growth drivers for the cloud. Next, some believe that Salesforce.com can be challenged in the SaaS-based CRM market. Regardless of who's right or wrong, investors must take a step back when big tech starts talking about valuation, and in this case, Brean Capital is expecting a price point that's even higher than $50 billion.Oracle is coming on strong, really strongLast year, Salesforce.com dominated the CRM market for cloud-based providers. Its closest competitors were SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), which finished the year with a 12.1% and 9.1% market share, respectively. Notably, Salesforce.com outgrew both SAP and Oracle. However, this year is likely to be much different, not for SAP but definitely for Oracle.In Oracle's last quarter the company added over 1,200 new SaaS customers, and noted that it is now growing faster than both Salesforce.com and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) in that business. Oracle is expecting to sell as much as $2 billion in new SaaS business this year, more than Salesforce.com. What's scary for Salesforce.com is that Oracle's growth is accelerating in this business as it grows larger.Source: OracleSpecifically, Oracle's PaaS and SaaS bookings increased more than 100% during its last quarter, compared to a 21% increase for Salesforce.com. In other words, Oracle now has more scale and is growing faster than Salesforce.com in SaaS. The reason is because Oracle is transitioning its licensing business to cloud services, a move that costs the company short-term, but long-term delivers more revenue, higher profits and near equal margins. Oracle has made a big move to offer 95% of its products on the cloud, and SaaS is a major way of delivering those services. As a result, Salesforce.com may see some legitimate competition in CRM and other businesses, thereby devaluing its business and slowing its growth. It's certainly a risk and something to monitor.$85 is not that far off, but is a big riskThe final major concern with Brean's price target is that $85 is not that far off. It is only a 21% gain on Salesforce.com's current stock price. Yet, given the things discussed herein, and that it already trades at more than 70x next year's earnings, that 20% of upside is a big risk.At some point in time, a company's valuation must carry the stock. Up until this point, Salesforce.com has been living on speculation and momentum. Yes, Salesforce.com has earned nearly $600 million in free cash flow over the last 12 months, but the problem is that it spends $1.05 for every $1 in new business that it earns. That's not a desirable business model, not like the very profitable Amazon Web Services.Nonetheless, it is possible that Salesforce.com crosses $85, but given the increased competition from Oracle and the company's struggle in laaS and PaaS, I certainly want to see how it performs in this coming quarter and its guidance for the future. Until then, I'm not sure how any analyst could say that Salesforce.com is worth $85 per share, regardless that it only represents a 21% gain.All things considered, Brean may have made good points in issuing their price target for Salesforce.com. However, the fact that big tech considers it expensive, competition is increasing, and that there isn't that much upside all weigh as reasons to avoid shares, not buy it."
3259025,52612,2015-06-15T11:19:30-04:00,"Salesforce.com presents little value to its legacy counterparts such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM or SAP.Salesforce.com's existing software service via the cloud is being challenged by evolving, new ways of delivering and using software through software-defined datacenters and software virtualization.Salesforce.com may be a thing of the past in a not to distant future, potentially the real reason why it's willing to sell.Amazon, if wishing to combine its cloud computing hardware with business software, may be the only one that can make a good use of Salesforce at this point.","Anyone still remember PeopleSoft? Once a rising star in enterprise software but later bought out by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). A Peoplesoft reminder, however, does not suggest that Oracle should also swallow up Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) this time. Unlike PeopleSoft, which added additional software capability to Oracle's core offerings, Salesforce, the often-perceived King of the Cloud, may actually confer little value to Oracle when the latter already has different cloud offerings of its own.As much as Salesforce likes to boast about its cloud business, selling itself to other large enterprise software companies also brings out minimal value, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM and SAP, all of which currently have strong cloud showings themselves. Despite reports about Microsoft evaluating a potential purchase of Salesforce, it's unlikely that Microsoft will pick up something it has already built itself.More importantly, what Salesforce believes is something cutting edge on the cloud has been increasingly commoditized with innovations moving away from simply delivering software via the Web to focusing on virtualization and everything software defined for more adaptability and flexibility in business software delivery and uses, areas outside of Salesforce's proud undertaking.Although little is being said openly, what Salesforce can offer a potential buyer is really nothing more than a legacy Web-delivered software services business, now being challenged by novel software services that offer readily scalability and better agility. It's something that Salesforce's traditional SaaS can never achieve thanks to the always fast-moving innovations in the tech world.This may be the true reason why Salesforce is willing to disassemble itself and talk up a potential sale despite its perceived stalwart status. It would be at investors' own peril if they were to misread the evolving cloud software market. Salesforce itself may have somehow predicted that it won't be able to carry its present business too far out forward as software delivery is rapidly moving past the kind of cloud offerings it has been promoting.Having no commitment to software virtualization and software-defined, next-generation datacenters as a way to better its cloud offerings, Salesforce is in fact staying out of this new round of business software services competition. But the company actually is quite shrewd being open to unloading its cloud business of an earlier innovation.""Salesforce automation is a 20th century solution to a 21st century business opportunity."" Those are the words of SAP when lately telling of its zero interest in purchasing Salesforce. Unbeknown to some investors, Salesforce's current high valuation may start dissipating at some point as new models of business software delivery services pick up steam.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), on the other hand, doesn't need to position itself on the forefront of the innovations in business software services like what typical vendors of enterprise software have to. Taking advantage of its widely-used Amazon Web Services, Amazon now runs the AWS Marketplace where business software and tools are sold by other companies and presumably delivered to business end users through their renting of Amazon's cloud services.Incorporating Salesforce into AWS Marketplace, Amazon quickly becomes a seller of business software itself. As the owner of both its online software store and cloud computing hardware used to deliver software, Amazon is in an advantageous position to promote business software it now has on its own shelves. With added business software capability, Amazon may be even more formidable in the eye of traditional enterprise technology companies.With little footprints in business software offerings, Amazon can use Salesforce to knock on the doors of business software users. Nestled within Amazon's vast Web services, Salesforce obtains a cushion to absorb any shock from ongoing innovations in how business software is delivered and used. Tapping into Amazon's stronger cloud computing, Salesforce has a chance to re-innovate itself to become more dynamic in its cloud hardware capability for more efficient software delivery.Amazon naturally provides a more suited environment to better respond to changing competitions in business software services because of its relative dominance in cloud computing. In the short term, existing AWS subscribers may have to consider sticking with the way Amazon's Salesforce delivers their software when having selected to use the cloud owner's in-house business software. Meanwhile, Amazon and Salesforce together can start crafting software-defined datacenters to go along with software virtualization, a more prevalent concept in software uses.Given how valuable Amazon's cloud infrastructure is to so many businesses relying on Internet computing, it makes no sense that Amazon doesn't eventually move into business software services to have a complete AWS. After all, it's the business software that runs on Amazon's cloud. Furthermore, current computing technology is all about how hardware can work most seamlessly with software. By including software offerings from Salesforce, Amazon can further enforce the stronghold of its cloud infrastructure."
3291095,48411,2015-06-29T12:57:56-04:00,salesforce.com is competing with Microsoft and Google to be the primary SMB/enterprise solution platform - an opportunity lucrative like none we've ever seen before.salesforce.com could take a huge step forward and deal a meaningful blow to its competitors with an acquisition of Slack.salesforce.com can make this deal happen and it would create immediate growth in my opinion; it would also make the platform more defensive and best of breed.I think this is a no-brainer and something that if salesforce.com doesn't do one of its competitors will.,"It's time for two of the best to come together either via deep integration or an aggressive acquisition move. I'm talking about salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Slack.First, I think one of the silliest M&A moves that hasn't happened has been (insert enterprise tech major) acquisition of Slack but primarily an acquisition by salesforce.com.I mean, really - there's no way that salesforce.com is hanging on to the idea that Chatter is 1) a serious competitor or 2) has any long-term viability/value-add outside of contributing to the ""all-inclusive"" feel of the salesforce.com ecosystem (a concept that I've described as a growing expectation by users in a recent HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) article). Chatter is simply a second rate product and frankly I think it's borderline inept. I know that salesforce.com hasn't invested heavily into it and it is in fact more a ""yeah it also offers this"" product but factually it isn't driving new business.Now, and again, I actually think Slack is a near ideal buyout for a handful of names - this would include anybody in the BI niche (read: Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tableau (NYSE:DATA), Dell, salesforce.com again).Sure, some of the platforms and solutions listed above have a chat/collaboration solution but it's always a secondary solution (meaning I have to run two separate windows and solutions) which is inconvenient and presents friction to usage.But Slack would mean so much to salesforce.com in that salesforce.com is already so dominant in the CRM space and so well on the path to having an established productivity suite in general. While CRM is the only niche that salesforce.com has a best of breed product it could pair Slack with any and all of its other niche products (again BI and Service offerings would be immediately and drastically improved) and see huge take rate increases, I believe. Also remember that salesforce.com is in a race with Microsoft and to a lesser extent Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to be thought of as the SMB/enterprise solution platform - the central productivity suite. Think the ""Windows"" of the workplace when Windows was at its peak.The winner of this race, if there does end up being one dominant platform, should shape out to be one of the biggest companies on the planet. The opportunity is lucrative like few that have ever existed.Which further underlines why salesforce.com needs to stop being proud and just make this happen. Both salesforce.com and Slack are growing at excellent rates - Slack is growing at absurd rates, but I think a NewCo would make these rates look downright slow:Not only just the value-add created for the NewCo total platform (described above), which would again be huge, but the removal of total friction. I think the NewCo would post incredible retention, dollar value per customer growth, and customer acquisition cost figures. Figures that would have The Street swooning. That's good for salesforce.com shareholders and management alike.Why should I have to use an Event Broker (I currently use Zapier) to get the cross-app functionality and use case execution that a NewCo would provide? How many potential adopters of both don't use one or the other because they either don't know how to link the services using an Event Broker or simply don't care to do so?salesforce.com has the access to funding capacity to make this happen and it should. It could also, as noted, deal a major blow to competitors and take a step forward in the race to becoming the dominant base productivity suite. Very rarely is such an obvious, high visibility of success integration this apparent and very rarely does it come with the ability to get more offensive and defensive.I think if salesforce.com doesn't acquire Slack, even at what is rumored as a $3.3 billion valuation (techcrunch reported a valuation of $2.8 billion very recently) that somebody else will - I presume it will be Microsoft. A tool and a productivity suite weapon as valuable as Slack has become won't be dangled in front of suitors for long.I continue to recommend a long position in salesforce.com.Good luck everybody."
3235856,24491,2015-06-04T09:27:23-04:00,"salesforce.com recently became the fastest software enterprise firm to reach a $6 billion annual revenue rate. Its revenue growth rate continues to be impressive.Cash from operations also grew significantly in the firm's fiscal first quarter, continuing the upward trend since a downturn in fiscal year 2014.Let's take a look at these growth rates and how they affect salesforce.com's intrinsic value.","By Paul TaitSalesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has grown in impressive fashion lately and has begun to draw considerable attention from competitors, even more so than ever before.The firm's first-quarter results were attention-worthy across many performance metrics. Beginning at the top line, revenue grew 23% from the year-ago period, to ~$1.5 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Digging deeper into revenue trends reveals even faster expansion potential in the future--the firm's deferred revenue balance increased 31% year-over-year! This growth rate is consistent with growth of 32% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, very promising growth rates.Unbilled deferred revenue, business that is contracted but unbilled, is also up substantially, showing a 25% increase compared to the year-ago period. Growing at an even higher rate than the firm's revenue metrics was its cash from operations, as it reported a growth rate of 54% year-over-year. In turn, free cash flow has increased, which we feel is the best parameter to use in judging a company's valuation through the course of the economic cycle.If it wasn't already, Salesforce.com has become a possible takeout candidate for larger software firms thanks in part to its fantastic growth. Rumors are swirling that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) have been in talks with the company, but opinions on the valuation of the company remain scattered. Reportedly, Microsoft offered $55 billion for the company, but CEO Marc Benioff wanted as much as $70 billion. CRM's market cap is ~$48 billion. Let's take an in-depth look at the trends currently taking place at Salesforce.com and arrive at our own fair value estimate.Salesforce.com's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Salesforce.com talks frequently about its $10 billion playbook, and the company recently became the first cloud-computing firm to generate $1 billion in sales in one quarter. It is on pace for over $6 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2016. The company's deferred revenue and backlog balances continue to grow, revealing future expansion potential.• There is much debate in the analyst community about using either Salesforce.com's non-GAAP or GAAP numbers in assessing the firm's performance. Though both offer valuable information, we think a focus on free cash flow is the most appropriate parameter in which to judge the value of the company's business.• Revenue growth is the company's current top priority. Long-term, however, Salesforce.com is targeting a mid-30% operating margin. If it hits this, our fair value estimate would more than double (we're assuming a mid-teens normalized operating margin).Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Salesforce.com's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 7.9%, which is regrettably below the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.6%.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. Though its economic profit spread has been inconsistent in recent years, we assign the company an attractive Economic Castle Rating on a forward-looking basis.Cash Flow AnalysisSalesforce.com saw tremendous free cash flow generation improvement in 2015. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Salesforce.com's free cash flow margin has averaged about 13.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company.At Salesforce.com, cash flow from operations increased about 60% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 97% over the same time period. So far in fiscal 2016, the firm is on pace to significantly increase cash flow from operations from 2015 levels.Valuation AnalysisHere we outline our valuation assumptions as our analysis culminates into a fair value estimate. Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Salesforce.com's shares are worth between $53-$79 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. Salesforce.com's current stock price is ~$73 per share, so it is bumping up against the high end of the range.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 21.3% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 33.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 13.5%, which is above Salesforce.com's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 13% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Salesforce.com, we use a 10.6% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $66 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example).After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock.In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Salesforce.com. We think the firm is attractive below $53 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $79 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion. Shares are currently trading in the upper half of our fair value range.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Salesforce.com's fair value at this point in time to be about $66 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Salesforce.com's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $90 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $66 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Wrapping Things UpIt's impossible to ignore the growth rates at Salesforce.com, and management remains focused on revenue growth, targeting the $10 billion mark. The firm is well-positioned to capture the shift to cloud-computing and already has impressive deferred revenue and backlog figures. Though it is a nice takeout candidate for larger software firms, it seems it may be a while before another management group agrees with its high asking price.Shares are currently trading in the top half of our fair value range, so we're not sure the time is right to jump in. However, management is targeting a 30% operating margin long-term, and our forecasts assume a normalized margin much lower than that. Should the firm hit its goal, our fair value estimate would be considerably higher.That said, we're just not sure the lofty mark has a high likelihood of happening. Though not as sexy as Salesforce.com, we tend to like larger software companies such as Oracle and Microsoft, particularly concerning the stability of cash positions and consistency in historical free cash flow. We'll continue to watch the competition within the software industry unfold as well as the possibility of a Salesforce.com takeout in the future, but we're not biting. We'd have to see a discount to our fair value to even consider the company."
3267155,89446,2015-06-19T08:13:02-04:00,"Salesforce reports GAAP and non-GAAP results, but claims Non-GAAP results provide better insight into the real business results.I believe investors may miss crucial information by relying too much on non-GAAP metrics.This article delves into the key differences between the two metrics, and guides investors on what to look out for.","Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) presents both GAAP and non-GAAP results for reporting purposes. From recent media reports it becomes evident that a lot of emphasis is placed on the non-GAAP version.Why do they differ so much? Why does Salesforce produce two different result metrics? And which one gives investors a truer picture of the underlying economic reality? In this article, I will try to shed some light on the first question while making some inferences about the second and third question.Why do they differ so much?For the quarter ended April 30, Salesforce reported GAAP net income per share of $0.01. This is rounded up from $0.006 as the profit was $4.1 million USD, and there are 664.310.000 shares outstanding. I think that we can simply say the Salesforce was break-even for this period, on a GAAP basis. For the same period, it reported non-GAAP earnings of $0.17 per share. This is based on a profit of 108 million USD and 653.809.000 shares (which is a non-diluted measure). For easy comparison:(Source)Now, this is quite a substantial difference, and obviously we want to understand why they differ so much. Thankfully, accounting standards require a company that reports non-GAAP results to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results, so that we, as non-informed outsiders, can understand how management has come to arrive at these numbers. The company states:""Non-GAAP earnings per share estimates exclude the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, amortization of acquired leases, the net amortization of debt discount on the company's convertible senior notes, and gains/losses on conversions of the company's convertible senior notes, gains/losses on sales of land and building improvements, and termination of office leases, as well as income tax adjustments.""All right. So that's quite a few items. Delving a bit deeper into the reconciliation however, it becomes quite clear that the biggest item by far is the stock-based expense. The stock-based compensation consists of multiple components. The first component is the plan that allows employees to direct up to 15% of their salary towards acquiring Salesforce shares. This plan is referred to as the Employee Stock Purchase plan, or ESPP.In addition to the ESPP, there are options being awarded to the more senior employees, and restricted shares have been issues in the past.To give a bit of an idea of the combined scale of these plans, consider that the total expense associated with this for the full year 2015 was $564.8 million (page 41 AR 2015). This is roughly equal to 10% of revenues.Guidance for the stock-based compensation expense is around 605 million USD for fiscal year 2016. This again equates to roughly 10% of revenue.Total compensation for 2014 for the senior executive group (7 people including the CEO) came in at 89.7 million USD. Most of that is stock options and share awards, which Salesforce does not include in its non-GAAP earnings.While shareholders are quite aware of the scale of the compensation in absolute terms they may not be fully appreciative of the way it impacts the results the company presents. In any event, the most recent pay rise for the CEO, Marc Benioff (from roughly 32 to nearly 40 million USD), was met with skepticism and a 47% vote against the package (it was implemented nonetheless).Another big item is the amortization of purchased intangibles. This relates to businesses that were acquired, in which case the accounting standards force companies to record the intangibles on their books and amortize them, and record any further difference between the book value of the assets purchased and the acquisition price as goodwill which needs to be tested for impairment periodically.Salesforce recorded $154 million of these amortizations in 2015, and $146 million in 2014.To provide an overview of how these costs have developed over the years, and how it has impacted GAAP versus non-GAAP results, please have a look at the following overview:(Source)The conclusion we can draw from this is twofold: 1. the gap as a percentage of revenue may be slowly closing (however, the figure for 2016 is guidance), and 2. as an absolute number, it is still a massive gap (half a billion) and makes the difference between substantial losses and significant profits.Why produce GAAP and non-GAAP results?Now that we understand the main drivers behind the difference, it is useful to start thinking about why Salesforce would produce these two different metrics.The company states:"" The primary purpose of these non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors who wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash items on the company's operating performance.""And,""Non-cash stock-based compensation, (…), are being excluded from the company's FY16 financial results because the decisions which gave rise to these expenses were not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but were made for the company's long-term benefit over multiple periods.""And finally,""While strategic decisions, (…), are made to further the company's long-term strategic objectives and impact the company's statement of operations under GAAP measures, these items affect multiple periods and management is not able to change or affect these items in any particular period.""To sum this up, management excludes certain items, mostly the stock compensation expenses, because it feels that:Let's have a closer look at the (correct) statement that it is a non-cash item. If this is a non-cash item, where do these shares come from? And who absorbs the costs associated with things like a stock compensation plan? The answer is that the shares are created through issuance by the company, and as such they have a dilutive effect. The costs of such a plan therefore, are absorbed by the shareholders. Especially looking forward therefore, this is a highly relevant item for shareholders as each share issued to employees, dilutes existing shareholders' ownership of the company.As a shareholder, I am definitely interested to know about this expense as it directly affects my wealth, and I am also very interested to know whether the company plans to continue to do this in the future. While the company does not explicitly state anything about its long term intentions around its employee stock ownership plans, the trend over the past few years, as well as guidance for the year to come, points towards this item increasing further.When I look at the three major reasons from management for excluding these items, it reminds me of other items that also are non-cash items, are long term investments made to provide revenue growth over the long term and they are items over which management has no control from quarter to quarter. For example, depreciation and amortization of fixed assets. However, the realization amongst investors and other users of financial statements has been that while all the reasons that management puts forward are factually correct, this does not mean that it's therefore helping those same gain a more accurate picture of the financial performance and condition.The very reason financial statements include a cash flow statement is precisely because account standard setting bodies have long realized that there is a difference between cash and non-cash transactions. By its very nature, the accrual basis of our accounting system will make profit deviate from cash generated, which is why we present both an accrual based profit and loss statement, as well as a cash flow statement showing the actual movement in cash. There is really no need for a company to re-invent the wheel, and produce another result metric that is essentially a profit and loss statement with some non-cash items arbitrarily swapped out.I think the most important question to decide whether items should be included should be: is this item a recurring expense, or is it truly a one-off? If it is a one-off, it may be capitalized and written off if it is expected to provide future benefits to the company. If it is recurring, it should be expensed in the period to which it refers.Going back to Salesforce, the charges for the stock plans have been running through the results for as long as I was able to retrieve annual reports for. This is therefore certainly not a one-off charge, nor is it an investment made in the current period that will carry benefits long into the future and can hence be depreciated over time. Instead, this is part of the compensation package required to get talent to join the company's workforce today, and retain them in this competitive field.Which version of results gives a more accurate picture of the underlying performance?The simple reality is that if Salesforce were to attract employees without offering shares and options as part of compensation, it would have to substantially increase salaries. Interestingly, the company notes this itself in its annual reports when describing the rationale behind the compensation structure. To me that implies that these costs are 1. part of salaries, 2. here to stay, 3. controlled by management, because they could probably be replaced by higher cash bonuses, 4. highly important to increase revenue over time.I do not agree with the notion that these expenses relate to items that are not intended to increase revenue in the short term. The whole idea behind these plans is to provide employees with a strong incentive to grow the company's share price, and the best way to do that is through stronger sales.I do not believe the reasons put forward by management therefore hold up, and think that this is simply part of doing business in this industry.Turning to empirical findings, a study conducted in 2013 found that ""many companies- including all of the 25 largest US based non-financial companies- are increasingly reporting some form of non-GAAP earnings"" (Source)This is also one of the arguments that Salesforce uses: competitors use non-GAAP measures as well. However, the decision criterium should be whether it provides better insights, not whether others are doing it.Rather than omitting these costs from its non-GAAP results, the company should provide additional disclosures warning investors about the dilutive effects of the compensation structure. It should also provide additional disclosures to explain that making stocks and options a large part of employees' compensation may result in additional selling pressure on the shares being traded in the public market as employees capitalize on the shares they have been awarded. It would not go too far to warn investors against the risk of a large number of shares coming to the supply side of the market if the shares underperform for any duration of time, as employees scramble to monetize whatever is left of what they probably perceive as part of their retirement planning.That this is not a hypothetical situation, as evidenced by the persistent insider selling that has been going on by the directors of the company. Marc Benioff (CEO and Chairman), has been selling chunks of shares over the past months with regular intervals, and so have the other executives. This makes sense if one realizes that 75% of their compensation consists of share awards and stock options.I am considering writing in more detail about the insider selling at Salesforce but will evaluate after observing the reactions to this article. Another interesting venue is to put the revenue recognition principles applied by Salesforce under the microscope, as it reports not just revenue, but also ""deferred revenue"" and even ""unbilled deferred revenue"".To answer the third question concerning which of the two versions is more accurate in presenting the true underlying results, I am personally in favor of including these costs in whichever result the company presents. The reality is that both IFRS and GAAP will force a company to do so for the reasons described above. To present investors, some of whom may not have advanced accounting knowledge, with another version that excludes this item amongst other things, is potentially misleading.The bigger theme here is how much freedom companies should have in presenting alternative versions of results. Salesforce gives one final reason for presenting non-GAAP results: its competitors are doing it as well. The last thing we need is a creative accounting race to the bottom, and regulators and accounting standard setters should guard against wiggle room that may impair the transparency and reliability of financial statements."
3267545,48411,2015-06-18T10:16:38-04:00,"CRM has released the first of what should be many to come applications for its Wave platform.The first offering, Sales Wave Analytics, is a mobile data and analytics offering that is meant to help manage sales pipeline tracking.CRM's BI platform is young but it will face huge and able competition - I think primarily from Microsoft.Still, CRM could spend to mesh together a very best of breed BI platform if it so desires - the question is will it?Continue to own both CRM and Microsoft while hoping a deal gets done - it would make both much more competitive.","salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is out with its first app for Wave, its data and analytics platform, with the introduction of Sales Wave Analytics - an app that ""will allow sales leaders to manage forecasts, pipelines, team performance and more to accelerate business growth (SOURCE: salesforce.com Sales Wave Analytics PR)"". Primarily though, I surmise this app was built with the pipeline management use case in mind. Still, this is a highly useful, highly visible value-add app that is a safe way for salesforce to demonstrate the concept of the coming broader app portfolio. Which is an important hurdle for salesforce to jump if it plans to gain any serious traction in the uber-competitive space.That said, am I excited about this? No.Do I think this is a needle mover? Not right now and not as-is.I'll explain why.First, salesforce is really, really late to this game and that's been well-advertised. For it to be able to capture the interest in the space, which again has been highly fragmented, it's going to need to at least be on-par with other major enterprise names - I would say a good comparable for salesforce to aspire to equal would be Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with its Power BI and Power BI Designer platforms. That's just on the data, analytics, and data visualization side, which is what Sales Wave Analytics is targeting. Longer term, salesforce wants to be involved in the Project Management and Collaboration game as evidenced by Chatter and the broader Wave platform. For salesforce to compete there it should aspire to compete with Microsoft's Project.So, salesforce has a long road ahead of it and a road filled with adequate and growing stronger players. That's not to say that salesforce isn't well-equipped to tackle the challenge, it is, it's just to say that there are fine platforms already being utilized in the BI/Project Management/Data Visualization space that unless salesforce is willing to go to war with (specifically I'm alluding to not allowing CRM integration with non-ecosystem platforms or demanding exclusivity when it comes to integrations with partners) will be hard to unseat.But like I said, Sales Wave Analytics is a good entry and it's a safe entry. It's a firm handshake but not one where salesforce squeezed too tight. It's comforting. It's teasing. How salesforce follow this up will be the real benchmark for how the Wave platform is going to fill out.Sales Wave Analytics isn't going to have any take outside of existing salesforce CRM users that want to have a single provider for the BI that this app addresses. Outside of that, there's no reason to switch from really any of the wide circulation BI/Project Management/Data Visualization space apps that provide what this app is offering.But, assuming that salesforce has contributed considerable resources to this endeavor since announcing it in mid-October 2014 and assuming salesforce wants to regularly roll-out its apps in a near-term window I think salesforce could buy itself into becoming a reasonable player in the general space if it gets aggressive with acquisitions. salesforce certainly has the money, finishing last quarter with over $1 billion in C&CE and marketable securities it could absolutely package together a very nice, very best of breed productivity suite of technology to mesh together into a formidable BI solution.The question is does salesforce want to do this and/or is it arrogant enough to think that it has a last mover advantage? It doesn't by the way.I think that the big missing piece to the Microsoft ecosystem is salesforce and big missing piece to the salesforce ecosystem is BI and all the ancillary capacity, something Microsoft is continuing to show that it has a knack for. That's why that deal should have gone through the first time and should definitely go through the second time. I think with salesforce rolling out its BI entry there's no denying the synergistic overlap between the two companies anymore.If salesforce really does intend to stand-alone as a company it should spend to accelerate its BI capacity as fast as possible.I continue to recommend a long position in both salesforce and Microsoft.Good luck everybody."

LiveIntent offers a fascinating (highly polarizing for those determining its value to housing platforms - salesforce.com in this case) platform that uses end-user specific identifiers and data to dial-in email proximity marketing at the time the email is opened, not when the email is sent.Those are two big differentiators to be clear on, that we're talking about intent based advertisements and advertising that are not interruption based. I think the salesforce.com integration is big in that the proximity marketing is intent based AND I think that's the sole reason salesforce.com chose to integrate at all. I'll clarify.To be perfectly clear, LiveIntent advertisements come in the form of email skins or whitespace fillers - the advertisements are not disruptive or directly distracting, at least according to feedback data that LiveIntent has gathered. LiveIntent also offers a programmatic delivery of customer owned (in this case salesforce.com's customers) advertising inventory as well. This means that the customer (again, salesforce.com's customers) can choose to use LiveIntent to programmatically deliver its own ads or it can choose to create revenue via delivery of outside party ads. In either case, so far LiveIntent has shown metrics that are impressive and that should benefit salesforce.com customers (at least those metrics that have been made public).salesforce.com doesn't need help from anybody. I think its market cap and its dominant positioning in the CRM space speaks to that pretty clearly. That said, it still chose to integrate with LiveIntent which means it desired the integration. Again, I think the sole reason for this is that the email proximity marketing offered by LiveIntent isn't simply guess work marketing. It's relevant marketing that has higher click through rates, ""10X engagement"" when skins are deployed, and ""28 seconds"" of view time (data sourced from a LiveIntent presentation at LiveIntent.com - data gathered by LiveIntent via salesforce.com, HubSpot, Marketo, etc.).As LiveIntent CEO Matt Keiser phrases it, ""it practically rivals television"". That might be a bit of hyperbole but LiveIntent is clearly on to something if salesforce.com is taking notice.So how does this benefit salesforce.com customers?Well, the ability to use data and analytics to advertise is never a bad thing. LiveIntent allows salesforce.com customers to not deploy pre-set advertisements but to advertise using all the tools of modern technology in real-time. This helps them avoid banner blindness for prop advertisements, position content with core-content strengthening value-add items (think Microsoft sending an email about the new Xbox while wrapping the email in a new sporting-game skin to a user that has data gathered that says he or she likes sports), and helps the email itself become more visible in general. All are good things.Then there's also the fact that salesforce.com customers can recoup costs that are normally sunk in email deployment. With email typically being a loss leader from an advertisement and engagement standpoint the ability to in-email advertise can incrementally contribute back to the breakeven of the effort. Potentially allowing the customer to do more or to simply not have a negative contribution margin from the initiative.But without a doubt the single largest value-add of the integration is the ""integration"" of new tech to the old tech emailing. Using those CRM notes, using that collected data, and using the entirety of the customer's journey to better target and make more effective the actual touch point. The ability for the programmatic, RTB platform from LiveIntent to increase efficacy levels is only as good as the data inputs its pulling from - inputs that are all within the salesforce.com platform. This should do well to strengthen the already strong value-prop of the CRM offered and make even stickier the CRM.That's a good thing for salesforce.com and those invested.So while this might have seemed like just another incremental integration, because of the uniqueness of the LiveIntent offering, it certainly isn't. This is now another hurdle a salesforce.com customer has to jump to exit the ecosystem.Continue to be long CRM.Good luck everybody."
3211006,24663,2015-05-26T09:23:49-04:00,"CRM reportedly turned down an offer from MSFT at $55 billion.
        CRM wanted $70 billion.
        CRM's market leading presence in CRM, its market share growth, and the outlook for the industry likely explains its request for more money.","There's a new report from CNBC that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was willing to dish out $55 billion for Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Apparently, Salesforce.com sees itself as worth closer to $70 billion, which likely explains why Microsoft, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and SAP (NYSE:SAP) have all been quoted as saying the price tag for Salesforce.com is too expensive. Personally, I thought $50 billion was too high, but there is a legitimate reason that Salesforce.com thinks it's worth every penny and then some.That reason is its leading position in customer relationship management, or CRM, through software-as-a-service, or SaaS offerings. This is the process of companies strengthening and improving their sales efforts; customer relations used to be done via on-premise IT, but is quickly becoming dominated by the cloud. And Salesforce.com is the unquestioned leader.All things considered, anyone who has ever heard of Salesforce.com is familiar with CRM and the fact that it is the market leader. But what's really impressive is how fast this industry is growing, and how Salesforce.com is head-and-shoulders above anyone else in the space; it could be said that Salesforce.com dominates this arena.Gartner's latest research, confirms as much, showing that Salesforce.com controls 18.2% of this market. The worldwide CRM market grew 13.3% to $23.2 billion last year, and nearly half of that market was from SaaS applications, which is the area where Salesforce.com makes its money. Now here's the thing, in this $23.2 billion market growing 13.3% is where Salesforce.com owns an 18.2% share, it actually grew revenue over 28% year-over-year. That means it actually gains market share, increasing to the 18.2% share in 2014 from just 16.1% in 2013. In other words, Salesforce.com is showing no signs of slowing down.Furthermore, Salesforce.com is creating more seperation from the rest of the pack. SAP and Oracle own 12.1% and 9.1% of the CRM market, respectively. Last year, SAP grew its CRM revenue just 7.2% and Oracle saw sales rise 2.6%. This means that Salesforce.com gained more market share while its only legitimate competitors lost share.Why does this matter? Right now just $11 billion of the CRM market is generated from SaaS-based applications, 47%. By 2018 that market will be worth almost $20 billion as on-premise CRM solutions drop to 38% of the total CRM market, down from 53% today. On a bigger note, the SaaS enterprise application market, which includes CRM, will become a $50.8 billion market by 2018, a market that Salesforce.com currently dominates with a 14.3% share according to IDC.In other words, Salesforce.com has robust growth opportunities ahead, with a clear path for CRM revenue to increase from $4.25 billion in 2014 to at least $7.25 billion in 2018. Importantly, that's modeling that Salesforce.com doesn't gain any additional market share, which is unlikely given its past and the lagging performance of SAP and Oracle. If Salesforce.com's remaining business grows at the same rate, revenue of $9 billion by 2018 doesn't seem like a far reach.That said, these models and projections only go until 2018, but the important thing to keep in mind is that SaaS applications in CRM is expected to keep rising, and Salesforce.com's opportunity to grab even more market share in the years beyond 2018 is significant.With nearly $580 million in trailing 12-month free cash flow and over $1.4 billion in cash from operations, Salesforce.com's operations are very profitable. As its revenue rises from $5.3 billion the last 12 months to $9 billion during the next three years, those profits should only rise, especially if Salesforce.com is acquired by a big tech company that wants to optimize its operations. Nevertheless, Salesforce.com seems to be asking for eight times 2018's expected revenue and 75 times 2018's free cash flow (assuming the margin doesn't increase). While that's a lofty premium, it's not unprecedented in the world of fast-growing tech, and not considering how fast it is adding to its leading market share. As a result, I can see why Salesforce.com believes it is worth $70 billion, I am just not sure that any acquirer will."
3206996,66283,2015-05-23T18:40:54-04:00,"Salesforce.com latest earnings were very strong as the company grew revenue, earnings and deferred revenue above expectations.Profitability is looking good for CRM so far this year as the company is nearly to GAAP operating profits.Questions still remain for us as to how well the company's long-term profitability will do in the long-run.","OverviewAfter the company's latest round of earnings this week, we wanted to revisit our Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) analysis that we put together in mid-April in light of the earnings and developments since the last post. Our last article touched on the changing image of Salesforce as an investment from a high-growth tech pioneer to a more mature tech business with less erratic wild growth and attention moving toward turning profits. Our overall assessment was that the questions of this shift remained too large to pay the premium that shares were harboring as of last writing at 10-11x price/book value. Since that article, book value is now nearing 12x and price/sales is nearing 9.Thesis ReviewTo start, let's take a review of our FY2016 outlook for Salesforce. Our main thesis surrounded about how the company began making a shift in the last few quarters to focus and talking more about its bottom line as its top ine was more consistent and less flashy (not that its 20%-plus revenue wasn't flashy). Yet, the company's FY16 was expected to drop significantly from previous year's rates, and the question became is the market ready and is CRM ready to deliver a lower growth rate with better bottom line presence.As we noted:The company's lower revenue and shift toward the bottom line was noted as the most important factor to watch in the coming FY. As Benioff said:As we move forward this year, the potential for profits and how the company does in turning a consistent profit will be crucial to the value of shares as well as our pricing analysis of the company.Another major factor that we believe is crucial to watch for 2015 (FY16) was a more diversified revenue stream. The company's SaaS business has been the main dominant revenue force, but new products are expected to become a larger part of the total pie moving forward. The company's new Analytics Cloud and attention to putting analytics into its business is a major potential growth input. As we noted:The push into analytics shows more growth and maturity for the Salesforce business as they innovate, develop new features and are producing a business ecosystem where they can establish an economic moat of integrated in-house products that speak to each other and continue to build off the core service (a la Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) advertising revenue and its ecosystem it has built to service it). The other aspect of the analytics push is that the company is looking at two main types of data - structured versus unstructured, which is a competitive advantage as most analytics firms are focusing on one or the other.The other main input that we were looking at as a main question for this year is rising competition. Cost of Marketing and Sales has risen at about revenue for quite some time as the cost of doing business in the CRM world is expensive. There's a lot of competition out there in the marketplace, and companies are spending a lot to try and catch up. As we noted:As we take a look at earnings and recent news, we want to look at these key factors for our investigation. These three parts of the equation are what really matter to us, and we would like to see a reduction in expenses to bring that bottom line up, how the company's Analytics program is progressing, and survey some of the competition.Earnings UpdateThe company's latest earnings came in a bit better than expected. The company saw a 23% increase in revenue versus what was expected to be 22%, and they beat analyst estimates on $1.51B revenue and 0.16 EPS (estimates were 0.14). The company also raised its full-year outlook for revenue to $6.22 - $6.25B, an increase of 20%-plus in revenue year/year. Additionally, the company had another strong unbilled deferred revenue quarter at $6B in Q1, which was up 25% year/year.How about the earnings movement for the company?The company turned an actual operating profit of $33M. The company has long been turning profits in its non-GAAP mode, but this quarter the company turned a true positive operating income. Yet, that operating profit was generated from a one-time benefit of a lease termination. Yet, the company was able to turn nearly breakeven performance without that termination benefit. One of the best signs of attention to profits and pushing for positive and growing ROIC was that the company's growth of marketing and sales was much lower than it has been. The company saw a 15% jump in those operating costs, but it was not as strong as their 22% jump in overall revenue. In fact, no part of operating costs outpaced revenue growth - a positive sign for a company that's moving towards maturity.The company's stronger than expected growth is pretty positive as the comps the company is coming up against are strong and they continue to outperform. The deferred revenue growth also is quite impressive as another 25% jump in revenues that will likely be on the books is a positive trend. Some analysts take this number to mean too much, but if it's trending up, not down, it will mean more future business, not less (and that's a good thing).When asked about the operating expenses moving forward, CFO Mark Hawkins responded:Operating margin expansion needs to continue, but we are seeing a positive that the company is able to see a strong deferred revenue growth of 25%, overall revenue growth of 22% and declining expenses. That shows a company that will be able to grow bottom line without its top line suffering, especially in the wake of heavy competition.How about the company's analytics?Here were some comments on it during the latest earnings call:The company did not break out performance numbers for Analytics for now, but it is looking at least anecdotally very strong. We would like to see some break out on this product, but things so far seem very beneficial. The company is integrating the product with other services as well as other technologies, and overall, analytics will definitely be an interesting driver moving forward. More exact numbers rather than ""cheerleading"" will help our assessment though.Finally, what about competition? Benioff claimed during the call that they were outpacing their competition. Is that true? Microsoft's commercial cloud business grew 106% in the latest quarter. Oracle's SaaS and PaaS business was up 30%, and IBM saw its cloud service up 65%. I think Benioff's comments were more about how fast the company has grown, but other companies are seeing their SaaS starting to grow quickly as well. The benefit to CRM is that they are growing as well, and the pie is huge for this industry. Further, CRM has growth overall whereas most of these businesses have weak, fledgling divisions that are hurting them dramatically overall.It was a strong earnings report that seems to show the company performing at a high level and delivering on a lot of key areas. Competition is rising, but the company's analytics combination is going to be a very beneficial aspect of their business that we believe will help them continue to grow.Conclusion - The Bull Case and The Bear CaseTo us, our bull and bear case remain the same right now. The company's business life cycle is starting to shift and mature. Yet, the company's need to generate profits is crucial to generating free cash flow, which is how the company can be judged. We believe the company has a lot of upside if they can start to produce some earnings growth, but right now, where the profitability will go remains. The question is how fast will it be and will it hit revenue as that competition increases. For us, we aren't sure, and that seems like a pretty big question to pay nearly 12x book value for a share today. Thus, we want to take a wait and see approach from an investor standpoint. The strength of the company is undeniable, but does that strength translate into long-term stock returns if I buy today? The company is very strong, but it remains hard to judge for a more than single year trade."
3201336,73185,2015-05-21T01:56:11-04:00,"Salesforce.com's dominant position in the CRM SaaS space, which is expected to be the fastest growing space in the cloud market, makes the company an enticing takeover target.Despite its strategic positioning, Salesforce.com is simply too expensive to be a realistic takeover target for bidders like Microsoft or Oracle.According to our estimates using a WACC discount rate in a DCF model, Salesforce.com is worth about $40 billion, and that's what we believe the company is worth to bidders.","Recently, there have been rumors circulating that tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are interested in a potential takeover of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM).We believe that, at Salesforce.com's current market value, such a transaction would be harmful for any buyer.Salesforce.com currently trades at roughly $74 a share, giving the cloud computing giant a market cap of roughly $46.5 billion and an enterprise value of $47.8 billion. The stock isn't cheap by any metric, trading at 87x trailing EBITDA and 81x 2017E earnings, which gives it a 2.5 PEG using the analyst consensus 2017 growth rate of 31.90%. While the company has seen revenue grow 33% over the past 3 years, Salesforce.com is still unprofitable.Why, then, are tech giants and cash-cows like Microsoft and Oracle looking to acquire an unprofitable, expensive, yet large tech business like Salesforce.com? The answer lies in the cloud.In short, Salesforce.com is the dominant player in the largest component (Customer Relationship Management - CRM) of the highest growth sector (Software as a Service - SaaS) in the highest growth space (Cloud Computing) in the tech world going forward.The transition from antiquated, complex, and expensive software and hardware products to the novel, largely misunderstood, but largely ""accepted-as-the-future"" cloud is already occurring, and this transition is expected to accelerate over the next five years and further.In order to understand why the cloud is expected to dominate the tech market in the near future, we must understand what the cloud is and what advantages it holds over traditional software and hardware products.The cloud is more or less a central data storage facility - as opposed to storing and managing data on data located on your computer, you are storing and managing data located at a central data storage facility (the cloud) and calling it to your computer when needed. This scalable architecture offers several advantages to users.Advantages of the cloud can be expressed succinctly in four points:The huge advantage of the cloud is seen in costs. The cloud is a shared infrastructure, much similar to a utility. You only pay for what you need or use, usually via monthly or annual subscriptions, and upgrades to cloud services are automatic and applied to all users using the cloud service. This is very different to traditional software & hardware products, where you pay for the whole software or hardware package and have to manually install the updates. Moreover, the cloud eliminates the need for physical storage or the hiring of an IT team, further cutting costs.The convenience advantage and space advantage can be explained by one simple sentence - the cloud is easy to start, use, and manage, and an entire business can be run from a single computer, since the data is stored on the cloud.The security advantage is exemplified by the cloud's multi-tenancy architecture. The cloud is very similar to a huge commercial building with several tenants (users). In this sense, the cloud's multi-tenancy architecture offers unprecedented scalability and security for stored data.Analysts and research groups alike expect computing cloud technology to experience exponential growth over the next five years.Goldman Sachs not only expects the cloud computing infrastructure market to be roughly three-fold its current size by 2018, but also expects cloud computing costs to account for nearly 11% of total enterprise IT spending by 2018 (up from roughly 5% in 2014).Computerworld, a business technology publication, believes 42% of IT decision makers are planning to increase spending on cloud computing services in 2015. Further, 52% of IT decision makers at companies with more than 1,000 employees are planning to increase spending on cloud computing services in 2015. This speaks to the scalability and cost advantages of the cloud - the larger a company gets, the greater the necessity for having consolidated, cost-effective network of data storage.The growth isn't just domestic, as evidence by the following forecasts from Ovum. By 2016, Ovum predicts that over 80% of enterprises globally will be using IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud technology.Cloud computing infrastructure can be segmented into three services: SaaS (Software as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).According to Cisco Global Cloud Index, SaaS, with a 33% CAGR, is expected to be the fastest growing service of the cloud (24% CAGR) into 2018.SaaS can be further segmented into two equal parts. The important part here is that CRM (Customer Relationship Management) services account for 50% of SaaS services. CRM comprises all interactions a company has with its consumers, including B2B (business to business) and B2C (business to customer) relationships.And here is where we see Salesforce.com's ostensible value to bidders like Microsoft and Oracle. Salesforce.com, with a 16% market share, is the clear front-runner in the CRM cloud space.Using Cisco Global Index's growth estimates for the SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, and overall cloud sector into 2018, we can quantify what Salesforce.com's position as the favored CRM SaaS software company means for the top line of the company (compared to Microsoft, who offers PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS services with its cloud enterprise suite).If we assume Salesforce can grow revenues in line with SaaS market expectations (33% CAGR) and Microsoft can grow its commercial cloud revenues in line with cloud market expectations (24% CAGR), we can see that the difference in each company's cloud top line diverge over time with Salesforce.com notching nearly $3 billion more in revenue from cloud services than Microsoft, on a trailing twelve month basis.These figures force us to recall a recent statement from Microsoft targeting a $20 billion run-rate for its commercial cloud by fiscal 2018. Looking at the numbers above, it just doesn't make sense that Microsoft can get to that run-rate without acquiring Salesforce.com. To better understand this, refer to the following chart, which is our analysis of what Microsoft's commercial cloud segment top-line CAGR would have to be in order to reach the targeted $20 billion run-rate by fiscal 2018, both by itself and with a potential acquisition of Salesforce.com.We can see that Microsoft, without a Salesforce.com acquisition, would have to grow its commercial cloud segment at roughly 44%, a little less than double the market's expected CAGR, to reach a $20 billion run-rate by FY18 (we assume baseline $17 billion in FY18 rev, from $4B + $4B + $4B + $5B, in sequential quarter revenue).With a Salesforce.com acquisition, however, that CAGR drops to 15.22%, below the market's CAGR. This highly suggests that the only way Microsoft reaches its $20 billion run-rate target by FY18 is through an acquisition of Salesforce.com.All these qualitative and quantitative reasons are why Microsoft and others would make a bid for Salesforce.com, and the type of value a Salesforce.com acquisition could add to the top line of these companies over the next few years.But is the price-tag on Salesforce.com worth it? In M&As, the bidder pays premium for shares of the company being bought out. Merrill Lynch thinks Salesforce.com shares could sell for as much as $92, while Credit Suisse values Salesforce.com's takeover value between $81 and $88 per share.Our analysis leads us to believe that Salesforce.com's fair takeover value could be roughly $87 per share, but we believe the assumptions that lead us to this takeover value are unreasonable. More reasonable assumptions lead us to believe Salesforce.com shares are worth only about $64 to bidders, valuing the company at roughly $40 billion.We get to our takeover value based on a 4-year DCF analysis using a WACC discount rate. We find Salesforce.com's WACC to be 9.05% using the following math:To get to an $87 takeover value, we assumed that Salesforce.com grows revenues at a 33% CAGR into 2018 (in line with the SaaS market) and benefits from some operating cost-saving synergies from a merger with Microsoft which should be effective immediately. Our work can be shown in the following figure.We do not believe, however, that a Microsoft merger will ensure a top-line CAGR of 33% for Salesforce.com, and thus do not believe Microsoft should pay $55 billion for Salesforce.com (a 17% premium on current market value).A merger will imply some cost-saving synergies, but that is exactly where the synergies end and become de-synergies. Companies like Microsoft and Oracle don't mesh with companies like Salesforce.com. Big and old companies don't mesh well with small and new companies in the tech industry - cultures clash, business values are devalued, and the core of what made Salesforce.com successful is quickly lost in the M&A shuffle. And there aren't enough cost-saving synergies for Microsoft or Oracle to break even on the EPS dilution from paying $55 billion for an unprofitable business.We do, however, recognize that there is some substantial value in adding the industry leading CRM SaaS provider for companies like Oracle and Microsoft who are looking to expand and grow their cloud businesses to stay relevant as their hardware and software businesses slowly bleed out.So how much is Salesforce.com worth to these bidders? We believe that Salesforce.com can grow revenues in line with cloud-market CAGR (24%), but not at a rate higher than that. Salesforce.com already has deep penetration into the cloud space, specifically the CRM SaaS space. Salesforce.com should also see slowed top-line growth due to increase competition from deeper-pocketed competitors like Microsoft and Oracle. As detailer earlier, a merger, while providing cost-saving synergies, risks personnel, cohesion, and culture problems, which could adversely impact top-line growth.These assumptions can be represented in the following figure, where we show our steps leading to a $64 per share takeover value for Salesforce.com.Our suggestion to Microsoft, Oracle, Amazon, and others interested in a bid for Salesforce.com: it's not worth anything north of $50 billion. None of these companies could get an earnings yield that justifies for paying a premium on $50 billion.Our DCF analysis indicates Salesforce.com is worth about $40 billion, and that is about what the company is worth to bidders like Microsoft and Oracle."
3146296,24276,2015-05-06T09:03:58-04:00,Only Oracle or Microsoft have the engineering talent to make a deal work.The deal would be highly dilutive to either one.This looks like rumors spread to prevent a deal and get a quick profit for traders.,"Arbitrageurs have created a bidding war over salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) where no such war even seems possible.Right now, Salesforce is being valued by the market at $45 billion. This for a company that last year had revenues of $5.3 billion but has not shown a profit since 2011.The valuation fairly screams for a mostly-stock deal, which would be dilutive for the acquirer, and there are only two companies with the technical infrastructure needed to turn a profit on those sales - Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). That's because Salesforce services run on Oracle hardware and software, and have lately been engineered to run on Microsoft's Azure cloud.Assume for the sake of argument that one of these companies were able to take out Salesforce at its present price, without a premium, which isn't going to happen. Microsoft would be adding roughly 6% to its sales in exchange for almost 13% of its equity. Oracle would get about a 12% sales bump but dilute its stockholders by as much as 25% - the price would more than wipe out its cash and short-term investments as of February, which stood at $43.8 billion.Who is going to do that?OK, the arbs say, how about SAP (NYSE:SAP)? Salesforce would give SAP a total cloud solution, lots of growth opportunities, and a stab in the heart of Oracle's future. But SAP itself is worth just $93 billion - a deal with Salesforce would practically be a merger of equals. And it could cost SAP billions to get Salesforce off Oracle hardware, with Oracle in no mood to negotiate terms.Crazy.OK, what about IBM (NYSE:IBM)? With a market cap of $171 billion, IBM could do a deal, and might get a benefit if it were, in effect, an acqui-hire, with Benioff taking over the CEO slot from the deeply-unpopular (with stock buyers) Ginni Rometty. But there's only $8 billion in cash on IBM's books. This would have to be a highly-dilutive, all-stock deal, representing a top-line gain of 6% and no bottom line improvement in exchange for over one-quarter of the company's equity. You may be able to get away with such crazy talk in Silicon Valley, where corporate chess pieces are moved about willy-nilly, but not in Armonk.Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ)? That company is worth $61 billion, and it's in the process of splitting itself in two, with printers going one way and enterprise work going the other. Frankly it's more likely that Salesforce would want to buy the HP Enterprise piece, getting all those salesmen and programmers, but it would be crazy to even consider it.So we're back to Oracle and Microsoft, which could at least integrate Salesforce into existing operations. It is one thing for someone at Microsoft to say they are looking at the company. It is another thing entirely to pull the trigger on a bid that is sure to get the antitrust lawyers busy, that would be dilutive to existing shareholders, and that would let Oracle and SAP spend months poaching customers willy-nilly.My guess all along is that Salesforce executives have been playing along with these rumors specifically to avoid a takeover. By sending the stock to the present heights, they make a takeover unaffordable. Eventually, they can put that to bed and get back to work, leaving the arbs with egg on their faces and losses on their books.That's an outcome everyone in Silicon Valley can get behind."
3135516,39301,2015-05-04T10:46:04-04:00,"Salesforce is looking to get acquired, according to recent reports from Bloomberg. Microsoft is one of the most widely cited candidate for such a deal.Satya Nadella should have no problem with securing the support of the board, as he has a lot of experience in cloud and enterprise (he can integrate the two companies).Satya Nadella is a part of the board, and has strategically positioned Microsoft to grow both cloud and mobile revenue.Over the long run, Microsoft can argue the mathematics behind such a deal without sounding unrealistic, or overly optimistic in its reasoning.Microsoft sits on $85.4 billion in cash. Very few opportunities could leverage the scale of Microsoft's cash pile (Salesforce is that rare exception).","I've heard of crazy technology rumors in the past, but it's been a while since I've heard of something as crazy as a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) marriage. It seems feasible by the numbers, and by the looks of it, Satya Nadella has unanimous support by the board to pursue acquisitions, make strategic decisions, and return the company to growth. If Satya can argue the merits to Bill Gates, and a couple other major stakeholders in the company, the deal has some feasibility.But strategically, is it worth the risk for Microsoft?Yes, and here's whyThere are only two other companies that can really afford to take this risk, and those two companies are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Microsoft can't risk losing its edge in commercial software licensing to its two major competitors, so it has to at least consider the deal, despite its scale, and despite the lack of CRM's profitability.Google and Apple will eye the situation closely, as they're not very good at charging money for software. They're really good at monetizing a marketplace for software, but they don't have a software business that appeals to a broad customer base of business users. Google doesn't charge anything for its software, and Apple doesn't either. They're both commodity providers of software, and quite frankly, only Microsoft and a few other companies are really proficient at direct software monetization. Microsoft needs to build out this moat even further, and quite frankly, it can do this by reducing the number of competitors it has to compete with.According to Gartner, Microsoft had 7% market share in the customer relationship management space, and Salesforce had 16% market share. Unifying the product offering by creating integration into various other Microsoft products, and offering bulk licensing discounts in conjunction with Azure, Windows Enterprise, and various other software-as-a-service products could give Microsoft added leverage to gain a significant market position in various software verticals.I anticipate accretion from such a deal over time, as Microsoft can lower the rate at which it outlays its cost, even as revenue for the combined division grows at a 20% to 30% CAGR. For all we know, the segment could grow at an even faster rate assuming a broader software bundle can appeal to a broad base of business customers. If market share figures were to improve, the growth rate would most likely accelerate, as a larger software bundle will have more appeal to business customers.Speculation mounts on the sell-sideI can imagine the rumors to have legs if reputable research organizations like JPMorgan and PiperJaffray are willing to opine on the topic.Here's the logic presented by JPMorgan:There's compatibility in the culture of both organizations; therefore, morale-draining layoffs are unlikely. Microsoft can use the added human capital from software design and sales. If there are too many software engineers working on overlapping projects, Microsoft can assign software engineers to emerging projects, and reallocate the sales organization to handle other growth areas inside of the company like Office 365, Bing, and consumer electronics. Adding in the workforce from Salesforce into Microsoft's employee base will diminish the need for Microsoft to hire additional employees, and gives Microsoft further depth in terms of its overall employee pool. In Silicon Valley it's really difficult to hire and retain high quality employees, so gaining an entire organization gives Microsoft significant operating leverage, because it can improve profitability over time, while it increases efficiency. Unlike other industries, software business models tend to have really high margins, so building cost efficiencies seems feasible. Combining Salesforce's software cloud, with Microsoft's pre-existing server infrastructure may also result in unanticipated cost synergies as well.I anticipate Salesforce.com to generate a 25% CAGR over the next five years in terms of sales. For sake of estimation, that would imply revenue of around $16.13 billion. Assuming Microsoft can reduce operating costs as the business increases its volume, CRM alone could generate a 25% profit margin, which would translate into $4.075 billion in net income. I think revenue ramp will cause margins to widen, as costs won't scale as quickly as revenue.Microsoft is notoriously disciplined with its cash spend, and has an established track record of turning losing operations into reasonably profitable business divisions (just look at the transformation of Nokia (NYSE:NOK)). I think higher profit margins are attainable, due to Microsoft's lowered effective tax rate, as a result of Irish tax laws. Admittedly, these laws could change over the next couple years, though I reckon Ireland has little incentive to change its tax code.Microsoft may need to acquire CRM at around $50 billion, and assuming those future earnings get the conglomerate discount, the added $4 billion will likely be valued at Microsoft's earnings multiple. Microsoft has really high quality earnings, so investors may price the stock at an even higher premium over the next five years. So if the incremental earnings from CRM are valued at around 20x, the valuation for the acquired business segment could grow from $50 billion to $81.5 billion over the next five years.Microsoft sits on $85.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company has grown its cash position by $10 billion per year, so the company has a ton of flexibility to both pursue acquisitions and return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Therefore unlocking some of the value in the balance sheet through a major acquisition of this scale could make sense for the company. It's not exactly clear how shareholders will respond. However, Microsoft has a really great track record of growing nascent business units into massive business ventures. So, shareholder buy-in seems likely.Microsoft's gaming and consumer electronics business would probably qualify for the fortune 500, and those aren't Microsoft's biggest business units in terms of revenue or earnings. The company is really massive, and I have reasonable suspicion that it can afford to absorb a couple additional companies, even if they were on the scale of Salesforce, as the company can pursue a combined cash and stock transaction. I think the dilutive effects would be offset with cash, increasing Microsoft's goodwill balance. The combined organization would probably fetch a market cap of $450 billion, as combining business units tends to put upward momentum into the combined valuation of companies so as long as institutional investors believe in the long-term accretion possibilities, which is already evidenced by the sell-side commentary.ConclusionI think there's a decent likelihood that Microsoft will leverage some of its cash, especially if it can put together reasonable numbers for shareholders to sink their teeth into. Operationally, Microsoft has a lot of control, and quite frankly, building a reasonable break-even analysis that takes into consideration operational leverage through cost synergies, and incremental margin improvements wouldn't require rocket science. It's just plain accounting, and quite frankly, the presentation material will likely be convincing enough so as to get buy-in from the Microsoft board and major institutional shareholders. Of course, we've seen bad business deals in the tech M&A space, but this time around, Microsoft's operational excellence definitely mitigates some of the agency risk.There could be further upside for CRM stockholders. Receiving Microsoft shares in a cash and stock transaction wouldn't be a bad thing, as Microsoft trades on solid fundamentals. Investors would get the immediate upside from a buy-out premium that could be 36% above CRM's most recent stock price, and would also get the benefit of long-term appreciation from owning Microsoft (assuming Microsoft can match the long-term returns of the S&P 500, which it most likely will).I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation on both Microsoft and Salesforce."
3121376,24663,2015-05-01T09:25:24-04:00,"CRM is reportedly on sale with an offer in the works.ORCL is considered the likely buyer.However, IBM is making big bets on its growth businesses, making it a potential acquirer.For this and other reasons, IBM might just be willing to take a big bet with CRM.","After reports of salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) seeking financial guidance in response to a takeover offer, most investors are assuming the acquirer to be Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Oracle is a business solutions software leader, creating natural synergies with an enterprise cloud company, and just recently launched a $10 billion debt offering, possibly for financing the acquisition. Also, Oracle recently said that it wants 95% of its products and services on the cloud by this year, up from 65% today, and has often expressed its desire to grow its cloud presence larger in applications. However, while Oracle would seem like the obvious acquirer, IBM (NYSE:IBM) might be the actual buyer.First off, IBM is very focused on its growth businesses, as evident in its Analyst Day earlier this year. At that event IBM unveiled a plan to shift $4 billion this year in spending to its growth businesses, and that it would increase revenue in these businesses from $25 billion to $40 billion by 2018. If so, organic growth and acquisitions must play a role. Since the cloud is IBM's fastest growing businesses, salesforce.com makes sense.Furthermore, IBM has proven itself to be very acquisitive in years past. Over a three year span IBM has spent $4.5 billion to acquire a dozen companies in the cloud, including SoftLayer for $2 billion. However, paying $50 billion plus for salesforce.com would definitely put IBM's cloud business on a different level, instantly making it a stronger software company.Specifically, both salesforce.com and IBM are enterprise service providers. IBM's on-premise IT business has suffered thanks to the rise of the cloud, and salesforce.com is one of those companies that has contributed to IBM's loss. Clearly, salesforce.com could would help IBM in hedging that loss. But also, it would strengthen IBM in all the areas of emphasis, infrastructure and platform as a service and data analytics while also giving it a new software-as-a-service, or cloud app business.All things considered, Oracle may be considered the frontrunner to buy salesforce.com, but I would not rest too easy on IBM. It has shown the same willingness to grow through acquisitions as Oracle, and I believe that investors are discounting IBM's willingness and desire for a return to growth. Currently, IBM's cloud business has performed well, now on a $3.8 billion revenue run rate for the next 12 months. That's up significantly from the $2.3 billion run rate this time last year, and represents a $500 million increase quarter-over-quarter.However, in a broader business that's expected to create $90 billion in sales this year, $3.8 billion is not that significant. But, incorporate salesforce.com and its expected $5.5 billion in revenue for 2015 and the cloud all of a sudden becomes very meaningful, maybe even strong enough to reverse revenue loss, for IBM. That would make the cloud 10% of IBM's business, and likely far more long-term.The result of buying salesforce.com could be increased sentiment, a higher stock price, and finally some excitement surrounding IBM. Thus, don't be surprised if IBM is the company making moves for salesforce.com, not Oracle."
3121136,25047,2015-05-01T08:56:38-04:00,"Rumor is running around that Salesforce.com is seeing takeover interest.One party which is rumored to possibly be interested is Oracle.This article explores what Oracle would look like if, indeed, it acquired Salesforce.com.","As I type this, the rumor is running around that Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) hired investment bankers to field possible takeover interest. One potential acquirer is said to be Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Salesforce.com stock is halted.So the question beckons: How would Oracle look like if it acquired Salesforce.com at, say, a 30% premium (so at around $87 per share, using yesterday's close)?Salesforce.com At $87At $87 per share, and using the latest diluted share count from its 10-K (651.5 million shares), Salesforce.com would have a market capitalization of $56.7 billion.Oracle, on the other hand, carries a present market capitalization of around $200 billion.If Oracle bought Salesforce.com using shares, it would lead to dilution of 28.3%.If the company bought Salesforce.com using cash at 4%/year, it would lead to interest costs of $2.3 billion per year.Earnings ImpactSalesforce.com has no GAAP earnings. Indeed, it posts losses, but let's be nice and consider it is at breakeven.If Oracle bought Salesforce.com using shares, its own earnings would be diluted over 28.3% more shares. So its TTM EPS would go from $2.41 to $2.10 per share. This would take TTM P/E from 18.5x to 21.2x.If Oracle bought Salesforce.com using cash, then it would suffer an additional interest cost of $2.3 billion per year (assuming financing at 4% - it would be a lot cheaper if using cash on hand, of course). This would turn into a $1.6 billion impact after tax, if we assume a 30% tax rate.So the $10.83 billion in TTM earnings would turn into $9.23 billion TTM earnings. Oracle's TTM P/E would go from 18.5x to 21.7x.Growth ImpactOracle had $38.84 billion in TTM revenues, and these are essentially stagnated. Salesforce.com would add $6.5 billion in revenues (FY2016 consensus).However, it would just add $1.14 billion in organic revenue growth. $1.14 billion on $38.84 billion in revenues would add organic growth of just 2.9%.The Positive Angle: SynergiesObviously, a deal like this wouldn't fly; so if such a deal is announced, it will come with a healthy dose of possible synergies. The easiest point where these might be achieved would be in Salesforce.com's famously high sales & marketing costs, which eat up around 50% of its revenues.If Oracle could eliminate half of these costs, then it would produce around $1.5 billion in pre-tax profit from Salesforce.com. This would be enough to eliminate nearly 2/3rds of the financing costs I considered above in my cash exercise. The deal would remain expensive, dilutive and would add little growth. But at least it wouldn't be outrageous.I, however, really doubt such extensive synergies can be achieved. Indeed, I doubt that these costs can be eliminated in any meaningful way.ConclusionIn short, Oracle would be trading a dilution of 28.3% of its shares for just 2.9% in revenue growth, and the deal would include significant earnings dilution.The company would become a whole lot more expensive and wouldn't grow a whole lot more. Its stock price would probably go down."
3204436,24663,2015-05-21T21:26:10-04:00,"CRM was reportedly approached by one, if not more, big technology company about an acquisition.However, three of those big technology companies have gone on the record saying that the company is too expensive.Given the overreaching nature of big tech, what should investors make of this?","Here's something interesting to ponder upon: If three big technology companies, all with tens of billions of dollars at their disposal, all say that Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is too expensive to buy, then isn't it priced too high for retail investors as well? Yes, Salesforce.com has a $50 billion valuation, but reportedly a big technology company was willing to dish out the payment to acquire it just last month. Since rumors of the company's acquisition first surfaced last month, SAP (NYSE:SAP), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) have all brushed off the possibility. To me, that's pretty telling for investors.Big tech is not just laughing off Salesforce.com buyout rumors with the typical ""no-answer"" response to questions. Management at all three aforementioned companies is straight-out telling us that Salesforce.com is just too darn expensive. SAP's CEO has gone on the record several times in the last few weeks. Most recently, the SAP CEO said, ""I do not expect that (acquisition) to be the case at all because of the valuation of the company."" He did not note Salesforce.com's growth prospects, its competitive edge, or a lack of synergies as the reason for SAP's lack of interest, only saying the company is too expensive.Oracle's CFO, Catz, shared a similar sentiment, saying, ""(Oracle is) not known to throw around money."" Catz then went on to say that if a competitor were to acquire Salesforce.com, ""(It) would be helpful to us"" - something that no executive would say if they felt that Salesforce.com could create strong synergies and a major competitive advantage with a key competitor. It's almost as if Catz were saying that Salesforce.com would actually hurt an acquirer, being too expensive, which would thereby help Oracle.While no one from Microsoft's camp has officially gone on the record, Reuters recently reported that the software giant is not weighing an offer, and that the company sees Salesforce.com as too expensive. Given Oracle and SAP's perspectives, this report from Reuters is likely correct.All things considered, big technology companies are notorious for rejecting M&A rumors or avoiding M&A-related questions and then making acquisitions soon after. However, never have I seen a company call into question a company's valuation and say straight up that a target is too expensive prior to making a bid. That would be like a retail investor knowingly investing in a company with limited upside and high downside - investing in a company that you know to be unworthy of its valuation.Ironically, sometimes a technology company will do just that. A company will reach to acquire an asset at a stretched premium because management believes that asset has something vital to the company's future. The most recent example is Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) purchase of WhatsApp for over $20 billion. In no way is WhatsApp worth $20 billion plus, but Facebook sees mobile and messaging as too big of an opportunity to pass on one of the world's largest ecosystems, and therefore, has tried to sell its investors on the logic behind the WhatsApp deal.As a result, if the most likely suitors for Salesforce.com are all saying that an acquisition is not going to happen, and are calling the company's valuation into question, then chances are it's too expensive and it won't be acquired. This is particularly alarming due to the growth expected in the public cloud over the next few years, with Forrester expecting it to become a $191 billion business by 2020 - up from $72 billion last year.In other words, Salesforce.com appears to be an asset that big tech would reach for. Yes, $50 billion is a big bet on the cloud, but to acquire the number one CRM company in the U.S., one with a competitive presence in infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service, seems like a good opportunity.Not to mention, Salesforce.com has over $800 million in 12-month free cash flow to complement a three-year compound annualized growth rate of 33% and expectations of 21% growth in each of the next two years. However, Oracle, SAP, and Microsoft know better than retail investors and analysts, and given the time that has passed since M&A rumors first originated, investors need to consider the fact that a buyout may not occur, and that these big tech companies might see something negative in the company that we are missing. Thus, why should retail investors buy into Salesforce.com at a valuation that not even overreaching big technology companies will entertain? They should not. It doesn't make sense."
3118826,24663,2015-04-30T18:29:47-04:00,"A large tech company is reportedly targeting CRM.CRM has a lot of concerns that could cause problems for the acquirer.WDAY would be a better acquisition target, and could be acquired itself.","Apparently, a big tech company is looking to acquire cloud specialist salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), a company whose market capitalization of $50 billion plus would make it the largest software acquisition in history. While the reasons a technology juggernaut would want to bolster its presence in the cloud makes sense, I believe that Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is a better buy, and that it becomes a very attractive takeover target if salesforce.com is purchased.A lot of people have trouble distinguishing the difference in cloud companies. We all know the terms infrastructure and platform as a service, made famous by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, and that companies like Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are mostly selling the same storage, application hosting platforms, and cloud computing services as their competitors. However, for cloud service providers like salesforce.com and Workday, the difference is night and day.salesforce.com and Workday provide platforms that focus on specific industries. From that platform a software cloud company can grow by expanding its product offerings, branching out into new industries and appealing to a larger enterprise customer base. That said, one of the big problems with salesforce.com is that it has lost this unique angle in the cloud, as it has elected to enter many of those same infrastructure and platform services that are sold by the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. Furthermore, salesforce.com has become a lot less specific in what it offers, somewhat losing its identity through dozens of acquisitions that have sparked growth and shareholder sentiment but also caused costs to skyrocket.In fact, one of my complaints with salesforce.com, and a big reason I think acquiring it is a bad idea, is because it's too hard to assess its real growth. For example, salesforce.com bought ExactTarget for $2.5 billion back in 2013, thereby entering the digital marketing space. Before that it bought BuddyMedia for $745 million to help grow its social media branding business, and last year spent $390 million to buy data analytics company RelateIQ. While acquisitions in technology are normal, I do think the acquisitive nature of salesforce.com, a company with $5 billion in revenue, can artificially inflate and make its growth appear better than reality. This also implies that organic growth is likely well below the 20% shareholders expect this year.Lastly, with salesforce.com being more diversified in the cloud, and having to manage many moving parts within its business, the company's spending has been out of control. In essence, salesforce.com has had to invest a lot of money in a lot of areas to find growth. As Seeking Alpha contributor Paulo Santos identified, marketing & sales costs as a percentage of new revenue has skyrocketed to over 210% from 162% over the last five years. Meanwhile, profits are nonexistent, a bit alarming for a company that has well over $5 billion in 12-month revenue.All things considered, Workday has a much more focused business approach in the $70 billion Human Resource Management space. Over time, Workday has gone from a company that just stored an enterprise customer's employee information and handled payroll to one that now uses big data to help companies recruit, determine appropriate compensation, and help a business cut costs. It has become a one stop shop for human resources as a platform that continues to evolve, and grow via service expansion with a well equipped ecosystem. .Some might think that Workday's focus on human resource management means a smaller market opportunity. But keep in mind, this is a $70 billion market that's growing fast. Furthermore, Workday has grown at a compound annualized rate of 80% over the last three years, and with a market share of just 3.5% it has the opportunity to gain a significantly larger piece of the HR management pie.Granted, despite Workday growing into a company that's on pace to create revenue well in excess of $1 billion this year, its market capitalization of $17 billion is a problem. To acquire Workday a company might have to pay $25 billion, and that's a lot for a billion dollar company. Therefore, to acquire Workday is to have complete confidence in its platform, and to know that it will one day control a large chunk of the HR management space, or more than 15%.Personally, I think Workday will one day own 15% of the HR management industry, and I think that because of its strong ecosystem it is a better acquisition than a salesforce.com whose revenue growth could slow considerably if acquisitions are no longer driving growth and spending slows to maximize profitability. Therefore, in a world where mobile applications are bought for over $20 billion, I think Workday's proven success leads to its acquisition if salesforce.com is acquired."
3122966,73565,2015-04-30T13:35:52-04:00,"If Salesforce were to be acquired, the SaaS ecosystem would change substantially.The number of large market cap companies capable of acquiring substantial SaaS startups would decline.Salesforce has spent $4.2B in the past five years in acquisitions greater than $100M.","Rumors swirled Wednesday that Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), the $40B SaaS behemoth, had been approached by an acquirer. Dan Primack speculated this morning that Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are the likely candidates. If Salesforce were to be acquired, the SaaS ecosystem would change substantially.Looking at the market caps and the balance sheets of the major enterprise acquirers, Microsoft could certainly acquire Salesforce outright in cash. Oracle would likely acquire the business in a cash & stock transaction.Most importantly, the number of large market cap companies capable of acquiring substantial SaaS startups would decline. In the past ten years, Salesforce has been the second most active acquirer of next-generation enterprise companies at greater than $100M, tied with IBM (NYSE:IBM) and second to Oracle.Salesforce acquires more frequently than most others, but their median purchase is smaller, about $400k compared to roughly $1B for the others. SAP (NYSE:SAP) is an outlier because of their Concur, SuccessFactors and Sybase acquisitions.In terms of total transaction value, Salesforce has spent $4.2B in the past five years in acquisitions greater than $100M, tied with Dell and VMWare (NYSE:VMW). Microsoft didn’t make the list because they’ve spent about $1.5B in the last five years on Yammer, Acompli and Sunrise.Salesforce is squarely in the middle of the pack when it comes to very large acquisitions, in this case ExactTarget at $2.6B.If Salesforce were to sell, the M&A landscape in the startup ecosystem would lose an active acquirer."
3072566,66283,2015-04-15T14:31:14-04:00,"salesforce.com is a clear leader in understanding and executing corporate sustainability.The company excels in areas such as employee benefits, LGBT equality, and community.The company needs to improve in its environmental stewardship as well as its diversity.","In this article, we look at the socially responsible investment side of salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). In our first article, we looked at the financial side of the software company to determine its investment potential as a traditional investment. We believe it is crucial that socially responsible investors look at both sides to find long-term investments that return value in both financial and social returns.Overall, CRM has a mostly mixed score. The company has been rated well for the importance it puts into its ethics, rated as a Most Ethical Company before by Ethisphere. Additionally, the company was recently a leader in challenging the state of Indiana, but the company has had mixed reviews in a number of areas including its governance, diversity, and environmental stewardship. The company's strengths are seen in employee benefits, LGBT equality, and community impact.Socially Responsible ScorecardThere are many ways to understand and develop socially responsible investing (SRI). What is ""responsible"" for each person is vastly different, and what might be ""responsible"" to one person might be ""irresponsible"" to others. That is the toughest part of investigating companies for SRI. While pure capitalism to some is the most responsible approach to business, others may see that this could harm other areas such as environmental stewardship or economic development. Others may believe too much capital invested into socially conscientious programs could hurt profits and investors. Therefore, we will try to present as much information as we can to render the best opinion possible.Overall, socially responsible investments are more about leadership and paving the way, rather than compliance. Compliance is doing what is required, while corporate responsibility is about leading and doing more than is required. Companies that lead are always the most respected in the long term, and we believe provide both a safe investment platform as well as peace of mind.The criteria we use to examine the company's overall social responsibility theme are gender equality, employment and diversity, environmental stewardship, leadership values and community involvement. With all research, some areas have more quantifiable parts, while in other areas, there is not as much. We base our research in taking an aggregate look at leading think tanks, research firms and important websites that cover these topics. We split this research into the aforementioned topics to help create a more holistic opinion.OverallOur typical findings for companies tend to show strengths in some areas and weaknesses in other areas that can be places for improvement. Our camp of SRI is that we believe that companies that show leadership in areas are those that we should commend while those that are simply complying are not pushing forward the role corporations can play in ethical development.In the case of salesforce, the company has been recognized in many years as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. Ethisphere looks at companies that think similarly and push the envelope of what corporate ethics means and push for leadership in this area. The fact that the company is recognized on this list does not mean they do not have areas that they need to improve, but these companies are often open-minded, transparent, working to improve areas of weakness, and have the infrastructure in place to improve.Interestingly, one of the other leaders in corporate responsibility is CSR Hub. CSR Hub ranks CRM at just above average on nearly every metric and below average on its Governance. The company gets 55/100 Overall, which is the average rating for companies on CSR Hub. In our findings, the company showed strength in its LGBT rights and progress it has made as an environmental stewardship. One of the areas that it has been criticized, though, is its very typical Silicon Valley negative diversity/gender equality as well as governance pay.Employment - Gender, Diversity, CompensationOverall, employment is a mixed bag for CRM. Silicon Valley, overall, has a clear issue with gender and diversity inclusion in its workforce that has been well documented. salesforce is one of the companies, though, that is leading to hopefully make this change. Yet, the company has been often rated as one of the best companies to work for by many companies that review this, which shows an interesting dichotomy.Let's first look at the issues and how the company is addressing them. One of the clear positive steps that leading firms in Silicon Valley are starting to do to address the issue of gender equality is publishing their numbers. For CRM, the publishing of statistics definitely could not be easy as the company is 71:29 in men-to-women. In leadership, the company is 85:15 and in tech roles is 80:20. By ethnicity, the company is 89% White or Asian-descent with only 6% of its workforce Hispanic or Black. These numbers are not much different than what we have seen in other reports we have done on companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).One of the easy cop outs that many analysts/commenters/writers have noted is that the company hires the best for the job, but it is a pleasure to see that salesforce realizes that ""hiring the best for the job"" is an easy way to hide behind the fact that women are not being hired to tech jobs. The company wrote an interesting blog post here that highlights the company's strategy to help be a leader in this area: Transparency, Address Unconscious Bias, and Develop Diverse Tech Talent Early.On the addressing biases that exist, the company noted:A real positive to see is that the company understands that the real change will be by bringing more talent to the forefront that is diverse. The company supports organizations doing this, and they noted, in that same article, ""a 2012 study found that employees who felt included and believed diversity was supported at work were able to innovate more (an 83 percent increase), and team collaboration improved by 42 percent. You can bet sales went up as a result."" The company is not where it should be, but they understand where they are and are making more than just blog posts to make changes. We would like to see a more comprehensive statement that the company has some goals as to where they want to be and make some strides to hit various targets to improve. Further, one of the easiest places to make this change is at the leadership level.While a lack of skilled of coding diversity can be part of the cause to the company's diversity, the company has only 15% leadership female, and there are only two females on the Board of Directors. There are a bevy of skilled females in leadership roles, and there is no excuse for this. Yet, salesforce (this is a pattern) has responded and appears to be one of the clear tech leaders in this space. As Business Insider notes:While we are never a fan of certain numbers that we must hit in order to be socially responsible as it is often more about intention and improvement, the company is starting something that we are hopeful other tech companies will also adapt. Further, the company is showing leadership by keeping their diversity stats up to date. What that means is that while the company doesn't have clear targets, companies are keeping track, and we will be able to look back every few months and judge if the company is just blowing hot air or making large strides.Why salesforce has been considered a Most Ethical Company is that the company is clearly putting in place plans to improve and get better. The company also has strengths in this area including workforce compensation and benefits as well as its strong support of the LGBT community.The company was ranked as #8 on Forbes list of Best Places to Work in its latest edition. The company gets high marks for tons of employee referrals for new hires at 58% as well as giving paid vacation days for volunteering. The company also offers unlimited sick days as well as 15 paid vacation days and 17 paid holidays per year. Employees are clearly very happy to work there, and we believe in the idea that a company should be a provider of jobs, health, and happiness, which is one thing that Silicon Valley has done well to produce.Additionally, the company is a leader in LGBT rights. The company received a perfect 100 rating from the Human Rights Campaign that measures companies for their inclusion, benefits, and equality they provide to LGBT employees. The company has the same benefits for same-sex and opposite-sex spouses and partners, insurance and coverage for transgender employees and operations, is an officially recognized LGBT Employee Affinity Group, and does diversity training among other items.Overall, we see some definite issues in CRM's employment responsibility with issues in their diversity and gender equality in the workforce, but we do recognize the company is working to make changes to this area. Further, the company is a leader in its treatment of its employees (given the way they defended all employees in Indiana) as well as its LGBT inclusion and support. We can see why the company may not rank strongly in this area, but why the company is considered an ethical company by Ethisphere. Now, salesforce has to improve in these areas, and we will definitely be checking in to see how they do.Environmental StewardshipAnother key area of corporate responsibility is environmental stewardship. Socially responsible investors focus in on this area a lot in their judgment of companies. While it is extremely important, being responsible is not just about how you treat the planet. We believe that there has been a corporate movement that was brought about by investors, pressure from leading companies, and pressure from the public for companies to start to reduce emissions and work harder to be environmentally friendly. Therefore, just being friendly is not really enough anymore. Since we are looking for leaders, we want to find companies that are pushing their own industry to get better in the way that we noted Starbucks has pushed its coffee industry to help implement the CAFE standards.How is salesforce doing in this area?The company is rated 196th in the latest Newsweek rankings of companies for their green companies. The company's carbon productivity is over 50% and is just below 50% in water productivity, but the company gets low marks for not having a pay link for management to its green targets and not having an audit or sustainability-related committee. The other main review of corporations is done by the Carbon Disclosure Project, which measures companies more on how they are planning to reduce carbon, how they are measuring that plan, and how are they seeing it through from year-to-year. The Project is really more about disclosure and planning rather than rating where companies are at currently, which we like.The CDP has rated salesforce since 2011. The company has had mixed reviews, but they actually dropped in 2014 to their lowest rating of 84 on their Climate Change report and were in the ""C"" performance band. One thing we noted in the Newsweek report was that the company's ""green"" reputation is stellar. The C performance band shows some activity and strategy for climate change, but the company also ranks fairly high when compared to its S&P 500 members as seen here. The negative, though, is the company was considered a leader in their first report in 2011, but they have since dropped. Unfortunately, the reports are not available that we can find, so we do not know why there was a drop.One item that many companies are doing now is putting out sustainability reports every fiscal year about what they are doing. Some of these are rich and full of great information and show weaknesses/strengths. In this CRM report, we don't get any information until page 8 where we see the company's carbon footprint. What is concerning on page 9 is that the company states that during the time it is looking at they had 30% revenue growth, but they increased carbon almost double. The company did increase its renewable sources of energy to 19% in FY14 from 17% in FY13, but the company has nearly 60% coming from coal/natural gas with the most from coal. One positive on page 12 is that we see the company is pushing to make their data centers more efficient. Additionally, the company had nearly 40% of their offices LEED-certified and reduced office space energy usage per square foot by 9% in FY14. Overall, the report shows moderate improvements, and they cannot be condemned for growing as a company and growing their footprint. Yet, a comprehensive, transparent plan to how they will reduce carbon is not available to the public, which is concerning.In this area, though, there are a lot of pundits/critics/reviewers, so we have quite a bit of information to use to compare against what the company is reporting. Greenpeace, though, has commented fairly positive reviews of salesforce, and they reported salesforce was a leader in adopting renewable energy in 2013. That was a major change from 2012 when it was named the ""Dirtiest"" by GP. In April 2014, the organization put together ratings on internet/tech companies and their green ratings. salesforce got a B on its transparency and commitment to renewable energy with a C on efficiency and deployment, but they were also commended for making it a goal to have 100% of their data centers powered by renewable energy. Yet, while the company has made claims; the follow through is where they need to improve. Here was Greenpeace's comments on efficiency and deployment:Overall, the company is one that is definitely better than average, and they have shown ""conversation"" that is leadership, but we would like to see a more comprehensive plan with a sustainability committee that will help to drive targets. Saying we want to be 100% powered by renewable energy is important, but the company has a long way to go as we can see from their 19% current level. Improving at just 200 basis points per year will mean it will take another 40 years to get to that 100% mark (which I doubt is the company's true path), but laying out targets and coming up with a plan the public can see would be a great next step.CommunityThe final piece of our puzzle is how does this company impact its community. Obviously, the prior two pieces of criteria are crucial for determining this as a company's focus on its employees and environment is important factors. In this area, CRM seems to be a leader or aware of areas they need to improve and working at making those changes.The company has also gotten strong remarks in their philanthropy and positive impact in the community. For example, the company's paid vacation for volunteer work has helped the company tally hundreds of thousands of volunteer hours. One of the reasons that we believe a prestige like the Most Ethical Company in the world was bestowed on salesforce was for its 1-1-1 strategy, which is a philanthropy philosophy the company has developed. In this philosophy, the company focuses on people, technology, and resources to work to help make positive impacts. The company has been recognized for this work. For example, they previously won the Corporate Community Involvement award from San Fransisco's Volunteer Center.The company's strategy is that they can bring their people, products, and resources to help those in need, NFPs, and more. On the people side, the company has clearly put in a plan to get their employees out and working in the community. The company has discounted or given away salesforce technology to 24K education or NFPs on the technology side, and the company has given $80M in grants since 2000.The three parts make up the salesforce Foundation. The technology that NFPs and other potential qualifying organizations get is pretty amazing as we can see here. With 10 free users and deep discounts for the rest.There are not a lot of unbiased reviews of companies and their community work. The Bloomberg Civic 50 is one that does put together a list, but salesforce did not make it. From what we see, though, the company has clearly put together a comprehensive Foundation that supports communities and those improving communities, which is a real positive.Conclusionsalesforce is definitely an interesting company to review from an SRI standpoint. The company has clear strengths in community, LGBT, employee benefits, and overall corporate responsibility mantras. They need to improve a lot in their gender/diversity as well as need to put together better plans to get to their goal of 100% renewable energy, but what we can say is that this is a company that is very aware, willing to make change, and promoting a healthy work environment. The next step is to review how the company is doing over the next 6-12 months in some of these key areas of concern, but our suspicion is that the company will help lead in these areas rather than follow much like they have done in the software-as-a-service industry.Overall, we like the company for its SRI a bit more than its current long-term investment value, but if the company can make strides in profitability over the next 12 months, this could be a very nice long-term place for responsible investors to park their money."
3069046,66283,2015-04-14T10:29:40-04:00,"Salesforce.com will start to see revenues slowing as comps grow and competition continues.As the company's business matures, the question is will the company be able to start retaining profits and cash flow?Without the company turning consistent profits, it is hard to judge whether or not the company's long-term value has significant upside or downside.","OverviewSalesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has slowed its upward movement after valuations have grown to extremely high levels. The stock is up nearly 15% YTD with valuations at nearly 8x sales and 11x book price. The stock is clearly priced at sky-high levels, but with a high-growth name that's clearly dominating its space, the valuation may not matter as much to investors. Yet, for many, the boat has sailed, so what does this mean for new investors? Is 2015 still going to be a great year for Salesforce? Is there still upside in CRM stock? What are the key factors that will determine 2015 for the name.We will look into these key questions in our article. We will start by looking at the 2015 catalysts for Salesforce and key areas to watch. Next, we will look at attempting to price a fair value estimate for CRM to determine the bull/bear case for the stock. Finally, we will look to decide where we stand on CRM.Fiscal Year 2016: The Year AheadThere's no question that Salesforce completely reinvented the way that software can work in a cloud environment, bringing about the SaaS revolution. The question moving into 2015 (CRM's FY16), though, is about a company that's starting to move from high-growth/speculative to a maturing company. One of the clearest signs of this has been the company's expected revenue dropping over 1000 basis points in the current fiscal year. The days of 30%+ growth for a $5B revenue firm are definitely coming to an end, and as that revenue growth drops, it brings about new questions.To us, the main gist of 2015, therefore, needs to be how will investors/analysts judge this company in the current year. Is it time that profitability starts to be looked at more closely? Additionally, the company is beginning to offer new products and diversify its revenue, which will be an intriguing aspect for the coming year. Can the company be successful with its new Analytics Cloud and improved Intelligence Engines? Finally, the company is seeing competition growing. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and most of all Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others, are nipping at the heels of CRM. The SaaS industry is definitely continuing to grow, but drops in Salesforce's leading market share will hurt shareholder value.Does The Market Care About Dropping Revenues?Since Salesforce went public, the company has averaged massive growth year/year with only one year since it went public under 25% growth. The company has had only two years under the 30% clip. The company was almost always judged by this number, estimates of where top-line growth was going, and the company's ability to maintain market share leadership. The company's latest estimates in their Q4FY15 conference call came in at estimating around 22% growth, which would be the second-lowest rate ever. CEO Marc Benioff notes:The latter part of Benioff's comments, though, show a shift in attitude. The company has matured and they are now looking at starting to focus on the margins, ROIC and those aspects of profitability that make high-growth, speculative names become long-term investments that people can hang onto forever. Benioff continues:Yet, this shift in attitude also presents risks. As a high-growth name, the company obviously wanted to be profitable, but the key factors were not as much churn, SG&A and cost per deal. Now, those aspects of the business are going to become much more critical to market reaction as revenue slows down, which is misleading because the comps are getting so large that these high percentages are just nearly impossible.The company has not returned positive operating income since 2011, but we believe that the market more than ever is going to want to start seeing $6B in revenue mean something in real terms of return on equity. Non-GAAP profitability is fine for growth/spec investors, but true profits are what is needed to tap into an entirely different type of investor.Diversified RevenueOne of the other knocks on CRM has always been that its revenue does not come from enough sources. The company's SaaS, while dominating and successful, has been locked into just a couple of products (tell that to the business Microsoft built on the back of Windows/Office). The company, though, should see the growth of some new products that are definitely quite intriguing. The product that is the newest and most intriguing for 2015 that the market will be watching is the Analytics Cloud. The company's Service, Sales and Marketing Clouds are all clear leaders, but CRM has been behind some of its competition in analytics. The new cloud is definitely a place of growth as it adds and develops the current offerings, and it can be a standalone product.The Analytics Cloud is intriguing because it allows the user to see data that impacts the entire suite of products. As President Keith Block notes:What the company is envisioning, overall, though is being more than just really great cloud-based software that can make marketing, sales and service better, but now it is integrating science to its users, giving them the opportunity to analyze data in the same way they revolutionized marketing, sales and service. As Trefis notes, ""In the Service Cloud, the power of data science will be harnessed for automation of certain customer service tasks. In the Marketing Cloud, marketers will be able to use data science for predictive and targeted marketing.""In the latest call, Benioff even noted that this was the most exciting revenue growth place for the company, and it is interesting that he sees analytics as a different industry and notes the company is entering a new market. At the same time, it is another sign of a maturing company that continues to innovate, develop new features, and produce an ecosystem that will continue to create its economic moat and hold its market share. This is clearly the place to watch for CRM to show its highest level of growth, and it will be interesting to see how the company does. Unlike the way they entered customer relationship management, analytics and cloud-based analytics is an area that's already dominated by Oracle and SAP, so they will have tough competition ahead for them. Yet, the ability to drive analytics into its new services and create new revenue from it is a great launching pad for this integrated product.What also is a strength of Salesforce's data movement is that the company is not just looking at one type of data - structured versus unstructured. The company has both, which is actually helpful to creating a moat for the company as a lot of its competition just does one or the other. Investor's Business Daily comments:Additionally, the shift in the way businesses want to spend money also is a sign that this could be a major win for CRM. It's no secret that spending on hardware and typical software is not a strong business anymore, but there's a strong desire for companies to spend money more smartly. Companies are choosing to invest in things like analytics over hiring significantly more bodies and letting data science do the analysis for them. Gartner notes that IT Spending will shrink another 1.5% in 2015, and they comment that companies like CRM are set up to be successful:Competition Won't Stop in FY2016The final aspect of the next FY for Salesforce is a question of its competition. The truth of this is that it won't stop, but the company has maintained leading market share despite a number of new entrants and challenges to the company. Additionally, the move into the data analytics is chock full of competition that the company will have to navigate, and it is an area that a lot of companies want to integrate right into their portfolio of products.One of the aspects of the profitability question is how much the company has to spend in marketing, sales, etc., in order to maintain this market share. Paulo Santos brought up this question as it pertained to costs of doing business and the potential for profitability:The competition is hot right now for SaaS for CRM products, and companies like Microsoft and IBM want to have a bigger piece of the pie. IBM has less than 5%, according to Gartner. Thus, does that mean Salesforce will have to continue spending at very high rates to maintain its customer base as churn will continue to remain high? If so, it will question the ability for the company to bring about profitability. MSFT clearly sees the light and has been pushing hard for Dynamic CRM and Microsoft 365. As CEO Satya Nadella noted:IBM also is making moves as it launched the ability to data mine Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) for businesses through its data services, while other data companies like Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Tableau and Qlik are all other data companies that will compete in the structured data field.While the competition has been high and been challenging, CRM continues to maintain its dominance, but we have to wonder how much is tied to the mystery Santos brings up. Further, if the company's comps become too large and those revenue growth numbers start to dip even further, will investors just continue to wait for profits? That question among others is what is to watch in the year ahead.Current PricingLet's take a look at the current price of CRM stock and understand what it means for the company. From there, we will examine the bull case for that price and the bear case. Finally, we will look at exactly where we believe the company is going. What we attempt to do is assess what will the company need to do over the next five years to justify the current pricing and thus how likely is that or not likely.In order to price the company, we need to make certain assumptions, and this is hardest with a high-growth company with a lot of moving parts and a lack of historical averages. Yet, that's the same exact reason why the company is sitting with its current valuation. Investors, to date, believe in the company, business and innovation that CRM brings to the table and are not as concerned with trying to nail down its worth as it's nearly impossible to do with a ton of accuracy. Instead of trying to make an estimate, let's use a DCF analysis thus to see what it would take to get at the company's current prices.We'll start with revenue. We have discussed this number quite a bit already, but a 20-22% line for the next two to three years looks likely with that dropping to the mid-to-high teens in the two years following. Those numbers are safe estimates for the company. From there, the real question becomes true profitability that leads to cash flow and not from a non-GAAP, adjusted basis. For this estimate, let's assume the company moves to breakeven and can hit a 5% operating margin in two more years and 8% by 2019.CapEx is expected to be at 5-7% of revenue in FY16, and that number should move to around 4-5% of revenue moving forward. The cap rate we used was 3%, which is an aggressive rate of discounting for high-growth names. When we run these base numbers through a DCF analysis we come up with the following results:That math equals a share price of roughly $40. So, we are clearly under the mark. Let's say we assume revenue will stay at 20% growth. When we make that adjustment we come in at about $45. In order to get to the $67 mark, we have to adjust profitability, and when we use a 15% operating margin mark in 2019, we hit that level, maintaining 20% growth per year. Is that achievable?Conclusion - The Bull Case and The Bear CaseTo us, using typical pricing models is always difficult for high-growth names as the anticipation is what matters. It is clear, though, in the language and business cycle that Salesforce is in profits (real profits) are going to start to matter, and that's the biggest question for the company this year. Can they start to reduce these high costs associated with high-growth? If they can, they will definitely be able to really start to woo some investors, and the success of that will help us determine if these higher profitability marks are achievable. Just to give you some perspective - MSFT, the most-successful software company to date (granted a different model), has averaged operating margins over 30% for years. The online business environment is not as profitable, but there's no reason one should not expect CRM to be able to turn down the costs as their business matures and raise operating margins. The question is how fast will it be and will it hit revenue as that competition increases. For us, we aren't sure, and that seems like a pretty big question to pay nearly 10x book value for a share today. Thus, we want to take a wait and see approach from an investor standpoint. The strength of the company is undeniable, but does that strength translate into long-term stock returns if I buy today?"

In practice, all Benioff promised was to cancel company events in Indiana although he also threatened a ""slow rolling of economic sanctions"" if the law isn't repealed.Salesforce paid $2.5 billion for ExactTarget, an Indiana direct marketing company, back in 2013 and now employs 2-3,000 people in the state. A check at Indeed.com showed five pages of currently-opened positions at Salesforce offices in Indiana.So far, however, the Salesforce boycott has only cost Indiana $8 million. That's the cost of an ExactTarget conference, scheduled for September, now being moved to New York. But a delay in cloud infrastructure upgrades could prove more costly to the state, and are a possible next step, writes Network World.Benioff has two problems with this political action. First, it's costly to move over 2,000 people out of a state because you don't like its social policy, especially when your high-flying company is already operating at a loss. Second, as Yelp (NYSE:YELP) CEO Jeremy Stoppelman noted in a supportive blog post, some 19 other states already have such laws on their books. Stoppelman wrote that his company will now make ""every effort to expand its corporate presence only in states that do not have these laws.But a check of Yelp's own careers web page shows it with open positions right now in Tennessee and Kentucky, both of which have laws like that of Indiana on their books. Texas, where Yelp is also hiring, is thinking of putting such language into its state constitution.Having lost their battle against gay marriage in many states, and potentially before the Supreme Court, many conservative groups are building a national campaign for such ""religious freedom"" laws, in an effort to re-frame the issue their way and rebuild political support. Benioff's move is a political statement on the other side in that argument. It is not, so far, an economic strategy.There are many examples, of course, of business leaders putting their politics to work in a business context. Privately-held Chick Fil A got into hot water a few years ago for its stand against gay marriage. Chick Fil A has since backed away from such public policy advocacy, although its stores still aren't open on Sunday.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook publicly ""outed himself,"" telling the world he is a ""proud to be gay,"" last year, but so far the company has taken no direct steps in this controversy. Apple stores remain in Indiana, and it's likely that Cook could even buy a Chick Fil A sandwich there on his next business trip to Indiana. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) has yet to pay a steep price for political activism but, after asking baristas to write ""race together"" on customer cups, it backed away within days.For many businesses, simply following the law and trying to stay quiet can get you into political hot water. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) was boycotted by conservatives for a while over allegedly ""gay friendly"" policies, but the group ended the boycott without getting a clear victory. A month later, former gay workers filed an employment discrimination suit against the company.The point is that activism, on any side, on any issue, is a risk for shareholders. Since Salesforce got involved in this controversy its shares have been flat, selling at roughly 8 times annual sales. Investors hope is that they remain flat, or even rise, until the controversy is forgotten."
3007096,76475,2015-03-18T11:44:46-04:00,Leading Wall Street analysts have given Salesforce.com a high price target and high ratings which comes as a sharp turnaround from their earlier negative stance about the company.This came after the company posted fiscal 2015 revenue that was slightly above consensus analysts’ estimates and fiscal 2016 guidance above consensus estimates.Is the sudden optimism about the company justified?,"Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) reported good fiscal 2015 results that showed the company's full-year revenue had reached the $5 billion mark for the first time in its history. The company finished the year with revenue of $5.37 billion, up 32% year-on-year. This led to a flurry of notable upgrades by leading Wall Street analysts whose love affair with the CRM giant had started running cold. Prior to 2014, Salesforce had for many years been Wall Street's darling, which was enamored by the company's impressive topline growth. Salesforce managed to grow at an average 35% annual clip over a period of six uninterrupted years, which gelled well with its image as a disruptor of old-line software companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL).Source: StatistaDuring 2014, Salesforce.com's topline growth slowed down a little to 32%, which was still quite good. Despite its impressive topline growth, Salesforce has largely remained in the red zone for years, occasionally reporting a thin profit for a quarter or two. The company's share performance therefore largely hinges on its revenue growth. The company's revenue growth dipped below the 30% reading on two occasions in fiscal 2015, causing jitters in the market as investors feared that the company's growth story was coming to an end. This badly impacted its stock performance, which underperformed the industry in 2014.Source: CNN MoneySalesforce'com shares, however, have been standout performers over the long-term, tucking on gains in excess of 1,000% since the company went public in 2004.Wall Street analysts overwhelmingly gave thumbs up for the company, which was in stark contrast to the overall negative sentiment expressed by the pundits barely a quarter earlier when the company was mostly rated as a ''Hold'' or ''Sell'' after its revenue growth of 29% and low fiscal 2016 guidance spooked the market.Salesforce had earlier issued a low fiscal 2016 revenue guidance of $6.45 billion-$6.50 billion, or 20%-21% growth, after it reported gloomy third quarter results. The company later raised the guidance after its fourth quarter and full-year earnings call to $6.47 billion -$6.52 billion, or 20.5%-21.4%, the mid-point being 21%. This suggests that the company's revenue growth is going to decelerate by a staggering 1100 basis points in just one year. Nevertheless, Wall Street was quick to heap its praise on the company and dished out the following upgrades:Salesforce's shares benefited from the love and shot up 11% following the upgrades. The shares currently trade at $64.60, implying a healthy 23.8% upside to the average $80 PT by the analysts.So, what caused the sudden change of sentiment toward the company almost overnight? Sure, the company's upper range of its new revenue guidance beat consensus analysts' estimates of $6.50 billion. But the margin beat does not appear big enough to warrant the 180 degrees shift in their thinking about the company.Managing ExpectationsIt appears as if the market's negative sentiment toward Salesforce in 2014 was largely driven by investors who had come to expect too much from the company. Maybe it has something to do with chief executive Marc Benioff and his penchant to paint an overly optimistic picture of what the company can accomplish. Salesforce has a much larger revenue base than competing CRM and SaaS companies such as Workday (NYSE: WDAY), NetSuite (YSE: NN), Cornerstone OnDemand (NASDAQ: CSOD) and others. Growing at close to 40% for a $5-billion-a-year software company is not an easy feat to pull off. As Marc Benioff pointed during the company's third quarter earnings call, there's no software company with a quarterly revenue of $1 billion or more that's growing faster than Salesforce.It's important to note that Salesforce has managed to maintain its market-leading CRM market share against deep-pocketed competitors such as SAP (NYSE: SAP) and Oracle.Source: GartnerSalesforce is now the 10th largest enterprise software company. A revenue growth rate in the low to mid-twenties would still mean Salesforce leads the top-10 pack. And the SaaS market is not about to so slow down any time soon. The SaaS market is projected to continue growing faster than the IaaS and PaaS markets. There is therefore little danger of SaaS companies such as Salesforce.com running out of growth runways any time soon.Source: IDCPerhaps the biggest reason that explains the general market pessimism surrounding the company is in relation to the growing competition from the likes of Microsoft. Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue grew by a blistering 114% in 2014, driven mainly by the Office 365, Dynamic CRM Online and Office 365, which are coincidentally the areas where Salesforce derives the bulk of its revenue.But Salesforce has learned how to hedge its cloud bets. The company has been compensating for the worrying slowdown in its subscription and support revenue by launching new products such Salesforce Analytics Cloud which the company launched during its latest Dreamforce event. The segment really is growing like wildfire, and is one of the divisions that helped save the company from ignominy after it reported its full-year results. Salesforce.com's Analytics Cloud already has 50 partners including big names such as EMC (NYSE: EMC), General Electric (NYSE: GE) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ). The company said that the product was recording the fastest growth for all its cloud products, which is hardly surprising given the rapid growth of Business Analytics. The segment has the potential to stave off slowing growth in the company's core CRM business. IDC projects that the Big Data and Analytics market will grow 6 times faster than the overall market between 2014 and 2017.Expanding Margins and Contracting LossesOne of the dilemmas faced by SaaS companies is that they have to contend with very high marketing expenses as they try to grow their customer bases and minimize churn. This places a lot of pressure on their bottom lines. In fact, nearly all young publicly-listed SaaS companies, including Salesforce, are still languishing in the red.But, as a SaaS company matures, it gets to a point where it starts going easy on its customer acquisition spree and starts focusing more on consolidating its gains. This helps it to rein in on its costs and eventually become profitable. This phenomenon has already started happening at Salesforce, where its operating margins expanded by about 200 basis points over the last two quarters, while its operating losses contracted by a considerable margin. This is a signal that the company could be nearing maturity. The downside of this is that the company is unlikely to return to the blistering growth it recorded a few years ago. The upshot is that Salesforce might finally become consistently profitable. I believe this is the reason why Wall Street has revived its love affair with the company.Bottom LineIt's quite possible that Wall Street and the market are willing to give Salesforce a free get-out-of-jail pass despite its lower revenue growth due to the promise of the company finally becoming profitable. I believe the optimism about the company is fully justified."

[2] In the Service Cloud, the power of data science will be harnessed for automation of certain customer service tasks. In the Marketing Cloud, marketers will be able to use data science for predictive and targeted marketing. The latest product releases follow Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff’s recent claim that the revolution in data science will fundamentally change how businesses are run. [3]Salesforce had so far lagged behind competitors like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) in predictive analytics. Oracle already utilizes data science for predictive analytics in its Business Intelligence suite. SAP also recently released a contextual marketing platform for telecommunication companies, which utilizes data science for targeted marketing. [4] Now, Salesforce has also jumped on the data science bandwagon with its new Service Cloud Intelligence Engine and Marketing Cloud Predictive Decisions.We have a price estimate of $60 for Salesforce.com, which is about 10% lower than its current market price.Service Cloud Intelligence Engine: Intelligent Resource Allocation in Customer ServiceSalesforce’s new Service Cloud Intelligence Engine is aimed at efficient and automated allocation of customer service requests and customer service agents’ workloads. That is, cases get assigned to agents based on skill set, case history and other specified factors, thereby optimizing resolution of customer service requests. Further, the Intelligence Engine automates the distribution and management of workloads based on expertise and case load, thus maximizing productivity. It also includes intelligent automation of business processes, like escalation of cases to other departments and distribution of potential sales leads to sales teams.Salesforce will release the Service Cloud Intelligence Engine for general availability later this year. The company has not announced the pricing yet, which suggests that the Intelligence Engine may not be a free add-on product like most of Salesforce’s recent offerings (Read: It’s Products Galore From Enterprise Software Vendors).Marketing Cloud Predictive Decisions: Efficient Targeted AdvertisingThe Marketing Cloud Predictive Decisions product offers three primary features to marketers – the collection of customers’ behavioral data, predictive analysis for advertising optimization, and workflow automation. The Collect Beacon component of the product collects real-time content updates and user behavioral data to constantly update the user database and predictive decisions. The Native Predictive Division component predicts which content will result in the highest conversion rates, while the automated workflow can trigger marketing campaigns using data from all available channels.The Marketing Cloud Predictive Decisions product will be available from May 2015. Pricing will begin from $1,250 per month.Prospect of Incremental Revenue a Welcome DevelopmentIt is encouraging to note that Salesforce is releasing revenue generating innovations rather than just minor add-on features available to existing users free of cost. A number of minor features recently introduced by Salesforce do not provide any incremental revenue for the company (Read: Salesforce Releases Product That Lets Businesses Create Custom Enterprise App Stores), which makes the above two offerings a welcome change of pace.New potential revenue streams are more significant for Salesforce now than ever before as its hitherto unhindered growth from the CRM segment is slowing a bit. (Read: Salesforce Posts Strong Q4 Results, Eyes Analytics Market to Drive Future Growth) The latest products may well be the beginning of Salesforce’s drive towards the analytics business, which it believes to be its next key growth driver. However, Salesforce will need to make a much bigger statement than the above two products if it hopes to capitalize on the burgeoning potential of the analytics industry.Disclosure: None"
2964676,25047,2015-03-03T11:06:29-05:00,"salesforce.com continues to amaze by the way it carries a $45 billion valuation, in spite of no GAAP profitability and flagging growth.This article exposes two mysteries associated with salesforce.com.One has to do with profitability, the other with the deferred revenue growth which analysts keep on celebrating.","There are two things that boggle my mind regarding salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). No, I am not going to talk about how it trades for more than $45 billion in market capitalization while having no GAAP profits. These are more specific issues.The First Mystery: Marketing and SalesIt seems strange to me that salesforce.com's Marketing and Sales cost line can keep growing as fast as revenues for so long. And indeed, that it can stay so stably at over 50% of revenues, even if FY2015 actually presented slight improvement over FY2014.In its earlier days, Marketing and Sales behaved as one would expect - as the company grew, there was a level of leverage which meant the cost line was diluted versus revenues. But from FY2011 onward, the line saw a relentless drive upward as we can see in the table below:Source: Several CRM earnings releasesIs the company really spending $2.76 billion in Marketing and Sales in a single year? That seems awfully large and unrealistic for me. It's strange that the company does not see any kind of leverage in this line. After all, if one thinks about it, getting new customers to sign up to salesforce.com's services might be hard and require a lot of selling activity. But when these customers renew their subscriptions, it should no longer require nearly as much selling. Yet, what we see is that, even though growth has already decelerated markedly, selling costs continue to expand in line with overall revenues.In the table above, I also tried to see how selling costs related to the net new revenues salesforce.com is achieving per year. This, too, is stable. It's stable at around 200% of the net new revenues. If selling costs only applied to new revenues, it would be almost like salesforce.com spent 24 months of gross revenues from a contract just to be able to sign it. To put this in context, salesforce.com's contracts typically run for 12 to 36 months. No wonder that salesforce.com ends up showing a GAAP loss.The Second Mystery: The Focus On Deferred RevenuesThe main metric that's always applauded by analysts is the growth rate of billings/deferred revenue. Billings is usually calculated by adding revenues plus the change in deferred revenue. This metric is seen as very important in subscription-based services because revenues from the service aren't all recognized upfront, the way you'd account for them if the company was selling software.The logic here is that deferred revenue gives us an advanced look into how revenue itself is going to perform later on. Seen another way, deferred revenue gives us a look at how orders for the company are doing today, even if they haven't yet translated into revenues.salesforce.com's latest earnings report was celebrated precisely because of how much deferred revenues jumped. And salesforce.com is clearly aware that analysts are looking there, because its PR headline clearly included the metric within its highlights as you can see below.So, why is there a mystery in there being a focus on this particular metric? Well, there are two reasons:The first reason - Deferred revenues are an unreliable indicatorAmong other things, deferred revenue growth rates are very sensitive to changes in contract duration and billing cycles. If the company previously sold and invoiced on a 3-6 month basis and then goes to invoicing on a 12-month basis, the same level of business will lead to a higher level of deferred revenue.It will also lead, for a while, to a higher growth rate in deferred revenues. And as it happens, salesforce has been doing precisely this (increasing contract lengths and invoicing for longer periods) for a few years already.A good description of these effects can be found in Kellblog.com's post about Box.The second reason - The irrationality of it allThe deferred revenue we're talking about for salesforce.com is overwhelmingly current (to be realized within the next 12 months) in nature. In the latest quarter, 99% of the deferred revenue was current.Now stay with me:So, what does it matter if deferred revenues were up 32%? salesforce.com's guidance for revenues over the next 12 months - where 99% of those deferred revenues are included - was for a growth rate of just 20.9%!And therein lies the mystery, why highlight a 32% deferred revenue growth rate, when those deferred revenues are but a large component of revenues, which will certainly grow just around 20.9% over the next 12 months?It makes no sense. Obviously, there is a scheme at work here. Basically, deferred revenues have been growing as a percentage of the revenues to be realized within the next 12 months. Not because growth was accelerating, but simply because payment and contract terms have been changing to show better and better deferred revenue growth. The following table shows this well:This wasn't always the case, though. It's just the case since FY2011, which is also mostly when salesforce.com seems to have started being managed to please Wall Street thirst for growth metrics, instead of profitability.Conclusionsalesforce.com continues to amaze in how it's able to keep a $45 billion+ market capitalization, while showing no GAAP profitability. This feat has mostly been achieved by pandering to Wall Street ""story stock"" logic. This logic demands above all that the company continues to show quick growth (in revenues), together with an undefined potential for massive profitability, somewhere in the distant future.The profitability potential is usually ascribed to one or several cost lines having illusive ""leverage"" to be realized somewhere in the future. Here, this ""leverage"" is mostly expected out of Marketing and Sales, a cost line which represents more than 50% of revenues. However, there has been precious little leverage in that line so far. Unlike with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), however, here we can't entirely dismiss the possibility that some leverage might appear in the future, though the reason why none showed up until now remains a mystery.Additionally, to sell the growth story, Wall Street clings to the rapid growth in deferred revenues. Such growth would have meaning if it meant revenues for the future would also be accelerating. But that isn't the case. Instead, deferred revenues simply constitute a larger and larger portion of future revenues. And indeed, revenues themselves are guided towards a significant deceleration (to 20.9% year-on-year) versus deferred revenue growth (which now stands at 32% year-on-year).In spite of all the happiness around salesforce.com, I believe this stock will end up popping like all bubbles do, and will have massive downside when it does pop."
2959106,20521,2015-02-27T12:51:05-05:00,,"The global cloud computing market continues to grow forth at stellar rates. In a recent report by Market Research Media, the global cloud computing market is projected to grow 30% annually to $270 billion by the year 2020. One company that is seeing similar growth rates in their annual revenues despite their size is Salesforce (NYSE: CRM).Salesforce's FinancialsEarlier this week, they reported impressive fourth quarter results. Revenues grew 26% over the year to $1.44 billion, in line with the market's projections. EPS of $0.14 was also in line with the Street's forecast. As their CEO added, Salesforce reached $5 billion in annual revenue faster than any other enterprise software company. They are now targeting to achieve a similar status for a $10 billion annual revenue run rate.During the quarter, revenues from Subscription and Support services grew 25% over the year to $1.35 billion and Professional services and other revenues were up 41% to $99 million.Salesforce ended the year with revenues growing 32% to $5.37 billion with subscription and support revenues growing 31% to $5.01 billion and professional services revenues grew 46% to $360 million. EPS came in at $0.52 for the year.For the current year, Salesforce expects revenues of $6.475 billion-$6.52 billion with an EPS of $0.67-$0.69. They expect to end the current quarter with revenues of $1.485 billion-$1.505 billion and EPS of $0.13-$0.14. The market is forecasting revenues of $1.49 billion with EPS of $0.15 for the current quarter and revenues of $6.5 billion with an EPS of $0.67 for the year.Salesforce's Market ExpansionSalesforce is focused on expanding their international presence. During 2015, they plan to grow their footprint in Europe and they are already opening data centers for that purpose. They will complete their expansion in France, Germany, and the UK this year. The presence in these geographies will help them target the small and medium businesses and government clients in these markets. They are following a similar strategy in Japan where they opened a second data center in December 2014.Salesforce is also strengthening their focus on the retail industry. Recently, they tied up with Home Depot (NYSE:HD) to implement a new model of customer service. Together, they have built a system that enables sharing and collaboration by employees, contractors, and consumers on one system. They are also working with high-end brands like Louis Vuitton to enable clienteling. Salesforce envisions clienteling to be the ability of a retail store agent to use their mobile device to personalize a customer's visit to a store.But Salesforce needs to watch out for competitors. Over the past few years, Oracle has been building their cloud services through acquisitions of big companies like Eloqua, RightNow, and Responsys. Other players like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have also expanded their cloud services significantly. For the recently reported quarter, Microsoft saw their cloud revenues more than double. For now, though, the pie is so large, that all the players will continue to grow, most likely.Their stock is trading at an all-time high of $70.24 with a market capitalization of $44.32 billion."

However, over the course of the previous year, other players in the CRM market such as Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) have also adopted cloud technologies thereby diminishing the competitive advantage enjoyed by Salesforce.com in the previous years. The diminishing competitive advantage is thus expected to weigh on the company's fourth quarter earnings, it has already dampened investor sentiment. Furthermore, Salesforce.com's fourth quarter earnings are also expected to suffer the impact of exchange rate headwinds as the Dollar continues to gain strength against the Euro. There are upsides from the continued growth of the global CRM market but the company's growth is now expected to trail the growth of the market owing to increased competition. The company is expected to report revenues of $1.44 billion and earnings of $0.14 per share during the final quarter of its FY 2015.Potential downsides for Salesforce.comIncreasing competition dampening revenue growthThe company's revenues from cloud-based CRM software account for almost 80% of its revenues and an almost similar proportion of value. The company had a 16% share of the market for cloud-based CRM software in 2013. While the company's market share has increased, it is not showing acceleration as it had before 2013. The emergence and continued penetration of ERP software giant Oracle along with the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and SAP (NYSE: SAP) in the cloud-based CRM market has checked the breakneck pace at which Salesforce.com was growing. Revenues for Salesforce.com are expected to show growth in the final quarter of its fiscal year 2015 but they will exhibit a slower pace of growth. Salesforce.com had built a head of steam in the cloud-based CRM market but other players have also identified the ease of deployment and usability of cloud CRM's thereby encouraging their sale and use. The market for cloud CRM's is expected to grow almost 16% annually over the course of the next 3 years. The growth exhibited by revenues of Salesforce.com has previously outperformed the growth of the cloud CRM market but is now expected to slow down which could lead to a potential downside for the company's share prices as investors have derived a great degree of value from the incredible pace at which its cloud-based CRM revenues have grown. Investor confidence may also suffer as the company may fail to attain its targeted market share.Exchange rate headwindsThe dollar has continued to gain strength over the course of the last year and its appreciation against the Euro and the Yen in particular has proved to be a cause of concern for Salesforce.com. The company's revenues for the final quarter of 2015 are expected to be dampened by the effects of exchange rate headwinds. Exchange rate headwinds are expected to persist over the course of the next couple of years at least and a potential interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve may lead to shock to the Dollar and drive it further upwards. Investors are thus also concerned owing to the impact of exchange rate headwinds which could lead to a potential $200 million hit to revenues for Salesforce.com in FY 2016. Investors are remaining cautious as the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions account for a significant proportion of cloud CRM sales. The persistence of exchange rate headwinds over the course of the next couple of years along with slowing revenue growth amid increasing competition in the cloud CRM space could lead to an overall downside for Salesforce.com's share prices.ConclusionSalesforce.com is expected to report an impressive revenue and earnings performance for the final quarter of its fiscal year 2015. The company is expected to see top line and bottom line growth. However, beyond fiscal 2015, trends are not in favor of Salesforce.com as the company's revenue growth continues to lose momentum and as a result the company continues to lose market share to the likes of Microsoft, Oracle and SAP. Investor confidence is thus expected to suffer as the company's growth is dampened by its diminishing competitive advantage in the cloud CRM market. I calculate a $57 estimate for the company's stock thereby indicating a potential 8% downside to the current market price of $62. Going long in Salesforce.com might not be a worthwhile proposition currently."
2768285,24157,2014-12-19T07:51:37-05:00,"Salesforce is using increasingly costly acquisitions to fuel its top line growth.The company's cash flow is not all it's reported to be, nor is its debt.Changing market sentiment and stiffening competition do not help the case for this stock's valuation.","Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is in the Danger Zone this week. We wrote on Salesforce.com around this time last year and since then it has become even more Dangerous.Increased volatility in CRM reflects how the market has become increasingly bearish on high-growth stocks with falling cash flows and mounting losses.Unprofitable Acquisitions Prop Up Revenue GrowthDon't let this company fool you into thinking its revenue growth comes cheaply. Salesforce acquired ExactTarget for $2.6 billion in cash in 2013, which added $194 million in revenues and -$153 million in operating losses. Not exactly a good return on investment. Salesforce's aggressive acquisition strategy has continued with RelateIQ in July 2014 for $390 million. These two large acquisitions come on the heels of seven other acquisitions in 2012.Many CRM bulls like to point to the company's revenue growth without recognizing the enormous cost at which it comes and that, from a cash flow perspective, these deal are not good for investors.Even with the big acquisitions, revenues are decelerating as organic growth is weak. While the company once grew revenues at over 50% per year, revenue growth has slowed almost every year since 2006, down to 34% in 2014. Consensus estimates see revenue growth slowing to 22% next year. Selling expenses have risen from 64% of revenues in 2006 to 68% of revenues in 2014.Salesforce's Deceptive Cash FlowOther CRM bulls point to the company's free cash flow (FCF). The simple formula for Salesforce's FCF, calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures (which omits acquisitions), shows growth from $90 million in 2011 to over $567 million in 2014.However, our free cash flow calculation paints a very different picture [just as it did with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)]. Salesforce's actual free cash flow was -$3.1 billion in 2014. The company was also FCF negative every year since 2011. Our free cash flow calculation holds the company accountable for all the capital it has put to work in its various acquisitions, which aren't recorded in capital expenditures.Figure 1 shows Salesforce's free cash flow decline since 2010. Investors looking at all the numbers see a very different story than those trusting the company's numbers.Figure 1: Revenue Growth Becoming ExpensiveSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsHidden Debt and LiabilitiesOne of Salesforce's favorite ways to boost its cash flow is to pay employees not in cash, but in stock. As a result, the company has a large liability of $702 million in outstanding employee stock options.Salesforce's balance sheet also understates its debt. While the company's balance sheet shows $1.5billion in total debt, over $1 billion in off balance sheet debt brings Salesforce's total debt to almost $3 billion. These future lease payments, which don't show up on any of the financial statements, also allow the company to overstate its falling cash flow.Big Name Competition Threatens to Undercut SalesforceCloud computing and customer relationship management is a notoriously crowded space. Competition comes from other large software companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Smaller competitors include companies such as Netsuite (NYSE:N), the privately-held Sugar, and countless other startups.Figure 2 compares Salesforce's free cash flow, after-tax (NOPAT) margins and return on invested capital (ROIC) with its main competitors.Figure 2: Lagging in Terms of ProfitabilitySources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.It appears that the smaller customer relationship management companies are having a difficult time making money.Microsoft and Oracle have renewed their focus on customer relationship management while drawing profits from their other lucrative software businesses. Microsoft is leveraging its healthy operating position and promising 48% savings over Salesforce's products.Unrealistic ValuationTo justify its current valuation of $60/share, Salesforce must immediately achieve pre-tax margins of 39% (equal to Oracle's) and grow revenue by 22% compounded annually for the next 8 years. Salesforce would be doing $20 billion in revenue at that point (compared to $4 billion in 2014).Not only has Salesforce's revenue growth been slowing for a number of years, but it is also likely that the company will need to settle for a good deal less than 39% pretax margins or risk being priced out by the likes of Microsoft. If we instead expect pretax margins of 20% and a 22% annual revenue growth rate for the next 10 years, CRM is worth just $34/share, a 46% downside.We are not saying this company will go bankrupt. But investors stand to lose a great deal of money when the market adjusts and prices the stock with more realistic expectations in mind.Revenue Growth No Longer Cutting It in Today's MarketAs we've discussed, the bull case for this stock is focused mainly on the company's revenue growth. Salesforce is just one of a group of prominent companies [the others being Amazon, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), and Fireye (NASDAQ:FEYE)] that have shown strong revenue growth but continue to lose billions of dollars.The market is growing tired after years of these companies' mounting losses. All of the aforementioned companies have experienced serious price declines this year, two of them greater than 40%. Salesforce is very similar to Amazon in that it is growing revenue quickly and is the leader in its space while also being highly unprofitable with deceptive cash flows. AMZN investors found out how that story played out earlier this year.Following in the steps of Amazon and Twitter, CRM could drop after earnings on investors' frustrations with further losses or soft guidance, just as it did in late November.Dividend and Buyback RiskWith around $845 million in cash and cash equivalents, a dividend or buyback is not out of the question. However, with the company bleeding cash that it needs to continue growing, declaring a buyback or dividend would not be wise but could certainly boost the stock.Short InterestShort interest stands at 31,910,000 shares, or over 5% of float.Insiders are SellingOver the past six months, insiders have bought zero shares and sold 2,230,360 shares, a total of 5% of total insider holdings. Over the past 12 months, insiders have bought just $65,000 in shares and sold $410 million. Insiders are bailing and so should you.Funds that Hold CRMInvestors must tread carefully in Tech sector ETFs and mutual funds, as many allocate heavily to this stock:André Rouillard contributed to this report."

Expect revenue growth of around 25% to $1.4 billion (after the FX hit) delivering gross profit of $115 billion, representing a gross profit margin of 82%. The outlook for CRM's business is bright, with a large and growing customer base. Its cloud products are likely to continue to drive revenue and margin growth strongly in coming years. My DCF methodology suggests a value of approximately $70 per share.CRM at a similar growth stage to Oracle or SAP in the 1990s, with strong revenue and FCF growthAs a quick reminder, Salesforce.com is a fast growing market leader in cloud computing and is at a similar growth stage to either Oracle or SAP in the 1990s when they were both moving from $5 billion revenue companies to $10 billion and above. Market expectations are for CRM will report full-year revenues (to end Jan'15) of around $5.3 billion, representing some 32% growth YoY, with a full-year gross margin of 80% and operating ""EBIT"" margin of 10%. Fundamental to the valuation and thus share price prospects for CRM is continuing strong double-digit revenue growth in both CRM's subscription business (95% of revenues) and its services business (5%) of revenues.Q4 2015 focus underlying growth likely to be very strongCRM will report its Q4-15 earnings on February 25th. We already know that Q4 transaction growth was some 63% YoY (versus 64% in Q3 and 53% in Q2) with the transaction growth metric being a measure of CRM's overall usage/product demand trends. CRM reported a record transaction day during Q4 of some 2.8 billion transactions, with the total number of transaction showing some 8% growth QoQ. Overall this bodes well for reported revenue growth in the quarter, which should be around 25% YoY to $1.4 billion, slightly hampered by the stronger US dollar translation effect.A possible US$ 50bn addressable market in cloudAccording to CRM and industry estimates, the total addressable market for CRM's cloud products is about $50 billion. Furthermore, the company can cross-sell its service, marketing, analytics and platform offerings to its large (approximately 150,000) enterprise customer base, raising the average revenue per customer. Margin growth could subsequently be strong too as such up selling and cross selling brings incremental margin benefit. One interesting statistic - CRM's management team indicated that amongst the company's top 50 customers, spending has increased by over 3x in the last five years, which implies that there is significant opportunity for CRM to drive revenue growth by focusing on selling more of its products to the remaining customer base.Valuation more attractive than its peersSalesforce.com's future revenue and operating cash flow growth profile is attractive, as shown in the accompanying charts. Over the coming two years I expect CRM's EV/Sales and EV/CFO ratios to drop sharply, to below industry averages, as the company optimizes selling opportunities among its existing and new customers.My DCF methodology suggests value of around $70 per share, which presents more share price upside potential than most of its peers. If the Q4 numbers are strong and outlook statement is positive, this stock should run toward my target price as shown below."
2874816,79325,2015-02-03T12:24:36-05:00,"Three years of negative earnings with double-digit top line growth.Core strength: Large enterprise IT market, high switching cost, scalability of enterprise solutions, SaaS BI is the future.Recent share pullback presents great buying opportunity.","Investment ThesisIf there is something Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has in common with Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), it is its ability to boast long-term, double-digit top line growth while downplaying the bottom line. In fact, Salesforce has been consistently losing money for the past 3 years, even though its revenue more than doubled during the same period. Many analysts see the $35.6B SaaS behemoth as the comeback of the dot-com boom. In this article, I argue that Salesforce is a great technology play by giving you 5 reasons why you should buy this stock.Source: Capital IQ1. Enterprise IT market remains mostly untappedAs seen in the following charts, worldwide information technology spending is huge compared to the size of Salesforce. Even with $5bn in revenue, Salesforce only accounts for 0.13% ($5bn/$3828bn) of total global IT spending. I would also like to draw your attention to the components of IT spending. The enterprise software sub-sector is where Salesforce mainly competes and its growth rate is significantly higher than the other sub-sectors. In the short-to-medium term, as the company broadens its product offerings, verticalization will prove to be an excellent strategy in gaining greater share of the enterprise IT market.Source: StatistaSource: Gartner2. High switching cost provides future revenue stabilityWhile negative earnings are certainly not something for the firm to boast about, it is important to note that the majority of the expense is incurred in acquiring new customers. For example, in the three months ended on October 31, 2014, marketing and sales expenses accounted for 66.2% of the total operating expense. In the enterprise IT space, the turnover for enterprise-wide software is generally low as switching costs are significant once the software is fully integrated with the rest of the IT infrastructure. Thus, I see the recent negative earnings as a temporary investment in acquiring future revenue stability.3. Scalability of enterprise solutionsSalesforce incurs significant R&D expenses in developing enterprise solutions. As the number of customers increase, the per-firm R&D cost declines, providing economy of scale and significant competitive advantage.Source: Capital IQ4. Intelligent SaaS is the futureThe future of business intelligence is SaaS BI (business intelligence) and Salesforce is in a great position to capture that with its Analytics Cloud, which can be fully integrated with its other cloud offerings. Salesforce is able to leverage on its existing customers and broad product portfolio to enhance its extensibility of Salesforce's platform, which will help to bring further penetration in the enterprise market while increasing switching costs.5. Recent stock pullback despite strong revenue growthEven though the firm had an impressive Q3 with revenue up 28.6%, its stock price had a minor pullback. This presents a great buying opportunity.Source: Yahoo FinanceConclusionWith the recent pullback of share price, now is a great opportunity to get into one of the leaders in SaaS. Salesforce is rapidly expanding its enterprise presence by aggressively acquiring new customers and developing integrated enterprise solutions. Its strong cloud portfolio and verticalizaiton strategy give it the ability to upsell higher margin products while deepening customer relationships."
2831696,59291,2015-01-20T06:33:12-05:00,"Facing mounting competition, Salesforce's first mover advantage has disappeared.Marketing cloud, built on products acquired for $3.7 billion, is showing lackluster growth.The product suite has broadened and lost focus. The value proposition of combining sales, service, marketing, platform, analytics and community remains to be seen.High hopes are being placed on Analytics, a new product in a competitive category.The company is in a precarious financial position, carrying $3.8 billion in Goodwill from past acquisitions on the balance sheet.","[Correction, Jan. 22: A previous version of this article stated incorrectly that Salesforce Analytics is based on the 2014 acquisition of RelateIQ. In fact it is based on the acquisition of EdgeSpring in mid-2013. The article has been updated to reflect this.]The competition in marketing automation software in the cloud has become white-hot. While HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) and Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) Eloqua have seen revenue growth accelerate, Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) Marketing Cloud revenue has dropped during this fiscal year. See the purple line:Compare with the fast growth of marketing automation competitors Marketo and HubSpot:A recent earnings call indicates that Oracle is gaining ground on Salesforce. Safra Catz:Larry Ellison:Buzzword strategy part I: the ""social enterprise""Salesforce has gone through several iterations of a product strategy. In 2011 Benioff regaled analysts with talk of the social enterprise, highlighting Chatter as the most successful product launch in the company's history. He announced Toyota Friend, a social network for Toyota owners built on the Salesforce Platform. As of now the Toyota Friend Twitter account has 6 tweets and 4 followers. The facebook account has one post in the last two years: a video of Benioff introducing the product back in 2011. Any tech company will abandon some projects, and this one was a relatively small investment by Toyota, Microsoft and Salesforce. My broader point is that Mr. Benioff seems to come to each call fired up about a new idea as the future of the company, without explaining why it is a good investment of the company's resources.The social enterprise excitement coincided with the acquisition of Radian6 for $337 million, Buddy Media for $736 million and ExactTarget for $2.6 billion. These are the anchor products of the marketing cloud, for a total cost of $3.7 billion. ExactTarget and Buddy Media were losing money at the time of acquisition and Radian6 was probably not making a meaningful contribution to results when acquired.Let's say marketing cloud has a strong fiscal fourth quarter, booking $180 million in revenue. That means acquisitions costing $3.7 billion are yielding an estimated $600 million in marketing cloud revenue. Since Salesforce does not report income by segment (despite my argument that they should) we don't know whether there is any net income here. In any case, because of encroaching competition from Marketo, Hubspot, Oracle and others, Salesforce does not have pricing power in this category. Since competitors already provide integrations of Salesforce CRM data, it's not clear why a Sales Cloud customer should choose Salesforce's Marketing Cloud. It remains to be seen whether the massive investment in Marketing Cloud contributes to positive financial results.Buzzword strategy part II: AnalyticsOn the most recent earnings call Analytics was all the rage. This follows the acquisition of early-stage startup EdgeSpring for $134 million. Between them, Benioff and Block used the term ""analytics"" 41 times on the call.The level of hype is incredible and awesome (see also my blog post on the BS Index):Keith Block:Merrill Lynch analyst Kash Rangan asked whether Analytics revenue was included in guidance for FY 2016. Benioff and Block bloviated for seven paragraphs without answering the question (with no follow-up from Rangan). Benioff:They indicated it was launched one month ago based on the acquisition of EdgeSpring in 2013. Analytics and business intelligence is a long-standing category with offerings from the biggest names in the business including Oracle, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and SAS. How can Salesforce Analytics be the ""best on the planet"" in a competitive category one month after launch?We heard nothing of what the Analytics product actually does, only that it will be easy for non-specialists to use. What data will be used and what business problems will the product help customers solve? How will it be integrated with the other clouds?This is sounding like the social enterprise hype of several years ago: a big, exciting, trendy idea that Salesforce will pioneer, without explanation of why the company is going after it and how it will contribute to financial results. Salesforce was indeed a pioneer in cloud CRM and leads the category with market share somewhere in the teens (by no means a dominant position). As the company moves into adjacent categories, it remains to be seen whether the company is leading the way or chasing trends through expensive acquisitions.Di-worse-ification?This comment by Mr. Benioff shows how Salesforce has diversified into multiple product areas within a few short years:(As a reminder, at the time of this statement in November the Analytics cloud had no material financial results, so it could not have had a significant position in the industry.)A little over three years ago, Salesforce consisted of Sales Cloud and an emerging Platform offering. It is not clear that the more diverse product line is greater than the sum of its dearly purchased parts. Purchases since FY 2011 have cost about $4.9 billion, contributing to share dilution of about 33% over that period. Current Goodwill of $3.8 billion on the balance sheet represents 40% of total assets and is just about exactly equal to stockholder's equity.Cumulative goodwill in dollars:I have not found evidence that Salesforce has taken a writedown on Goodwill. Based on my inference that Marketing cloud is unprofitable and has led to $3.7 billion in Goodwill on the balance sheet, I will be interested to see if the company takes a writedown in Q4 2015.OutlookThe growth thesis for this company requires that the Sales and Service cloud offerings subsidize Platform, Marketing and Analytics until they become profitable. Bloated with goodwill mentioned above and saddled with long-term debt of $1.36 billion, Salesforce's balance sheet is more precarious than it has ever been. The pressure is on for the company to deliver extraordinary growth in the newer product lines, in the face of intense competition from rivals with much deeper pockets. Larry Ellison seems particularly keen to crush Salesforce (helmed by two ex-Oracle executives):In any event 2015 is sure to be a critical year for companies to establish market positions in this rapid-growth phase of enterprise cloud computing.And here come LinkedIn and facebook. LinkedIn, with 330 million registered users, has launched Sales Navigator for lead generation and social selling. Facebook recently announced facebook for business: ""Find new customers. Increase sales."" These offerings will only add competitive pressure in the sales and marketing automation categories.I hold a short position in CRM."

This harbinger of subscription, internet delivered software created one of the most exciting waves in software and the single most valuable SaaS company today, worth $37B as of this writing.If I had to choose one chart to describe Salesforce, it would be the one above. Salesforce remains the fastest growing SaaS company on record. More impressively than the growth rates are the scale of the numbers. Seven years after founding, the company generated $500M in revenue. No other SaaS company has come close to the same scale of achievement.Salesforce's S-1 contains the company's data all the way back to Salesforce's second year since founding and we can see the revenue growth in the first few years was astounding.In terms of revenue growth rates, Salesforce has maintained a greater than 100% compound annual growth rate until $51M in annual revenue.Salesforce's averaged an $11k account at IPO across 8,000 customers, which is among the bottom third of SaaS companies. SMBs (less than 200 employees) contributed 40% of revenue, mid-market customers (200-500 employees) contributed 30%, and enterprise rounded out the last 30%.To grow this quickly, Salesforce invested a significant amount in sales and marketing, but not meaningfully more than the SaaS median.In the company's earliest years, Salesforce invested about 75-100% of revenues into sales and marketing, a figure that tapered off to 50%.Salesforce recorded impressive sales efficiency metrics of greater than 1, meaning $1 of sales and marketing investment bought more than $1 of revenue for years 3 through 7. This amazing sales efficiency fueled the company's growth and minimized cash burn.And the company reached cash flow break even three years into sales, having burned about $69M.Initially, the company spent very little on engineering. In fact, it was once among the lowest of any SaaS company. But now the company is on a steady path above the median as the company builds new products to cross sell its enormous customer base, including help desk software, business intelligence and marketing products.Salesforce is a unique business. Out of the gate, the company grew, grew, grew and it has never looked back. Compared to several newer SaaS companies, Salesforce was remarkably capital efficient. The first pure play SaaS company, Salesforce remains the city upon a hill."

The fourth quarter was a relatively quiet one for Salesforce, with no acquisitions and no major product releases. Most of the products and updates released by Salesforce during the quarter were add-ons that have been made available to existing licensees for no additional costs. Therefore, Salesforce's revenue growth in the fourth quarter is expected to come from existing revenue streams, which face stiff competition from the rapidly expanding presence of competitors like Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) in cloud computing.In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, Salesforce's revenue growth slowed to 30%, down from 37% growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. The growth rate slowed partly because of the sheer scale that Salesforce has achieved by now and partly because of realignment of sales personnel and clients during the third quarter. Efficient cost management contributed to a non-GAAP operating margin of 10.6% in the third quarter, which is an expansion of nearly 90 basis points year on year.Salesforce has guided fourth quarter revenue to range from $1.436 billion to $1.441 billion, implying a year on year revenue growth rate of 25% to 26%. [1] Consensus revenue estimates for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 stand at $1.44 billion, which is at the higher end of the company's guided range. The guided and consensus revenue growth rate is over 10 percentage points lower than that of fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Fourth quarter EPS consensus estimates stand at $0.14, which is at the high end of the company's guidance of $0.13 to $0.14. It is worth noting that Salesforce has beaten consensus revenue estimates consistently for the last four quarters.Fiscal 2015 full-year consensus revenue estimate is $5.37 billion, which is an expansion of 31.9% compared to the previous year. Full-year consensus revenue estimates are notably higher than Salesforce's guidance of $5.25 billion to $5.30 billion. Full-year EPS consensus estimates stand at $0.52, higher than the company's guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50. Further, the company expects to be able to deliver a 125 to 150 basis points improvement in non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal 2015.We have a price estimate of $55 for Salesforce.com, which is about 10% lower than its current market price.Era of Breakneck Revenue Growth May Be Over as Competitors Catch UpSoftware behemoths Oracle and SAP have been rapidly making their presence felt their cloud offerings. Consequently, Salesforce, which had so far been competing primarily with Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) in the CRM sector, may not be the biggest shark in the ocean for much longer. Oracle and SAP both are realigning themselves as cloud-based vendors rather than continuing with the traditional on-premises business model. Their deep pockets, longstanding customer relationships and significant brand value now pose a major threat to Salesforce's customer acquisition and retention. This is already evident in Salesforce's slowing revenue growth and soft revenue guidance. While Salesforce may still be the fastest growing cloud company, it is no longer possible for it to achieve the over-30% revenue growth rate of the past.However, it is pertinent to note that Salesforce is still beating the global CRM market by a considerable margin. The global CRM market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% through 2018, [2] which is a worst-case scenario growth rate for Salesforce. The introduction of Wave Analytics Cloud and the Salesforce1 Lightning Platform during the third quarter is expected to have contributed to revenue expansion in the fourth quarter, which may be able to prop up overall revenue growth rates. Further, Salesforce has been able to keep up new customer acquisition and billings growth so far, which may protect its short-term revenue stream. Its international expansion plans and the new European data center may also provide a minor boost to revenue expansion.Therefore, we believe that while Salesforce may no longer be able to achieve a revenue growth rate north of 30%, it may still achieve commendable growth commensurate with the size of its operations. We expect to return to this topic soon after more research.Margin Improvement Expected to Continue in Fourth QuarterSalesforce has claimed that it is on track to deliver 125-150 basis points improvement in non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal 2015. [1] Non-GAAP operating margin may improve in the fourth quarter because the annual Dreamforce event, which is generally held during the fourth quarter, was concluded in the third quarter itself this year. This may result in lower Selling, General and Administrative overhead expenses compared to the same period previous year.It is particularly remarkable that although Salesforce is not undertaking any specific restructuring or cost saving programs, it is still able to make significant progress in margin improvements. In the third quarter alone, the company achieved non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 244 basis points despite holding the biggest Dreamforce event in its history in the third quarter. If Salesforce is able to sustain this momentum in the fourth quarter, it may well be on its way to beating its guidance of margin improvement of 125-150 basis points.Disclosure: No positions."

Seen as a pioneer in the cloud software business, much of its success is a result of its software-as-a-service (or SaaS) modules and related offerings.Source: Market RealistNew Products and Acquisitions Drive Revenue GrowthSalesforce.com stock had a strong performance for much of 2014 because of its large revenue growth, new platforms, and acquisition model. The company has had consistent revenue growth since being founded in 1999, with revenue growth up close to 30% since this time last year. Being a leading company in the cloud and SaaS space, Salesforce.com is able to leverage its strengths to solidify its position in the small and medium-sized business (or SMB) space. One way it has done so is its new CRM platform Salesforce1. The platform was designed for developers, independent software vendors (or ISVs), end users, and customers. Organizations are quickly realizing the importance of the cloud, and Salesforce1 has been developed to benefit from this trend. It's a mobile application and platform allowing the company to connect with customers in an exhaustive way. It is expected that around 60% of Internet users will choose mobile customer service applications by 2015, making Salesforce1 a potential cash cow.Acquisitions are also expected to enhance capabilities for Salesforce.com, especially ExactTarget and RelateIQ. Purchased for $2.5 billion, ExactTarget brings added enhanced email campaign management and marketing automation to its marketing cloud. This acquisition also included the marketing automation application Pardot. It allows marketing and sales departments to create, deploy, and manage online marketing campaigns. Pardot increased Salesforce's revenue and enhanced its efficiency. RelateIQ was also acquired for $390 million. This acquisition should be a key value addition in the CRM space, as it eliminates the manual data entry. Besides these acquisitions, the company also announced a partnership with Microsoft. The key point to this deal is the interoperability between Salesforce.com and Microsoft Office 365. It increases Salesforce.com's offering coverage across different platforms, allowing customers to access business-class email and calendar services, online conferencing, and secure file sharing through Office 365.Algorithmic AnalysisI Know First is a financial services firm that utilizes an advanced self-learning algorithm to analyze, model and predict the stock market. The algorithm produces a forecast with a signal and a predictability indicator. The signal is the number in the middle of the box. The predictability is the number at the bottom of the box. At the top, a specific asset is identified. This format is consistent across all predictions.The signal represents the predicted movement direction or trend, and is not a percentage or specific target price. The signal strength indicates how much the current price deviates from what the system considers an equilibrium or ""fair"" price. The signal can have a positive (predicted increase) or negative (predicted decline) sign. The heat map is arranged according to the signal strength with strongest up signals at the top, while down signals are at the bottom. The table colors are indicative of the signal. Green corresponds to the positive signal and red indicates a negative signal. A deeper color means a stronger signal and a lighter color equals a weaker signal.The predictability indicator measures the importance of the signal. The predictability is the historical correlation between the prediction and the actual market movement for that particular asset, which is recalculated daily. Theoretically the predictability ranges from minus one to plus one. The higher this number is the more predictable the particular asset is. If you compare predictability for different time ranges, you'll find that the longer time ranges have higher predictability. This means that longer-range signals are more important and tend to be more accurate.All of the previously examined factors helped the company's stock perform well for most of 2014. The I Know First Algorithm had a bullish forecast for Salesforce.com on November 29th, 2013 in the one-year time horizon. The company had a signal strength of 13.34 and a predictability indicator of 0.21. In accordance with the algorithm, the value of the stock increased by 13.58% over that time.Third Quarter Earnings Report Gives Reasons For ConcernSince that time, there have been some concerns for the company, however. The main concern is the results of their third-quarter earnings report. While revenue growth and earnings per share marginally beat analysts' expectations, guidance for the fourth-quarter of this year and for next year was below consensus estimates. Concern also grew over a slowdown in the company's subscription growth. This problem is made even worse by the fact that its subscriber acquisition spending is outpacing that of its peers. Salesforce.com spends about $1.94 for each dollar of new business when the industry average is about $0.70.Although the company reported earnings per share of 14 cents, this did not use generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). While the company appears to be profitable under the non-GAAP system, using GAAP reporting considers stock-based compensation as an expense. Salesforce.com pays about 12% of its revenues in stock compensation, compared to 1.5% of revenues for Amazon, one of their main competitors. This type of compensation dilutes the share count, and while it's a non-cash expense, it definitely isn't free. Using GAAP principles, the company's earnings per share was actually a loss of 6 cents. The CEO of the company, Marc Benioff, recently sold 37,500 shares of the stock on the open market at an average of $55.50, for a total value of $2,081,250.Even though the company experienced revenue growth of roughly 30% on a year-over-year basis, its operating expenses have grown at a much higher rate. This has led to the company having negative margins since 2011. In line with these negative factors, the company's stock has been bearish for the last couple of months. The I Know First Algorithm correctly predicted that this would happen, giving Salesforce.com a signal strength of negative 15.73 and a predictability indicator of 0.45. Once again, the algorithm was correct, as the value of the stock decreased 10.03%.Future OutlookSource: Yahoo! FinanceWhile Salesforce.com stock price has decreased in recent months, market analysts still remain overwhelmingly positive about the stock. The average recommendation of 41 brokers who have initiated coverage of the stock is a buy, and they have a mean target price of $70.41. Most of the analysts believe that the lower than expected guidance provided in the most recent earnings report can be explained by strong headwinds caused by currency. The strong dollar is having negative effects on companies that have business in other regions, as the revenues are decreased when converting foreign currencies back into U.S. dollars. While many are concerned about decelerating growth in the sales cloud, a majority of analysts point to growth of new products like Salesforce1 and of other areas, addressing this concern.The algorithm agrees with the analysts' consensus opinion for both the one and three-month time horizons. For the three-month time horizon, Salesforce.com has a signal strength of 5.02 and a predictability indicator of 0.58. It is important to note once again that the signal is not a price target or percentage increase, but only indicates the predicted movement trend.While the algorithm has a bullish outlook for the company, there are things to be concerned about. The company continues to have immense revenue growth year over year, but their net margins have not followed, remaining negative. Large acquisitions, along with growing operating expenses from research and development and sales and marketing have kept the company from turning their massive revenue growth into profits. Looking to the future, the company will need to make progress on the bottom line if they are to reach analysts' expectations. The economic downturn in Europe and other regions is also of concern. Salesforce.com has a focus on small and medium sized businesses, which tend to suffer the most and shut down during times of economic uncertainty.Investors should be cautious and pay thorough attention to market conditions if investing in Salesforce.com. Although it would be encouraging to see the company post positive profits first, the revenue growth and overall company outlook make it an attractive stock. The company does expect GAAP earnings of $0.09-$0.10 for the fourth quarter, and the recent loss of value in the stock caused by the lower-than-expected guidance due to currency headwinds provides a good opportunity to buy the stock at a cheap price.I Know First Research is the analytic branch of I Know First, a financial start up company that specializes in quantitatively predicting the stock market.

2584005,72215,2014-10-22T12:29:01-04:00,"A few days ago, Salesforce.com announced the launch of the ""Wave"" that is set to target the Business Intelligence market.The Business Intelligence market has registered stable growth and was up nearly 8% in 2013, worth about $14.4 billion up until last year.Wave faces some challenges: The software is very simple and given that companies are hiring specialists to conduct data analysis, Wave might not be able to tap into the market.Salesforce posted a strong growth in its revenues during Q2: the company has raised revenue guidance for the full year and growth in revenue is likely to continue.CRM holds a 52-week bearish range of $48.18 and a bullish range of $67. The year-end estimate for the stock price is a bullish $69.28, indicating that prices might rise.","Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is working relentlessly toward expanding its sales growth and its addressable market, as it announced the launch of the Wave a few days ago. This is the sixth cloud platform that has been launched by the company, and is one that is set to target the Business Intelligence market. The new platform has been designed with the integration of the customer relationship offering, and offers features for predictive analytics as well, making data exploration easier.The growing Business Intelligence marketThe Business Intelligence market has registered stable growth over the past few years. According to Gartner, the market grew by 6.8% from 2011 to 2012, and was up nearly 8% by 2013. The agency estimated that the market was worth about $14.4 billion up until last year and is witnessing sharp rises in investments being undertaken to generate tools for users. Further growth is expected in this industry going forward, while deployment of more tools in the market also is expected to satiate demand.Tough Competition in the MarketAlthough the market provides Salesforce.com with an opportunity to not only enter, but also grow - competition in the market does not make things easy for the company. SAP dominates the market and holds a market share of about 21.3%. This rival leaves no stone unturned to continue expanding in this industry. Among its latest ventures, the company has announced its alliance with Birst which will increase the potential of sales generation, while allowing both companies to take advantage of the new customer base that arises as a result of this deal.Besides the tough competition being put up by SAP, Salesforce.com also has to compete against rivalslike Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and SAS Institute that hold the second (13.9%), third (12.7%) and fourth (11.8%) position in the market in terms of market share, respectively.Gartner also believes that the market will experience an increase in its sales outlook, going forward, as business begin to pick up their demand for predictive analytics tools in the near future.It is believed that the market for Business Intelligence has only begun picking up the pace. BI platform sales are estimated at $8.55 billion, and future predictions estimate that this segment, particularly the tools for prescriptive and predictive analytics, is expected to provide companies with profitable growth going forward.Challenges Down the RoadGiven that Wave has been launched into a market that Salesforce.com is pushing hard to pave its way into, it faces a number of challenges. Wave primarily markets itself as a simple software that is easy to use by users who are not specialists. But the catch in this situation is that companies are already hiring specialists and data analysts who are capable of using advance analytical tools to contribute to business operations. This puts Salesforce.com in a bit of a dilemma where it will either need to beef up its platform to cater to the needs of advanced specialists while giving up its idea of simplicity, or it could continue forward on the same road and remain too simple, which in the case of the market, is a huge risk as well. Furthermore, if Salesforce.com does in fact begin targeting professionals, it will have to adapt the way it sells its products as it is now accustomed to selling to very different end users than the professional ones.Another problem that Salesforce.com could face is that not many companies might be willing to migrate their data out of their current database onto Salesforce for the fear of data loss or even because it might be expensive. Although many businesses have data on Salesforce already, this might not be a big blow to the company, but given that other companies like Cloudera, Pentaho and Tableau are offering downloadable software, and making significant headway into the market, it is nonetheless an indication that companies would actually prefer bringing software closer to the data that they already hold, rather than migrating data anywhere else.Financial ResultsSalesforce.com recently announced its second quarter results for FY2015 and reported a 30% jump in its revenues which amounted to $1.32 billion. Deferred revenues also witnessed a 31% year-on-year increase amounted to $2.35 billion. Operating cash flow of the company was up 34% and was recorded at $246 million.GAAP loss per share was announced at 10 cents. Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share were recorded at 13 cents, and were reported higher since they do not include the effects of stock compensation expenses, amortization, interest expenses and losses on conversion of senior notes.Third quarter revenues are expected to increase by 27% and range between $1.365 billion to $1.370 billion. GAAP loss per share is expected to range between 12 cents to 13 cents, while non-GAAP earnings are expected at 12 cents to 13 cents.The company also raised its revenue guidance for FY15 and states that revenues might range between $4.34 billion to $5.37 billion. These estimates were up by $30 million from the previous guidance. GAAP loss per share is expected to range between 48 cents to 46 cents, while non-GAAP earnings are expected at 50 cents to 52 cents.Outlook for Salesforce.comThe entry that Salesforce.com has made into this new market is definitely a positive one, and raises the company outlook for the years ahead. However, competition remains one of the key challenges that the company should not lose sight of at any point in time, despite the market being large enough to accommodate another platform developer. Salesforce will have to push harder into its market to ensure that it gains the traction that it hopes for.Shares for the company hold a 52-week range bearish range of $48.18 and a bullish range of $67. Going forward, the one-year target estimate for stock prices is a bullish $69.28 indicating that stock prices definitely have room to grow and spiral upwards in some rallies that are expected in the future, driven by new product launches and better earning results.Revenue outlook for the company stands strong based on the fact that this new market is not the only arena that Salesforce.com is dependent on its growth for. Given that the Business Intelligence market is a large one, Salesforce.com has a higher probability of success. Furthermore, its upbeat performance in its other business segments will contribute to its top and bottom line growth in the future, as the outlook for the financial results remain strong and investor sentiment remains positive about Salesforce.com."
2705015,71215,2014-11-23T16:09:10-05:00,Salesforce.com has been driving revenue growth through acquisitions.Management has a long track record of selling stock.The company's $3.8 billion in goodwill is concerning.,"BackgroundOn November 19, 2014, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported a 3Q FY 2015 net loss of $38.9 million (-$0.06 GAAP, $0.14 Adjusted) on sales of $1.38 billion compared to a net loss of $124.4 million (-$0.21 per share GAAP, $0.09 Adjusted) on sales of $1.08 billion in the same period last year. These numbers matched Estimize-reported consensus earnings estimates of $0.14 per share (Adjusted) on sales of $1.38 billion. These numbers are based on a fully diluted share count of 629.5 million in 2014 and 600.5 million in 2013.Key FinancialsGuidanceQ4 FY 15Full-Year FY 2015Full-Year FY 2016 (ends January 2016)Quick TakeOn the company's earnings call, management's discussion focused primarily on the company's sales growth. CRM has made a substantial number of acquisitions and sales have continued to grow. The company recorded sales of $1.38 billion in the quarter compared to $1.08 billion in the same quarter last year. Management spent little to no time talking about earnings or cash generation, but repeatedly emphasized sales numbers and the company's high profile clients.While the company's sales growth has been impressive, its earnings power and cash generation are not inspiring.Management also provided sales guidance through the full FY 2016, which is surprising. It's puzzling how management can give precise guidance on sales going a year out when it is still in the process of finalizing acquisitions. For a company in a stable industry (i.e. tobacco) this would be understandable, but for the self-proclaimed world's number one CRM company, which operates in a growing industry, it seems ambitious and makes me wonder what the process for recognizing the company's deferred revenue is.CEO Marc Benioff has a consistent track record of open-market sales of CRM common stock, which is quite troubling. He has sold millions in stock this year. Furthermore, management's discussion of the company's earnings in ""primarily non-GAAP terms"" ignores the company's actual performance. According to the 8-K filed with the earnings:$139 million in stock-based compensation in the quarter amounts to $0.21 per share in compensation, based on the 659 million shares outstanding in the quarter. This massive amount of compensation, coupled with management's consistent record of insider selling, gives the impression that CRM executives see the company as a piggy bank rather than a platform for developing next-generation software.CRM's balance sheet consists of $3.78 billion in goodwill out of $9.41 billion in total assets, reflecting it's acquisitions. Furthermore, the company's cash flow from operations of $122.5 million shows that its acquisition spree is not translating to bottom-line performanceIf management's acquisitions don't materialize over the next several quarters we could see some substantial goodwill impairment charges that will negatively impact future earnings. Management's posture doesn't reflect a solid foundation and the company's balance sheet isn't sound. While I don't feel comfortable shorting CRM, it's not a name I would want in a long-term portfolio.Conference call transcript available from Seeking Alpha here. 8-k with financials and press release available here."
2703435,23479,2014-11-21T17:44:15-05:00,"Revenues from subscriptions and support grew 28% in Q3FY15, slower than the 36% reported in a similar period last fiscal year.Revenues from professional services decelerated from nearly 50% in Q3FY14 to 33%.The company provided revenue guidance of $6.45 - $6.50 billion for FY16, lower than consensus estimates of about $6.52 billion and our estimate of $6.66 billion.","Cloud Customer Relationship Management company Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported a mixed set of results on Wednesday. Quarterly revenues for Q3FY15 stood at $1.383 billion, higher than its earlier guidance of $1.365 billion - $1.37 billion. However, the growth rate slipped during the quarter, declining from 37% in Q3FY14 to 30% in Q3FY15. Although a part of the slowdown is attributable to Salesforce's sheer size and scale, which makes it difficult to maintain a growth rate over 35%, we believe company-specific factors also contributed to a possible slowdown during the quarter.Strong operational discipline and cost management helped a strong expansion in operating and net income levels in fiscal year 2015. Non-GAAP operating income expanded nearly 47% on a year-on-year basis from $284 million to $417 million, resulting in an increase in margins from 9.72% to 10.61%. Furthermore, non-GAAP earnings increased from 28 cents per share in Q3FY14 to 38 cents per share this quarter following the robust growth in non-GAAP operating income. However, loss per share in GAAP earnings widened to -32 cents in 9MFY15 compared to -19 cents in 9MFY14, due to an increase in income tax provisions in fiscal year 2015.Business Realignment Weighs on Q3FY15 Top Line GrowthRevenues from subscriptions and support grew 28% in Q3FY15, slower than the 36% reported in a similar period last fiscal year. Similarly, revenues from professional services decelerated from nearly 50% in Q3FY14 to 33% this quarter. Comparatively, year-on-year growth in Q2FY15 for both the subscription and professional service divisions stood at 37% and 58%, respectively. The company reported a change in strategy to provide custom, industry-specific Customer Relationship Management platforms across six industries to enhance customer value.We believe the segregation of sales personnel and allocation of new client accounts following this business realignment could have contributed to a slowdown in revenues during the quarter. Although the third quarter has been a softer quarter for Salesforce, with fewer subscription renewals historically, the move to build solutions for specific industries instead of rolling out an industry-agnostic CRM platform requires significant industry-specific training on part of sales personnel, impacting near term sales growth.Year-on-year growth in revenues from the Americas region, which accounts for the largest share of sales, decelerated sharply from 41% in Q3FY14 to 29% in Q3FY15. European revenues also decelerated in Q3FY15 compared to a prior year period, due to a challenging macroeconomic environment in the Eurozone region. Shares of Salesforce dropped about 4.5% after the company provided revenue guidance of $6.45 - $6.50 billion for FY16, lower than consensus estimates of about $6.52 billion and our estimate of $6.66 billion.Going forward, we expect near-term sales growth to remain constrained, given the reduced efficiency of the sales personnel in the new organizational setup. However, long term sales are likely to benefit from successful execution of the ""New Industries Strategy"" as new customer adoption and renewal rates are expected to increase from these industry-specific solutions.Expanding Margins Could Improve Valuation ProspectsSalesforce has been fueling its robust revenue growth by investing heavily into its operations, driving down margins over the years. The company has always been known for its strategy to prioritize revenue growth over profitability. Non-GAAP operating profit margins have nearly halved in the past five years, dropping from 16.5% in FY10 to 8.93% in FY14. Within the application software vertical, Customer Relationship Management has been the fastest growing sub-segment and is pegged to grow to $37 billion by 2018. Given the rapid evolution of competition in the CRM market in recent times, we believe the pace of investment into Research and Development and Sales and Marketing operations is justified, so as to maximize product functionality while growing its customer base and market share.For the nine months into FY15, non-GAAP margins expanded nearly 1% to 10.6%, driven by lower General and Administrative expenses. Margins in the fourth quarter have historically been close to margins in Q3, and we expect full FY15 non-GAAP operating profit margins at about 10.75%. Going forward, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to gradually expand to 13% by FY21.The competitive nature of the booming CRM market, particularly in the SaaS-based CRM segment, should reign in pricing going forward and subsequently, operating profit margins. We have factored in low margin expansion prospects into our discounted cash flow valuation for Salesforce. However, there could be a 19% increase in our Salesforce price estimate if the company manages to expand its non-GAAP operating profit margins to 14.5% by FY21.Disclosure: No positions."

Revenues were up 29% y/y, with subscription/support revenue up 28%. Deferred revenues were up 28% y/y to $2.2bn.Pressuring the stock was the less-than-expected guidance. Q4 fiscal 2015 guidance was for revenues to be $1.436bn-$1.441bn, up 25% y/y, but below the $1.145bn consensus. Full-year 2015 guidance is expected to be $5.365bn-$5.37bn, suggested growth of 32% y/y.Fiscal 2016 revenues are expected to be upwards of $6.5bn, which is near the high-end of previous guidance, and suggests a 20% y/y growth. But it was below the $6.66bn consensus. Despite sales expectations coming in below expectations, the key is that sales are still growing at a very robust rate.The stock is down 4% over the last week, but we're still up 14.5% over the last six months.The market has a hard time making up its mind with CRM. Shares have proved volatile, but just because the stock hasn't gone up in smooth up-and-to-the-right fashion doesn't take anything away from the fact that its stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 200 percentage points over the last five years.We covered CRM back in September, noting that it could turn out to be a long-term investment. As we noted:Trading at 6.7x fiscal 2015 sales, its valuation is justified in a historical context. And looking out to 2016, CRM trades at 5.5x sales. With a strong balance sheet and robust expected earnings growth, we like CRM for the long term."
2785095,78265,2014-12-30T11:22:23-05:00,"In this article, we tell the story of why investors should avoid Salesforce.com.Salesforce.com has poor returns, lots of debt and a high price tag, so investors beware!We believe current shareholders should move to a well-defended, high-ROA castle with a nice, wide moat.","A picture is worth a thousand words. With that in mind, let us give you 5,000 words of information in our short article on Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). We believe it's often possible to tell a story with graphs. When we review some of our favorite charts as they pertain to Salesforce.com, we see a story that represents a terrible mixture of poor returns at expensive prices. In particular, we're concerned about the collapse of tangible book value per share, ROA, ROE and EBIT, alongside high levels of debt. Compounding this is the fact that investors are being asked to pay a very high price for CRM shares.The Story Begins: Tangible Book, EBIT And ROA OH MY!Come along with us now as we tell the story of this company that we believe is going to destroy shareholder wealth in the coming years.Salesforce.com had optimistic beginnings. Once upon a time, tangible book value per share grew fairly consistently. Then it plummeted.Source: GurufocusThe same thing happened to operating earnings. Things looked quite good in the kingdom of Salesforce.com, then EBIT per share went negative in July 2011 and has never looked back.Source: GurufocusThe company's ROA and ROE figures have also declined. They made their best returns in 2005 and have been in slow decline since. ROA and ROE went negative in 2011 and nothing in the kingdom of Salesforce.com has been able to revive them.Source: GurufocusThe Ugly DebtIn addition, the managers of Salesforce.com decided to burden the good shareholders of the company with a huge debt load. In January of 2013 debt was zero. As of October 2014, debt was $1.4 billion.Source: GurufocusThe Ole Revenue-Net Income DisconnectThe spookiest part of our story involves the comparison between revenue and net income. We hope you're sitting down. Revenue has ballooned over the past 10 years, yet net income has remained relatively flat.Source: GurufocusThis graph tells a powerful story and is eerily familiar to us as we build up a library of short ideas. Whenever we see such a graph, we're prompted to ask two questions: If a company cannot convert rising revenue into rising profits, what good is ""growth?"" And if a company can't achieve higher levels of profitability alongside such fast revenue growth, what will it take to drive profits higher? We don't have an answer to either question.In addition to all of this, investors should be aware that since January of 2011, the company has generated $1.8 billion from financing activities and $3.59 billion from operations. This means that of the $5.39 billion the company has generated over the past 4 years, fully a third came from bankers.What Of Price?That's how the underlying company is doing. That's the ""value"" in the ""value-price"" relationship. But what of the price that we're being asked to pay? In the canon of Western literature, we may find examples of admittedly poor characters that are ""too undervalued."" Is that the case here? It turns out that investors are being asked to pay for Salesforce.com as if it had already achieved greatness. The problem is that (former?) greatness continues to elude it.Because there's no net income, P/E is of course impossible. Just because there are no earnings, though, doesn't mean the story can't take an interesting twist. We'll move further up the income statement and compare enterprise value (39.09 billion) to EBIT. Looking at the last four quarters, we see EBIT of: -104 million, -55 million, -33 million and -22 million for a total of -214 million. Comparing this to enterprise value, gives us an EV/EBIT of ~-182 (quite expensive) and a cash flow yield of ~ -1/2%. It would be a better to put this capital to work in a treasury bill or a checking account or replace the pea under the mattress with this capital.Concluding RemarksWe hope you have enjoyed our short story in graphs of the tale of Salesforce.com. More importantly, we hope you heed our warning and turn back before investing in this high-priced, poor-returning company. There are much safer places for investors in the wild world of capital markets."
2756645,76975,2014-12-17T09:41:08-05:00,Shares of Salesforce have fallen out of favor with investors after the company issued weak revenue guidance for fiscal 2016.Slowing top line growth at Salesforce might allow it to cut down its high sales and marketing costs and allow it to become profitable.The company's shares are likely to climb much higher if it becomes consistently profitable.,"Shares of leading CRM company Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) have taken quite a hammering ever since the company issued weaker-than-expected revenue guidance for fiscal 2016. As of midday Monday, the stock has tanked roughly 8.5% since November 19 when CRM revealed it expected revenue growth in the coming fiscal year to clock in at $6.45 billion-$6.50 billion, or 20%-21% growth. For a company that has been growing its top line at a 30%-plus clip over the last five years, the low guidance was disconcerting and caught many investors by surprise.Source: StatistaSalesforce.com has richly rewarded long-term investors; the stock has been a 10-bagger, climbing more than 1,000% since the company went public. Despite it's impressive growth, Salesforce's bottom line has been nowhere near as impressive. The company has not reported a GAAP profit since 2011. Salesforce enjoys the same equivocations as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) - both companies have managed to make investors comfortable with red ink. While slowing growth is nothing to be proud of, the trend might actually be a blessing in disguise.Slower Growth Might Allow Salesforce To Become ProfitableOne chief characteristic of pure-play SaaS companies such as Salesforce, NetSuite (NYSE:N), Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), Concur Technologies (NASDAQ:CNQR) and others is that they sport high sales and marketing expenses as a percentage or revenue. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has the second highest SaaS revenue after Salesforce. The company's Sales & Marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue are just 20%.This conundrum of high sales and marketing expenses puts a lot of pressure on the operating margins of these companies. Apart from Oracle, all the other SaaS companies mentioned here are not profitable.High marketing costs is a key component of a typical SaaS company. Legacy software companies such as Oracle and SAP (NYSE:SAP) are luckier than SaaS companies in that they sell perpetual licenses and charge customers a large one-time license fee upfront, plus maybe another 15%-20% of the license fee as maintenance fee every year. A large chunk of Oracle's revenue does not come from selling new software, but rather from license updates, as well as support and maintenance of installed software. These companies benefit because their revenue and marketing expenses are almost perfectly aligned. SaaS companies, however, operate quite differently.Companies such as Salesforce are, however, not so lucky. Unlike old-line software companies, SaaS companies operate by ''renting out'' software to companies which use it and pay on a monthly basis. These companies incur huge customer acquisition costs upfront, but their revenue comes in gradually as the months roll on. For a SaaS company to generate enough revenue to cover its operation expenses, it has little choice but to expand its customer base as wide as possible. Moreover, typical customer contracts last 12-24 months, meaning the company has to spend quite lot of money to minimize churn and make sure customers renew contracts. Other characteristics of SaaS companies include:What all this boils down to is that the more a SaaS company grows its customer base, the higher its marketing expenses continue to grow, making it even harder for the company to turn a profit. Simply put, as long as a SaaS company is growing revenue rapidly, it becomes incredibly hard for it to become profitable.A company like Salesforce, however, is able to milk more revenue from its existing customer base via upselling and upgrades. Salesforce charges more for every extra person that uses its software and also increases the charge per person for extra features. Salesforce's net churn (rate of cancellation minus the rate of upgrades) is also quite low and can sometimes turn into negative churn. But that does not inure the company from the curse of all SaaS companies. As long as Salesforce is growing its top line at a brisk clip, it's likely to continue languishing in the red.That's why Salesforce growing its top line around 20% instead of the recent 35%-plus clip could actually help the company become profitable. Of the operating expenses listed above, both R&D and administration expenses are quite inelastic and are not likely to be affected much by slower growth. But sales and marketing expenses, by far the company's biggest line item, are likely to come down considerably and ease margin pressure, allowing it to start turning a profit consistently.Stock-Based Executive CompensationMany investors contend that Salesforce’s unusually high stock-based executive compensation is one of the reasons the company has remained unprofitable - and they are right. Salesforce spends roughly 10%-12% of its revenue in stock-based compensation, which is simply excessive. In the current fiscal year, it will dole out $564.16 million, or 10.5% of its revenue, as stock-based compensation. In contrast, the average tech company spends 1%-3% of revenue as stock-based compensation. For instance, Amazon typically spends less than 1% of its revenue as stock-based compensation, though of course its revenue is much larger than Salesforce’s. Salesforce’s high stock-based compensation not only places a lot of pressure on its bottom line, but also keeps on diluting its shares, sometimes by as much as 5% every year. In comparison, Amazon’s share dilution never runs higher than 1%. This is usually not a big problem when investors are happy with the company and keep bidding up its share price, but could become problematic when investors are feeling skittish about it.What’s worrying about Salesforce’s stock-based compensation is that it keeps growing in tandem with revenue growth. This means that unless the company changes its policy, investors should not expect this trend to change. In its defense, Salesforce started the practice of rewarding its employees handsomely with stock back in the days when it faced bare-knuckle competition from Oracle and SAP. Back then, the company had little cash flow to speak of, and had to devise a means to attract top talent from Silicon Valley to help it compete effectively against its deep-pocketed rivals. The company has, however, over time managed to build a lot of goodwill around it and should have no problem retaining top talent without being profligate.How Soon Can Salesforce Become Profitable?Salesforce's strategy at this point could be to start slamming the brakes on its customer acquisition spree. Former CFO Graham Smith once hinted that the company had a goal to become profitable by the time it hit $10 billion in sales. Assuming the company will focus on growing organically and has no plans to make another large acquisition like ExactTarget and maintains a 20% revenue growth rate going forward, then it will hit $10 billion in sales in 14 quarters. The company might, however, become profitable sooner than that. Assuming Salesforce's sales and marketing expenses grow at only 10% going forward and its stock-based compensation holds steady at the current level, the company could become profitable in as little as 4 quarters.Stock PerformanceSalesforce has a consensus analsyts Buy rating, with Goldmann Sachs and Stern Agee being the latest analysts to rate it as a buy. The stock has a consensus target price of $69.39, suggesting 26% upside to current price. I, however, believe that Goldman Sach's target price of $74, or 34.3% upside to current price, is more realistic guided by a number of factors. Salesforce remains the leading CRM company with 16% market share. The CRM market is predicted to grow at a healthy 21% clip to hit $37 billion by 2014 giving Salesforce good growth runways. Moreover, Salesforce has managed to differentiate its CRM offerings from those by players like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle.Given the spate of consolidations in the market by large players such as Oracle and IBM, I expect the large players to continue gobbling up smaller players thus eliminating some competition and the need to spend heavily on sales and marketing. Salesforce might also continue pulling off large buyouts like ExactTarget, which will allow it grow inorganically. Moreover, Salesforce has managed to differentiate its CRM offerings from those by other players in the space.With Salesforce becoming profitable while maintaining strong topline growth, you can expect its shares to hit fresh highs."
2561855,23479,2014-10-14T16:52:55-04:00,"Through its new business intelligence cloud offering, Salesforce intends to provide customers with predictive analytics features.Salesforce Wave is designed to make it easier for everyone to explore data, uncover new insights and take action instantly from any device.Salesforce could benefit from a SaaS analytics platform, but competition is intense in the BI Market.","The world's largest cloud software company, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), looks to be working toward expanding its own addressable market to accelerate its sales growth and pull away from its competitors. The company launched a sixth cloud platform named Wave on October 13, 2014, to enter the Business Intelligence market. [1] Through this new cloud offering, Salesforce intends to provide customers with predictive analytics features by integrating its own Customer Relationship cloud offering. Salesforce Wave is designed to make it easier for everyone to explore data, uncover new insights and take action instantly from any device.We have a Trefis price estimate of $55 for Salesforce.com, approximately 3.3% higher than its current market price of $53.Predictive Analytics Tools to Bolster Growth in Business Intelligence MarketGartner estimates the Business Intelligence (BI) market at about $14.4 billion in 2013, up nearly 8% from 2012. [2] Comparatively, the year 2012 witnessed a 7% growth in the BI market on a year-on-year basis from 2011. [3] Despite the faster growth in the BI market in 2013, investments into mainstream BI tools that generate actionable insights have been tepid, with significant investments into ancillary tools such as experimental silos, infrastructure and other support services. Deployment of mainstream BI tools that leverage analytics on big data are likely to accelerate going forward.German enterprise software giant SAP is the market leader in the BI space, with revenues of over $3 billion, indicating a market share of approximately 21.3%. [2] SAP has been able to support its organic analytics tools from the BusinessObjects line with acquisitions, such as KXEN. Additionally, the launch of the BusinessObjects suite on HANA has further provided strength to its existing analytics portfolio. The second, third and fourth spots are held in close contention by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and SAS Institute respectively, with market shares of 13.9%, 12.7% and 11.8%, respectively. [2]According to Mr. Dan Sommer, research director at Gartner, ""As the BI market shifts gear, we see a series of tipping points in 2014 that will accelerate adoption, but it may come from a different place. These tipping points are that half of BI and analytics spend will be business driven, half of new license spend will be driven by data discovery requirements, and half of organizations will consider deploying BI in the cloud, at least tactically."" [2] We believe predictive analytics tools that are business-driven in nature would begin to witness a significant uptick in sales going forward.Salesforce Could Benefit from SaaS Analytics Platform, But Competition is Intense in BI MarketGiven the extensive network Salesforce has built in its Sales and Service clouds, utilizing that data on the Wave platform to unveil new insights could immensely benefit its customers. Companies can quickly deploy sales, service and marketing analytics, or build custom mobile analytics apps, using any data source. As of now, Salesforce intends to offer Wave as an analytics tool for sales, service and marketing departments. However, partner companies will be working on other domains, such as human resources and finance. The standalone Salesforce Wave comes in two variants - one for ""builders"" with access to create and manage data sets priced at $250/month, and one for ""explorers"" with access to viewing and sharing data insights and dashboards, priced at $125/month. [1]However, the BI market is only warming up to new areas of focus such as predictive and prescriptive analytics. Currently, BI platforms (both on-premise and on-demand) account for nearly 60% of the overall market, or $8.55 billion in sales. [2] These platforms require business analysts to build huge data warehouses and create schemes to access data. While this segment of the market has posted a healthy 9% growth over 2012, niche tools that provide predictive and prescriptive analytics, which stand at just over $1 billion in sales in 2013, seem to be a more lucrative opportunity going forward. A recent report from McKinsey Global Institute highlights that decisions based on data-driven insights result in 23 times greater likelihood of customer acquisition, 6 times greater likelihood of customer retention and 19 times greater likelihood of profitability. [1]While the entry from Salesforce into the analytics realm is certainly a positive development with good long term prospects, the near-term outlook is challenging due to strong competition in the more mature product areas. As niche product areas gain traction, Salesforce has the opportunity to create tools that disrupt the traditional market trend, something it has done well in the past.Disclosure: No positions."

The company has exhibited extremely strong revenue growth (growing 38% in the most recent quarter) but has not been able to obtain profitability on that strong top line as of yet. The company looks poised to continue its growth with its recent tender offer for ExactTarget but the ultimate return may occur from obtaining better than expected margin expansion and the market rewarding it as a newly profitable company. However, given the current valuation and recent market pullback, we are currently neutral.Business Description: Salesforce.com is the leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a strong focus on customer relationship management (CRM) service offerings to their customers. Company was founded on delivering CRM applications via the internet or ""cloud."" The company's products include: Sales Cloud, which enables companies to grow and monetize their sales pipeline, Service Cloud: platform for customer service, Marketing Cloud: customer platform for one to one marketing solutions, and Salesforce1: cloud platform for developing customer apps. Companies benefit from the ease of integration and configuration, lower cost of total ownership, and rapid deployment.ExactTarget Acquisition A Smart Move: Salesforce acquired ExactTarget for $2.5 billion in cash in 2013. ExactTarget is a software company catering to marketing departments. Some of ExactTarget's customers include: Nike, Gap, and Coca-Cola. ExactTarget competes with Constant Contact (NASDAQ:CTCT), MailChimp, and Responsys (NASDAQ:MKTG). This acquisition will allow Salesforce to obtain subscription revenue from marketing departments, with CMOs expected to outspend CIOs by 2017.Valuation:Comparable enterprise sales focused companies were selected in order to value Salesforce.com. A five times enterprise value to revenue multiple was selected given CRM's higher revenue growth versus its peers, but was selectively reduced given its lack of profitability. Basic shares outstanding were utilized (note that diluted shares would lower price target). Based on this analysis we feel the stock is relatively fairly valued at current levels and are looking for other technology investments in the sector at more attractive entry points.Risk Factors:"
2491635,41741,2014-09-12T16:11:02-04:00,The company still trades at a high valuation but it could be a growth story.It reported another solid quarter that topped estimates and expects the rest of the year to be impressive.Its acquisitions and new product launches should carry the stock higher in 2015.,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is one of those high-flying SaaS companies that trades at a high valuation - 86x forward earnings. It reported 2Q earnings that had investors spirits heightened. Revenues grew to $1.32 billion, up by more than 37% compared to the previous year, and besting consensus estimates of $1.29 billion. This growth comes as there was a rapid acceptance of its cloud-based solutions, favorable foreign exchange rates and the acquisition of ExactTarget.Gross margin was 78.3%, down by around 1.3% given the acquisition costs. Adjusted operating expenses grew by just under 33% to $1.03 billion mainly because of larger investments in sales and marketing and research and development. However, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues fell by 2.87% compared to the same quarter of the previous year.Non-GAAP diluted earnings came to $0.13 per share, an increase of 44% over the previous year. The company's higher expenditure on marketing is beginning to pay off judging by the double-digit increases in revenues and profits. Revenue growth in North America was 39% and growth in Europe and Asia was 42% and 29%, respectively.What the future holdsThe company has forecast sales for fiscal year 2015 above analyst expectations. The figure will be between $5.34 billion and $5.37 billion, compared to the analysts' consensus estimate of $5.34 billion. For the third quarter ending in October, sales will be around $1.37 billion and earnings will be around $0.12 and $0.13 per share. Analysts had, on average, expected earnings of $0.13 per share on revenues of $1.37 billion.The company is the largest supplier of customer management software and the effect of recent acquisitions and the establishment of a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to have kick started growth in the enterprise business. Salesforce has built its business platform around cloud computing where customer access is online unlike rivals such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP SE which still rely on premises technology for growth. As a result, revenues are expected to grow by 30% or more for the third consecutive year.Large spending on acquisitions has restricted profits since 2011 and the company does not expect to report a full fiscal net profit until 2017. CEO Benioff points out that the spending results in returns and he describes the process as ""getting Salesforce on steroids."" For instance, the sales of ExactTarget's products have grown by 10% to $122 million over the previous year. The growth has expanded the company's presence in locations worldwide including large office facilities in San Francisco and London.A different approach to enterprise softwareSalesforce has used a different approach to its customers by becoming a dominant presence in the provision of PaaS (platform as a service) with its product offering called Salesforce1. Platform as a Service (PAAS) is a cloud-based initiative which provides developers with a framework on which to build applications making them quick, straightforward and cost-effective. In other words, it streamlines the process of application development by offering software and tools and even infrastructure such as servers.This additional product offering provides the company with robust margins compared to companies that offer the separate elements separately. This is illustrated by the company's latest deal with Safeway which chose the Salesforce1 platform to build applications for increased productivity. Safeway will be able to integrate all its stores and associates on a single platform for communication. International Data Corporation reports that the platform-as-a-service market is expected to be worth over $14 billion by 2017 and the entire customer relationship market is expected to touch $36 billion by the same year. Salesforce is well positioned to take advantage.Bottom lineSalesforce.com continues to lose money on a GAAP basis and pays no dividends. However, patient investors should be rewarded in due course as large marketing and acquisitions spending begin to generate profits.Already, the optimistic forecast for 2015 is a good indication of what lies ahead. The company has already rewarded its investors with a price increase of more than 30% over the last year. We still see it as a growth story. Against the current price of $60, the target prices set by analysts are anywhere between $70 and $80."

        Salesforce is moving into new areas such as wearables, which should open up a new area for growth in the future.","Since my last Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) article in May, shares of the customer relationship management company have appreciated close to 19%. In that article, I had written about why the shorts are wrong about Salesforce. The company has been delivering terrific growth in revenue, and since it operates in a fast-growing market, its performance can improve further.In a little over three months since that article, Salesforce's short float has declined further. At the end of April, Salesforce has 45.14 million shares short according to my previous article, but at the end of May, the short float fell to 43.33 million shares. This is not surprising if we consider Salesforce's performance and its prospects.Tremendous growth expectedFor example, in the second quarter, Salesforce.com announced total revenue of $1.32 billion, a 38% increase on an year-over-year basis. Moreover, for the third quarter of 2015, its revenue is projected to increase 27% on a year-over-year basis, while adjusted earnings are expected to come in between $0.12 and $0.13 per share, up from the year-ago earnings of $0.09 per share. Its projected revenue and earnings for the third quarter are also in line with estimates.Moreover, Salesforce's long-term prospects are also quite bright. In the course of the next five years, the company's bottom line is projected to grow at an annual rate of 28%, which is almost double of the 15% industry average. In addition, the company's cash flow generation is also impressive, as Salesforce has generated $1.13 billion in operating cash over the past year, apart from $1.09 billion in levered free cash flow.The end-market opportunity is strongAdditionally, investors should also note that the company is plying its trade in a fast growing CRM space, and it is closing new deals at a fast pace. According to Gartner, the CRM space is on track to become a $36 billion market by 2017. According to a Forbes report:Salesforce is doing well to make the most of this opportunity, as its revenue growth shows. The company has made a number of moves to grow its business, especially acquisitions. Last year, Salesforce acquired ExactTarget, and it has successfully integrated it into its portfolio. This acquisition has brought the ExactTarget Marketing Cloud to Salesforce's portfolio, which should allow the company to tap growth in digital marketing.This is a smart move, as digital marketing is slated to grow at a good pace going forward. As per Forrester, spending on digital marketing is expected to double in five years. In fact, this market will represent around 30% of total marketing spending by 2017.Further, in response to the rising competition, Salesforce had also acquired social media monitoring company Radian6 Technologies and social media marketer Buddy Media. In July, Salesforce acquired RelateIQ as well for approximately $390 million. This acquisition has added the capability of spontaneously capturing data from calendars, email, and smartphone calls to its portfolio. With such moves, Salesforce has bolstered its product platform, which has allowed it to land more deals.According to management:Services will continue driving growthMoreover, Forbes has named Salesforce the world's most innovative company for the fourth year in a row. This showcases its persistent focus on the customer, as the company is focused on delivering an innovative customer platform. Moreover, its Sales Cloud has been reported to be the leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Salesforce automation for the eighth year in a row.In addition, IDC recently declared Service Cloud to be a cutting edge platform for servicing and supporting customers. Salesforce launched Service Cloud SOS in April, which provides quick and tailored customer service within any mobile app, giving customers the ability to manage their business on mobile. In addition, the company's updated Salesforce Journey Builder enables personalized planning and personalized optimization for one-to-one customer interactions across various channels.The breadth of the Salesforce platform can be seen by its wide enterprise cloud ecosystem. It has more than 1.7 million developers leveraging its development tools on mobile using Salesforce1. Several customers have already turned toward Salesforce1, and its apps have now been installed over 2.5 million times by its enterprise customers.Recently, Salesforce announced its partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft is expected to have become the largest customer of the Salesforce marketing cloud platform. The software giant has built a new product called Office 365 onto the marketing cloud, and it is using Journey Builder to augment its application.Moreover, the company recently launched its Salesforce Wear initiative, in line with the shifting trend toward the wearable market. Salesforce is trying to integrate wearables with its enterprise infrastructure, and as this market grows, it should see more traction.ConclusionConsidering Salesforce's moves and the opportunity in the end market, it is not surprising to see why the shorts are moving away from the stock. The company's bottom line is expected to grow at a tremendous pace in the future, and the consistent addition of features on its platform should allow it to land more customers going forward. Thus, investors should remain invested in Salesforce even after its solid run in the past three months, as the stock looks well-positioned to climb further."

Going forward, I have high conviction that the company will continue to execute in new areas, which will drive the company's valuations going forward. Also, Salesforce.com has made strategic acquisitions like ExactTarget, and RelateIQ, which adds to Salesforce.com's core ecosystem of services and software. A stronger ecosystem will drive more sales through cross-sale opportunities.Salesforce.com finds itself in the envious position of being in a rapid growth phase, and while the business could be much more profitable, I think the investments that are being made now are reasonable in light of future pay-offs. I think the stock trades at a fair value currently, but I think bottom line and top line growth will take the value of the stock much higher over the next five years.Cloud will drive Salesforce.com's growthSalesforce.com has a different approach to the cloud, and with the core enterprise software, Salesforce.com is one of the better CRM tools that an enterprise can deploy to manage sales relationships. Salesforce.com has pivoted into becoming a dominant PaaS provider (platform as a service) via its offering called Salesforce1.For those unfamiliar to PaaS, here's a definition from Apprenda:Salesforce1 basically streamlines the process of building an application that can be accessed by offering the necessary software, and tools to do it, and even the infrastructure (mainframe PCs). This added level of service gives Salesforce.com added margin versus just offering infrastructure. Salesforce.com has been able to gain various customer wins, as Salesforce1 makes it considerably easier for organizations to create software that's unique to their needs and can be accessed via a mobile application or via the Internet.According to Marc Benioff:Salesforce.com is an enabler to productivity as it gives companies the tools and infrastructure needed to drive productivity in the workplace. By broadening the market through tools and back-end infrastructure, Salesforce.com has been able to pivot from its dependency on selling its own productivity software and instead become a software development and infrastructure provider. This part of the market is expected to grow at a fairly high rate and the business has great exposure to it.Source: Salesforce.comThe company doesn't offer any comps to prior periods and the prior earnings release didn't break down the segment revenue. However, the Salesforce1 platform comprises a respectable mix of total revenue (15 percent). This segment offers a lot of growth potential and, assuming the company continues to build the front-end experience paired with continued back-end infrastructure investment, Salesforce1 will eventually become Salesforce.com's largest business segment in terms of revenue.Quoted from Reuters:Bottom lineSalesforce.com is definitely one of the more speculative plays in the cloud. On the bright side, the company continues to exhibit high growth rates, and acquisitions offer meaningful value.I price the stock at 111.72 times non-GAAP 2015 fiscal year EPS of $.52. My price target is currently $58.09; the present valuation of the stock is $59.23. The stock trades at a value higher than my current price target, but the five-year growth trajectory is still compelling, as the company will continue to grow sales and will eventually adjust its cost structure to reflect higher margins, which will drive earnings. Assuming the company reports respectable free cash flow at some point in the next five years, the company will eventually return cash to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends.Therefore, the business is a long-term buy, even though stock price appreciation may be limited over the next several months."

Technology seems to be advancing each day which basically means that tech firms aren't likely to go out of business anytime soon, provided they manage to keep up with the pace of the rapid development in the sector. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), a leader in the Customer Relationship Management industry, provides its clients with technological solutions to their customer relationship management needs, thus making the company's business a rather important service in modern times. Recently, the company announced the launch of a new service that will allow customers to build an online network to connect them to third parties including suppliers as well as customers. This will enable companies to make their supply chains more efficient. However, each new service or product introduced by any company can have a number of different impacts on its performance and the its returns to its investors. Let's take a look at how this offering will impact Salesforce and its stock.After the global financial crisis of 2008, Salesforce has managed to increase its market share rapidly from around 10.6% in 2010 to 16.2% in 2013. This trend is expected to continue in the future. Partially responsible for this growth rate is the fact that the overall cloud software market is growing at a high rate and the company has taken advantage of this fact by investing in cloud software technology solutions. The company's latest offering is based on the concepts of cloud computing generated by the company's first venture into cloud 2 enterprise social network market, Salesforce Chatter. The new offering is going to enable its customers to create and use websites such as LinkedIn that will allow them to connect with third party sources such as clients and suppliers.The company's new offering is basically based on three variants; customer community, partner community and employee community. This division of tiers has enabled the company to develop an extremely sophisticated software that will cater to the minutest details of the overall supply chain of clients. The customer community variant allows for custom branding along with social collaboration. These features are also present in the partner community tier. In addition to these features, the partner community has a number of other features including controlled access to data, the capability to manage opportunities for the firm and features to assist senior sales personnel. These features have been embedded into the software to give clients additional value in order for them to be able to reach higher levels of efficiency. The employee community tier includes options to manage work schedules for mid level sales personnel. The overall aim of the entire software is to assist companies attain higher efficiency levels by improving the operations of the company. This offering promises clients better operational performance as a result of which the software will obviously allow Salesforce to increase its revenues significantly.Not only this, the company has also been highly eager to move to mobile devices and tablets by 2015 as the demand for software for these devices has increased significantly. Another aim of the new offering is to connect a number of different apps and create a platform to increase the mobility of sales personnel. Furthermore, the fact that the software will be tailored according to the needs of the different customers, the target market for the service has been highly expanded. This will further increase the demand for this new offering thus contributing directly to the revenues of the company.In the short run, it is true that the company will experience costs while it is still in the process of developing the software. The expected price of the company's stock is also at $55 which is 8% lower than the company's current market price of $60. However, these are only the short-term impacts that the company will face. In the long run, the company has a plethora of opportunities waiting to be explored thanks to its new offering. Firstly, the new software is a highly sophisticated one that will allow firms to increase their overall efficiency significantly by allowing the companies to work on the minute details of their sales activities. This makes the software very useful. What adds to the value of this venture is the fact that the new software can cater to a large target market owing to the fact that it is highly customizable. This will further allow the company to generate higher revenues. Furthermore, the company's aims to integrate mobile devices and tablets into the whole plan makes the venture even more attractive as mobile technology is a rapidly growing sector these days. Overall, the new venture, in the long run, will be beneficial for the company as a whole."

(NYSE:CRM) is a computer software company that could be an interesting play for investors. The stock closed at 7.3% last week due to the solid performance of the second quarter of fiscal year 2015.The rock solid second quarter performance caused the company to boost its full year guidance and the company now expects to generate between $5.34 billion and $5.37 billion in revenues reflecting a full year growth of 32%.Source:Morning StarThese positive revisions have made analyst more optimistic regarding Salesforce.com for the coming quarter and year. In the past 30 days, 5 estimates have been revised higher for Salesforce.com and only one was lowered. Deutsche Bank has raised its price target for the stock to $70, reflecting an upside of almost 21% on the current stock price. Pivotal research has also raised its price target from $70 to $71.Second Quarter PerformanceSalesforce.com reported outstanding second quarter results with revenues of $1.32 billion reflecting an increase of 38% compared to the figure reported in the second quarter last year. The second quarter 2014 revenue also beat analysts' estimates of $1.29 billion. The increase in revenue is attributed to the fast adoption of the company's cloud-based solutions and acquisition of Exact Target. In less than a year the company surpassed the $4 billion revenue run rate and is now sitting at $5 billion; the company is now eyeing $10 billion. The operating cash flows for the company rose to $246 million reflecting an increase of 34% compared to the figure reported in the second quarter of 2013. The company achieved operating cash flows of more than $1.1 billion this year which is an incredible achievement. The company's operating expense increased by almost 33% mainly due to higher expenditure in marketing and sales and research and development. This is not a cause for concern because in the future the company will reap the benefits in the form of increases in sales and profitability.The Company's Future is Backed by Salesforce1The core of the company's cloud and customer platform is Salesforce 1, which was announced last year. Salesforce1 has generated $346.3 million during the first half of the year which brings the annual revenue run rate to $700 million. The market for customer relationship management is expanding and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% to $36.5 billion by 2017.Nowadays companies are running their entire business from their mobile phones and Salesforce1 can provide capability in this mobile environment. With 1.7 million developers on the platform and 10 times more APIs, Salesforce has positioned itself well for growth in this mobile CRM environment.In order to capitalize on the growing CRM market Salesforce has recently launched Salesforce1 its community cloud. This will enable companies to create their own trusted, LinkedIn-like communities that are connected to their unique business processes in order to engage customers, partners and employees in a whole new way. The launch of the community cloud propels Salesforce to the enterprise social network market which had sales of $1.24 billion last year and is projected to grow to $3.5 billion by 2018. Companies that use community cloud technology can get Salesforce applications such as billing and recruiting. The starting price of this product is $500 per month and about 2000 social networks are supported by this technology.International Growth OpportunitiesSalesforce generates almost 70% of its revenue from the US. The growing CRM markets in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region could provide growth for the company. In the past Salesforce experienced problems providing CRM services in Europe especially in Germany. Europeans don't trust cloud vendor providers in the US because of the spying accusations against the National Security Agency. Data on US-based cloud is under surveillance by the US Government and many countries are very sensitive to foreign spying.In order to overcome this problem, Salesforce is seeking to acquire German software companies and also plans to open a German data center in partnership with Deutsche Telekom. If Salesforce succeeds in opening a data center in Germany it will alleviate much of the problems associated with US-based cloud vendors. The National Security Agency has no access to a cloud in Germany. In addition to Germany, Salesforce opened up headquarters in France, a tower in London, and landed a big deal with Philips in Netherlands. Europe could prove to be a growth catalyst for the company in the near future.ConclusionSalesforce.com recently reported a loss and hasn't offered any dividends to date. This doesn't mean that investor should sell their stakes. The company is spending more than half of its revenue on marketing activities. With time present losses may be converted into profits. The company is considering international growth through acquisitions and moving into new markets to drive growth. Based on this analysis I am bullish on Salesforce.com."
2448375,70915,2014-08-25T09:52:20-04:00,Salesforce’s recent quarter brought double-digit growth in the revenue and Non-GAAP profit.Salesforce1 is a breakthrough product which holds multi-billion dollar worth for the company.Integration of acquisitions and reduction in marketing expenditure will convert losses into profit.,"Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) is another player besides Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to compete in the cloud environment taking over the IT sector. The company's stock value has gone up by 36% in a year. As more firms adopt broader suites of cloud computing applications, Salesforce will gather the potential to become a top application and platform vendor.The company reported its quarterly result this week and as a response, the investors were found cheering. Highlights included a gigantic deal with Philips, in which the company will be building its health applications on the Salesforce platform.In this article, I will discuss what Salesforce did during the recent period, particularly focusing on the important details. Then I will talk about the future potential of this organization.Second QuarterSalesforce reported revenue of $1.32 billion, which not only increased by 37.8% as compared to last year's quarter but also surpassed the analysts' estimate of $1.29 billion. The increase in revenue was due to the fast adoption of the company's cloud-based solutions, the ExactTarget acquisition and a favourable foreign exchange impact.Gross margin came at 78.3%, down by 134 bps due to the costs related to the acquisition of ExactTarget. Adjusted operating expenses (including stock-based compensation and excluding amortization of acquisition-related intangibles) increased by 32.9% to $1.03 billion, mainly due to the higher investments in research and development, marketing and sales and general and administrative activities. However, as a percentage of revenue, the operating expenses fell by 287 bps from last year's quarter.The company reported non-GAAP diluted earnings of 13 cents per share, which was 44% up since the second quarter of 2013. All in all, double-digit growth numbers in sales and profit explains that Salesforce's higher marketing expenditure is paying off. Not only the domestic market is responding favorably, but the international market is also showing positive feedback towards the company's products. This is why Salesforce witnessed revenue growth of 39% in America while revenues from Europe and Asia increased by 42% and 25% respectively.The company's future is now backed by Salesforce1. The product offers businesses such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft, with a zoomed-in view of every customer. This enables these companies to deliver tailored content across all the channels and devices. I believe that this product will generate billions in the future.There are several reasons for this. First, the market for Customer Relationship Management ""CRM"" is expanding; it is expected to grow to $36.5 billion by 2017 globally. This brings the CAGR of the market to 15%. Secondly, the company is making good use of this expanding market. Through Salesforce1, clients can build and deploy an app on Android, iPhone, and on any tablet all at the same time. This allows companies to run their entire business from their phones. The product is designed to unite various apps and to bring a large number of devices on a single platform. This, in turn, significantly increases mobility for marketing professionals.The success of this product can already be seen from developers that are currently using it. With 1.7 million developers on the platform and ten times more APIs than before, compared to company's previous Force.com development platform, Salesforce has positioned itself well for the growth in mobile CRM applications in the future. Revenue of $346 million, for the first half of 2015, has already been generated through this platform. This makes the annual revenue run-rate to be approximately $700 million for the company.Other than what is stated above, Salesforce has brought key modifications to its ""Journey Finder."" The advancements introduced last month are designed to operate in the way marketers think, rather than the way computer systems work. To be precise, the Maps upgrade consists of more activity and journey tracing of the customer. The Triggers will now have the feature of automatic responding to actions in real time. Lastly, the Metrics will include testing and optimization of each and every interaction.The additional visual analytics are engineered to allow marketers to locate and mark out a customer's journey through almost any digital channel. These channels include email, mobile, and wearable connected devices. The Journey Builder is already accessible to Salesforce1 clients. The Maps, Triggers, and Metrics functions are scheduled for release during the third quarter of the fiscal-year 2015. This will help in sustaining the top-line trend.Bottom LineSalesforce currently reports a loss on GAAP basis. The company hasn't given any dividend to date. Yet, these details don't indicate that investors should sell their stake. With time, investors should look for operating expenses as a percentage of sales to decline further, as it did in the recent quarter. The company has been spending more than half of its revenue on marketing. As soon as the promotional activities reduce, the present loss should convert into profit.Till then, investors should wait, and let Salesforce do what it is doing. The company has its full-year sales guidance up. On average, it has already given sales growth of 35% for three years, much above the industry's 12%. Basing my belief on that, I expect further upward revisions as the acquisitions are integrated into the company, and heavy marketing for innovative products establish brand loyalty for Salesforce. Strong prospects for the company suggest a buy rating."
2446035,55442,2014-08-23T05:22:16-04:00,"Salesforce.com reported better than expected revenue and raised revenue guidance, causing the stock to soar.Despite having achieved critical mass of over $1.3 billion in revenue per quarter, adjusting operating profit is less than 1% of revenue.At age 15, Salesforce.com is much less profitable than Oracle and Microsoft were at a similar phase of development. This suggests structural differences in economics.Assuming Salesforce.com continues to grow at a rapid clip for the next 3 years and significantly improves operating profitability, Salesforce.com appears overvalued.","Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) shares soared following the release of 2Q numbers and increased guidance for the full year. Taking a step back from the figures we've been directed to look at (Adjusted EBITDA, revenue backlog, etc.), one cannot help but notice that the company is barely profitable (using EBITA -earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization). Clearly the market believes it is just a matter of time before Salesforce.com generates meaningful operating profits. Is this a reasonable assumption? As outlined below, I think investors are setting themselves up for disappointment.While Salesforce.com is on track to generate more than $5.3 billion in revenue this year, after deducting stock-compensation expense, it is on track to be just better than breakeven (adding back non-cash amortization expense associated with acquisitions to stated operating profit). For the second quarter, CRM reported a GAAP operating loss of $33.5 million. Adding back amortization of purchased intangible assets of $36 million and $9.9 million of debt discount amortization, I get to an adjusted operating profit of $12.4 million, which is equivalent to an operating margin of less than 1%. Should investors in Salesforce.com (or other SAAS stocks) be concerned about these low margins? Let's examine arguments as to why profits aren't super-meaningful put forth by bulls:While I have no counterpoint to #3 - it is possible (though unlikely) that Salesforce.com continues to defy gravity and trades on a large multiple of sales, point 2 can be quickly refuted:Here is some Oracle history:Early Oracle history demonstrates a high growth rate and a strong operating margin. The same is true for young (15 year old) Microsoft:It is clear from the date above that Salesforce is an inferior economic animal relative to Oracle and Microsoft.As for point 1, the notion that profits will materialize eventually, I don't disagree. However, based on CRM's performance thus far (the company is 15 years old), I do not believe it is at all realistic to expect 25%+ operating margins given that at $5+ billion in annual sales, CRM generates just 1% operating margins. There is not much evidence of scaling in this business, i.e. revenue growing significantly faster than expenses leading to an explosion in profitability. I believe the reasons the business has not scaled are as follows:That said, from what I have heard, there is very little focus on costs (and that may be an overstatement!) at Salesforce.com and other SAAS companies. With a very, very low cost of capital (creating ability to continually raise new cash to pay bills) and investors looking the other way on profitability this makes sense. However, I expect that at some point (after growth has slowed considerably) we will see a major restructuring effort (likely under a new CEO). As noted above, I believe the Salesforce.com's business is structurally inferior to Oracle and Microsoft though I do believe it will ultimately prove profitable. Assuming that Salesforce can do $9 billion in revenue (19% CAGR) in 2018 (with an incremental 12% operating margin - this is quite generous vs. history) and execute a $700 million cost cutting program (equivalent to over 8% of the company's estimated cost base) in 2017-2018, I estimate just over $1.2 billion in 2018 operating profit. Taxing this at 35%, gets me to $780 million or $1.15 per fully diluted share. Assuming that Salesforce garners a 20x P/E multiple at this stage (forward growth prospects likely to be reduced significantly), this produces a 2017-2018 fair value of $23. Discounting back to today, I get a fair value of $17.25.Despite the market's enthusiastic reaction to yesterday's results, I continue to believe that Salesforce.com's share price is disconnected from economic reality."

The platform connects various apps and devices to a single platform, greatly increasing mobility for sales reps.","Salesfore.com (NYSE:CRM), the largest SaaS company, delivered a stellar quarter during its latest earnings call - at least as far as bottom line growth is concerned. The company recorded 38% topline growth with revenue of $1.319 billion, easily beating the consensus estimate of $1.288 billion. The company's bottom line, however, remained in the red as usual, with a GAAP loss of $0.10 per share. Interestingly, Salesforce provided a comprehensive breakdown of sales by product offerings and operating expenses for the first time that gave investors a good peek of what's happening behind the scenes.Source: StatistaSalesforce is one of the most notable maturing companies that has managed to make investors comfortable with red ink. Its close peer in this regard is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), though the giant online retailer manages to eke a small profit for its investors every now and then. Let's look at some of the top reasons why Salesforce is having a hard time turning any profits, and how soon investors can realistically hope the company can start turning profits.High Sales and Marketing ExpensesSalesforce spent $671 million as marketing expenses, translating to 51% of its revenue. That figure certainly looks high, but is an improvement from last fiscal year when the company sales and marketing expenses averaged 53% of the company's revenue.Salesforce is not alone in this conundrum of extremely high sales and marketing expenses. Other SaaS companies have similarly high marketing expenses. Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of its revenue clocks in at around 42%, 46% for ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), and 51% for NetSuite (NYSE:N). Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), a leading Big Data company, spends 72% of its revenue on sales and marketing functions.SaaS companies spend large amounts of money on sales and marketing functions so as to grow their revenue base rapidly and reduce customer churn. SaaS companies, unlike traditional software companies, rent out their software to organizations who use it and pay on a monthly basis. For traditional software companies, their revenue inflows are easier to model since the company simply sells its software for a huge upfront license fee and then charges a smaller fee (around 20% of license fees) for software maintenance. SaaS companies, however, have to incur huge customer acquisition costs then try hard to keep their customers long enough so that they can at least recoup their investment.A fast-growing SaaS company like Salesforce is proof that the company's strategy at this point is to acquire as many customers as possible in order to expand its revenue base. Salesforce expects its fiscal year 2015 revenue to exceed $5 billion. Outgoing Salesforce's CFO, Graham Smith, recently hinted that Salesforce had a target to become GAAP profitable by the time the company hit $10 billion in revenue. This could mean that Salesforce's management might decide to change its strategy of going flat out for customers and maybe concentrate on consolidating its gains. Doing this would probably lower its sales and marketing expenses to 40% of revenue or lower, with substantial cost savings.If Salesforce maintains a growth rate of at least 30% going forward, the company will be on course to hit $10 billion in revenue in just 10-12 quarters. Currently, Salesforce has a lot going for it that will likely make it relatively easy for the company to maintain topline growth rates around 33%-35% for the next three years or so. High growth in the CRM market with cloud deployments currently outpacing on-premise deployments is a key driver. Salesforce 1 also is showing very impressive growth since its launch last year. The platform connects various apps and devices to a single platform, thus greatly increasing mobility for sales reps. Salesforce 1 is currently on an annual revenue run rate exceeding $700 million.High Stock-Based Employee CompensationSalesforce has been relying heavily on stock-based compensation for its employees over the last decade. The company spent more than $520 million on stock-based compensation over the last 12 months, or 13% of its operating expenses. In comparison, only 4% of Oracle's operating expenses went to stock-based compensation over a similar period. If Salesforce manages to hold this expense at the current level with minimal or no growth over the next 3-4 years, stock based compensation as a percentage of operating expenses will eventually fall to more normalized levels of around 6% or less.CRM data by YChartsThere is another danger, however, that could be lurking over the horizon for Salesforce. Stock-based compensation is a great way to reward employees when stock prices are rising rapidly. Salesforce's shares have risen more than 1000% over the last 10 years. The company's high-flying shares have been effective at luring top talent from Silicon Valley to join its ranks. Salesforce has had to compete for talent against the likes of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP), both of which have deep pockets. Its generous stock-based employee compensation have helped it to attract and retain highly talented employees that would otherwise opt to join its rivals.But Salesforce's stock has lately become sluggish. The shares lost as much as 20% at one point this year. If the sluggish performance continues, then the company's management might find it prudent to start giving employees more cash-based compensation instead of shares. Salesforce managed to generate only $576 million in free cash flow last year. That level of cash flow is hardly enough to pay its employees in lieu of shares, let alone buy back its own shares to try and prop up its stock price.But with Salesforce currently showing strong revenue growth, it's unlikely that its shares will take a hit for long. As long as the company continues growing its topline at the current impressive pace, and avoids increasing its stock based compensation too much, revenue growth will eventually outpace growth in this expense category. If Salesforce increases its stock-based compensation at just 10% going forward while revenue grows by at least 30% per annum, stock based compensation will make up only 6% of its overall operating expenses in about 4 years, by which time the company should be able to turn a profit."

        Strong free cash flow generation is fueling the company's strategic investment initiative.
        Even with strong share price growth the past five years, Salesforce still trades at attractive valuation multiples.","Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) international expansion could fuel revenue growth for years to come. In early 2014, Salesforce announced its intention to open data centers in France, as well as leverage its pan-European presence to expand its business in other countries as well.The opening of data centers across Europe and the U.K will help Salesforce tap into local small and medium businesses as well as government agencies in these areas. Government agencies usually require data to be stored locally rather than in data centers outside the country for security reasons, according to a recent study by Zacks.com.Salesforce could be increasing investments in the U.K., France and Germany at the most opportune time as a recent study by International Data Corporation, an advisory firm specializing in information technology, predicts that spending on IT in Western Europe will increase 2% in 2014.Moreover, expansion into Europe allows Salesforce to diversify its international revenues going forward. In the last reported quarter, Salesforce derived around 19% of its total revenue from Europe, showing an annual increase of 42%, and could continue to grow those revenues as current investments begin to payoff.Over the last five years, Salesforce's share price has risen nearly 400% as strong revenue growth has fueled the surge. A majority of revenues have been derived in the domestic U.S. over that period, but with international expansion into Europe and Asia, Salesforce's revenues could be on the cusp significant future gains.Free cash flow generation has been an impressive metric for Salesforce, even as they have increased investment overseas. Since 2011, free cash flow has risen close to 900%, directly attributable to the company's strong revenue growth as its products have reached a wider customer base.Growing cash flow will also allow Salesforce to take on more strategic investments in the future. In July 2014, Salesforce acquired Relate IQ, a provider of an analytics-based customer relationship management [CRM] platform, for $390 million. The deal provides Salesforce with a data-driven alternative to existing CRM platforms in the market.As a result, the new platform facilitates a unified customer experience, bringing a relationship intelligence to Salesforce's cloud offerings. Synergies from the deal are expected to strengthen Salesforce's position in the ""big data"" space, according to Market Realist.Lastly, although Salesforce has seen its share price rise significantly over the past five years, the company is still trading at attractive valuation multiples. The chart below show the company's price to sales ratio is only 7.85, compared to a multiple of 12.5 in 2011. With the company's aggressive expansion overseas and further strategic investments, Salesforce looks primed to see more share price appreciation over the next few years."

The acceleration in top line growth in these regions was facilitated by an increase in IT spending on the back of a recovering global economy. Sales from the Asia-Pacific region, which contribute about 10% of revenues, grew slower than these developed markets during the quarter, at 27% year on year. However, the Asia-Pacific region's growth rate during Q2'15 was higher than its growth rate from a similar period a year ago.In this earnings article, we take a look at the recently reported Q2'15 results from Salesforce. We have a $47 price estimate for Salesforce.com which is under revision to incorporate the latest quarterly earnings.Growth in SaaS CRM Deployments Should Benefit SalesforceThe global market for Customer Relationship Management software has been exploding each year, with intensifying competition among vendors and aggressive investments from customers. Technology market research provider Gartner expects the global CRM market to expand to approximately $36.5 billion by 2017, from about $20.5 billion last year, representing a compounded annualized growth rate (OTC:CAGR) of about 15.5%. [1]More importantly, a recent Gartner update on the global CRM market highlights the fact that cloud deployments of CRM suites are outpacing standard on-premise deployments. The Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model of CRM deployment, pioneered by Salesforce, is expected to register a higher CAGR of approximately 23% than the broader CRM market through 2017. [2] The higher growth rate for SaaS-based CRM software has resulted in greater share of on-demand deployments. Gartner estimates more than 50% of CRM sales to be SaaS-based by 2015. [2] On a longer term, Gartner estimates as much as 85% of CRM suites to be deployment on-demand by 2025. [2]Salesforce should benefit from both the explosive growth in the CRM market and the shift toward on-demand deployments from companies. The company has followed market trends carefully and has diversified itself from being a sales automation software provider into a successful sales analytics provider, presenting targeted customer-centric solutions to its users that increase their marketing return on investment (NYSE:ROI). Successful deliverability of high ROI on marketing investments for its customers has resulted in a rapid expansion in its customer base over the years. And we expect increasing stickiness from older customers and expanding renewal rates from newer customers should help sustain revenue growth for the company.In terms of deferred revenue, Salesforce's deferred revenue base expanded by 32% on a year-on-year basis to reach $2.35 billion. For Q3 2015, Salesforce estimates suggest deferred revenues will grow about 30% year on year. [3] Moreover, the company's unbilled deferred revenues increased to $5 billion by July 2014, underlining Salesforce's strong business pipeline for the future.Salesforce1 Could Become a Potential Multi-Billion Dollar Product for SalesforceSalesforce launched the ""Salesforce1"" platform before the start of its annual Dreamforce conference in November 2013. This new offering is engineered to connect various apps and a multitude of devices across a single platform and greatly increase mobility for sales representatives. Built on an API first philosophy, Sales Cloud on Salesforce1 features additional API tools for developers to create and deploy enterprise-level applications across mobile devices. [4] The platform has generated sales of about $346 million in H1 2015, which represents a fiscal year revenue run rate of about $700 million.We believe the platform could see tremendous growth prospects and become a billion dollar sales generator for Salesforce in the very near future. With about 1.7 million developers on the platform and 10 times more APIs than before on its Force.com development platform, we believe Salesforce is well-positioned for the growth in mobile CRM applications in the future, especially from the retailing industry. [5] In its recent Q2'15 earnings call, Salesforce reported having signed a deal with Safeway to build applications that increase store productivity for the retailer.

At the time of acquisition, many of these companies were innovative, young and growing fast but not necessarily profitable (for example, Buddy Media had a net loss of $20.6 million in the first half of 2012 and ExactTarget had a net loss of $11.6 million in Q1 2013).The newer product lines now represent fully half of the company's revenue in Q1 2015 (see ""Revenue by Cloud Service Offering"" under Item 2 of the 10-Q). Given the significant shift in product offerings and investment of company resources, it is reasonable for an investor to ask: what cash flow and profit or loss are these new revenue streams yielding?The SEC and Salesforce exchange letters about revenue sources and segment performanceIn a comment letter to Salesforce in May 2013, the SEC raised questions about performance of the company's four main product offerings among other issues. Salesforce responded in June 2013:The SEC was apparently not satisfied because on July 30, 2013 it replied:Salesforce responded on August 23:A week later the SEC shot back:In September Salesforce acquiesced on reporting revenue by product offering (emphasis added):Salesforce reported this information in the first quarter of FY 2015 (10-Q) (percentage column added):However the company stopped short of reporting profit and loss for these offerings, providing this explanation:(For deep background, that paragraph draws on the language of Financial Accounting Standard 131, ""Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information."")Next the company makes a nuanced claim: while it has ""offerings"" in multiple market segments, it evaluates financials on a consolidated basis (emphasis added):Let's review where we are after this intricate exchange with the SEC:How well does this meet the needs of investors? Let's look at a principle laid out in one of FASB's broad Concepts Statements (Concepts Statement No. 8, Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting) (emphasis added):Key terms to keep in mind are ""efficient and effective use of...resources,"" ""components of that return"" and ""uncertainty of future cash flows."" I'll turn now to a discussion of the vastly different risk profiles of various components of Salesforce's business, and explain why the above accounting principle calls for disclosure of profitability for each of those components.Salesforce is a combination of a mid-cap tech company and a basket of high-risk, unprofitable early-stage companiesWe can think of Salesforce as a portfolio of three ""asset classes."" One is the Sales Cloud--the mature CRM product that leads its category in market share. This is the cash-generating foundation of the portfolio; I'll call it asset class A. If this were the only asset class, consolidated financial statements would be adequate to give a clear picture of its profitability and future prospects.A second asset class is acquired young companies with significant revenues or ""anchor"" status in product offerings, such as ExactTarget, Buddy Media and Radian6. I'll call this class B1.Finally there is a longer list of acquired small companies or startups such as Assist.ly and DimDim acquired for $50 million or less. Typically these have been brought in to acquire specific technologies, features or key individuals who can strengthen existing offerings. I'll call these class B2. Salesforce has organized these companies' offerings as shown below, with class B1 in bold (assignments partly based on author's judgment, acknowledging that a company may not fit neatly into one offering):In asset class B1, ExactTarget and Buddy Media were known to be losing money at the time of acquisition. AllThingsD reported that Rypple was cash flow-positive but did not report numbers. Jigsaw reported profitability on a revenue run rate that I estimate at $20 million -- so profit was likely to be negligible. As a recent graduate of Y Combinator, Heroku was likely not profitable.I do not have financial information on the companies in class B2; but in the typical growth trajectory of a tech startup, the first few years see an expanding user base and revenue growth while profitability takes a few more years (if achieved at all). More likely than not, classes B1 and B2 were not making a meaningful profit at the time they were acquired by Salesforce.As mentioned above, Sales cloud now represents about 50% of revenues. We can also count some Platform revenue as class A since it is more established than Service and Marketing Clouds, bringing us to roughly 55% in class A. For the other 45% of its business, Salesforce is effectively acting as a giant incubator and integrator of small, early-stage tech companies. It is attempting to convert these into cash flow generators by combining them into the four main offerings shown in the above table.Goodwill on the Balance Sheet reveals the resources Salesforce has deployed to develop new offerings. Goodwill has ballooned to nearly 40% of total assets as of the end of FY 2014:During the intensive period of acquisitions from FY2011-2014, Operating Income dropped precipitously:(And in the first quarter of this fiscal year, operating loss was $55 million vs. $45 million in the prior year quarter.)Let's revisit the FASB Concept quoted above (emphasis added):The Goodwill chart makes it clear that Salesforce has directed significant resources towards emerging offerings in the Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud and to some extent Platform. These products are based on acquisitions of early-stage companies that were purchased at high multiples and are, by and large, probably not profitable for reasons stated above. As a result, future cash flows of Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Platform are highly uncertain. This is precisely the time when investors need to understand the performance of these newer components of Salesforce's business (asset classes B1 and B2) compared to the more established Sales cloud component (asset class A).Seeing this simple table in SEC filings would go a long way towards fulfilling the FASB principle above and allowing investors to assess the risk-reward profile of each of Salesforce's product offerings:With this data, investors could track Salesforce's progress in incubating and integrating acquired companies into its scheme of four main product offerings. They could better understand the current cash flows and future prospects of these new offerings. They could assess whether the $3.5 billion in Goodwill on the balance sheet, representing nearly 40% of assets, remains an accurate reflection of the current value of past acquisitions.Inadequate reporting creates an inefficiencyAs discussed above, from an investment point of view Salesforce is a hybrid of approximately 55% established CRM and platform products and 45% speculative products adapted from early-stage, higher-risk companies that by and large would have been unprofitable at the time of acquisition. Even though Salesforce strives to be seen as an integrated company, from an investment risk/reward perspective one could see it this way:Through the dramatic changes of the last four years, the company's reporting has not meaningfully changed to reflect a diversified set of offerings. By reporting accounting on a consolidated basis (with the exception of revenue), Salesforce is failing to disclose material information: specifically, its progress in bringing acquisitions to profitability in the context of its four main product offerings.I believe Salesforce is massively understating the risks inherent in its strategy of acquisition, diversification and growth, and therefore not providing adequate information to its investors. Over ten years the stock has been propelled by customer acquisition, technical innovation and revenue growth among other factors. Dramatic recent changes to the company's strategy and finances, combined with the lack of information about vastly different risk profiles across components of the business, create an inefficiency that points to an investment opportunity on the short side.Disclosure: The author is short CRM.

2431785,71005,2014-08-18T11:00:25-04:00,"Salesforce.com common stock is highly overvalued.Public investors should follow the lead of management and ""smart"" institutional money and sell their shares.Traders and speculative money should follow the lead of investment bankers and buy puts or sell stock short.","We have seen numerous articles published on Seeking Alpha about Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Three stand out in particular: ""Salesforce.com may be riskier than it seems"" by Paulo Santos, ""Salesforce.com: 3 Simple Questions for Wall Street Analysts"" by Weighing Machine, and ""Salesforce.com - The Underpants Gnomes of Wall Street"" by Jay Schembs. These three reads are a must for responsible investors desirous of a better understanding of the risks of owning Salesforce.com. In addition, Michael Blair has done a persistent job in several articles, ensuring that the weaknesses of the bull side thesis for Salesforce.com. remain in the public spotlight.Mr. Santos uses a metric, the Altman Z-test to show that, absent the high-flying stock price, Salesforce scores deep in the zone where companies are highly likely to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This shows how CRM is overvalued. Weighing Machine brilliantly and in a fun, literary way summarizes the motivation of Wall Street analysts in pushing CRM stock, thus explaining, at least in part, why it is overvalued. Jay Schembs employs a thesis and catalyst approach to form an actionable course for investors to sell or short Salesforce.com.Salesforce earnings are contentious. The company reports GAAP earnings, the actual earnings of the continuing public shareholders, because it is required to report them by force of law. Salesforce prefers that investors concentrate instead on pro forma results, which remove:These are real expenses, borne by shareholders directly on the balance sheet or through dilution of their ownership of the company's future stream of earnings. With Salesforce.com, these are mostly regularly recurring items. Discarding them is worse than foolish. As his second question in the aforementioned article, Weighing Machine properly asks, ""Why is adjusted operating profit (excluding stock compensation) the right metric on which to evaluate Salesforce or any other company?"" The answer we know is that it is not. Salesforce has reported pro forma profits in quarter after quarter, yet the current consolidated balance sheet shows an accumulated deficit of $440.068 million. Dividends and return of capital through stock buybacks come from GAAP earnings; pro forma gets you nothing. GAAP earnings are the proper measure for an investor to consider.To add to the earnings confusion, analysts regurgitate the company's pro forma estimates and the news media publishes them. Go to Yahoo Finance, bring up CRM and query analyst estimates. Yahoo reports the average analyst earnings estimate for fiscal 2015 as .51 per share. Salesforce reported it expected to lose GAAP (.49) to (.47) for fiscal 2015 in its May 20, 2014, press release. Are investors confused by this? Surely some are. How can they not be? This confusion contributes to a higher stock price than what would otherwise obtain. What Salesforce and its analyst friends are doing is similar to the behavior of brokers in the dot.com bubble. They publicly touted a stock while bashing the stock in private emails to privileged clients. Two sets of books, if you will, is just plain wrong.We need an earnings number that gives the most accurate and informative picture of a company's performance. I use GAAP then remove (when Salesforce explicitly reports them) changes to the tax valuation allowance (TVA). My technique delivers a more accurate assessment of the actual quarterly earnings and their underlying trend. Here is my table of important metrics.Note: Unless otherwise indicated or hyperlinked, all data in this article is from SEC filings accessed through the Salesforce website.Over the past nine quarters, on a GAAP basis (adjusted for reported changes in tax valuation allowance), Salesforce lost at least $727.94 million. The loss is greater than what I report if the company further tapped the TVA. No quarter was profitable. The table above clearly shows that the capital contribution of continuing public shareholders supports Salesforce.com. The company is not sustained by its money losing business. The company has projected a further GAAP loss of approximately $201 million over the next three quarters.Let's take a cursory look at the Salesforce.com business model. Salesforce operates in three main business segments: software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS). In all three areas the company faces brutal competition from established titans. IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are active in its main market SAAS. In the IAAS space Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) dominates with Google making a massive catch-up effort. In PAAS Salesforce has an 18% market share with Amazon just behind with 17%.Salesforce business strategy has been an attempt to produce a product which is all things to all people. To this end, it has acquired more than a dozen companies to enhance its original customer relations management software product. These include: Assistly, Prior Knowledge, Radian6, BuddyMedia, Cloudconnect, Pardot, RelateIQ, and the largest purchase ExactTarget. These acquisitions and others, almost all not yet profitable startups, have left a mark on Salesforce balance sheet. At end Q1 2015 there was $3,501 million of goodwill on the balance sheet and several hundred million more of amortizing purchased intangibles. These are huge costs and they contribute to making the Salesforce product more costly to produce than the company is able to charge customers.There is another problem arising with this business model. Not every current customer wants to pay for each and every product enhancement. This leaves the company charging an outdated insufficient price for its product; or saddles the company with outsized sales and marketing expense derived from attempting to retain or add customers. Salesforce has long intimated that it could significantly improve margins by reducing sales and marketing expenses when it reaches some targeted scale. But so far, as revenues have surpassed an annual run rate of $5 billion, it has failed to demonstrate this.This leaves the company only one other option: raise prices. The previously hyperlinked article cites Google as recently cutting IAAS and PAAS prices by 68% and 85%, respectively. Salesforces other tough competitors are following suit. So, for Salesforce this appears not to be an option. I and the authors I have cited are in agreement with Jay Schembs thesis that Salesforce is meaningfully overvalued. Now, what is the likely catalyst that will verify our thesis and make shorting Salesforce a sound course of action?Each Salesforce quarterly earnings report brings the possibility that investors will recognize something which awakens them to the notion that this company is a doubtful investment. Salesforce has announced it will release its Q2 earnings report Aug. 21, 2014. Here are potential catalysts supporting the short Salesforce thesis:In Q1 2014, Salesforce paid down $267.5 million principal on its 0.75% convertible senior notes and spent approximately $186 million to exercise note hedges to obtain and deliver shares to the convertible note holders. Salesforce must pay approximately an additional $550 million or an average $64.7 million per month to the Jan. 15, 2015, expiration date to redeem the remaining notes. Notes redeemed this quarter will diminish corporate cash.Salesforce has a lumpy annual billing cycle. In fiscal Q1 2015 customers paid down accounts receivable by $676.68 million. In Q2 receivables build again and the company must fund this. Using the average percentage gain in receivables for the last two years as guidance would project use of about $130 million of Salesforce cash for this purpose.Salesforce has announced a major expansion of its physical plant, including three new data centers in Europe and more in Japan and Canada. It is also taking on a major new expense, moving its headquarters to space in Salesforce Tower in San Francisco, rented from Boston Properties. These initiatives will require substantial cash outlays. Here is a table of my expectations for this quarters change in Salesforce cash balance:These are my guesstimates primarily based on extrapolation.During June and December, Salesforce grants stock awards to management and employees. With the decline from $67 per share in Q1 to $51.65 at the Q1 end, Salesforce may feel pressured to grant options on a larger number of shares and at a lower exercise price than in the past to compensate employees. Formerly shareholders could look forward to stock option grants at ever higher strike prices. A lower price grant could spook institutional or other observant shareholders.These are my guesstimates primarily based on extrapolation.In calendar Q4 2013 and Q1 2014 the 10 largest institutional holders of Salesforce reduced their holdings by 25,509,632 common shares. They reduced their ownership of CRM from 53.23% to 48.02% at end Q1 2014. Chairman and CEO Mark Benioff and other senior officers are also selling. Benioff is currently executing a 10b5-1 plan to sell 20,000 shares every day the market is open. In 2012 he sold 40,000 shares (adjusted for a 4-for-1 stock split) every market day. This selling has taken a toll on Salesforce stock price. The stock has declined 21.26% to $52.75 from $67 per share it touched on Feb. 28, 2014.Salesforce sold warrants to purchase 26,944,700 shares of common stock when it placed the 0.75% convertible senior notes. These have an exercise price of $29.88 and will expire Jan. 15, 2015, unless exercised. Salesforce will raise $805 million cash from exercise of these warrants. Should the stock fall and they go unexercised, this company will have to raise additional money somewhere else, or face liquidity issues. Salesforce has discussed the hedging of these notes and warrants in numerous SEC filings. The holders of these privately placed securities are presumably sophisticated and surely some of them have hedged their positions by shorting Salesforce stock. Whatever their disposition, there will be a lot more shares coming to market. Salesforce has 185.9 million additional shares reserved for capital commitments or employee compensation.Salesforce takes a great deal of care in managing expectations about its business. Inevitably there will be a miss of some sort that the company will be unable to assuage. Each quarterly earnings report bears that risk.In conclusion, Salesforce.com common stock is highly overvalued as there are no GAAP earnings which can sustain its business. Brutal competition makes it difficult to foresee future profitability. Management, institutional investors, and private bankers hedging Salesforce debt have all been aggressive sellers of stock. The coming earnings release brings with it significant risk that investors will open their eyes to the dangers of owning Salesforce stock. I agree with the conclusion of Weighing Machine that $15 is a more appropriate price for Salesforce stock.There is one caveat to my short Salesforce thesis. This is that Salesforce.com would complement the business of Google, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, Amazon, SAP (NYSE:SAP) and others. They are all large, well-capitalized, mostly profitable companies. All might be interested in acquiring Salesforce if they could figure out how to make the business profitable. But why buy Salesforce at the current market capitalization of about $34 billion, when there is a good chance it could trade at a quarter of that price soon? I recommend purchase of the January 2015 puts.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2301785,50792,2014-07-07T09:07:03-04:00,"Salesforce is not an easy decision, where buying and selling is concerned, and for due cause: it is an extremely volatile stock with a questionable growth strategy.However, strategic alliances, new datacenters, and increased hiring suggest that Salesforce may be worthy of consideration by investors.Specifically, I Know First predicts a bullish forecast for the company in the 3-month and year-long periods.","The software service giant Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a company unanimously associated with customer relationship management software - so much so, in fact, that it is traded on the NYSE under the symbol ""CRM"" itself. The world's largest provider of CRM software, Salesforce serves over 104,000 customers, has more than 5 million users, and boasts a social media following totaling over 782,229 users across Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and LinkedIn (LNKD). In recent years, pursuing an aggressive growth plan, it has also made numerous acquisitions in the hopes of elevating revenue growth, forming strategic alliances with the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). This expansive behavior has not gone unnoticed: Salesforce was ranked the most innovative company in Canada by Forbes in 2013, and Number 7 in Fortune magazine's ""100 Best Companies to Work for in 2014"" - it has, to be sure, received no shortage of accolades from global and American business publications in recent years. In addition, I Know First predicts a bullish forecast for the company in the 3-month and year-long periods.The GoodThere is merit to considering Salesforce in buying decisions. Salesforce itself, for one, appears to believe that its growth strategies will grant it increased success in years to come. In anticipation of expansion, the company recently signed a tremendous lease that will see it taking over the tallest office building west of Chicago. Strategically located, this new office tower is in the center of downtown San Francisco, and is easily accessible to other regions of both the Bay Area and California as a whole. ""It's a great symbol of Salesforce as a company that brings other companies into the future,"" says George Hu; Wiegel seconds him, saying that Salesforce's reaching 500 employees in the local office in five years - twice the jobs committed as part of its Oregon relocation package - is a sign of strength for the regional market.Despite the flack it has received for its acquisition-based growth, too, Salesforce remains committed to its strategic methodology: a sign, perhaps, that there is more to its business development ideas than meets the eye. Soon-to-be-retired Salesforce CFO Graham Smith acknowledges this, saying, ""We've been very clear about our strategy to prioritize growth and operating margins over time."" Following his leave, Autodesk's Mark Hawkins will step into the role. Hawkins is famous for his executive roles at Dell and HP (NYSE:HPQ), the latter of which he helped build quite dramatically. He joins the company enthusiastically, calling its potential ""enormous"": a counter to the naysayers.Salesforce has also been careful to resolve any criticisms aimed at it. After its phishing attack ordeal in 2007, the company - and CRM in general - was criticized for its insufficient user security: a common problem in CRM. In the aftermath, one particular demand surfaced from consumers and industry experts: Salesforce needed to create a European data center to ensure that European customers' information was kept as safe as possible. Using American-based cloud solutions for European client data, said Phil Shoesmith - Head of IT at Alzheimer's Society UK - was just not as secure as operating a locally sited datacenter. ""We would like to see [an EU datacenter] for risk mitigation,"" he said. Salesforce responded enthusiastically, promising that a datacenter would be opened in 2013; despite a slight delay, it announced finalized plans for a Slough-based datacenter in May 2013. It is expected to open with full functionality by 2014.Salesforce is also doing more in the way of growth: in addition to its UK datacenter, it has plans to expand into France, and into Germany via Deutsche Telekom. It also appears to be working towards healthcare-specific CRM via its partnership with Philips; this latter move could see it branching into a market that is expected to hit $4.5 billion by 2018.The partnerships do not stop there: in June 2013, a press release on Oracle's website definitively announced that it and Salesforce had entered into a ""comprehensive nine-year partnership encompassing all three tiers of cloud computing."" CEOs Larry Ellison and Marc Benioff each appeared to believe that the other's services would benefit his own company: the impressive infrastructure of Oracle's engineered systems - what Benioff calls its ""power"" - would greatly benefit Salesforce, said Vice President Parker Harris. Ellison, for his turn, says he is ""looking forward to working with Salesforce."" It really does seem that this partnership could be profitable, from the viewpoint of CRM: the same efficient Oracle Linux and Exadata Infrastructure that makes Oracle a worthy competitor makes it a worthy friend for CRM.Another, similarly useful partnership was also implemented this year - on May 29th, 2014, Salesforce announced a global strategic partnership with Microsoft, which will seek to connect Salesforce's applications to Microsoft Office and Windows. As much as both CEOs claimed that the deal was about ""putting the customer first"" and ""building bridges that allow customers to be more productive,"" this was, arguably, also a good move for Salesforce - Oracle and SAP had already closed in on deals with Microsoft, and Microsoft itself competes with Salesforce for CRM customers. Now, it is possible that Benioff's company won't be left in the dust.All else aside, the facts are simple: the company's year-over-year growth is outstanding. In 2014, its total revenue has seen an increase of 37 percent year-over-year; its subscription revenue increased by 36 percent year-over-year, and its professional services saw an increase of a large 58 percent year-over-year. Though it does lose money on a GAAP basis, these figures cannot be ignored in considering whether or not this stock - however volatile it may be - is reasonable to buy.Other analysts seem to agree, too. As of July 3rd, 2014, 22 of 28 analysts reporting to NASDAQ recommend CRM as a strong buy. Similarly, Yahoo! Finance analysts' mean recommendation this week concerning CRM is a 1.8, where 1.0 is a strong buy and 5.0 is a sell (Figure 1).Figure 1.1. 22 of 28 NASDAQ analysts recommend CRM as a strong buy. An additional three recommend it as at least a buy; 2 recommend holding off before buying or selling. Only one analyst strongly believes that selling is a reasonable option.Figure 1.2. The mean recommendation of Yahoo! Finance analysts this week is a strong buy (the strongest possible buy is a 1.0, and CRM is tending towards this figure at 1.8).The BadConcerns regarding Salesforce have existed for quite some time. The company has most definitely been growing: it has a nearly ten-year history of increasingly numerous and expensive acquisitions, with 2013 seeing the SaaS giant purchasing more and more: within a week of purchasing ExactTarget for a whopping $2.5 billion, for example, Salesforce also took EdgeSpring in a small but still technologically meaningful move to recruit new talent. While this growth has been seen as part of the reason for Salesforce's increasing popularity in recent years, this rapid, massive acquisition strategy has been cited as one that hurts profits and strains the balance sheet: as New Constructs blog highlights in this graphic, investors need to be aware that growth is not always - and, in the case of Salesforce, not often - proportional to profitability (Figure 2):Figure 2. Salesforce's Net Operating Profits After Tax (NOPAT) were consistently growing until 2011, which saw the implementation of Salesforce's massive acquisition-centered revenue growth strategies; since 2011, NOPAT has been on a steady decline. Top-line growth with little attention paid to the bottom-line is dangerous.Other sources provide warnings along the same lines: while Salesforce is a dominant name, its low profitability and poor margin leverage are not going anywhere. Online investors have mentioned that this high-growth revenue, low-profitability trend reminds them of the technological market of the late 1990s. In addition, Salesforce is steadily accruing adjusted total debt, which has risen from $2.3 billion in 2012 to over $4.2 billion in 2013, consistently up from a comparatively innocuous $780 million in 2010 - the amount seen prior to the implementation of the aforementioned acquisition strategy. Online discussion reflects these notions: some investors go so far as to cite the difference between Salesforce's earnings and reported cash flow as reminiscent of a Ponzi scheme, and claim that the company is severely overvalued mostly because of the new strategic partnership it announced with Oracle in June 2013. They point, too, to the fact that insider trading activity has seen 103,514 buys in comparison to a much larger 2,458,086 sales in the last twelve months - this trend toward selling, which appears to include members of the company's management, has sparked word that even some segments of Salesforce itself do not believe so strongly in its value.Even facets of Salesforce's profile that seem advantageous are actually overrated, according to some. Certainly, CRM managed to acquire ExactTarget; this was heralded as a useful investment by many, Salesforce competitor Rob Tarkoff included. However, ExactTarget's CEO Scott Dorsey stepped down within a year of acquisition, igniting concerns about how well the transition proceeded for ExactTarget. Of course, CRM is a pioneer - it was instrumental in popularizing CRM software, and remains in possession of the largest chunk of market share in the industry, as well as some excellent products. However, Oracle and SAP are fast gaining on its 14% share: both companies also have shares in the double digits, so it is not that dominant. Sure, Salesforce introduced Mobile Reports and Dashboards, a set of solutions that allowed users to perform business analysis, in response to claims that it was falling behind competitors. Unfortunately, though, these developments only allow users visualization, according to most analysts: true analytic capabilities are still lacking from the platform.Even recent progress is not too favorable. While the company has done relatively well this year - it is currently at about $58 a share - it has fallen back considerably from its February high of $66 a share. Further, while its market share has grown, its profitability is still lagging.Add to this questionable atmosphere a CEO who is - at least a little - suspiciously enthusiastic, and pays employees utilizing primarily the company's own stock, and things do not look so optimistic for CRM.The Algorithmic PerspectiveI Know First uses an advanced self-learning algorithm based on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and artificial neural networks to predict the flow of money in almost 2000 markets from 3-days to a year. This algorithm provides traders with a trend they can use to identify when to enter and exit the market; though it may be used for intra-day trading, the predictability of this trend becomes stronger in 1-month, 3-month, and 1-year forecasts; as such, it can - when coupled with traditional analysis and careful reasoning - effectively be used to analyze the value of even such difficult stocks as CRM.The updated July 4th forecast generated by the I Know First algorithm is shown below (Figure 3). Bright green signifies a highly bullish signal; light green also indicates that the forecast is bullish, but not as strongly so. Bright red, in turn, signifies a bearish forecast; correspondingly, light red indicates a bearish forecast as well, but not as negative a forecast. Each compartment contains two numbers: the strength of the signal itself (represented by the number in the middle of each box, to the right), and its predictability (found in the bottom left corner, this is the approximate level of confidence the algorithm has in the forecast). Taking all this into consideration, the ticker symbol for Salesforce - ""CRM"" - may be seen as bearish in the 1-month and 3-month frames, and remains strongly bullish across the 1-year frame; this and predictability should be taken into consideration when this algorithmic perspective is used to inform traditional analytic tools.Figure 3. Algorithmic forecast for CRM. CRM appears bearish in the 1-month and 3-month horizons, but gains strength over the year-long time frames, becoming strongly bullish and demonstrating the stock's potential for growth.The figure below illustrates I Know First's algorithmic predictions in the tech stock field, indicating which stocks had the most bullish one-month signal and advising buyers on the best long investments.

Best Tech Stocks to invest in as predicted by the I Know First Algorithm to obtain maximum gain in one month.Figure 3.2. The forecast is based on the short and long-term predictions of ""I Know First"" predictive algorithm.ConclusionAlbeit that Salesforce has been seen as a volatile, dangerously-strategized stock, and though its acquisition-centered growth has diminished its cash operating profits, it is still a company to watch. Recent expansion of the company's San Francisco-area employment size signals Salesforce's confidence in its success. It has also worked to resolve issues concerning customer data safety by building several European data centers, set to open soon across the UK, France, and Germany. In addition, the company has plans to expand into the potentially lucrative telemedicine sector via a partnership with Philips, which has a chance of bettering its revenue even further as we move towards 2018. Strategic partnerships with Oracle and Microsoft protect Salesforce, if slightly, from its competition; with an outstanding year-over-year growth and a long term, scientifically-informed I Know First forecast that is strongly bullish, Salesforce, volatile though it may be, should be examined carefully by traders.Business relationship disclosure: I Know First Research is the analytic branch of I Know First, a financial start-up company that specializes in quantitatively predicting the stock market.

The 'New Industries Strategy' is designed to help businesses derive greater value from their customer relationship management (CRM) suites by deploying specific Salesforce CRM solutions. During the announcement, the company announced that it expects significant demand for such customized solutions from six industry groups globally - financial services/insurance, healthcare/life sciences, retail/consumer products, communications/media, public sector and automotive/manufacturing.Below, we take a quick look at the recent alliance between Salesforce and medical device and technology giant, Philips (PHG). We have a $47 price estimate for Salesforce that stands at a 17% discount to its current market price of $57.Healthcare Solutions Alliance With Philips Marks Entry Into TelemedicineRecently, Salesforce announced a strategic alliance with Dutch-based technology solutions company, Royal Philips, to deliver an open, cloud-based healthcare platform. Through the combined alliance, Salesforce expects to leverage Philips' strong footprint in medical technology, clinical applications and clinical informatics and provide a platform for patient relationship management, allowing caregivers to collaborate closely with their patients. Data from medical devices developed by Philips are collected and analyzed an a Salesforce platform to enhance clinical decision making by professionals.With this alliance, we believe Salesforce intends to strengthen its presence in the global telemedicine solutions industry. Telemedicine is the use of telecommunication and information technologies to provide clinical health care solutions from a distance. Globally, the market for telemedicine solutions is expected to grow by more than a factor of 10, as medical providers increasingly employ remote communications and monitoring technology, to reduce costs and improve the quality of care, according to IHS Technology (IHS). Global revenues from these remote telemedicine devices and services is expected to increase from approximately $440 million in 2013 to more than $4.5 billion by 2018.The alliance with Philips might actually be Salesforce's first venture into the high growth telemedicine industry. The growing telemedicine market should drive the need for robust back-end data management software solutions, wherein Salesforce specializes. In the future, Salesforce could rope in other alliances with medical device manufacturers such as General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) to build a strong healthcare specific CRM offeringDisclosure: No positions"

Furthermore, the companies are planning to create interoperability between Salesforce.com's CRM Software as a Service (SaaS) applications and Microsoft Office 365. This partnership once again brings into focus Microsoft's newly energized ""Mobile First, Cloud First"" strategy, and Salesforce.com's efforts to increase the coverage of its offering across different platforms. In this article, we will briefly look at the recent partnership arrangement and how both companies will benefit from it.The OfferingBoth companies have stressed the importance of collaboration, and through this partnership will work toward connecting customers that use both Salesforce.com's CRM platform and Windows products extensively. The companies plan to deliver the following solutions:Win-Win Situation For Both CompaniesMicrosoft draws over 50% of its revenues from sale of licenses for its flagship operating system Windows and productivity suite Office. With Windows 8 and the Surface launch, Microsoft introduced a uniform interface across its device environments: PCs, Tablets and Smart Phones. And it is working hard to popularize its Cloud offering, including the Azure development platform and Office 365. In the past few quarters, its OS sales have taken a dip due to tepid PC sales, and its latest version of Windows 8.1 has been slow to take off. Furthermore, competition in productivity suites, especially from Google Docs, has eroded some of Microsft's market share. To counter these trends, the company is offering discounts to OEMs for Windows 8.1 cheaper devices, and Office productivity suite on different platforms such as iPad. [1]Furthermore, Microsoft is increasingly targeting enterprise customers to reignite sales of Windows through new hardware launches. We believe that the company is strategically positioned to target enterprise clients since corporations around the world continue to favor Windows as their Operating System. This partnership will further Microsoft's cause to deliver a world class product on its platform.Moreover, Salesforce's CRM delivered through cloud resonates well with small and medium enterprises that lack dedicated hardware budgets to complement on-premise CRM bundles. Its latest offering, Salesforce1, allows users to access Salesforce's desktop platform through a mobile interface with easier and customized services for its customers. The new Salesforce1 platform, intended for smartphones and tablets, has 10 times more Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) than any other Salesforce platform. This allows application developers across small, medium and large enterprises to leverage customer mobile connectivity and provide their applications across various platforms and interfaces. With this agreement, both companies intend to better integrate their Cloud environments.Both Microsoft and Salesforce stand to gain from this partnership. While Salesforce can target its customers on Windows mobile and tablet, Microsoft can attract more enterprise clients for its Surface tablet and mobile phones. Given the growth potential within the smartphone service market, we expect good demand for the product from various enterprises and this should translate into additional revenue growth for Microsoft's hardware business and Salesforce's CRM business.However, we have yet to analyze how this partnership might affect Microsoft's competing Dynamic CRM, which has a revenue run-rate of over $1.5 billion and a market share of nearly 7% in 2013. [2] Going forward, we expect accelerated growth in the CRM software market globally due to rising adoption by enterprises and across industries such as mobility, social media and technologies, web analytics and e-commerce. Technology research firm Gartner recently updated its forecast for the CRM market from $21 billion to $37 billion by 2017. The report also points out that the CRM industry is witnessing growth faster than forecast, which indicates the immense opportunity that companies such as Salesforce, SAP, Microsoft and Oracle have in this market. [3]At present, we have $41 price estimate for Microsoft, which is approximately 3.2% above the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."
2237493,56962,2014-05-26T07:35:32-04:00,"Salesforce managed to beat analyst expectations regarding its latest-quarter sales, and generated 37% YOY growth.Excessive increases in expenses overshadowed the rise in revenues, so earnings failed to reflect the impressive revenue increase.Salesforce has a robust cash flow position that allows it to continue spending on R&D, sales and marketing.Salesforce's valuation is trading at an excessive valuation, which provides an opportunity for investors to generate some profits from the stock.","Salesforce.com Inc. (NYSE:CRM) reported its results for the first quarter of FY2015, and they were marginally ahead of analyst expectations. Despite the fact that the company's losses widened due to an increase in expenses in line with the rise in revenues, the company improved its guidance for the rest of fiscal year 2015. However, it is worth considering whether or not it is a viable investment given its excessively high valuation. This article will try to consider all of these matters to come up with a justified conclusion for investors.Top and Bottom LinesSalesforce reported revenues of $1.23 billion in the recent quarter that reflected a decent growth of 37% year-over-year. The company generates its revenues from two segments: Subscription and Support and Professional Services & Other. The following graph illustrates their respective contribution to the company's revenues and cost of sales. The Subscription and Support division is the major contributor of the company's top line, and reported a year-over-year increase in revenues of 36%, while the Professional Services & Other division generated 58% more revenues during this quarter.Source: Company Press ReleaseDespite the impressive rise in revenues, the company reported a rise in losses year-over-year. During the first quarter of FY2014, Salesforce ended up with a GAAP loss of $96.9 million, up from $67.7 million in the same quarter last year. GAAP EPS stood at a 16 cents loss per share, while adjusted EPS stood at 11 cents per share, up from 10 cents earned in the same period a year earlier. The reason behind the increased losses is the excessive spending of the company in terms of R&D, sales and marketing. The company's cost of revenues increased by 40%, while its total operating expenses increased by 34%, which was enough to negate the increased revenues during the quarter.Source: Company Press ReleaseFinancial PositionThe following chart provides an overview of the company's income statement in the five previous quarters. As depicted in the graph below, the company's current net profit margin is below the margin in the same period a year earlier, but in the last 3 consecutive quarters, the margin has been improving slightly and gradually. Still, it has to improve very much before it can get back to the level it was during the second quarter of FY 2014.Source: BloombergSalesforce generated cash flows from operations of $473 million, reflecting a massive increase of 67% year-over-year. This was partly because of the company's stock-based compensation plan. Due to the company awarding its shares to its employees as compensation, cash was not utilized, while increasing the company's shares outstanding by 4% year-over-year. The company ended the quarter with $1.53 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The company's free cash flows almost doubled year-over-year to $413 million.Future GuidanceSalesforce raised its guidance for the second quarter of FY 2015, as well as for FY 2015 as a whole. It anticipates earning non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.11-$0.12 in the second fiscal quarter and $0.49-$0.51 in the full-year FY 2015. On a GAAP basis, the company will continue to report losses per share. For the company to generate revenues of $5.32 billion, on average, during FY 2015, it needs to raise its revenues by 8% over and above the revenues reported in the first fiscal quarter.The company raised its guidance for FY2015, but now, it is just in line with the analyst expectations as compiled by Thomson Reuters. Analysts were expecting the company to generate revenues of $5.29 billion, on average, and the company's guidance of sales for the fiscal year averages $5.32 billion. This is greater than analysts' average expectations, but the high estimate of analysts stands at $5.35 billion, which is slightly ahead of the high end of the company's guidance at $5.34 billion.Final TakeSalesforce is a company with a market capitalization of $32.27 billion and a forward P/E of 75.56. This stock is trading at a huge price-to-sales ratio of 7.37 and a price-to-cash flow of 162.47. Salesforce is continually reporting losses on a GAAP basis, and anticipates doing so in FY 2015 as well. Despite the fact that the company is a pioneer in the cloud software business, it has been facing specialized competition that is pushing the company into a corner. In an attempt to combat the competition, the company is trying to diversify its services, but it will take much time to become established, partially due to the fickle nature of the industry, as well as continuous advancements. Therefore, I am bearish on this stock because of two reasons: repetitive losses and the unjustified or excessive valuation at this point in time. I suggest investors sell this stock at its current lucrative price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Gemstone Equity Research research analyst.

The researcher found that 41% of the CRM systems sold last year were SaaS-based offerings and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) led the market with a 16.1% market share. SAP (NYSE:SAP) was a distant second with 13% market share followed by Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) 10% share.Salesforce's FinancialsSalesforce.com recently reported strong quarterly results as well. Q1 revenues grew 37% over the year to $1.23 billion, ahead of the market's projections of $1.21 billion. On a Non GAAP basis, Salesforce earned $0.11 per share compared with the Street's expectations of earnings of $0.10 per share. But on a GAAP basis, the company continued to report losses and ended the quarter with a loss of $0.16 per share compared with a loss of $0.12 per share a year ago. Salesforce's continued losses are attributed to the rising spend on sales and marketing and R&D expenses. Research and development expenses for the quarter grew 43% to $188.3 million and sales and marketing costs increased 37% to $639.3 million.During the quarter, revenues from Subscription and Support services grew 36% over the year to $1.15 billion and revenues from Professional Services and Other segment increased 58% to $79 million.For the current quarter, Salesforce projected revenues of $1.285-$1.290 billion with an EPS of $0.11-$0.12. The market was modeling revenues of $1.27 billion with an EPS of $0.12. Salesforce increased its annual projections and now expects to end the year with revenues of $5.30-$5.34 billion and an EPS of $0.49-$0.51. The market was projecting revenues of $5.29 billion with an EPS of $0.49 for the year.Salesforce's Continuing Market ExpansionSalesforce continues to build on its lead by launching mobile based products and expanding its international presence. Within the mobile segment, Salesforce released Salesforce1 Service Cloud SOS, an innovative solution for mobile devices. Salesforce1 is Salesforce's mobile app development platform. The Service SOS will be evoked by putting an SOS button on a mobile app and it will lead the user directly to either live video or on-screen support to enable instant and personalized customer service.Earlier this month, Salesforce also announced the capability to integrate Salesforce1 with Heroku. Through the integration, companies will be able to connect customer data in Salesforce with next-generation customer apps. Heroku Connect will not only provide companies with the ability to build and deploy engaging consumer apps at a faster speed but also ensure that these apps are integrated seamlessly with the back-end business processes to allow real-time workflow and data analysis.Salesforce is also growing its international presence. Last quarter it added to its senior management in Japan by hiring ex-HP Japan head Shinichi Koide as the CEO of Japan. The company plans to grow its presence in Europe and is looking at creating 500 new jobs in the region by opening data centers in the U.K., France and Germany.The stock is trading at $52.89 with a market capitalization of $32.27 billion. It touched a life high of $67.00 in March this year."
2233583,54222,2014-05-22T14:31:00-04:00,"Salesforce.com is seeing rapid growth in revenue, and the company has increased its full-year revenue forecast.Salesforce's earnings are expected to grow at double the rate of the industry average for the next five years, making it a solid investment.However, Salesforce's short float has been growing, but investors should ignore it and focus on the company's strong business.","Although Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) earnings are expected to grow at almost 30% for the next five years, some investors seem to be buying none of that. If we take a look at the company's short float, this fact would become clear. As of April 30, 45.14 million shares of Salesforce were short, up from 43.80 million in the prior month. All this is despite Salesforce.com being among the world's most admired software companies, according to Fortune Magazine.Also, Salesforce posted revenue growth of 37% to $1.23 billion in the first quarter and issued a strong outlook for the current one. Moreover, Salesforce raised its full year guidance, expecting year over year revenue growth of 30%-31% this fiscal year. Despite all these positives, Salesforce shares fell after the company reported earnings on account of a wider loss.Salesforce reported a loss of $96.9 million in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $67.7 million in the year-ago period. However, the company did beat the bottom line estimate on adjusted earnings, reporting $0.11 per share as against the expectation of $0.10 a share.Robust growthCritics of the company will point out to the widening net loss figure. However, Salesforce operates in a fast-growing cloud environment and the company is making investments to grow its business. As such, some hits to the bottom line can be expected as it tries to gain market share.For example, Salesforce.com had registered more than 200 transactions in the fourth quarter of last year that were seven figures or more. Also, they included more than 10 eight-figure transactions. It is determined to repeat such performances going forward on the back of strength in its cloud-based platform. The company's SalesForce1 cloud and service cloud applications are gaining traction due to enhanced services and support, and it expects this to be a strong growth driver going forward.Why the growth should continueSalesforce1 has been built API first, and it can connect with anything and everything on various devices such as smartphones and tablets. The success of Salesforce1 can be gauged by the fact that the company announced over 250 major independent software vendors, or ISVs, have agreed to build Salesforce1 applications on the company's AppExchange. Also, Salesforce.com already has more than 30 Salesforce1 apps like Evernote, Dropbox, LinkedIn (LNKD), and HP Live on the AppExchange.Salesforce.com's other interesting segment, service cloud, also looks primed for growth after the launch of Desk.com. The service cloud focuses on small service concepts for small businesses. Also, Salesforce's ExactTarget Marketing Cloud is claimed to be the world's most powerful customer platform for one-to-one marketing, according to management.The ExactTarget Marketing Cloud would be a big advantage for Salesforce going forward as it is determined to capitalize on the industry's growth. According to Forrester, spending on digital marketing is expected to double in the next five years, representing 30% of the total marketing spend by 2017.Salesforce is also counting heavily on its flagship Sales Cloud product, which is among the leading platform for sales, according to IDC. The company is looking to make the Sales Cloud platform even better by deploying next generation apps, which is why it expects good traction in its sales, service, and marketing with Force.com in place. Additionally, Heroku and Fuel are also making its ecosystem stronger, leading to tremendous improvements in the number of app developers on the Salesforce platform that have increased 50% year over year to 1.5 million.Fundamentals and final wordsSalesforce currently does not have a trailing P/E ratio as it is running in loss. Also, its forward P/E of almost 72 also seems high. A rich valuation such as this is another reason why shorts have been piling into Salesforce. However, as we saw above, analysts expect Salesforce's earnings to grow at an estimated CAGR of 29.50% for the next five years, almost double of the industry's CAGR of 15.92%.The company is seeing good momentum in the business with rapid revenue growth, and given the expected earnings growth rate, I think it is a solid investment. As such, investors should ignore the shorts and focus on its long-term prospects.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Strong y-o-y revenue and operating cash flow growth, a second-quarter sales guidance that beat analyst expectations as well as a raised full-year outlook were, in theory, enough to cause increased investor interest and send the stock price higher. What happened? Shares of Salesforce.com stumbled more than 5% in yesterday's trading session in an environment of broadly rising equity prices.The Federal Reserve caused a spike in equities yesterday as it became clear that investors don't have to expect an end of loose monetary policy any time soon. Translation: Low interest rates are here to stay for the moment, which, obviously is what investors like to hear.So why are shares of Salesforce.com down against the trend? Well, the reason seems to be that many investors started to doubt the sustainability of Salesforce.com's sales growth. With sales growth in the 30% neighborhood and oftentimes exceeding 30% in the past, how long can a company grow before it runs into constrains? Also, despite another quarter of fantastic sales growth, Salesforce.com's full-year earnings guidance is disappointing.First quarter resultsLet's go through Salesforce.com's first-quarter 2015 accomplishments. The maker of consumer management software reported:Overall, Salesforce.com's results beat analyst estimates on both earnings and revenues. The cloud computing company also beat analyst expectations with respect to projected second-quarter sales. The company announced that it expects Q2 2015 sales of approximately $1.29 billion which beat the analysts' consensus estimate of $1.27 billion.For the full year, Salesforce.com expects total sales to come in between $5.30-5.34 billion while analysts so far had been expecting full-year sales of $5.29 billion. Salesforce.com also increased its sales range guidance from $5.25-5.30 billion which was stipulated at the end of February 2014.The table below reconciles Salesforce.com's earnings per share projections for the second quarter and fiscal year 2015 to adjusted EPS figures. Salesforce.com only expects a slight sequential improvement in second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.01.(Source: Salesforce.com Fiscal 2015 First Quarter Results Announcement)ValuationThough I like Salesforce.com's persistent sales growth, I still find the consumer software application maker not convincing on the earnings side. Ultimately, Salesforce.com will need to show investors that it can translate sales growth into meaningful earnings growth as well. Salesforce.com currently trades at 70 times earnings and certainly belongs in the club of extremely richly-priced growth stocks. Salesforce.com also does not expect to turn a profit in fiscal 2015 on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, CRM projects earnings somewhere around $0.50 per share which would lead to an earnings multiple of a cool 100. The company also trades at more than seven times sales: Way out of touch with the underlying fundamentals, even when considering above-average sales growth of 30%.Technical pictureTo be honest, I am not a big fan of Salesforce.com. Initially hyped as a high-growth company in the sexy industry of cloud computing which won accolades for being among the most innovative companies in the world, even surpassing companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) in innovation rankings, share price gains of Salesforce.com certainly haven't met high investor expectations lately.Shares of Salesforce.com have increased 34% over the last two years, only 10% over the last twelve month and have actually declined approximately 9% YTD.(Source: Yahoo Finance)Bottom lineGiven Salesforce.com's expectation of a full-year GAAP loss and adjusted earnings that are too low in my opinion to justify the extremely high equity valuation of the cloud computing specialist, I would not want to own its shares. The sell-off yesterday also seems to indicate that investors start to become more critical with respect to the sustainability of Salesforce.com's sales growth. At more than seven times sales, Salesforce.com's valuation is not justifiable in my opinion. Avoid.Disclosure: I am short AMZN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Quarterly revenues reached approximately $1.28 billion for the company, with $1.15 billion recognized from its subscription and support business for its Sales Cloud, Service Cloud and Marketing Cloud offerings. The subscription and support business is Salesforce's largest division, and the company has been reinvesting aggressively to accelerate its revenue growth rate. In Q1'15, subscription and support revenues grew 36% compared to 29% during a similar period a year ago. Additionally, revenues from its professional services business, which include various consulting and other training services to its customers, expanded 58% on a year-on-year basis to reach $80 million.Non-GAAP gross profit for the company stood at $975 million in Q1'15. This represents a gross margin of 79.5% for the quarter. In comparison, non-GAAP gross profits were approximately 70 basis points higher in Q1'14. This decrease in gross margins between Q1'14 and Q1'15 is a result of an increase in cost of revenues. Similarly, non-GAAP margins for Salesforce's income from operations declined from 10.5% in Q1'14 to 9.7% in the quarter, mainly due to an increase in operational expenses. Income from operations on a non-GAAP basis (which excludes non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased intangibles) stood at $119 million in Q1'15 compared to $94 million from Q1'14. Net income on a non-GAAP basis reached $69 million in Q1'15, representing a net income margin of 5.7%. Comparatively, net income was $61 million in Q1'14, representing a net income margin of 6.8%.In this earnings note, we take a look at the major trends that are expected to continue shaping Salesforce's robust revenue growth. We have a $47 price estimate for Salesforce which is under revision to incorporate the latest Q1'15 earnings. Headcount Expansion Continues As Revenue Growth Remains PrioritySalesforce's total headcount at the end of Q1'15 was just over 14,200, up 38% on a year-on-year basis. The 38% increase over Q1'14 was mainly because of the consolidation of ExactTarget into Salesforce. Excluding inorganic growth in headcount, the company hired more than 900 employees in the quarter, which is the most significant organic hiring completed in a quarter ever. The rapid increase in personnel is one of the driving factors for Salesforce's robust revenue growth. The company relies on its sales team for generating qualified sales leads and contributing to a steady expansion in deferred revenue reserves. It has a direct sales force in its regional hubs and field sales personnel in territories close to its customers. Both the direct sales force and field sales personnel are supported by sales representatives, who interact with potential customers and provide verifiable leads.Salesforce's deferred revenue reserve (current portion plus non-current portion) expanded 34% on a year-on-year basis to reach $2.32 billion. Unbilled deferred revenues, which have not been invoiced yet, expanded to $4.8 billion. For Salesforce, unbilled deferred revenues have a high probability of contributing to future revenue, particularly because these billings are contracted under a non-cancelable subscription agreement. As the company invoices these unbilled portion of deferred revenues for its customers, the invoiced portion gets transferred to its deferred revenues account on the balance sheet. Upon realizing these services, revenues are recognized appropriately. With a total deferred revenue reserve of over $7 billion, the Salesforce revenue pipeline remains robust for the foreseeable future.However, the expanding headcount continues to strain gross and operating profit margins for the company. Salesforce's SG&A expenses stood at $800 million in Q1'15, compared to $600 million from a similar period in FY14. Excluding stock-based compensation expenses associated with SG&A expenses, net cash-based SG&A expenses for Salesforce are approximately $703 million. Comparatively, the same net cash-based SG&A expenses were approximately $507 million in Q1'14. As a percentage of revenues, these net cash-based SG&A expenses were approximately 56.8% and 57.3% in Q1'14 and Q1'15. The higher percentage on a broader revenue base indicates the higher investments that the company is making into its business. This has impacted the company's operating and net income levels over the past few years. We expect this expansion in SG&A expense to continue going forward.Disclosure: No positions."

On this metric earnings came in at $0.11 per share. The difference is of course largely explained by stock-based compensation which totaled $131 million over the past quarter, $44 million in amortization charges and various other small charges.Looking Into The OperationsMain subscription and support revenues rose by an impressive 36% to $1.15 billion while professional services and other revenues were up by 58% to $79 million.The backlog for future revenues appears solid as well with deferred revenue increasing by 34% to $2.32 billion. Gross margins were under a little pressure but at 76% were still very healthy.The problem is that operating costs total 81% of revenue as the company spends fifty-two cents on every dollar of revenue being recognized on marketing and sales efforts.OutlookSalesforce.com furthermore updated the market with a second-quarter and full-year outlook.For the current second quarter Salesforce.com foresees GAAP losses between $0.12 and $0.13 per share while non-GAAP earnings are estimated around $0.11-$0.12 per share. These ¨earnings¨ are to be realized on revenues of $1.285-$1.290 billion which would represent a 34-35% annual growth rate.Full-year revenues are now seen up 30-31% to $5.30-$5.34 billion. While the company foresees GAAP losses between $0.47 and $0.49 per share, non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to come in between $0.49 and $0.51 per share.Investors are happy with the full-year outlook after the company previously anticipated non-GAAP earnings of $0.48-$0.50 per share on revenues of $5.25-$5.30 billion.ValuationSalesforce.com ended the quarter with $1.53 billion in cash and equivalents. The company has $278 million in ¨normal¨ debt while it has $1.33 billion in convertible debt outstanding. This results in a very modest net debt position.At $53 per share, Salesforce.com's equity is valued at roughly $32.4 billion. This values the business at some 6 times anticipated revenues for this year.The company is not paying a dividend at the moment, yet the widespread use of stock-based compensation diluted the shareholder base by roughly 4% over the past annum.Implications For ¨Investors¨During the quarter, Salesforce.com ¨spend¨ $131 million in stock-based compensation which is a non-cash expense as the company continues to issue new shares to please, attract and maintain its employees.With 14,200 being employed at the moment, this amounts to roughly $9,200 per worker for a period of three months. That is right, the average employee receives nearly $37,000 per annum at current rates in stock-based compensation on top of their salaries. This is not just a one-time extra, but really a substantial portion of their salary which is not accounted for as such under the phony non-GAAP earnings metrics.No one is doubting Salesforce.com's impressive top-line growth as it is conquering a new social and enterprise cloud market. Yet for several years the company is reporting big losses after being profitable in the years before. CEO Benioff continues to focus on growth, although the company will keep a close eye on improving its margins.Despite concerns for margins, the company remains committed to achieve its $10 billion sales target, aided by acquisitions like last year's $2.5 billion deal to acquire ExactTarget. Benioff furthermore stresses that margin expansion is difficult when you are running a subscription model while showing rapid growth.Despite the top-line success I remain unconvinced about the company's latest performance while a $30 billion plus valuation continues to push up already high expectations. The continued excessive use of stock-based compensation and focus on non-GAAP earnings which are achieved through phony accounting don't match my prudent principles.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

        Another quarter where expenses grew even faster than sales.
        Another pile of options exercised by management and the stock promptly sold.
        The game goes on. Don't be left holding the bag when it stops.","Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) turned in another incredible quarter. Amazing is out and incredible is in.Growth was incredible. Headcount grew by an incredible 38% to 14,200. Total operating expenses grew by an incredible 36% to $990 million. Operating loss grew by an incredible 25% to $55 million.It was, well, incredible.In absolute dollars, revenues rose by $334 million and expenses including costs of goods sold grew by $346 million. Not to worry, Salesforce.com will make it up on volume. Incredible volume.The order book seems to be rolling over despite the incredible growth. Deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue grew at 34% and 33% respectively, both below the rate of growth of revenues which Salesforce.com reported as 37%. That portends slower growth ahead.The balance sheet was an interesting read.Source: Salesforce.comDeferred revenue dropped by a couple of hundred million to $2.3 billion and accounts receivable dropped by $675 million to $684 million from the January 31, 2014 fiscal year end. The company claimed operating cash flow was $473 million in the quarter and touted a 67% increase from prior year. Of that $677 million came from lower accounts receivables offset by a $186 million reduction in accounts payable, the plain fact is that the company did not really generate much of anything from sales of its SaaS products to its customers. Salesforce.com did get $74 million by issuing stock to insiders which they promptly sold, a pattern that has typified Salesforce.com executives' behavior for quite some time.Investors should pay attention to the trends in deferred revenues and accounts receivable. Salesforce.com receives much of its revenues for a given contract when the contract is signed, deposits the cash and books the amount received for services that extend beyond a current period to deferred revenues. When it invoices customers for an amount of what it calls ""unbilled deferred revenue"" (a euphemism for sales not yet invoiced) that amount is added to receivables and revenues recognized over the contract terms just as if the company had received payment up front. As the funds are received, receivables fall but the revenue recognition is not changed by the payment.As a result, dropping receivables and declining balances of ""unbilled revenues"" are an indication that things are tightening up a bit and will eventually show up as lower sales growth or even a decline.The Salesforce.com charade has gone on for quite a few years and seems to have legs, so don't expect any change anytime soon. As long as Wall Street is okay bidding up the stock on the basis that one day the company might turn a profit, management are going to be content to continue to exercise options and dump stock to siphon as much money away from non-management shareholders as they can get away with without a shareholder revolt, and the rank and file shareholders will sit tight and let the game go one for as long as the share price is rising or at least stable.In the final analysis, the whole exercise can only have a happy ending if at some point Salesforce.com becomes a profitable enterprise able to pay its way by selling customers services for revenues that exceed the costs not only of providing the services but also of the marketing and sales organization that persuades those customers to buy in the first place. There is not much evidence that day is any closer now that it has been for the past few years.One bad quarter and the institutional money will flee like rats from a sinking ship and retail investors will experience a sinking feeling of their own.I am short the stock.Disclosure: I am short CRM.

2229463,53552,2014-05-21T00:09:00-04:00,"CRM was flat after-hours as investors digested a mildly-positive earnings report.While revenue was up 38%, deferred revenue is growing more slowly, and expense increases are keeping profits from growing substantially.At 100x earnings with high expenses and slowing revenue growth, I would be a seller of CRM.","After the bell on Tuesday, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) released its quarterly earnings, and the results were mildly positive. Typically, CRM shares are very volatile often moving 10% after earnings, but shares were basically flat after-hours as investors digested these results. On the whole, CRM continues to be a great growth story with a very rich valuation. These earnings are probably not enough to convert many bulls or bears, and the same valuation versus growth battle that has hurt shares over the past three months will likely continue for the foreseeable future. While the company clearly has a great product, I cannot recommend CRM as its shares are trading roughly 100x earnings, which is simply excessive.In its fiscal first quarter, CRM earned $0.11 on revenue of $1.23 billion, which was up 38% year over year (all financial and operating data available here). Analysts were looking for $0.10 on $1.21 billion in sales, so this was a mild beat. Thanks to these solid results, CRM incrementally increased its guidance for the full year and expects to earn $0.49-$0.51 on a non-GAAP basis with sales between $5.3 and $5.34 billion. Factoring in the mild first-quarter beat, CRM is basically guiding to current consensus over the next nine months. CRM is not offering the type of guidance that could turn the bears neutral, instead sticking to what Wall Street already expected. When revenue growth is 38%, that is not necessarily a bad thing, but it will likely leave shares capped below $55.For CRM, it is important to look at deferred revenue, which is a good leading indicator for future revenue as CRM fulfills its contractual obligations. In the quarter, the deferred revenue balance jumped 34% year over year to $2.32 billion. This growth rate is slower than actual revenue growth of 38%, which suggests growth will decelerate over the course of the year. During the quarter, the deferred revenue balance actually shrank by about $185 million as CRM worked through its backlog. Unbilled deferred revenue, which can be a leading indicator for revenue further down the road (9-15 months away), hit $4.8 billion, which was up 33% year over year. Again, this is a great growth rate, but it is slower than current quarter revenue growth. As CRM grows bigger and comps get tougher, it simply is difficult to grow as fast. Over the next 24 months, I expect to see decelerating revenue growth from CRM.Even with this growth, we are not seeing CRM get the needed scale to significantly increase profitability. On a GAAP basis, operating expenses were 81% of revenue compared to 82% last year. CRM's net loss on a GAAP basis actually increased year over to year to -$97 million from -$68 million a year ago. CRM continues to spend aggressively on R&D, sales, and marketing, which is negating the increase in revenue. At this point, CRM will need to continue to significantly grow revenue before it is generating significant profits. Right now, CRM is mainly a revenue growth, not profit growth, story, which is why valuation is so excessive.Now on the positive side, cash flow continues to be very strong with operating cash flow of $473 million, up 67% year over year. However, there are several factors that make cash flow appear stronger than it is. First, CRM uses a lot of equity to pay employees with equity compensation totaling $131 million in the quarter. While this costs no cash, it does dilute shareholders with the share count up 4% year over year. CRM also saw a massive drawdown in its accounts receivable, resulting in a cash inflow of $677 million compared to an inflow of $370 million last year. Over the balance of the year, receivables will trend back up, which will negate some of this gain. CRM does generate a fair bit of cash, but timing issues made this quarter's cash flow look abnormally strong.All in all, CRM reported decent results. Revenue was up a solid 38%, and it gave pretty good guidance. Deferred revenue was strong but does confirm the trend of decelerating revenue growth. CRM also is spending a lot, which is why revenue growth is not flowing through to the bottom line. With $0.50 of non-GAAP earnings this year, shares are trading a rich 104x earnings. Shares are also trading 6.06x revenue. With decelerating revenue growth that should fall to about 23% in calendar 2015, this is a really excessive multiple. Momentum names have been falling out of favor, and CRM is still not a value stock by any means. With expenses growing as fast as profits and revenue growth slowing, I would not pay 104x earnings for CRM and wouldn't be interested until shares fell back towards $40. At current levels, the best trade is to sell CRM. This quarter shows that CRM is still excessively valued.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The stock closed Friday at $51.80, up 0.74%. But the shares are down more than 6% year-to-date. Salesforce, which has quickly built itself into a leader in the growing software-as-a-service (SAAS) market, is and has always been a very interesting story.Despite constant moans about the company's valuation and its seemingly apathetic approach towards profits, Salesforce has always delivered the growth investors have come to expect. And it has done this in the face of stiff competition from the likes of IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), two traditional enterprise software titans that want nothing more than to put Salesforce out of business.The prevailing question continues to be, to what extent can Salesforce continue to outperform. And at what point will profitability matter? On Tuesday, management will have an opportunity to answer this question, as well as many others. But before they do, Salesforce will need to appease its doubters with another beat. But this time, will it be enough to get the stock to reverse course?On Tuesday, analysts will be looking for Salesforce to post 10 cents in earnings per share, which will be flat on a year-over-year basis. Despite the better-than-expected results seen from other enterprise giants like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Rackspace (NYSE:RAX), the Street has not revised Salesforce's estimates, which is a surprise. For the full year, earnings are expected to be 50 cents per share, up 43% year-over-year, topping last year's mark of 35 cents per share.In terms of revenue, the Street will be looking for $1.21 billion for the quarter, 36% higher than the year-earlier total of $892.6 million. For the full year, revenue is projected to come in at $5.29 billion, up 30% year-over-year. Revenue, which has grown for two consecutive quarters, has been the company's strength. In the February quarter, Salesforce posted roughly 30% revenue growth, and 36% growth the quarter before that.With signs that business conditions are improving, I don't expect Salesforce to have any problems on Tuesday. Given the rate at which companies are accumulating ""big data"" and positioning their models for cloud efficiency, it seems reasonable to project strong ongoing demand these services. Still, even with Salesforce's lead, I don't envision a scenario where Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), EMC Corp. (EMC) and Oracle are just going to concede this market.Also, with tepid growth seen from Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure platform, Salesforce's ongoing success makes it a prime acquisition target for a company like Microsoft, which has embraced a shift from strictly selling software to a focus on services. Microsoft's existing enterprise footprint makes this a worthwhile consideration, particularly given its recent push with Office 365. To date, Microsoft has not made any value-creating deals to show that it is a serious contender.All told, Salesforce's valuation, which continues to apply a ""N/A"" in the P/E column, is the only thing keeping value investors at bay. But after a decade of outperformance, it's time to take this company seriously, especially on this recent pullback. With the stock trading at $51, Salesforce is a sure-bet $60 by the second of the year. To the extent that the company can guide with enough confidence to affirm near-term outperformance, Salesforce should reach the $60 mark within days of this report.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Wall Street Playbook's tech sector analyst.

The company is the world's largest pure-play cloud software company, with annual revenues of approximately $4 billion and a market capitalization over $30 billion. Salesforce's Customer Relationship Management (CRM) offering competes against on-premise offerings from software giants such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) in the rapidly expanding CRM marketplace.Salesforce became the market leader in the global CRM market with a market share of approximately 16.2%. Revenues for the company have seen tremendous growth, registering an annualized growth rate exceeding 30% since 2008. However, revenue growth has been fueled by aggressive investments, as evidenced from the 31% growth in cost of revenues during the 2008-2013 period. Similarly, Salesforce's operating expenses expanded at an annualized rate of 34%. This rapid rise in expenses often resulted in weak operating, and subsequently, net profits for the company.The company recently changed its Go-to-Market strategy to cater to specific industries individually, which could very well enhance revenue prospects going forward. However, the creation of individualized sales teams should weigh on Salesforce's near term results. Sales and Marketing spending accounts for approximately 70% of Salesforce's gross profit, and we expect this share to expand further in fiscal 2014. Moreover, the company is investing capital into new data centers in the U.K., France and Germany. In short, this high growth $4 billion software company is aggressively investing in its business. Growth In Cloud CRM Market, Strong Sales Team Should Boost Deferred Revenue BaseSalesforce had deferred revenues of approximately $2.52 billion as of January 2014, up 35% on a year-on-year basis. The current portion of deferred revenues amount to $2.47 billion, while the remaining is contributed by the non-current portion of billed subscriptions. Additionally, the company's unbilled deferred revenue reserve, which includes future billings under the company's subscription business that have not been invoiced, stand at $4.5 billion as of FY14 end. On a year-on-year basis, unbilled deferred revenues have increased approximately 29% from FY13 end. In total, billed and unbilled deferred revenues stood at a whopping $7 billion for the company at the end of January 2014.The massive deferred revenue reserve for Salesforce ensures strong top line growth in the near term. The reason for Salesforce's strong performance in deferred revenues is attributable to two factors. On the macro front, cloud services are witnessing rapid adoption across industry verticals. Moreover, CRM has seen greater traction in the cloud space compared to other enterprise software suites particularly because of the flexibility it gives to an enterprise's sales team.Specific to Salesforce, the strong deferred revenue trajectory underpins the exceptional capability of its sales team in selling its product offering. The company's sales and marketing personnel witnessed a 33% expansion in headcount between January 2013 and January 2014, partly due to aggressive hiring and partly due to the consolidation of ExactTarget. Salesforce states that it intends to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within its existing customer base through the additional personnel, which should contribute to further increases in its deferred revenues, resulting in strong revenue growth.""New Industries Strategy"" Should Depress Operating Profit MarginsSalesforce recently announced a strategic shift to offer specific solutions across industry verticals such as financial services/insurance, healthcare/life sciences, retail/consumer products, communications/media, public sector and automotive/manufacturing. This particular strategy allows the company to charge a premium and derive greater value by clearly demarcating industry verticals and delivering specific solutions to customer needs in a particular industry instead of a generic cloud deployment.However, the decentralization of the sales team and the creation of individualized, industry specific sales teams requires added investments for hiring and training purposes. This should inflate general sales and marketing and administrative spend in the near term. Additionally, specific solutions across industry verticals should lead to an increase in R&D expenses. We believe this increase in operating expenses could result in a contraction in margins throughout fiscal 2014.Disclosure: No positions."

However, the company has delivered share price growth of nearly 30% in a year. Had it not been the decline (see graph below) that started after Salesforce announced its fourth quarter result at the end of February this year, the gain on investment per annum would've been more than 50% on share price alone.Source: YchartsTemporary market sentiments shouldn't distort the long-term view, especially in the market in which Salesforce operates. This article will focus on some of the past details explaining why share value decreased, and then we will look at some specifics to determine the future prospects of this stock.Historic PerformanceSource: 10KDuring the last year, the total revenue of Salesforce increased by 33% to $4.1 billion. A similar growth rate was observed in subscriptions that account for more than 90% of the company's total revenue. The increase was attributed to volume-driven increases from new customers, upgrades, and additional subscriptions from existing customers and a decline in churn rate compared to the last year. The company continued to invest in customer programs and initiatives, that together with longer contract durations and increasing enterprise adoption, helped it to reduce its churn rate.Costs worsened as they increased to $968 million, pushing the cost ratio up 200 bps from 22% last year to 24%. The reason was additional employee-related costs of $103 million as Salesforce increased its customer support and professional services headcount by 58% in one year to meet the higher demand for services from customers, of which a big portion was related to the acquisition of ExactTarget. Other cost increases related to service delivery were primarily driven by increasing data center capacity, depreciation and amortization expenses, along with subcontractor and professional services costs.Salesforce Spends More Than Half of its Revenue on MarketingR&D remained near to its historical level, increasing just 100 bps from last year to a total revenue share of 14%. The most important cost for Salesforce was and continues to be its marketing expenditure. Marketing and sales expenses were $2.2 billion or 53% of total revenue for fiscal year 2014. The company's marketing headcount increased 33% last year as more personnel were added to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within the existing customer base.While other costs played their part, they weren't as important as above. The net result was diluted EPS of negative $0.39 down 18% more than last year. The continuous negative EPS over the last three years, despite industry top line growth is the reason why investors have become frustrated with the bottom line performance. This probably explains the decrease in share price after the latest earnings release.Source: TrefisI believe investors should know a few points before they start having a negative perspective of the company. The graph above shows that Salesforce's market share has constantly grown from 2010 onwards along with the expanding CRM software market. I am sure out of all the factors that have caused this to happen, a lot of credit can be given to the higher marketing expense the company has incurred to increase its brand awareness. This is also why revenue from Europe and Asia Pacific increased 26% last year compared to 2013.Cloud computing is still a relatively new arena with companies moving towards it at their own pace. An enterprise software forecast from Gartner shows that the CRM market will grow to $36.5 billion worldwide by 2017. CRM leads all enterprise software categories in projected growth, with a CAGR of 15.1% from 2012 to 2017. With these prospects, marketing seems to be a good choice. The benefits will be realized later when the industry reaches a saturation point and pre-established brands are chosen to service existing clients.Secondly, the company's recently announced strategy to reap in more revenue seems to be a profitable undertaking for the future. The company's new Industries Business Unit ""IBU"" that it is forming will deliver social, mobile, and connected cloud solutions for six global industries:(financial services, insurance, healthcare, retail, media, public sector, and automotive).By restructuring its team to industry particulars, Salesforce plans to capitalize on creating business operations, recruiting and training workers to gain proficiency in individual industries as an additional boost to the top line. The company has announced that it will grow its current team of industry experts, develop an ecosystem of preferred partners and create transformational solutions that will leverage the power of the trusted Salesforce1 platform for each sector.Bottom LineTo report growing profits, every firm requires ongoing revenue growth. While cost control is essential, without a growing revenue stream, there is not much that could be done to generate return for investors. Salesforce's revenue growth for the past three years has stood at 35%. This is three times more than what the growing industry has generally experienced. Investors should watch for the point at which the company establishes a hold level for its market share that it desires, and at that point, it should reduce its marketing expenses in the future. This should bring its profit level to a satisfactory point. Based on the above-mentioned reasons, I think Salesforce is a good investment and therefore, it gets a long-term Buy rating.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

CRM provides customers with the solutions they need to build a next generation social front office with social and mobile cloud technologies. Most of CRM's revenue is generated from subscription and support, with professional services and others comprising the remainder of revenue.From the strategic perspective, I'm categorizing CRM as software and internet software and services. CEO Marc Benioff, through his ""No Software"" concept, had the strategic vision required for a software company, and now the company is employing the shaping strategy required for an internet software and services company. For example, the new mantra refers to running your business from your phone; this could end up being ""visionary"" as well as ""shaping.""In my opinion, Keith Block, President and Vice Chairman, is starting to have an impact on CRM's tactics. I could be giving Block too much credit, but I think he has had substantial input in the new Industries Strategy. The Industries Strategy ""solves problems for big businesses."" As CRM wins deals with its industry-tailored solutions, the profit margins of the firm are likely to improve.Relative to the street, my revenues estimate is a little below consensus ($1.21B). I'm modeling 32% revenue growth during fiscal 2015, which is above consensus for the full year. With that stated, I model CRM like a mature company to make the comparisons easier for the reader and myself. So, CRM would generate more than $1B of revenues during the quarter and would be on pace to generate more than $1B of net income for the full year. Additionally, the consensus for FQ2 revenues is $1.27B, which is in-line with my estimate.From reading the company's press releases and listening to management, CRM seems to have a solid growth plan in place. It is what I would call, ""Standard operating procedure."" We, the reader and myself, will have to see what the first quarter's results look like and what management has to say about the outlook for the business.Portfolio & ValuationCRM is in a bear market of at least intermediate degree. There are no conclusive signs of a bear market of primary degree. But given the bull market of primary degree dating back to 2012, there is a good chance of a bear market of primary degree. This is a dip-to-buy with a conservative profit target.I significantly revised upward my intrinsic value estimate to better reflect the underlying fundamentals of the firm. With even the upward revision, CRM is still overvalued by just less than 10%. That speaks to the strong fundamentals of the business, as Benioff and company lead CRM into rare territory ($10B annual revenues). There are going to be a lot of investors who figuratively kick themselves for not getting in at a market cap of $32 billion when CRM is trading at a market cap of $100 billion.General RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in CRM.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2186103,47391,2014-05-02T08:34:27-04:00,Cloud companies are coming under pressure in the stock market.A round of significant price cutting for cloud services seems to be the cause.Salesforce.com is particularly exposed.,"Not all clouds are white and puffy. Some are harbingers of inclement weather ahead. That is what seems to be in store for Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), a function of increased competition from strong and profitable competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Photo: CaptainKimo.comAfter a few spectacular years of stock market appreciation, stocks of cloud companies have been in a free-fall for about three months, and as a group, have lost about half their ""value"". By ""value"", I mean their market capitalization, since their intrinsic value is at least debatable.In the case of Salesforce.com, the stock has fallen from a high of about $66 in February to about $52 today, so the stock has held up better than most.Source: Yahoo.com FinanceSalesforce.com likes to describe itself as the ""leader"" in SaaS and PaaS services. I notice that many unprofitable companies like Salesforce.com describe themselves as leaders, but I like to think of leaders as leading in some category other than sustained losses. For CRM, those losses may accelerate as its competitors up their game while lowering their prices.There is no doubt the CRM space is growing quickly, with forecasters like Gartner finding it necessary to increase their forward estimates on a regular basis.Source: Gartner, as reported by ForbesThose forecasts remind me of forecasts for data transmission demand by companies like Worldcom a few years ago and DRAM prices in the late 1990s, when memory sold for $50 a megabyte. The forecasters get the units pretty well on the money, but forget about what happens in terms of price for a service that has a very low variable cost.As pointed out by SA author IAE Research in a recent article, Microsoft has become very aggressive on price for its Dynamics CRM product, which competes head-on with Salesforce.com, offering its service for less than half the cost of Salesforce.com, as shown in this excerpt from the IAE Research article.The Salesforce.com web site provides its current pricing, which ranges from a low of $25 per user per month to a high of $150 for standard packages, and offers a custom package on a quotation basis.Source: Salesforce.comGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft all recently made major reductions to their prices for cloud services, and I believe that over time, that kind of price competition will spill over into the CRM marketplace. Salesforce.com stopped releasing statistics on its number of customers a while ago; in the year ended January 31, 2011, the company boasted of 92,300 customers. I presume that number has more than doubled since that time, given that Salesforce.com revenues in 2011 were $1.7 billion, and this year, I can see sales reaching $5 billion. In 2011, Salesforce.com reported in its 10-k that it had 15 million subscribers, which I took to mean individual users, and presumably that number has also grown.The point is that with millions of users, the monthly average revenue per user is a significant metric, and if it comes under pressure from Microsoft or the other major competitors like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) or SAP, the impact on CRM is immediate and punishing.Assuming 15 million users, a $5 per month drop in monthly average revenue per user hacks $900 million out of revenues, with no offsetting reduction in costs. For a company like CRM, which has been incapable of showing any meaningful profit since it was formed, price competition makes it particularly vulnerable. Unlike Salesforce.com, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP are profitable and diversified, and can afford to compete on price.I am short the name.Disclosure: I am short CRM.

2209263,24491,2014-05-11T04:47:07-04:00,"Salesforce.com's top line is growing nicely, but its valuation largely reflects this.The firm registers a 3 on the Valuentum Buying Index. We prefer higher rated firms.In the valuation context, other big-cap software giants such as Microsoft look like a steal compared to Salesforce.com.","Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is a company that requires a significant amount of monitoring. Even small changes in the trajectory of its future revenue growth could have large implications on its intrinsic value. Though the fiirm is well-positioned for the shift to cloud computing and revenue expansion is impressive, we think its valuation already reflects this growth potential. Let's walk through how we capture its strong top-line growth in the DCF and apply the Valuentum process to shares.For those that may not be familiar with our approach, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. We think stocks that are cheap (undervalued) and just starting to go up (momentum) are some of the best ones to evaluate for addition to the portfolios. These stocks have both strong valuation and pricing support. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.Most stocks that are cheap and just starting to go up are also adored by value, growth, GARP, and momentum investors, all the same and across the board. Though we are purely fundamentally-based investors, we find that the stocks we like (underpriced stocks with strong momentum) are the ones that are soon to be liked by a large variety of money managers. We think this characteristic is partly responsible for the outperformance of our ideas -- as they are soon to experience heavy buying interest. Regardless of a money manager's focus, the Valuentum process covers the bases.We liken stock selection to a modern-day beauty contest. In order to pick the winner of a beauty contest, one must know the preferences of the judges of a beauty contest. The contestant that is liked by the most judges will win, and in a similar respect, the stock that is liked by the most money managers will win. We may have our own views on which companies we like or which contestant we like, but it doesn't matter much if the money managers or judges disagree. That's why we focus on the DCF -- that's why we focus on relative value -- and that's why we use technical and momentum indicators. We think a comprehensive and systematic analysis applied across a coverage universe is the key to outperformance. We are tuned into what drives stocks higher and lower. Some investors know no other way to invest than the Valuentum process. They call this way of thinking common sense.At the methodology's core, if a company is undervalued both on a discounted cash flow basis and on a relative valuation basis, and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Salesforce.com posts a Valuentum Buying Index score of 3, reflecting our ""fairly valued"" DCF assessment of the firm, its unattractive relative valuation versus peers, and bearish technicals. We generally prefer ideas that register a 9 or 10 (a ""we'd consider buying"" rating) on the Valuentum Buying Index as new additions to our portfolios. Once they are added, we tend to hold them until they register a 1 or 2 (a ""we'd consider selling"" rating) on the Valuentum Buying Index. Salesforce.com does not come close to registering the rating necessary for consideration. With that said, let's move into why.Salesforce.com's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsBusiness QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Salesforce.com's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 9.5%, which is below the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of POOR. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Salesforce.com's free cash flow margin has averaged about 19.4% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Salesforce.com, cash flow from operations decreased about 37% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 79% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Salesforce.com's shares are worth between $43.00 - $65.00 each. The estimated fair value of $54 per share is roughly in-line with where the company is currently trading (about $50 at the time of this writing). Though the ValueRisk rating is not as high as other volatile equities, we wouldn't think much of a 10%+ decline from current levels in the context of the fair value range. We think this is a fair assessment at this juncture. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 24.8% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 34.9%. This is simply fantastic growth that we're building in, and the decline is more a reflection of the law of large numbers than any fundamental impediments to continued expansion. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 12.2%, which is above Salesforce.com's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 15.5% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. The phase II growth is among the best in our coverage universe, and its resulting fair value is in-line with the market price. Investors should take this to mean that future growth is largely priced in. For Salesforce.com, we use a 10.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.We understand the critical importance of assessing firms on a relative value basis, versus both their industry and peers. Many institutional money managers -- those that drive stock prices -- pay attention to a company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-earnings-to-growth ratio in making buy/sell decisions. With this in mind, we have included a forward-looking relative value assessment in our process to further augment our rigorous discounted cash flow process. If a company is undervalued on both a price-to-earnings ratio and a price-earnings-to-growth ratio versus industry peers, we would consider the firm to be attractive from a relative value standpoint.For relative valuation purposes, we compare Salesforce.com to peers Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others. Though these are not necessarily competitors, we think the comparisons help investors keep perspective on what else is out there. For example, Microsoft is trading at less than 13 times normalized earnings, and this doesn't adjust for the software giant's large cash balance. Clearly, we think Microsoft's valuation opportunity is much more compelling than Salesforce.com's in this light -- and the former has a strong and growing dividend.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $54 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Salesforce.com. We think the firm is attractive below $43 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $65 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Salesforce.com's fair value at this point in time to be about $54 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Salesforce.com's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $73 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $54 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsIn the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of the Valuentum Buying Index has stacked up per underlying score as it relates to firms in the Best Ideas portfolio.

2090733,47391,2014-03-15T14:52:28-04:00,Salesforce.com seems dependent on prepayments from small businesses to fund growth.Small businesses have high failure rates and are vulnerable to recession.If recession occurs the Salesforce.com business model poses serious liquidity risks.,"In a previous article I pointed out the degree of dependency Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has on customer prepayments it records as deferred revenue to support its balance sheet. Many SA reader comments have correctly pointed out that customer prepayments are a low cost source of funding and may be preferable to borrowing or the dilution that could accompany an equity issue, and of course they are right.The risk in reliance on customer prepayments is the liquidity issue that may arise if those prepayments begin to disappear which may occur if customers move to shorter termed contracts or balk at prepayment altogether. The negotiating power may lie with the customer in instances where Salesforce.com is dependent on both the prepayments and the revenues and the customer has economical alternatives. The ""stickiness"" of Salesforce.com revenues is therefore a critical issue.Salesforce.com last November advised analysts that it did suffer from attrition but that the attrition was more than offset by increased revenues from existing customers, presenting these two slides.Source: Salesforce.com November 2013 presentationSalesforce.com annual reports disclosed in 2009 that it had 15 million subscribers and in 2010 had 104,000 customers without updating the number of subscribers. The company has reported neither data point since 2010.Notwithstanding, we can infer some data points from Salesforce.com pricing of its services, set out below.Source: Salesforce.com websiteIf one assumes that Salesforce.com has at least retained its 15 million subscribers (defined to be individual users) the average user in fiscal 2014 paid less than $25 a month. If Salesforce.com held onto its 104,000 customers from 2010 the company's average customer paid less than $40,000 a year for the service.I presume but don't know that Salesforce.com's customer base and number of users is growing, not shrinking. If that is so, the growth must be in the lower priced tiers or revenues would be much higher than reported. I think it is fair to say the Salesforce.com customer base comprises primarily small businesses. To the extent Salesforce.com has any large customers, the number of very small customers paying less than $40,000 a year and less than $25 a user would have to be much greater to make the numbers balance.Small businesses are typically fragile with high failure rates.Source: Small Business TrendsThat concentration among small businesses makes Salesforce.com a very risky stock to own. If the current business cycle peaks and we enter another recession, you might see Salesforce.com join the ranks of small businesses struggling to survive, and the customer prepayments it relies on for cash flows may turn out to be a more costly source of financing than plain vanilla debt or equity.I created a simple model of Salesforce.com assuming it maintains its current ratios but growth slows post 2015 to 15% in 2016 and 10% in 2017. The results show a markedly increased dependence on rapid growth in customer prepayments to stay solvent.Source: Salesforce.com financial statements, Michael Blair analysisIf that is not frightening to investors, a peek at the same model with a 5% annual decline in revenues might be.Two years with a 5% annual decline in revenues and Salesforce.com by 2017 would need $5.9 billion in customer prepayments to balance its books, an amount that would exceed its revenues. At the same time, many small customers would experience their own financial problems in an economic downturn if the past is any guide.Think slowing growth can't happen? Pay close attention to what is going on in Russia, Latin America, Africa and China and what those trends may mean for the world economy in a year or two. And good luck with your Salesforce.com investment if we go into a recession with the typical devastation to small businesses that results.I am short the name.Disclosure: I am short CRM.

2156333,44981,2014-04-23T05:35:49-04:00,CRM on the cloud and the feature of mobility plays in favor of the company.Expansion into the Japanese market should allow the company to continue its revenue growth.The expected growth in the CRM segment and the revenues of the company makes it a good long-term pick.,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has made strong progress in the CRM market, and has now become the market leader. The slow transition of IT expenditure from CIOs (chief information officers) to CMOs (chief marketing officers) has opened the doors for robust growth. The stock price has followed the trend, and the stock has gained over 37% during the last twelve months. While the market has strong demand for CRM software, Salesforce.com has combined the two growing aspects of the current technological world - the company offers CRM on the cloud to ensure portability and accessibility, which aligns perfectly with the new smartphones and tablet era.CRM on the CloudThere are two reasons for the growth in the customer relationship management software: First reason is the availability of CRM on the cloud, which has allowed sales persons to carry the software on their mobile devices and allowed them greater accessibility. This has also eliminated the information gap which may arise between CIOs and CMOs. The second reason is the benefit of portability. In the mobile devices era, we have seen robust growth in cloud-based services, which complement the need to have the software on the go. As a result, sales teams equipped with tablets can access their CRM while in the field.Over the next few years, SaaS-based CRM software is destined to show exceptional growth rates. Gartner research suggests that mobile CRM will grow by 500% by the end of 2014, as 30% of the sales companies will give tablets to their sales teams. Salesforce.com is the market leader in the mobile CRM segment, with 14% market share. Being the market leader will allow the company to exploit this growth opportunity and result in a substantial increase in the revenues.Why is Salesforce.com taking the lead?The reason for the fast growth in the revenue of Salesforce.com is its market segmentation. The smaller and rising companies have greater growth rates as compared to the ones that are already established. Same goes for the assets and facilities. Smaller businesses have lesser assets, and are potential customers for a wide array of products and services.Salesforce.com derives the majority of its revenues from its CRM software, and the company markets the product to the large organizations, as well as small-medium enterprises. However, the main growth drivers for the company are the smaller businesses, as the majority of these businesses are still not using CRM software. This gives Salesforce.com an advantage, as it is basically targeting the small business segments, which are high in number. Overall, the worldwide CRM market is growing at around 12%.Also, in the small business segment, the major competitor is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and its product has a lower ranking than Salesforce.com's software. SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), the other major player in the market, only competes in the medium and large enterprises segment.We believe that the revenues of Salesforce will continue to grow further from the small businesses. This is because the company only provides SaaS-based CRM, and does not offer on-premises service. As reported in mid of 2013, 40% of all CRM software sold were SaaS, and the number is increasing. On-premises are generally more expensive, and small companies tend to reduce their costs to a greater level. In fact, in today's market, cost reduction is crucial for even large businesses. Therefore, cost is a major factor which has been contributing to the growing revenues of Salesforce.com and will continue to do so.Japanese MarketThe U.S market for SaaS CRM has been growing at an average annual rate of around 30%. However, as I mentioned above, the overall growth rate in the CRM segment is around 12%, and the market is heading towards maturity in the U.S. Nonetheless, the growth in SaaS CRM and mobile CRM remains strong, and the company is planning to exploit this growth opportunity through some expansion.Salesforce.com has seen potential in the Japanese market, and is now considering expansion in Japan. The company has recently hired former head of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) Japan, Shinichi Koide, as chairman and CEO of Japanese operations. Salesforce.com is expecting to extract $1 billion in yearly revenue from this market. The company's last reported yearly revenue was around $4.07 billion. Therefore, we are looking at an increase of around 25% solely from Japan, if the company achieves its target.Risk/RewardSalesforce.com has a strong position in the CRM market, and the company is the second-largest in terms of revenue growth. But there is another reason why Salesforce.com should be preferred over its competitors. Most of its competitors are diversified groups of businesses, and although it is a good thing in risk mitigation, the diversified approach can sometimes result in slower growth. If we look at Microsoft, the CRM segment is a small portion of its total revenues, and high growth in this segment will not have a big impact on its total revenues.On the other hand, a focused approach towards a certain high-growth segment usually results in higher growth in revenues. Salesforce.com primarily relies on CRM, and rapid growth in the mobile CRM segment will allow the company to continue growing its revenue at an impressive rate. Higher growth in the business and revenues should result in a larger increase in stock price for Salesforce.com compared to its competitors.At the same time, increased exposure to a single segment can result in slower growth for the company if the said segment faces declining growth rates. However, as the expected growth in the CRM segment is expected to remain strong in the short-medium term, the company should not face the problem of slowing growth. Nonetheless, in the longer term, Salesforce.com will have to diversify its revenue mix and expand into other business segments. SaaS-based CRM is easy to adopt because of its lower cost. But it also allows the customers to easily switch between different SaaS vendors without incurring huge capital expenditure or long disruptions in their operations. Keeping this in mind, the company will need to be the best service provider in the segment in order to maintain or grow its position.ConclusionWe believe that Salesforce.com is uniquely positioned to benefit from the growing tablet-based CMOs market, which has strong growth rates. The steps taken by the company should allow it to continue its impressive revenue growth. The stock is down about 8% during the last three months, and it gives a good entry point to the long-term investors. We believe there is still room for Salesforce.com to grow.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2133853,23479,2014-04-09T15:09:40-04:00,,"Cloud customer relationship management (CRM) leader Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) announced a new strategy on April 2 to individualize offerings across industry verticals to accelerate top line growth for the company. Revenues for Salesforce have seen an annualized growth rate of over 30% in the past five years, boosted by strong migration to the cloud from company-owned infrastructure. Last fiscal year (ended January), revenues for the company crossed the $4 billion mark, partially supported by the acquisition of digital marketing company ExactTarget for $2.5 billion.In this note, we take a look at Salesforce’s ‘New Industries Strategy’ and analyze its potential impact on the top line going forward. The company continues to invest heavily to support its impressive top line growth, which has impaired operating and net income profit margins on a non-GAAP basis for the company.'New Industries Strategy' Should Present Targeted Growth Opportunity For Salesforce We believe the new industries approach is a way for Salesforce.com to offer vertical, industry specific solutions using the Salesforce1 platform, which allows customers to develop company-specific mobile and desktop solutions. By clearly demarcating industry verticals it serves, Salesforce.com expects to derive greater value from enterprise deployments of its CRM suite. Going forward, the company expects significant demand for CRM solutions from enterprises and governmental organizations operating in six global industries – financial services/insurance, healthcare/life sciences, retail/consumer products, communications/media, public sector and automotive/manufacturing.Given the possibility of skewered growth in enterprise CRM from certain industries going forward, Salesforce’s strategy to overlay these groups across its existing operating structure looks to be a prudent move. The company has already recruited executives with rich industry experience to build customer solutions for specific industries. This industry-specific structure from Salesforce should bode well for future growth from the company, and should be able to create a strong binding with its mobile-first Salesforce1 platform.However, the creation of these groups suggests the company’s intensive investment in growth will continue, which will bother those of us seeking higher profitability. With the new industry-specific reorganization of its Go-To-Market team, Salesforce will be investing in creating business operations, hiring, and training personnel to gain expertise in individual industries. The company announced to “grow its current team of industry experts, develop and ecosystem of preferred partners and create transformational solutions that leverage the power of the trusted Salesforce1 platform” for each sector. These investments ahead of growth would further strain margins for the company going forward.However, prudent strategies such as the Salesforce1 platform and the launch of industry-specific teams to cater to enterprise needs should boost top line growth. We expect Salesforce’s market share in the global CRM market to see continued uptick going forward. In a recent analyst presentation, the company reported 17 straight quarters of declining attrition rates from its customers driven by greater usage of the Salesforce CRM suite and increased customization using the Salesforce1 platform. The new industry groups should bolster further customization with industry-optimized solutions and this should further reduce customer attrition.We have a $49 price estimate for Salesforce, which stands at a 12% discount to its current market price of $55. Despite the company’s impressive strategies to prop up top line growth, we believe the concerns on margin pressure for Salesforce.com are larger than what the market is factoring in at the moment.Disclosure: No positions"

That goes to say that I have been around long enough for there to be a gray hair in my beard - but only one. Now that you are tuned in again, it is time to tell you what I now think about CRM.Honestly, the competitive environment is going to slow the growth of CRM at some point, but that point may not be in the near future, as management is very well paid and, in my opinion, earning their compensation. The point, the international expansion combined with strategic acquisitions and deeper penetration into the enterprise space, is likely to keep CRM growing at a rapid pace over the next several quarters.Simply stated, if you model the company like a mature company, this is a ""dip to buy.""Recent DevelopmentsBusiness SummarySalesforce.com is a provider of enterprise cloud computing services. CRM is dedicated to helping customers of all sizes and industries worldwide transform themselves into ""customer companies"" by empowering them to connect with their customers, partners, employees and products in entirely new ways. CRM provides customers with the solutions they need to build a next-generation social front office with social and mobile cloud technologies. Most of CRM's revenue is generated from subscription and support with professional services and other comprising the remainder of revenue.CRM has developed an impressive track record of providing solutions to SMBs, but the firm has to improve its execution in the enterprise segment. So, Keith Block is bringing with him from Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) a focus on solving problems for big businesses. Large enterprises typically sign larger deals that improve the profitability of the firm providing the solution(s). If Block is successful, CRM's profit margins will expand.But the competition at the high end is becoming more fierce as large established enterprise solutions companies, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle and IBM (NYSE:IBM), invest in cloud-based services through strategic acquisition and internal development. Also, there is competition for SMB business as smaller rivals with cheaper services enter the market. For example, Less Annoying CRM offers its less complex service for $10/month, which is attractive to companies without a significant IT budget.For fiscal 2015, I expect revenue to come in $100M above management's guidance as the ExactTarget acquisition, new product offerings and expansion in Europe drive growth. During fiscal 2016, I think the story will be similar, which results in a forecasted 22% increase in revenue. In the chart above, the GAAP diluted EPS figures represent reported and forecasted numbers. The pro forma diluted EPS figures represent industry life-cycle stage adjustments. Pro forma diluted EPS is forecasted to increase 34% in fiscal 2015 and 22.4% in fiscal 2016.I view the liquidity as ample. From the solvency perspective, the solvency position is solid. There was an increase in debt and financial leverage during fiscal 2014. I think the firm is toward the upper end of the tenable debt capacity. Consequently, I think CRM will decrease the amount of financial leverage during the coming fiscal years.The forecast is for continued strong cash flows growth with a ramping of capex as the firm expands internationally. Free cash flow to the firm is forecasted to increase 14% in fiscal 2015 and 13.4% in fiscal 2016. A growth firm that is cash flow positive suggests that firm has the potential to be a long-term going concern.Overall, I'm bullish on the future of CRM. I think the firm is taking the right steps, which are increasing enterprise wins and international scope. Keith Block should be the right person to guide continued growth. The competitive environment should eventually have an adverse impact on the growth rate, but the timing remains highly uncertain. Overall, CRM appears poised to remain among the largest software vendors in the world.RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in CRM.Portfolio And ValuationCRM is in a bear market of intermediate and minor degree, which is part of a primary degree bull market. In other words, this is a ""dip to buy.""First, the intrinsic value estimate is lowered to $28.46 from $32 per share to better reflect the competitive environment. Second, the price/earnings multiple is adjusted to allow comparability relative to a mature company, such as Oracle (11.6). Lastly, the rest of the multiplier valuations are unadjusted. Consequently, if CRM were trading at the base case intrinsic value of $28.46 per share, the valuations would be reasonable. But CRM would be trading at 23 times forward adjusted earnings if it were a mature company. Simply stated, there is a case for the current valuations given the reinvestment of revenue, but the increasingly competitive environment weakens the case.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2094283,40781,2014-03-18T05:16:45-04:00,"The Markman hearing scheduled for April 2014, is still on the way.Salesforce tells the SEC that they cannot provide details about the services they provide.Salesforce and Document Security Systems seem to be in a lose-lose situation right now.","Investors in Document Security Systems (NYSEMKT:DSS) have undoubtedly been on a roller coaster ride over the last year or so. Not only has the company changed with its merger with Lexington Technology group (""LTG""), but shares have as well.After DSS merged with LTG back in July, shares have been hard pressed to be able to gain the momentum they once had before the merger was completed.In January, shares briefly touched levels not seen since the merger, but that was short-lived after it was announced that the US District Court of Northern California issued a stay of proceedings in the Bascom Research case (a wholly-owned subsidiary of DSS). This unfortunately meant another delay (the second time in five months) for investors in DSS with regards to the Bascom case against Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and LinkedIn (LNKD).The reason for the stay was in light of Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int'l, a Supreme Court case covering the patentability of software. All eyes will now be on the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int'l. It's anticipated that a ruling will likely be made in June and the Markman hearing for DSS will be rescheduled shortly thereafter.Luckily for investors, the company has not put all of its eggs into one basket, as it operates in varies segments. First, the company licenses and monetizes its patents and intellectual property. Second, the company also develops anti-fraud, anti-counterfeiting, authentication and mass-serialization technologies for governments, corporations, etc. The bad news for investors is that the monetizing aspect of the company's patents and patent portfolio's looks to be harder than first thought.VirtualAgility (""DSS"") V. Salesforce Et AlVirtualAgility Inc, is an enterprise software company that sells cloud-based and computer technology. Last year, the company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Salesforce, Et Al last year. So what does this have to do with DSS you might be asking? For those that are not aware, DSS is an investor in VirtualAgility.The alleged infringing products are cloud-based software, which includes the Sales Cloud and Service Cloud applications. On February 27, 2014, Judge Rodney Gilstrap denied the Defendants' Motion to Stay and issued the Markman hearing to take place on April 3, 2014.Salesforce Under ReviewNobody can deny Salesforce's success over the years, as the company continues to grow into a multi-billion dollar business. However, things don't seem to be all that rosy as some investors might think. Let me explain.Two weeks ago, fellow SA contributor James Ryans wrote a very interesting article on Salesforce titled; Salesforce.com Can't Tell You Where Its Revenues Come From. I would encourage all investors to read the article to get a better glimpse of what DSS and other companies are up against.After major scandals (Enron, etc.), rocked the investment community during the early 2000s, new rules (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) were put into place to better protect investors. So what did the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") find while reviewing the business of Salesforce? Below are some of the responses.Salesforce responded to a multiple of SEC reviews and filings, saying that it could not tell what products were growing sales, or whether those sales are coming from new customers, upgrades, or additional subscriptions to existing customers. Not only that, but when asked to describe the growth of each of their four core service offerings, Salesforce could not provide the details.When Salesforce was asked to identify the revenue growth separately due to new customers, upgrades, and additional subscriptions, Salesforce said that it does not have the data to do so. I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist, but perhaps it's not a coincidence that the CFO and other executives and directors have left the company.ConclusionThose in the Intellectual property industry know it takes a lot of time before one usually receives the fruits of their labor. Just ask companies such as VirnetX (NYSE:VHC) and Vringo (VRNG) who are currently down this path. Both companies have been awarded favorable decisions in court (reaching upwards of one billion dollars), only to see the defendants continue to drag everything out and postpone judgment.Of course there is some risk involved with IP companies. Without an underlying business model, many of these companies burn through a lot of cash. Secondary offerings then come into play which dilutes shareholder value. Not only that, but royalty payments are not always a given. Why? Simply because the defendants can work around the patents in question and thus avoid paying royalty payments to the plaintiffs. So what does this have to do with DSS and its investment in VirtualAgility?Those investors who are counting on a huge windfall of money for DSS need to think about a couple of things for a moment. Even if things were to go DSS' way (The Markman hearing), there are still many possibilities and scenarios (Appeals, etc.) that could still play out and hurt DSS and VirtualAgility. It doesn't help either that Salesforce is showing a limited amount of visibility into its own business at the moment.While I'm not here to point a bleak picture of DSS, I did want to point out that investors need to take a more realistic approach with the company. Those investors expecting a major run-up due to the Markman hearing in April, might be somewhat disappointed.From what I understand and hear, DSS has a relatively small stake in VirtualAgility. Depending on how the winnings are divided up, a small award could have a very negative impact on shares. Why? Simply because investors have been lead to believe that a major windfall of cash is on the way, which in fact may not be the case. Because of this, I do not believe that shares will go on much of a pre-markman run considering DSS is just an investor in the case against Salesforce et al.Luckily for investors, DSS has just recently filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co. (""Samsung""), Taiwan Semiconductor Corporation (""TSMC""), and NEC Corporation of America (""NEC"") in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division. This along with the Apple lawsuit that was filed last November, gives investors and the company a broader range of resources and revenue streams to tap into.As always, I'm providing you with my track record and other particular stocks that I recommend.

2093843,23479,2014-03-17T18:34:43-04:00,,"Recently, cloud CRM software company Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) announced its plans to expand its operations in the European region. [1] Salesforce plans to open three new data centers in the U.K., France and Germany to lure government customers that require stricter data protection requirements, according to a Bloomberg report. Salesforce's business is primarily concentrated in the U.S., which accounts for almost 71% of overall revenues. The European region contributes approximately 18% to overall revenues with Asia-Pacific accounting for the rest.Currently, the company has four data centers in the U.S. and one data center in Japan to cater to its entire customer base. Salesforce plans to open the U.K. data center by August 2014, with two additional data centers in France and Germany to open by 2015. The expansion plans look to be a move to increase geographic diversity on part of Salesforce and become a global CRM player. Below, take a look at the potential opportunity for Salesforce in Europe and the impact of an expansion in operations on its stock price. We have a $49 price estimate for Salesforce, which stands at a 17% discount to its current market price of $59. Does This Investment Contribute To Salesforce's Bottom Line?Salesforce's recent financial results have been a story of strong top line and deteriorating bottom line as the company continues to invest heavily in its strong growth. In its recent fiscal earnings, Salesforce reported a revenue growth rate of 33.5% on a year-on-year basis. Concurrently, its expenses grew even faster, impairing its non-GAAP operating profit and producing a GAAP-based operating loss. Investing in new data centers is a highly capital intensive proposition. Google spends approximately $4 billion a year on building and maintaining data centers that support its systems, which puts the high CapEx requirements in store for Salesforce in context. [2]Salesforce's capital expenditures increased from $152 million in 2011 to $299 million in 2013. Including the increases in capitalized software reserves, the company's total CapEx spending increased from $212 million in 2011 to $574 million in 2013. The opening of new data centers in the next two years should expand CapEx requirements. Salesforce currently guides a CapEx spend of 5%-7% of FY15 revenues. Our CapEx widget below gives you an idea of an increase in CapEx spending on Salesforce's stock price. The spike in CapEx as a percent of Gross Profit in 2013 is a result of our CapEx valuation methodology, which includes any increase in capitalized software reserves. Salesforce's acquisition of ExactTarget added approximately $275 million in capitalized software, which led to an increase in total CapEx for 2013.Additionally, Salesforce would have to increase its investments into operating activities such as Sales and Marketing, General and Administrative expenses to generate additional customers in these countries. As a SaaS company, new revenue generation would tend to be spread across the subscription period, which is typically between 12-36 months for Salesforce. The first of these three data centers, the UK facility, is scheduled to open this August, though sites for the other two have yet to be selected. They thus are not expected to open until 2015. To the extent these investments and the associated expenses are made ahead of the revenue they are to support, they will erode profitability to a degree.Expansion Into Europe Could Pose Long-term Threat To SAP's DominanceAccording to Gartner, enterprise software spending in the EMEA region is expected to increase at a compounded annual growth rate of 4.3% between 2012-16 to reach €70 billion (~$92.4 billion) by 2016. [3] This implies that the size of the EMEA enterprise software market at the end of 2013 should be approximately $81 billion. For its part, the company suggests the market for cloud software in Europe will be $29.4 billion by 2017. This is as reported by the Bloomberg report. The opportunity is rich.Salesforce's expansion into Europe directly stacks up against SAP's (NYSE:SAP) position in the market. SAP is the leading software player in the European market and derives close to 45.5% of its $22 billion revenues from EMEA. The company reached €975 million (~$1,295 million) in global cloud-based license sales and support revenues in fiscal 2013 and expects cloud revenues to grow 32% in fiscal 2014. [4] Although SAP should continue to hold Europe as its strong hold in the near term, Salesforce's entry into the region with domestically located data centers should result in some migration of customers from SAP CRM deployments onto Salesforce's platform in the long term.Disclosure: No positions."
2065633,20521,2014-03-04T08:28:16-05:00,,"According to a Forrester research report, worldwide IT spending is projected to grow 6.2% this year. The growth is driven by IT spending on the software segment, which will grow 7.8% this year. Forrester believes that the software market growth is attributed to spending on SaaS, mobile app development, business intelligence, and analytics solutions. As CRM provider Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) delivers on this trend, their stock continues to soar to new heights.Salesforce's FinancialsSalesforce saw Q4 revenues grow 37% over the year to $1.15 billion, compared with the market's projections of $1.13 billion. But while revenues may be growing, Salesforce has not yet converted them to profits. GAAP loss per share grew to $0.19 per share, compared with the previous year's loss of $0.04 per share. Adjusted EPS of $0.07 fell from $0.13 a year ago but managed to exceed the Street's targeted EPS of $0.06. The increasing losses are attributed to the continued spend on R&D and sales efforts. For the quarter, R&D expenses grew 43% to $173 million and sales and marketing expenses increased 47% to $639.8 million.During the quarter, revenues from Subscription and Support grew 37% over the year to $1.08 billion and revenues from Professional Services and Other segment increased 43% to $70 million. Fiscal 2014 revenues grew 37% over the year to $4.07 billion with an EPS of $0.35.For the current quarter, Salesforce projected revenues of $1.205 billion-$1.210 billion with an EPS of $0.09-$0.10. The market was expecting revenues of $1.19 billion with an EPS of $0.10 for the quarter. Salesforce projected to end the current year with revenues of $5.25 billion-$5.30 billion, an impressive 30% growth over the year. The market was looking for revenues of $5.21 billion for the year. Salesforce expects to deliver an adjusted EPS of $0.48-$0.50 for the year compared with the the Street's expectations of $0.50.Salesforce's Mobile and Cloud GrowthIn response to the market trend, Salesforce continued to grow their mobile offerings. Their recently released mobile app development platform, Salesforce1 has seen tremendous growth. Since its launch last quarter, more than 250 Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) have signed up to build Salesforce1 apps on their AppExchange. Also, more than 30 Salesforce1 apps like Evernote and Dropbox are already live on the AppExchange. It has ten times more APIs than on their earlier development platform, Force.com and more than 1.4 million developers. As I have said before, I am bullish on the potential to generate highly profitable revenues out of this base of developer entrepreneurs by turning a large number of them into successful businesses.Within the first month of release, the Salesforce1 Customer Platform helped drive a 96% growth in Salesforce1 mobile app active users and a 46% growth in active users of custom mobile apps. In fact, their CEO, Mr. Benioff, illustrated how he was able to use Salesforce1's apps to view the analytics related to the quarter's closing directly on his mobile phone.They continue to expand their presence for small businesses that are able to use Salesforce's customer service offerings through the Service Cloud with Desk.com. The recent addition of ExactTarget is also helping grow within the segment which helped them earn $95 million in revenues during the quarter.Their stock is trading at $62.37 with a market capitalization of $37.88 billion. It touched a life high of $67.00 earlier last week.Disclosure: No positions"

(NYSE:CRM) is a global cloud computing company best known for its customer relation services. Recently, Salesforce released its earnings for the fourth-quarter and full fiscal-year 2014. The company performed very well, and reported better-than-expected results that beat expectations.The fourth-quarter revenues of $1.15 billion grew by 37% year-over-year. This significant growth includes the benefits from the acquisition of ExactTarget. Salesforce earns its revenues primarily from subscriptions that are charged on a pro-rated basis over the contract period, and recognizes customers as the entity, company or organization that purchases subscriptions on a per-user basis for its employees. The subscription and support (that accounts for 94% of total revenues) added $1.08 billion revenues, reflecting an increase of 37%. The professional services (that account for 4% of total revenues) also proved to be a growth catalyst for the company, that generated $70 million, reflecting a growth of 43% year-over-year.The following graphs show the subscription & support and total deferred revenues of Salesforce. Source: Earnings PresentationsDeferred revenue, a metric for the company's future subscription revenues, continued with their seven-quarter streak to increase in the mid-30s on a year-over-year basis. This quarter, the metric increased 35% year-over-year to $2.52 billion. Unbilled deferred revenues, a metric that measures the amount contracted but not yet billed, increased 29% year-over-year to $4.5 billion, thus reflecting a substantial backlog.The non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share of $0.07 exceeded the expected earnings per share of $0.06 on revenues of $1.13 billion.Salesforce Expansion in Europe to Flourish Its Growth ProspectsSalesforce has seen tremendous revenue growth of 41% in the European region during fiscal year 2014. To take advantage of this lucrative opportunity, Salesforce recently decided to expand its operation. Now, the company plans to open new data centers in the U.K., Germany, and France, and intends to cover companies of all sizes in Europe, including BMW group (OTCPK:BAMXF), Pernod Ricard (OTCPK:PDRDF), and Zeiss (OTCPK:CZMWF). According to the company's expansion plan, the first data center will be opened in the U.K. in August 2014, with additional data centers to open in France and Germany in 2015.These data centers in Europe will give ease of access to its cloud-based CRM software, and additional opportunities for Salesforce in more regulated businesses and government sectors. Salesforce has been a part of the U.K. government's G-Cloud framework system since 2012. Combined with its existing four data centers in the U.S. and one in Japan, Salesforce is creating massive capacity around the globe. It is clearly evident that the company is positioning itself to continue its existing fast-paced growth in the future. The company's push in Europe would help it to compete effectively with its rivals and enjoy growth, because the market for cloud computing in Europe is expected to reach $29.4 billion by the end of 2017.The increasing need for effective storage will increase the demand for the cloud app market. According to estimates, the global customer cloud app market will grow at a CAGR of 15.25% over the period of 2013-2018. According to a report by Gartner, North America would be the largest region with 59% of all new spending on cloud services from 2013 through to 2016. Western Europe, despite the growth challenges in the region, remains the second-largest region, and will account for 24% of all new spending during the same time period.The recently forecast first-quarter sales of Salesforce may top analysts' estimates, as demand for its customer service programs helps bring in large contracts. Europe accounted for 18% of Salesforce's revenue in fiscal year 2013, up from 17% a year earlier. More than two-thirds of sales were in the Americas. Salesforce raised its fiscal year 2015 revenue guidance by $100 million to reach $5.3 billion, with a full-year growth rate of 30% at the high end.Industry Outlook and Salesforce's Recent DevelopmentsGartner forecasts that the worldwide dollar-valued IT spending forecast will grow 3.1% in 2014, reaching $3.8 trillion. To take advantage of this growth in data center systems and cloud computing, Salesforce has been expanding aggressively through a significant number of acquisitions since 2006. Its most recent development was acquiring business intelligence and analytics startup, EdgeSpring, and Clipboard, a startup whose service lets users save chunks of text and rich content from Web pages and share them with other users online.Source: GartnerThe most significant acquisition is ExactTarget, which is a digital cloud marketing solutions provider. The newly-acquired company has more than 6,000 customers, including major corporations like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Gap (NYSE:GPS), and Nike (NYSE:NKE).The acquisition has made Salesforce a technology leader in the market. The company is now able to provide customers a wholly-integrated marketing platform that combines Salesforce's sales, service, and marketing cloud with ExactTarget's digital marketing capabilities. These acquisitions will play a key role in the growth of Salesforce over a longer period when the synergy benefits will be realized.It is anticipated that the customer relationship management market will reach $36.5 billion worldwide, reflecting an increase of 77% from the current market of $20.6 billion. CRM also leads all enterprise software categories in projected growth, showing a 15.1% CAGR from 2012 to 2017. Salesforce's specialty in CRM operations, along with industry growth prospects would definitely act as growth catalysts. The business intelligence also possesses the potential for growth, which was the likely reason behind the acquisition of EdgeSpring, and Salesforce is very well-positioned to grow strongly.Source: ForbesThe total return to an investor from price appreciation and dividends, assuming that the dividends are reinvested, is 35.14%. Salesforce has outperformed the S&P 500, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM).Source: YChartsAlthough Salesforce is currently not profitable, the company has quite promising future returns due to the immense potential of growth, its strategic position, and market share in the cloud computing market. The company will expand its operations in Europe and other emerging markets, and increase its offerings, so this will ultimately lead to profitability and growing subscriptions, and largely contribute towards the returns to investors.

2076923,47391,2014-03-10T00:05:00-04:00,Salesforce.com has a $1.3 billion working capital deficit.Ninety five percent of the funding of liquid assets comes from customer prepayments called Deferred Revenues.Continued growth in Deferred Revenues seems necessary to keep the ship afloat.A collision between profitless growth and customer credit seems inevitable.,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) benefits from pre-payment for its services accounting for those pre-payments for services not yet provided in a given year as a ""Deferred Revenue"" liability. This is a standard way of accounting for such payments and there is no issue with the treatment. On the balance sheet, the pre-payments received show up as additions to Cash balances and the pre-payments invoiced but not yet paid show up in the Accounts Receivable balance.At least that is what I get out of their disclosure documents.An example may assist. A customer purchases a license to use the Salesforce.com platform for two years and pays Salesforce.com $200 on the first day of its fiscal year. Salesforce.com deposits the $200 to its bank and by year end has provided one year of the two years' licensed services and records $100 as revenue. The other $100 is already in the bank but not recognized as revenue so Salesforce.com records the $100 as a Deferred Revenue liability to balance the books. In the following year when the second year of the license runs its course and the full two year service has been provided, Salesforce.com will recognize the revenue and relieve the Deferred Revenue liability. Importantly, while the Deferred Revenue will show up in that second year in Revenues, no cash will be received in that year it having been received by Salesforce.com in the prior year.In the case of Salesforce.com its January 31, 2014 balance sheet discloses that the Deferred Revenue liability had grown to be $2,473,705 in Current Liabilities and another $48,410 in non-current liabilities (all numbers are 000's to conform to the Salesforce.com statement presentation). ""Current"" means due within the next fiscal year, indicating that the vast majority of Deferred Revenue will be recognized in fiscal 2015.Source: Salesforce.com press releaseSalesforce.com gave guidance that its fiscal 2015 revenues (year ending January 31, 2015) will be in the range of $5.25 to $5.3 billion. Of that, $2.5 billion (I have rounded the $2,473,705) has already been booked with payments received or recorded in accounts receivable. Since I expect accounts receivable to grow in proportion to revenues in fiscal 2015, it is fair to say that the $2.5 billion Deferred Revenue being recognized in fiscal 2015 will provide no additional cash to Salesforce.com.In fact, the prepayments by customers recorded as Deferred Revenues by Salesforce.com have grown to where they now fund 95% of Salesforce.com liquid assets. The past few years illustrate the point.Source: Salesforce.com reports, Michael Blair arithmeticThe Salesforce.com balance sheet is not all that liquid. Working capital as at January 31, 2014 showed a deficit of $1.3 billion.My take on this is not pretty. Customers give Salesforce.com money - I like to think of it as a deposit - for services to be rendered over time. Customers have a reasonable expectation that the money they paid will be used to provide the services they contracted. But it is not. It is being used to fund past and current losses and to help pay for acquisitions of unprofitable companies that management hopes will one day be profitable.The result is a balance sheet that is very tight. Cash, securities and receivables are now $1.7 billion less than debt and deferred revenue obligations, leave alone accounts payable of $0.9 billion as at January 31, 2014.Source: Salesforce.com reports, Michael Blair arithmeticProfitless growth won't solve this problem. At best the crunch can be ""Deferred"" by exponential growth in customer prepayments.Given the very rapid build in Salesforce.com employment and marketing expenses generally, this seems to be management's plan.Source: Salesforce.com November 19, 2013 presentationAs long as Salesforce.com can keep the money from new contracts coming in up front at a faster rate than they are paying it out to provide services for existing contracts, the game can go on.By my arithmetic, Revenues have grown at a compound annual growth (CAGR) rate of 33% since 2010 while Deferred Revenues have grown at a 38% CAGR. In my opinion it has a Ponzi-like smell to it and I don't think it can go on much longer.I am short the stock.Disclosure: I am short CRM.

Bulls point out that GAAP profit metrics are irrelevant, focusing on substantial revenue growth and visionary leadership in cloud computing. Bears point out that the company, now generating more than $4 billion in revenue, still loses money on a GAAP basis, has declining gross margins and revenue growth rates, and operates in a highly competitive industry with no network effects and large, entrenched competitors. I've certainly been a bear over the last year, but I want to focus on the facts here and let folks draw their own conclusions.GAAP reporting is a major source of confusion related to CRM (and other enterprise SAAS companies). In CRM's case, GAAP confusion primarily centers on revenue recognition and stock compensation expenses. CRM generates a substantial proportion of their operating cash flow (OCF) from growth in deferred revenue (business the company has billed for, either receiving cash or booking a receivable, but not yet recognized as revenue) and the add-back of non-cash stock compensation expenses. I've argued in the past why I believe both are dubious OCF sources, but the point here is that although CRM is not profitable by GAAP standards, it has historically generated OCF.Free cash flow (FCF) is the most important metric for me to evaluate historical and future cash generation, and will serve as the primary input in this analysis. Here, I assume FCF is simply OCF less capital expenditures (excluding $270 MM the company spent on raw land in 2009). I've also argued in the past why I believe acquisitions should be deducted against OCF in determining CRM's FCF, but this analysis excludes acquisitions. Thus, I've given bulls everything they could ask for in presenting a fair picture - using an FCF metric that excludes acquisitions and eliminates most of the accounting adjustments that result in GAAP losses.Salesforce generates the majority of their free cash flow from sources other than net income. Quality earnings are often described as having persistence and predictability. For example, a company whose net income equaled FCF would require no add-backs or adjustments - subject to a wide range of assumptions and techniques to massage - to reconcile the two. CRM's net income, on the other hand, is negative. They rely on massive non-cash adjustments - stock compensation being a major one - and changes in working capital accounts. Working capital changes are not predictable - in fact, many prefer to use after-tax operating profit plus non-cash charges as an OCF proxy when calculating FCF. CRM's stock compensation add-backs grow predictably, but lack persistence if employees begin demanding cash compensation in lieu of equity. CRM's foundation of OCF and FCF is tenuous.Let's turn to CRM's performance in generating FCF. As the chart below illustrates, FCF grew rather rapidly until 2012, when it began to stagnate. Remember, these figures exclude cash acquisitions, which certainly have contributed to FCF generation, but most certainly were not free to shareholders.It is important to note we are looking at per share FCF, since the stock compensation add-backs discussed above have a seemingly benign but long-term deleterious impact on shareholders. For example, CRM's outstanding shares grew from 586 MM in January 2013 to 610 MM in January 2014. During that same period, annual FCF grew from $557 MM to $576 MM. Absolute FCF grew 3%, but the accompanying increase in shares outstanding resulted in a per share decrease in FCF of 6.3%.Although CRM's FCF per share has been roughly flat since 2012, the stock rose substantially. Meanwhile, the company used its cash hoard and borrowed to finance acquisitions. The combination of higher stock prices with continuously increasing shares outstanding, increased debt, and decreased cash has driven enterprise value to approximately $40 billion. The resulting EV/FCF seen below is now the highest in the company's public history, approaching 70.EV/FCF, of course, excludes growth, CRM's major selling point to shareholders. Just like the more familiar PEG ratio, EV/FCF/G adds a growth component to evaluate a company's value. Here, the combination of CRM's stagnant FCF growth and increasing EV creates a remarkable endpoint to the chart below. As seen, EV/FCF/G typically fluctuates between 0 and 5, even in the company's early days, when they were generating only a few hundred million dollars in revenue and had massive growth opportunities ahead of them.CRM's position as a battleground stock has come to a head. Bears would be wise to acknowledge GAAP shortcomings in valuing the business. Meanwhile, bulls should appreciate the growth in FCF - what really matters - is waning, resulting in a stock price that absent further speculation appears unsustainable.Disclosure: I am short CRM.

With the Salesforce.com platform, your marketing department can track every detail of your customers' behavior from orders to sales to intentions. Or can you?SA Author James Ryan published a recent article pointing out that Salesforce.com is telling the SEC that it can't even tell where its own revenue comes from. The SEC correspondence between Salesforce.com and SEC staff is a great read. In response to an SEC query on June 18, 2013, Salesforce.com wrote a letter to the SEC, an excerpt from which follows:[SEC Query][CRM Reply]We respectfully advise the Staff that while total revenues are positively impacted by new customers and additional subscriptions or upgrades from existing customers, we do not separately quantify the revenue impact of these factors affecting total revenues in assessing the performance of our business. While part of our business strategy is to pursue new customers aggressively and to deepen our relationship with existing customers, we have found that this incremental revenue by its individual source is not meaningful information. During our relationships with our customers, we hope to upgrade customers to one of our premium service editions, sell additional subscriptions to service offerings currently being used, or sell additional subscriptions to different service offerings. When those events occur however, the terms are typically coterminous with the original contract end date. When a contract renewal occurs, it then becomes difficult to evaluate period-over-period dollar comparisons by individual revenue source. Accordingly, we respectfully note that we provide the narrative discussion of these revenue trends consistent with Item 303(a) (3) (NASDAQ:III) of Regulation S-K where a quantitative breakdown is not meaningful for the reasons discussed above.OK, I get it. Revenues increased 35% and some of it came from new customers, some from upgrades, some from additional subscriptions from existing customers, and some from improved renewal rates. But Salesforce.com has no record of how much of the revenue change came from each source.Why does Salesforce.com just export those data from its state-of-the-art CRM system? Surely it records who its customers are, when they upgraded or ordered a new subscription, and if and when they renewed. Maybe it doesn't even use Salesforce.com CRM for its own operations. I don't know.On August 29, 2013, the SEC wrote again to Salesforce.com with the following question:Revenues, page 432. Your response to prior comment 2 states that you do not track or monitor the separate impact of new customers, or upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers, on total revenues for a period. Please explain to us how you determined that your:In addition, given that your revenue recognition policy appears to have remained constant from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013, it is unclear why your revenue recognition policy impacts your ability to provide a more detailed explanation of the material increases in recognized total revenues from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013, and from the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Please advise. Finally, tell us whether you have considered including a metric, such as bookings, to give additional insight into sales trends.Hmmm? Good questions. Salesforce.com does not track these items, but knows to one decimal place how much they contribute to the rise in revenues, at least in aggregate. Are there some other sources of revenues or does the Salesforce.com gobbledygook simply mean revenues rose 38.1% and it must have come from these sources?On September 27, 2013, Salesforce.com wrote to the SEC with inter alia this reply:Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResults of Operations, page 40Source: Salesforce.com September 17, 2013 reply to SECWe don't have transcripts of the oral discussions referenced, but this letter adds to our knowledge that Salesforce.com not only cannot break out new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers or revenues from improved renewal rates but also can't determine how much of its revenue comes from any of its particular services.I think I get it again. It gets revenues and say those revenues come from customers and that is about it. I guess the standard of full, plain and true disclosure in the United States securities regime doesn't require any more.Surprisingly, in light of the SEC exchange, it might seem that Salesforce.com does have a better handle on its revenue sources than it told the SEC. However, in its Investment Community Session November 19, 2013, Salesforce.com was able to break out the details of customer attrition in this slide:Source: Salesforce.com Investment Community Session November 19, 2013In addition, Salesforce.com was able to provide investors with details of how much additional revenues it had from existing customers to offset that attrition, in this slide:Source: Same as above slideThe second slide has a footnote that says: ""Note: Excludes Renewal Business"". Somehow, without financial controls that permit separation of such data for the SEC, Salesforce.com was able to break it out for investors.I will send a link to this article to the staff at the SEC who asked Salesforce.com to break out the data. Maybe the SEC will ask Salesforce.com if it wants to reconsider its response. Maybe I should send the link to Carson Block as well - he seems able to get to the bottom of mysteries like this one.An important issue for investors is the implications of the breakout Salesforce.com did provide in the slides above. I took those data in rough terms (I had to estimate the plot points on the charts) and produced the following spreadsheet, which I included in my SA article a few days ago:Source: Michael Blair analysisThe implication of the charts is that Salesforce.com is not adding new customers that make any material contribution to revenue. If that is so, how can revenues continue their relentless growth at about 30% a year?If Salesforce.com is losing customers at 12% each year and new customers are providing little added revenue, the growth can only be higher revenues from the existing but apparently shrinking customer base. I suppose it is possible that the new customers who added $42 million to fiscal 2014 revenues might be customers with ""amazing"" growth in their demand for Salesforce.com services. But I doubt that growth will explain much of the $1.2 to $1.3 billion revenue increase Salesforce.com is guiding to in fiscal 2015.Part of the explanation may be related to the way Salesforce.com books deferred revenue. As I understand it, if a customer buys a three year subscription and pays up front, Salesforce.com banks the upfront payment, but recognizes revenue for the part of the contract that coincides with the fiscal year being reported and sets up the balance as ""deferred revenues."" While Salesforce.com already has the payment in this example, the revenue will be recorded in future periods and the ""deferred revenue"" liability reduced as the revenue is recognized.If that is a material part of future revenue, it is a future cash flow problem. The cash is already on the balance sheet and in the bank and the portion of revenue being recognized in the future periods will not add any cash, that having already been received. With a few billion of debt now and any slowing in cash coming in - deferred or otherwise - this puppy is going to the pound.Since Salesforce.com is apparently unable to break out its revenues by any segments requested by the SEC, it seems unlikely that investors will get much insight into future revenue sources except the company's ""amazing"" guidance and some arm-waving all-encompassing gobbledygook about revenues coming from new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers, and renewal rates, improved or otherwise.If I am right that revenues from new customers are falling off a cliff as set out in the spreadsheet above, the rubber will hit the road pretty soon.Salesforce.com has a deferred revenue liability of $2.5 billion as at January 31, 2014. If I am correct in my understanding of its accounting, the benefit of that deferred revenue is already either in the bank or in accounts receivable and will not result in future inflows of cash. That is about half of the $5.25 to $5.3 billion Salesforce.com is guiding to as fiscal 2015 revenues.Amazingly, that $5.25 to $5.3 billion continues the roughly 30% growth in revenue Salesforce.com seems to achieve year after year despite an apparent and almost miniscule contribution from new customers (based on my analysis anyway) and a 12% attrition rate of existing customers.To misquote from Hamlet, something seems to be rotten in the state of Denmark.I may be way off base in my analysis, but the absence of details and transparency from Salesforce.com is a contributing factor if I am. Investors deserve better, and the SEC deserves a better response.I am going to do a cash flow analysis of Salesforce.com from its date of incorporation through its fiscal 2014 balance sheet. It will take some time, but it should make for fun reading.I am short the stock.Disclosure: I am short CRM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Responding to an SEC review, Salesforce says they cannot tell what products are growing sales, or whether those sales are coming from new customers, upgrades, or additional subscriptions to existing customers. Perhaps it is not a coincidence that their CFO announced his retirement Feb. 28.No one can deny Salesforce's success, growing by a reported 33% to more than $4 billion of revenue in the year ending January 31st 2014. Yet the company lost more than $200 million and spent more than $2 billion on acquisitions, so investors could be forgiven for wondering if the company's systems are up to the task.Salesforce admits that they ""...do not have financial systems and controls in place to be able to accurately quantify the percentage of our total revenue derived from subscriptions to the Sales Cloud or any other core service offering...""Salesforce also noted that its 38% growth for the year under review ""...was due to new customers, upgrades, and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates..."" Yet, when the SEC asked Salesforce to provide the contribution of each factor to the company's growth, Salesforce admits that they ""...do not separately quantify or monitor the separate impact of these enumerated factors."" In other words, growth must come from these factors, because they cannot think of anywhere else revenue growth could have come from. One can forgive the SEC for failing to point out the fallacy of Salesforce claiming that revenue grew due to an improved renewal rate; in other words Salesforce said growth came from losing fewer customers.But there is another source of growth. In Salesforce's 10-K that was released today (March 5), they provide nearly identical language describing that their growth was ""...due almost entirely..."" to these same factors. Yet the ExactTarget acquisition footnote says $194 million of consolidated revenue came from the acquisition. This means that only 27% of Salesforce's growth was due to new customers, upgrades, and additional subscriptions, not 33%.After the Enron and Worldcom scandals, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that the SEC review the financial statements of each public company at least every three years. The purpose of these reviews is to protect investors by ensuring issuers disclose meaningful information to investors, as required by the securities laws. In many cases, these reviews are completed silently, and no comments or requests are issued. In some cases, the SEC asks for minor clarifications. But in many cases the SEC asks for truly useful information that investors should want and have. The results of these reviews can often highlight the shaky foundations of a company's reporting and financial controls.Clearly Salesforce is a phenomenal success, and investors should remember that a quality business and quality financial reporting need not go hand in hand. But an enterprise software company should be embarrassed if it is incapable of basic analysis of its own sales data.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours.

Revenue rose, too, but by a comparably smaller percentage, 37%; thus the bigger loss. This is the dis-economy we mention in the headline. As Salesforce gets bigger, its cloud-based software seems harder to sell, not easier. That’s not how scaling is supposed to work.But this bad news completely misrepresents the Salesforce release and the story the company wants to tell. The release starts by projecting fiscal 2015 revenues – they’ll rise 30%. Other happy comparisons are trotted out. And soon, we’re being treated to the first mention of non-GAAP results; there will be 61 mentions of non-GAAP in all.

2059593,23479,2014-02-28T15:31:55-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported its fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2014 results yesterday, February 27, after the close of markets. (Fiscal years end with January.) Revenues crossed the $4 billion mark for the full year, reaching $4.07 billion at a growth rate of 33.5%. ExactTarget, which Salesforce acquired in July 2013, contributed $196 million in revenues in fiscal 2014. Deferred revenue levels also grew 35% to reach $2.52 billion. Additionally, the company has a robust unbilled deferred revenue pipeline amounting to approximately $4.5 billion.However, margins for the company continued to tread a downward trajectory as operating expense grew even faster than revenue for the third successive year. Salesforce posted an GAAP operating loss of $286 million for FY14, which translates into a staggering -7% operating profit margin. Comparatively, GAAP operating profit margin last fiscal was about 3.6%. Non-GAAP operating income excludes the impact of non-cash expenses such as stock based compensation and amortization of intangibles, and is a better benchmark to gauge the performance of a company with significant non-cash expenses.Even on non-GAAP terms, Salesforce posted a decline in margins. Non-GAAP operating income stood at $364 million, which indicates a non-GAAP EBIT margin of 9% compared to $357 million (~11.7% non-GAAP margins) from a year prior period. Heavy investments into R&D and SG&A activities combined with constant expansion in stock compensation payments have been detrimental to the company’s non-GAAP and GAAP margins. We expect to see continued erosion in margins for Salesforce in the near term, as competition intensifies within the cloud enterprise software industry and Salesforce’s increases its investments to increase its lead over competitors.Salesforce finished fiscal 2014 with a GAAP net income loss of $232 million despite receiving a favorable tax benefit of approximately $126 million. What’s more worrying is that Salesforce’s loss before tax deductions nearly tripled, increasing from a loss of $128 million in the previous year to $358 million in fiscal 2014. We currently are in the process of updating our price estimate of $50 for Salesforce to incorporate the latest Q4 earnings.Factors Weighing Down On Salesforce’s MarginsAs stated above, Salesforce’s erosion in margins is driven by its operating expense growth outpacing revenue growth. Salesforce’s SG&A expenses increased 35% over CY12 to $2.77 billion. R&D spend for the company increased at a steep 45.2% rate over the 12 months to reach $624 months. In comparison, Salesforce’s revenues only grew at 33.5% compared to last fiscal, which puts downward pressure on margins. Salesforce’s high operating expenses indicates the highly competitive SaaS marketing and CRM industry.Salesforce markets and sells its services primarily through a direct sales channel, with telephone sales personnel based in regional hubs and field sales personal based in territories. Both these sales personnel are supported by sales representatives who are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads for the company’s top line growth. Compensation for these sales representatives and personnel is usually made on a commission basis. In addition, the company’s employee stock compensation have been on a constant upward trend, amounting to about 12.5% of fiscal 2014 revenues, up from 6.8% in fiscal 2010.The company also has a network of partners consisting of various independent software vendor, IT consulting firms and system integrators that provide lead referrals and contribute through an indirect sales channel. Salesforce pays these indirect partner channels a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue from the customers they refer. As its business expands, we expect Salesforce to expand both its direct sales personnel and indirect partnerships which should continue to weigh down on margins.As a percent of revenue, Salesforce’s operating expenses far outweigh those of legacy software players such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP AG (NYSE:SAP). The primary reason for this higher expense allocation to both R&D and S&M is to maintain its competitive lead and support its hyper growth rate in the top line. Salesforce has a stronger presence in the small and medium enterprise market, which typically have low renewal rates and require substantial sales and marketing and service activity. Investments into R&D and S&M activities ensure Salesforce an expansion in its market share within the CRM industry.Additionally, Salesforce reported a total of 200 large deals, that crossed seven figures in revenues for fiscal 2014, compared to 150 in fiscal 2013. [1] Currently, the growth in number of large deals signed by Salesforce is in close correlation with overall revenue growth. If the growth in number of large deals outpaces overall revenues going forward, we should see some lift in margins as large enterprises offer scale and pose a lower operating burden, relative to deals with smaller companies. This should lift the company’s financial health in the long run.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
2062683,47391,2014-03-03T09:02:50-05:00,,"Gartner forecasts the CRM market for 2014 at $23.9 billion.That forecast suggests the CRM market grew by one third since 2012 when it was an $18 billion market, a growth rate of about 14% versus the 12.5% growth rate in 2012.Source: ForbesSalesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported fiscal 2013 revenues of $4 billion and guided to revenues of $5.3 billion in 2014 at its last earnings conference.Achievement of $5.3 billion revenues would put Salesforce.com at about a 22% share of the Gartner forecast market versus 14% in 2012.If Salesforce.com is taking share, someone must be losing it. Who?In April 2013, Gartner reported CRM industry sales in calendar 2012 as follows:What is interesting is that everyone is growing. If Gartner is right that the 2014 market will be $23.9 billion, that will represent an increase of $5.8 billion from 2012 in absolute dollars. Salesforce.com would have garnered about $2.7 billion of that growth increment if it achieves its $5.3 billion revenue guidance. That performance would mean that Salesforce.com is capturing about 51% of the growth in the market.According to the Gartner 2012 table above, Salesforce.com was not the fastest growing player in CRM space - that would be IBM (NYSE:IBM) with 39.4% growth, while Salesforce.com would be in a tie with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) with a 26% growth rate.If one simply projects the CRM market with each competitor growing at the rate it grew from 2011 to 2012 through to 2014, the picture looks like this by my arithmetic:Source: Michael Blair analysisThe trendline would put Salesforce.com calendar 2014 revenues at $4.0 billion, a long way shy of the $5.3 billion the company forecasts for its fiscal 2015, which comprises 11 months of calendar 2014. Of course, the Gartner numbers are calendar year and Salesforce.com fiscal year ends in January. A few hundred million of the difference reflects the Salesforce.com acquisition of Exact Target in 2013. Exact Target revenues contributed $195 million to Salesforce.com fiscal 2014 sales and likely represent $400 million to $500 million of the fiscal 2015 picture. I can find no evidence to explain the additional $800 million in the fiscal 2015 guidance.I have no idea how Salesforce.com can be taking massive amounts of market share from competitors who are not reporting corresponding market share losses of the same magnitude, at least not in reports that I can find.To use a word familiar to Salesforce.com CEO Mark Benioff, it is simply amazing.There are a few alternative possibilities:Salesforce.com's Investor Community November 19, 2103 set out some interesting data that go to its sales figures. One slide showed declining attrition from existing customers. I read the chart as showing the attrition rate declining from 16% in Q412 to 14% in Q413 and 12% in Q414 more or less.The presentation then went with a slide that showed added sales to existing customers more than offset that attrition with about $2 added for every $1 lost in FY12; $2.25 for every $1 lost in FY13 and about $2.50 added for every $1 lost in FY14.Taking those data at face value, I estimated their implications for Salesforce.com reported revenues as set out below. For example, if Salesforce.com suffered 16% attrition from its fiscal 2011 revenues (excluding professional fees) of $1,551 million, it would have had attrition of $248 million, but added twice that, or $496 million, from existing customers, raising what I will call its base revenues in fiscal 2012 to $2,047 million. Since it reported $2,267 million in revenues, the balance had to come from new customers.The same analysis shows that revenues from new customers must have dropped to about $113 million in 2013 and a mere $42 million in 2014.In the midst of all this, Salesforce.com continued to report steady growth in revenues, which it paraded in its November 19, 2013 Investor Community presentation with this slide. Given the churn, the offsetting growth in revenues from existing customers, and the apparent decline in new customer revenues, the performance is, well, amazing.Despite the ""amazing"" performance, key executives and directors of Salesforce.com are jumping ship.Salesforce.com CFO Graham Smith is stepping down in March 2015.Source: Salesforce.com websiteMr. Smith is 53 years of age and has been with Salesforce.com since 2007.Source: BloombergI have no idea what prompted Mr. Smith to decide it was time to leave Salesforce.com at 53 years of age.Mr. Smith is not the first departure.

1938701,24550,2014-01-10T10:13:27-05:00,,"At Dreamforce last Fall, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) introduced it's new platform offering, Salesforce1. This week I attended the World Tour event in NYC for Salesforce1 and spent some time talking to Salesforce execs and an assortment of customers about the platform. I've started to write this post several times since I first heard about it, but after yesterday's event I think I finally have a complete picture of what it is, and isn't.Salesforce1 is a platform and it's also the mobile app that replaces all the other mobile ways to interact with the Salesforce CRM system including Chatter. From an app perspective it pretty much does what you'd expect a mobile CRM app to do, so I'm going to focus on the platform capabilities for this post. The platform is built on top of the existing Force.com platform and provides an environment to the user that supports a catalog of API's and device agnostic app development and deployment. In one sense you could consider Salesforce1 a mobile apps dev and management platform, but that is only be part of the story. It really forms the basic of connecting across any device, person and application in a single environment.As a development platform it provides the capability to build and deploy device agnostic apps to employees, partners and customers. A couple of examples might make this easier to understand. The first example is an internal one. Using Salesforce1 a company could provide a custom field service app that pulled customer data and service ticket data from Salesforce and combine that with technical drawing stored in the companies PLM system, repair specifications (or videos) stored in the company knowledge base as well as integration into a work order management system (as well as any number of other functions from legacy or other enterprise cloud applications) inside the Salesforce1 app ""wrapper"". It's not limited to apps though, you could also integrate sensor data in real time from the ""thing"" that the field service rep was servicing so that it could be remotely monitored from the field service app. In other words any connected ""thing"" could be incorporated into the app and used / acted on. This opens up all sorts of use cases around Internet of Things (IoT) and even wearables like Google Glass or Samsung's Galaxy Gear watch. The second example is one that was presented yesterday at the tour event based on an actual customer story. The customer, Stanley Black and Decker used Salesforce1 to build a customer experience app for it's DeWalt tools brand. The mobile app is a companion to the tools and available to customers that purchase the brand. It connects to a peer to peer customer community and is also then, connected directly to DeWalt customer service. In the scenario that would shown at the event, the user of the tool experienced a problem, used the app to log a question in the community that was picked up by a customer service rep. The rep logged the issue in the Service Cloud, search the knowledge base for an answer and responded to the customer with information and eventually used a real time screen sharing experience with video to walk the user through the repair. To me, this is exactly the type of experience that companies need to think through, and using a platform like Salesforce1 could add significant value to an overall customer experience strategy though connected mobile apps that help the end customer interact with the brand and with the brand's customer community in real time.The platform also provides mobile app management capabilities including 1 click deployment for any mobile app. As we move more towards managing the mobile enterprise by focusing on apps over devices this type of functionality gains importance. Since it's almost impossible to manage to a specific device anymore, as employees feel empowered (and in many companies are empowered by bring you own device policies), managing enterprise access and security by the app will become the default."
2050903,23479,2014-02-26T14:08:59-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is expected to announce its fourth quarter and full fiscal 2014 earnings Thursday, February 27, after the close of markets. The company has a market capitalization of approximately $38 billion and is the global leader in both cloud-based and overall CRM deployments. In its prior three quarters, Salesforce recorded revenues of $2.93 billion at a 32% year-on-year growth rate. However, this impressive top line growth comes with a margin expense for the company. Gross margins for its subscriptions and support business declined to 81.3% in the three quarters in fiscal 2014, compared to 82.7% during a similar period last fiscal. The company’s professional services division, which accounted for roughly 6% of overall revenues in these three quarters, continues to operate with negative gross margins of -3.1%.On the whole, Salesforce’s aggressive top line growth strategy continues to pressure margins on all fronts, with non-GAAP operating margins dropping from 17% to 12% between CY09 – CY11. A favorable one-time tax item amounting to $149 million favorably expanded margins to 17.4% in CY12. In the nine months reported so far in CY13, Salesforce’s non-GAAP operating profit margin stands at 9.71%, compared to 11.24% from a similar period a year ago.In the three quarters concluded in fiscal 2014, GAAP operating margins stood at a much steeper -6.2% against -4.1% figure seen in a similar period in fiscal 2013. We are of the view that Salesforce’s growth strategy at the expense of negative margins is detrimental to the company’s business in the long term.Our price estimate stands at $50 for Salesforce, which is at a 21% discount to its current market price of $64 and reiterates our view despite the company’s impressive revenue growth.Focus On Newly Launched Salesforce1 PlatformSalesforce launched the ‘Salesforce1′ platform before the start of its annual Dreamforce conference in November 2013. This new offering is engineered to connect various apps and a multitude of devices across on a single platform and greatly increases mobility for sales representatives. Built on an API first philosophy, Sales cloud on Salesforce1 features additional API tools for developers to create and deploy enterprise-level applications across mobile devices. The platform has ten times more APIs than before on its Force.com development platform, with more than 1.4 million developers and more than 250 major independent software vendors (ISVs) working on the platform. The new 1 Touch service in the Salesforce1 Service cloud enables developers and ISVs, to build and embed service features into products and applications.Employees are increasingly using their own device for work, owing to this shift, Salesforce’s bet on a mobile CRM platform looks promising. Technology research firm, Gartner, expects the number of mobile CRM applications to increase from approximately 200 in 2012 to more than 1,200 by 2014. Moreover, the share of SaaS CRM deployments for certain types of applications is expected to cross 50% by 2016 from 40% in 2013, indicating the top line opportunity Salesforce has in the CRM industry. We expect to see a high single-digit sequential growth in subscription revenues, supported by strong traction in the the Salesforce1 platform.No Containment On Margin Pressure YetSalesforce’s operating margins have taken a plunge in the past four years, entering the negative territory at -1.5% in fiscal 2012 (ending January 2012). Since them, operating margins have deteriorated steadily to reach -6.2% in the three quarters this fiscal. Increasing competition in the niche cloud software market has forced Salesforce to ramp up on its R&D and SG&A expenses from 10% and 61% in fiscal 2010, to 15% and 67% in the three quarters in fiscal 2014 so far. Going forward, we expect to see further erosion in the company’s margins as legacy players such as SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) start offering their products on an SaaS model.We currently forecast Salesforce’s operating expenses as a percentage of Gross Profits to tread lower going into 2014 and beyond, and expect the company to post an operating profit by 2017.

2052083,23625,2014-02-26T18:12:28-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is set to report FQ4 2014 earnings after the market closes on Thursday, February 27th. Salesforce is a cloud based computing company best known for its customer relationship management (crm) product. Cloud computing is expecting to be a major area of economic growth within the next decade and Salesforce is currently ranked by Forbes as the #1 most innovative company. CRM shares have been on fire in 2014 and are up 16% through a period where most stocks sold off in January. This quarter investors have lofty revenue expectations for Salesforce.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see All Estimates for Salesforce)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for CRM to report 6c EPS and $1.129B revenue, while the current Estimize.com consensus from 41 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 7c EPS and $1.139B in revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting Salesforce to beat the Wall Street consensus by 1c EPS and $10million in revenue.Over the previous 6 quarters the consenus from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street in predicting Salesforce's revenue everytime and has been more accurate in forecasting EPS 3 times. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case we are seeing a larger differential for Salesforce.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from 4c to 10c EPS and $1.120B to $1.180B in revenues. This quarter we're seeing a wide distribution of estimates for Salesforce.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A wider distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market, which could mean greater volatility post earnings.Over the past 4 months the Wall Street EPS consensus remained flat at 6c while the Estimize.com consensus inched higher from 6c to 7c. Over the same period of time the Wall Street revenue consensus increased from $1.113B to $1.129B while the Estimize consensus rose from $1.134B to $1.139B. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and upward analyst revisions at the very end of the quarter are often a bullish indicator.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is TechStockRadar, who projects 7c EPS and $1.135B in revenue. This season TechStockRadar touts an impressive record of being more accurate than Wall Street on EPS and revenue 71% and 67% of the time respectively. In the Winter 2014 season TechStockRadar is rated as the 6th best analyst and is ranked 16th overall among over 3,900 contributing analysts. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case TechStockRadar is expecting Salesforce to match the Estimize consensus on EPS but come report between Estimize and the Street on revenue.This quarter CRM is expected to report all time revenue to the tune of 35% growth compared to FQ4 last year. Cloud computing is expected to be a major area of growth in the near future and Salesforce in a leader in cloud computing applications. On Thursday contributing analysts on the Estimize.com platfrom are expecting Salesforce to continue its momentum and beat Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom line.Disclosure: None"
1875901,24491,2013-12-04T01:52:23-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), one of the largest firms in enterprise cloud computing, reported excellent fiscal 2014 third quarter results. Revenue surged 36% year-over-year, while deferred revenue expansion largely kept pace (up 34% year-over-year). Unbilled deferred revenue, or business that is contracted but unbilled and off balance sheet, was $4.2 billion, up 40% from the same period a year-ago. Though non-GAAP earnings per share came in at a meager $0.09 during the period, the firm posted operating cash flow of $138 million, which was up 30% on a year-over-year basis. Capital expenditures jumped to $74 million from $51 million in the year-ago period, resulting in free cash flow of $64 million (or about 6% of sales). Salesforce.com ended the quarter with $1.09 billion in total cash and marketable securities.Looking ahead, the firm raised its full fiscal 2014 top-line guidance $30 million to the range of $4.05-$4.055 billion (an increase of 33% year-over-year) and narrowed its diluted non-GAAP earnings per share target to the range of $0.33-$0.34 (was $0.32-$0.34). Our top-line forecast is slightly better than the updated range, while our fiscal non-GAAP 2014 bottom-line estimate remains $0.34 per share (as presented in our 16-page report). Salesforce.com issued full-year 2015 guidance in the range of $5.15-$5.2 billion, up more than 28% at the high end of both respective annual ranges. The 2015 target was slightly lower than our forecast of $5.23 billion for the fiscal year, but we wouldn't be surprised if Salesforce.com raises its fiscal 2015 guidance to our number in coming periods. In any case, Salesforce.com was very proud to note that it is going to be the first enterprise cloud company to deliver more than $5 billion in revenue next year.Valuentum's TakeSalesforce.com is trading at nosebleed multiples on a non-GAAP earnings basis, but the company continues to generate solid operating cash flow. We continue to be encouraged by the pace of the firm's top-line expansion and its implications on the health of enterprise spending, particularly for cloud services. We'll be monitoring the company closely in coming periods, but we're not rushing to add shares to our Best Ideas portfolio; they continue to trade within our fair value range (at the time of this writing).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2038093,23469,2014-02-21T01:50:23-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is a great example of a company that is an excellent company with great products. Yet, we see the company as a sub-par investment with just under 10% upside in 2014. To examine any investment, one must first examine the company -- obviously. Yet, what many investors do not realize is that great companies do not always make great investments, while some companies that have significant flaws or current issues are great investments. It is all about the balance of valuations to growth, risks, and projections.In this article, we will focus on the positive catalysts for the business in transaction growth as well as the main catalyst of Salesforce1. Yet, we will also price the company based on five-year projections. We came into the day with a Hold-rating, and we see still see the company as a Hold-rating with $72 price target for the year.Business OverviewSalesforce is a global cloud computing company. It is best known for its customer relationship management products. Salesforce has also entered into social enterprise arena through acquisition. Salesforce.com is focused on platform-as-a-service (PAAS) with five main businesses - Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud, the ExactTarget Marketing Cloud, and Salesforce1. PAAS is the growing part of the cloud computing industry as platforms continue to become an interesting part of the business experience over infrastructures and software. PAAS is expected to be the largest part of the industry moving forward.Salesforce has built a great platform that allows for customers to build social front offices that use both social and mobile cloud-based technologies. CRM's revenue is made from subscriptions as well as support. These two parts of the business make up 93% of total revenue. CRM's ""customer"" approach as a platform is a very unique competitive advantage.Main CatalystAt Salesforce.com, the best-selling and top product for the company has long been the Salescloud. Moving forward, though, CRM is redefining its business, and we believe that one new development is going to take CRM into the future. As we have seen with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) before them, mobile and tablets are the way of the future for the tech world. CRM has built themselves as a platform-as-a-service that combines software, infrastructure, and customer service into one product. Yet, as the world moves away from desktops and notebooks to phones and tablets, it is important that CRM be able to maintain its perch as the top customer service cloud company.Salesforce1 is the platform for mobile that can link the CRM business across its sales cloud, service cloud, chatter, etc. It's nearly a platform within a platform, and we believe it reinvigorates the company. Here is Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff talking about the launch of Salesforce1:Most businesses realize that mobile, table, and the ""internet of everything"" are coming strong, and we believe that this move is excellent for the company moving forward. One of the neatest features is the multi-channel experience. For example, agents on Chatter can escalate a case to experts. The Chatter feed is integrated with the Service Cloud through Salesforce1, which could be on your desktop or mobile platform. Other features of Salesforce1 include the building of mobile apps, employment apps, and connect devices. As Cisco pushes for the ""Internet of Everything,"" CRM is building the customer-service experience for companies to link your fridge to the company or your watch to the watchmaker.The results, thus far, have been very solid, according to the company. We are quite very bullish on this strategy as well, and we believe it really is the future of both the company and CRM. Not only has Salesforce built unique products on its cloud platform, but it is now integrating them on multiple channels, which is very attractive. The potential for the product, and the company moving forward are very enticing. According to The Street:Salesforce1 is at the core of this. Businesses are starting to realize that the mobile revolution is something they will have to be a part of as that market continues to grow, and CRM appears to have crafted another top-notch product that can leverage their other products further.One of the difficulties in the cloud is forming an economic moat. In SaaS, there are obvious software differences, but it's less difficult to build alike software. In IaaS, the economic moats are very small as we are seeing a price war commoditizing servers and cloud storage. Yet, CRM has taken the cloud and build an appealing platform that links software with storage with customer service, building some insulation around their business, which is only furthered by this product.We will cover more of direct numbers in our price target analysis section below.Secondary CatalystOne of the best aspects of CRM is that in addition to their attractive Salesforce1 product, the company has other attractive features that we believe can lead to future growth as well. One of the biggest benefits to the company is the type of transactions and the value of the product that we are seeing from customers using the product. John Mylant did a great job of describing this catalyst:Basically, Mylant is discussing that the rate of transactions is growing for CRM, but that the rate of API calls is also growing, meaning that customers that use the service are using it often and that rate is also growing. As customers become more dependent on the platform, they will want to use it longer as well as use more features. At the same time, CRM is not satisfied. They continue to develop more services for these clients, and that brings them more customization, API calls, and revenue!This success can also be seen an attrition rate that continues to decline every quarter and is expected to drop to less than 10% in 2014.Loyalty as well as building an economic moat is building a business that can be successful for the long-term, and that is what CRM appears to be doing right now, which attracts us to them fundamentally. Yet, every great investor knows a great business is not always a great investment if the market is not correctly pricing the company. Therefore, in our next section we need to determine the appropriate pricing.Projections/Price TargetComing into today, we had a price tag for CRM at $42, but we last presented that price tag in mid-2013. We are now forecasting on a five-year projection through 2018 in our Oxen Group Pricing Model. Here are the numbers we are using in our projection:Revenue - The company has predicted around $4B-$4.1B in revenue for 2014. Revenue growth has been strong, and we obviously believe that it will remain that way. In constant currency in the latest quarter, Americas revenue grew 41%, Europe grew 39%, and Asia grew 17%. We expect them to be able to grow to $5.2B in 2015 as we believe the company is just scratching the surface to their potential as we highlighted earlier in the article. From there, we will use a conservative 22% CAGR growth rate through 2018 to reach about $9.5B in revenue in 2018. Comps grow harder each year, thus the decline in CAGR. Yet, the company has about $6B of deferred revenues and revenues that are to be invoiced, giving us a lot of confidence in their ability to grow revenues moving forward.Margins - The company has had negative operating margins for the most part due to high SG&A mostly due to acquisitions and lots of spending to develop their business through R&D and hiring a lot of the best names in the business. Yet, we believe that the company will start to see positive operating margins exist in 2015. On a non-GAAP basis, though, the company has been operating around a 9% operating margin. We use GAAP rates in our model, and we expect the company to see a flat operating margin this year before moving to around 4-5% margins before getting to the 8-10% range by 2016-2018. Stock-based compensation will fall as a % of sales over time as well as large SG&A upfront expenses.Capital Expenditures - We believe these numbers will remain large around 6-7% for the next couple years as a part of revenue. The company is in a high-acquisition-based business that requires buying both vertically and horizontally to keep pace. Yet, the company may seem some slow down as a percentage of sales as the rate of sales increases in comparison to CapEx. We have never seen CapEx over $350B even in high acquisition years. We estimate fluctuations, and therefore used a flat rate of $275B moving forward.Taxes - Since 2008, the tax rate is around 30% to 40%, so we assume 32% over the next several years.Shares Outstanding - The company has 603M shares outstanding.Using our cash flow model and these numbers, we have come up with a 2014 price target of $72. We were disappointed to see this number as we believe this is a great company, but we used the best case in nearly every scenario. Profitability increases, CapEx levels off, taxes are low, and the company grows at outstanding rates. While we are confident in this, what this means to us is that as an investment at this time, CRM is a Hold. Hold onto it if you have it, but we should wait for a pullback to add new positions. For those that believe that you can't value a growth name, we used a 1.5% cap rate in our model, which is nearly not even discounting all future growth in the company.ConclusionAs we look closely at CRM, we see a fascinating business that is glowing with opportunity. A company we fundamentally like very much. As we look at valuing the company's equity worth, we see a limited upside picture. Momentum can continue to carry this name for some time, but at some point, CRM will have to work off its more than 10x price/sales and over 100x future PE ratios. We like buying on a dip to below $60 to start a new position.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Business relationship disclosure: I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

2006291,48501,2014-02-09T05:29:53-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is the world's largest provider of customer relationship management software. CRM generates most of its revenue from subscription and support fees. But a portion of revenue is generated from professional services. CRM is still in the growth phase and is set to report its latest quarterly and annual results later this quarter.Fiscal 2014 revenue is forecasted to be in the $4.05-$4.055B range with a GAAP EPS in the range of ($0.45) to ($0.44). Fourth quarter revenue is projected to be in the $1.124B to $1.129B range, which is a 35% y/y increase; the GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in the range of ($0.25) to ($0.24). Also, CRM is forecasting FY15 revenue of $5.15-$5.20B, which would be about 28% above FY14 revenue.The company's products expansion into marketing, service and platform could drive double digits revenue growth over the coming 3 years to 5 years. Also, there is plenty of room for international expansion. But CRM is priced to perfection. There is substantial scope for a share price decline of 9% to 25%, from the $61.60 per share level, following the release of fiscal fourth quarter results. To be fair, the share price could rise to $72, following the report.Recent DevelopmentsBusiness SummarySalesforce.com is a provider of enterprise cloud computing services. CRM is dedicated to helping customers of all sizes and industries worldwide transform themselves into ""customer companies"" by empowering them to connect with their customers, partners, employees and products in entirely new ways. CRM provides customers with the solutions they need to build a next generation social front office with social and mobile cloud technologies. Most of CRM's revenue is generated from subscription and support with professional services and other comprising about 7% of revenue.Total revenues during the fiscal third quarter increased to $1.08B with 91.7% of the increase, relative to the year-ago quarter, attributable to the increase in revenue from subscription and support. The percentage of total revenues attributable to subscription and support declined from 94% to 93%. Total cost of revenue increased 751 basis points faster than total revenue, and the gross profit margin declined from 76.4% to 75.1%. CRM increased the relative investment in R&D. The loss from operations, which is before non-operating income and expenses, grew from 7% of total revenues to 9% of total revenues. But the loss per diluted share decreased as a result of a substantial decrease in the provision for income taxes.The income statement was adjusted for company lifecycle stage. Net income during 2012's fiscal third quarter would have been $246.1M, which would have increased to $314M during fiscal Q3 2013. Earnings per share would have increased from $0.43 to $0.52. Net income would have increased 27.6%, and earnings per share would have increased 20.9%. Adjusted net income could exceed $500M in the fiscal third quarter of 2016.The liquidity is ample and the solvency position is durable. The cash ratio, omitting the current portion of deferred revenue, was 0.50, at the end of the fiscal third quarter. The current ratio, excluding the current portion of deferred revenue, was 1.28. Total debt to equity was 0.54, and financial leverage was 2.78. The tangible book value remained negative and was a reported $-582.7M. CRM will probably rebuild its cash balance in the coming quarters, in my opinion, which would increase tangible book value.The key cash flow measures increased in fiscal Q3 2013, relative to the year-ago period. Cash flow from operations increased 30%, but capital expenditure increased 42%. Free cash flow to the firm increased 35% to $82.9M, and free cash flow to equity increased 5% to $57.7M as $7.5M of debt was repaid during the most recent quarter. The growth rates are considered relatively sustainable in the near term.To be best of my knowledge, CRM is the only major corporation that is known as ""The Customer Company."" For example, Oracle Corporation is known for its databases. I think that provides CRM with a competitive advantage and consequently reduces the risk premium that I charge. CRM should be able to generate earnings of more than $0.41 per share during the next twelve months; that assumption adjusts forecasted EPS to account for the company's lifecycle stage.RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in CRM.Portfolio & ValuationCRM is in a bull market of primary and intermediate degree. Right now, the share price is making a new minor high for the uptrend as it re-tests the $61.50 level. At this point, I would have to forecast a continuation of the uptrend with potential resistance coming in at $65 per share.There isn't much of a diversification benefit from investing in CRM. While the correlation with the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) has declined recently, since 2013 the correlation is 0.80. Since 2009, the correlation is 0.96.It follows that variations in the price of the broader market explain a substantial amount of the variations of CRM. Since 2009, 91% of CRM's price variations are explained by the variations in the price of S&P 500. Since 2011, 64% of the variations of CRM are explained by the variations of the broader market. Currently, forecasts for CRM should include forecasts for the broader market.CRM is trading above trend. The 3-months, 6-months, and 12-months price targets are $55.19, $57.33, and $61.62. The current share price is $61.70. Thus, CRM could face a bout of short-term profit taking.Based on the fundamentals of the company, it should be trading at a premium to the market, on a price/book value basis. But at 12.7 times book value relative to the market's 2.6 times book value pricing, CRM is overvalued, in my opinion. In my model $46.56 per share is the distribution level with the intrinsic value of CRM being $32 per share. To be fair, I can understand why the market is pricing the company at $61.60 per share, but those assumptions are too aggressive for me, at this point. Granted, CRM is in the ""aggressive growth"" category.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Salesforce.com issued full-year 2015 guidance in the range of $5.15-$5.2 billion, up more than 28% at the high end of both respective annual ranges. The 2015 target was slightly lower than our forecast of $5.23 billion for the fiscal year, but we wouldn't be surprised if Salesforce.com raises its fiscal 2015 guidance to our number in coming periods. In any case, Salesforce.com was very proud to note that it is going to be the first enterprise cloud company to deliver more than $5 billion in revenue next year.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital - ROIC - with its weighted average cost of capital - WACC. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Salesforce.com's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 20.9%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Salesforce.com's free cash flow margin has averaged about 20.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Salesforce.com, cash flow from operations increased about 61% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 99% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisThe estimated fair value for Salesforce.com is $49 per share. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 28.2% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 32.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 9.8%, which is above Salesforce.com's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 17.5% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Salesforce.com, we use a 10.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $49 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Salesforce.com. We think the firm is attractive below $34 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $64 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Salesforce.com's fair value at this point in time to be about $49 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Salesforce.com's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $67 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $49 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The big player is Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) with a 14% market share, followed by SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM).The top ten fastest growing CRM vendors included only one of the largest players - IBM - which grew at 39% in 2012 to reach $649 million in revenues according to the Gartner data.On September 30, 2013 SYNNEX acquired IBM's CRM Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) unit for $505 million. The unit had sales of $1.2 billion and generated $120 million of EBITDA according to the release. If we are talking about the same IBM unit, the growth rate of 39% must have accelerated for it to be a $1.2 billion business 9 months after the end of 2012, but perhaps the two data points are not precisely similar. Regardless, it is pretty clear the IBM CRM business was both profitable and growing very quickly.What is wrong with this picture?SYNNEX pays $505 million for a $1.2 billion CRM business growing at a blistering pace and earning EBITDA at about 10% of revenues. The market puts a value on Salesforce.com of $37 billion for a business only three times larger than the IBM unit growing at a 25% pace and not earning anything to speak of. I may have it completely wrong, but either the CRM business unit of IBM reported by Gartner and the one sold to SYNNEX are different things or the gap in valuation between the market's valuation of Salesforce.com and what SYNNEX paid IBM for its unit is incomprehensibly wide.I think the units are comparable, and while it seems SYNNEX paid a pretty good price to IBM for this business unit, the market's valuation of Saleforce.com is so far out of the ballpark of reality so as to deny sensibility.IBM is not managed by fools. They sold this business no doubt because it did not meet their strategic vision for the future of IBM. They got a price from an arm's length sophisticated buyer after what could only have been a professional negotiation by informed parties.The market valuation of Salesforce.com does not reflect such a negotiation. Instead it is a highly hyped momentum play led by a charismatic leader who sells his own stock into the market at what seems like every opportunity followed closely by his senior management team who play the same game, and then tell shareholders the ""stock based compensation"" expense (that is, the gains they are making at the expense of all other shareholders suffering dilution from the exercise) should be ""added back"" as an ""adjustment"" to come up with the earnings shareholders should use in putting a value on the stock.Yahoo.com Finance reports that Salesforce.com insiders sold about $50 million worth of stock in the past 6 months, likely garnering more than the company will earn this quarter. But one insider did buy 200 shares. A contrarian I guess.Salesforce.com is overvalued by a country mile. Investors who have bid the stock to a lofty $37 billion market value have only themselves to blame if it craters but those analysts who pile on with BUY or OUTPERFORM ratings should be held accountable for aiding and abetting when the chickens come home to roost.I am short the stock.Disclosure: I am short CRM.

1901861,24157,2013-12-17T09:15:00-05:00,,"Check out this week's Danger Zone Interview with Chuck Jaffe of Money Life and MarketWatch.com.Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is in the Danger Zone this week. The cloud-based customer relationship management provider has helped pioneer the software as a service (NASDAQ:SAAS) model, but the first-mover advantage can be short lived. CRM differentiated its services by delivering them through the cloud, but as other companies develop their own cloud platforms, CRM will be hard pressed to continue its spectacular growth. CRM's strategy of acquisitions to grow revenue at the expense of profits raises questions over whether the company can achieve the profit margins necessary to support its expensive valuation.Acquisition Strategy Hurts Profits And Strains the Balance SheetCRM has spent aggressively on acquisitions in recent years, including a $2.6 billion purchase of ExactTarget, a provider of digital marketing software, this past July. These acquisitions have kept the top line growing at the expense of profitability.CRM's cash operating profits (NOPAT) had been growing at an accelerating rate until 2011, when the company's growth strategy shifted its focus to acquisitions and revenue growth. Over the next three years, the company spent (in millions) approximately $400, $420, and $580 respectively. As Figure 1 shows, these acquisitions have been good for revenue but bad for NOPAT.Figure 1: Revenue vs. NOPATSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsThe ExactTarget acquisition appears to continue this pattern. In 3Q13, ExactTarget added roughly $81 million to revenue (accounting for 28% of CRM's year over year revenue growth) and lost about $68 million (accounting for 55% of CRM's reported pre-tax loss for the quarter).While CRM has managed these acquisitions without overly straining its finances so far, the balance sheet is beginning to swell. At the end of its most recent fiscal year CRM had over $2.3 billion in adjusted total debt, which includes $1.1 billion in off-balance sheet debt due to operating leases. That number has increased significantly in 2013, as CRM took on an additional $1.9 billion in debt and capital lease obligations. At the end of 2010, the company had under $780 million in total debt.Salesforce is competing with giant companies like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) in the CRM industry. If it tries to outspend those companies it will have to run up even more serious debt or dilute equity holders. Oracle recently bought Big Machines, a company that Salesforce had previously invested in.Buying up smaller companies to hit revenue targets and keep the stock price up is nothing new. Recent Danger Zone calls Tangoe (TNGO) and InnerWorkings (NASDAQ:INWK) followed the same strategy. Those two stocks are down 37% and 29% since I put them in the Danger Zone.Competition Limits GrowthCRM helped pioneer the SaaS model, which allowed it to deliver business applications and software to customers in a new, more efficient manner. In many ways, CRM has a great deal in common with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). NFLX pioneered a new way of delivering content to consumers, but the barriers to entry were not enough to keep Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Hulu, and others from following in their footsteps. To protect its market share, NFLX has had to keep its margins low and attempt to differentiate with original content, which threatens to further erode its already thin margins because it is so much more expensive than the used content NFLX peddles now.Similarly, CRM helped popularize the SaaS model both through its own software and its mobile app development platform. Long term, I don't see any more value in the cloud platform for CRM than I do the streaming delivery system for NFLX. Once competitors can replicate the delivery system, the only differentiation becomes the content being delivered. CRM now has to rely on offering superior quality products, and while its current offerings still beat the competition, there's no guarantee that it will hold on to that top spot in the future. Companies like ORCL or SAP could leverage their existing franchises and large installed bases of customers to create a competitive product, or smaller companies like SugarCRM could succeed through the open source software development model.As of 2012 Salesforce had a 14% market share in the global CRM industry, which made it the industry leader. However, SAP and Oracle still have double-digit market shares, and small, fast growing companies like Sugar CRM and Zoho make up almost 40% of the market. As the market leader, Salesforce is in an enviable position, but there are too many competitors for it to achieve the market domination that its stock price implies.Priced For PerfectionSalesforce could absolutely grow into a profitable company in the future. After all, it does have the largest market share and most advanced set of products in a rapidly growing industry. However, the massive revenue growth and margin expansion that its stock price predicts seems unlikely.CRM's current valuation of ~$51/share implies 30% compounded annual growth in revenue for 13 years with an average pre-tax margin of 7.5%. Under that scenario, CRM would have $95 billion in revenue in 13 years, which is about how much IBM generates today.Even if we give CRM credit for more significant margin expansion, the required revenue growth is still staggering. If CRM's pre-tax margin expands to 15 percent, the company would still need to grow revenue by 20% compounded annually for 15 years, at which point its annual revenue would be $55 billion, or around what Intel generates today.Simply put, a $30 billion market cap for a company with negative profits does not make sense. There are too many competitors out there for CRM to grow revenue and expand margins simultaneously to the extent that the market valuation already implies. Too much downside risk is in this stock.Insiders SellingOver the past six months insiders have sold roughly 900,000 shares and bought a grand total of 200. Large portions of these insider transactions have been sales by management. Perhaps management is not as confident in the future of CRM as it would have us believe.900,000 shares only represents 0.5% of the shares held by insiders, but the trend is still clearly towards selling rather than buying. Additionally, the amount of options exercised doubled from 2012 to 2013, with 5 million shares being exercised in 2013. Insiders don't appear to see much more upside to the stock at its current valuation.Avoid These FundsInvestors should avoid the following ETFs and mutual funds due to their 6+% allocation to CRM and Dangerous-or-worse rating.Sam McBride contributed to this article.Disclosure: David Trainer and Sam McBride receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, sector, or theme.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1928781,53422,2014-01-06T00:56:26-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is a high-growth cloud computing company and has been ranked by Forbes as the world's most innovative company with 12-month sales growth rate surpassing the 30% mark. Salesforce.com is a darling in the investor community: High growth rates, an extensive acquisitions record and the sexy business segment cloud computing have led to a premium valuation similar to the valuations witnessed during the dotcom years. However, I believe such multiples reflect extraordinary risk for investors particularly when considering Salesforce.com's negative earnings record and projections.Shares of Salesforce.com have risen 30% over the last twelve month. The company has the second best peer group performance after Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) which gained 56%.High revenue- and operating cash flow growth have led Salesforce.com's shares gradually higher over the last two years. Salesforce.com gained 118% while Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) returned 40%, SAP (NYSE:SAP) 56% and Adobe Systems 106%.Free cash flow multipleSalesforce.com has had some decent operating cash flow growth over the last years (see table below). Salesforce.com has achieved OCF growth way north of 20% per annum and I expect those rates to persist at least in 2014 and 2015. I estimate that Salesforce.com manages to achieve $1.2 billion in operating cash flow in 2015 (that is, the financial year ending January 2015). With investing cash outflows normalizing and returning to historical levels, I estimate that Salesforce.com achieves a meaningful turnaround in free cash flow to equity to $333.5 million or $0.56 FCFE per share. This translates to an approximately 1% free cash flow yield and a still massively inflated forward P/FCFE multiple of 98.Peer group comparisonThe free cash flow valuation from above, which implies quite optimistic assumptions about FCFE growth, indicates that the company trades at extreme cash flow multiples. Not surprisingly, Salesforce.com's forward P/E ratio is just as high. With a P/E ratio of 110.24 Salesforce.com's investors have to shell out a massive growth premium upfront. Other companies such as Oracle, SAP and Adobe Systems trade at meaningfully lower earnings and sales multiples.The next two charts display the forward P/E and P/S ratios for the peer group as well as the peer group average including and excluding the distorting metrics for Salesforce.com.A summary table with valuation metrics as well as Salesforce.com's extraordinary premiums to peer group average P/E and P/S ratios are shown below:SummaryInvestors purchasing Salesforce.com pay a massive upfront growth premium that makes a purchase extraordinarily risky. The free cash flow to equity projections from above indicate that Salesforce.com trades at a massive 98 times forward free cash flow to equity even though the projected turnaround in free cash flow is quite optimistic. The forward P/E ratio of Salesforce.com stands at 110 which shows that investors are overly willing to pay a growth premium. With an earnings and cash flow multiple of around 100, Salesforce.com is in good company with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) which also trade at similar multiples (and also have negative earnings records). Growth expectations are already so high, that the company will disappoint at some point and realign investor expectations with reality. Salesforce.com is among a set of much hyped, high-growth companies that trade at extreme multiples but aren't convincing on the earnings front: Salesforce.com's 2013 nine month net loss came in at $0.19 per diluted share. FY 2012 and 2013 (financial year ending January 2012 and January 2013) also produced negative earnings of $0.09 and $1.92 per diluted share. Investors should stay away.Disclosure: I am short AMZN.

Many CRM companies are expecting strong growth. But this rising revenue is not necessarily turning into profits.Salesforce’s FinancialsLast week, CRM services provider, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported a stellar quarter, with revenues crossing the billion-dollar milestone for the first time ever. Q3 revenues grew 36% over the year to $1.08 billion, ahead of the market’s projections of $1.06. Revenue growth was attributed to the acquisition of ExactTarget. Adjusted EPS of $0.09 was in line with market expectations. Salesforce continued to report losses on a GAAP basis and ended the quarter with a loss of $0.21 per share.During the quarter, revenues from Subscription and Support grew 36% over the year to $1 billion and revenues from Professional Services and Other segment increased 50% to $71.6 million. By region, revenues from the Americas grew 41%. Europe and Asia revenues grew 46% and 4%, respectively.For the current quarter, Salesforce projects revenues of $1.12-$1.13 billion, compared with the Street’s forecast of $1.12 billion. It projected EPS of $0.05-$0.06 which fell short of the market’s projections of $0.07. Salesforce expects to end the year with revenues of $4.05 billion-$4.055 billion and non-GAAP net loss of $0.33-$0.34 per share. The market was looking for revenues of $4.03 billion and a loss of $0.34 per share. Salesforce expects to end the next year with revenues of more than $5.15 billion-$5.20 billion.Salesforce’s Growing Product OfferingsSalesforce continues to expand its market presence through tie-ups and product expansions. Earlier last quarter, it entered into an agreement with Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) to integrate its apps to help customers improve performance analysis, identify trends in customer relationships, and make informed decisions using financial and operational performance data. Recently, it also entered into an agreement with Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) to develop and sell a new computing product for enterprise customers, the Superpod. Superpod is a dedicated Salesforce instance which is available within the Salesforce data center and will run on HP’s infrastructure.Recently, it also released a new platform for its mobile segment called Salesforce1. Salesforce1 is a CRM platform for developers and software vendors who are focused on mobile apps. Through the platform, Salesforce’s developer customers will be able to customize services for smartphones and tablets and applications developers will also be able to use new tools available on the platform.Salesforce does have a strong product portfolio and is seeing impressive revenue growth. The company’s biggest concern, though, remains profitability. Last quarter, operating losses grew 81% to $98 million, primarily attributed to the more than 38% growth in payroll costs due to the several acquisitions discussed above. But for now, management is not looking to significantly improve margins. During the recent quarterly results announcement, CEO Mark Benioff said that the goal was to increase margins, but they also want to grow as Salesforce continues to reinvest its earnings to expand market share. In the long run, Salesforce wants to earn revenues of more than $10 billion per year.As I said earlier, Salesforce needs to execute its platform strategy effectively. That is one of the keys to effectively impact the long-term profitability for the company.For now, the stock is trading at $52.71 with a market capitalization of $31.65 billion. It touched an all-time high of $58.37 earlier this month.Disclosure: No positions"
1873971,39031,2013-12-03T12:27:33-05:00,,"A smidgen of negative sentiment has crept into the Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) share price since their earnings report on 11/18. Here is an excerpt from CRM's earnings press release:It is within these two small paragraphs where we believe the dirty little secrets about CRM are buried. Several fellow SA contributors, including Michael Blair, Illuminati Investments and Jay Schembs have done an admirable job in pointing out the bearish case for CRM. We want to put a spotlight on the man-made gems that CRM produces that is currently their most important and profitable product. You won't find it in any of their products' marketing materials. And yet without it, CRM would have very little cash because as they themselves acknowledge in the above paragraph, they have no GAAP earnings. What is this lucrative item CRM produces in the same way Central Banks print currency? It is the issuance of insider stock options which, upon exercising, brings fresh cash proceeds into the CRM coffers and in most cases into the insiders' pockets as well. This practice is highlighted in the release above in this excerpt:Here is a snapshot going back only to May 24th (the full year would have taken too much space) of the SEC filings where CRM's Form 4s (insider transactions) are filed: (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)In a tribute to the saying that a 'picture speaks a thousand words', we think the snapshots above give investors the general theme of what's going on at CRM. We did a tally of the last year's insider sales based on Form 4s tracked by SECFORM4.com which showed a total of 301 insider transactions providing $85,572,881.606 in net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options in CRM shares reported to the SEC November 26th, 2012. Incidentally, the reason the pennies are fractional is CRM has issued a bevy of stock option grants struck at a $.001 exercise price. But this only tells part of the story. The last three 10Qs filed by the company for the quarters ending April '13, July'13 and October'13 show an aggregate of $217,429,000 in proceeds to CRM from exercising options from ""Proceeds from employee stock plans"". In addition, the last three reports show another $84,800,000 coming to CRM in the April'13 10Q from ""Proceeds from issuance of warrants"". But this type of activity is nothing new to Salesforce as we can see from this excerpt from the latest 10K filed with the SEC for their fiscal year ending January 31st, 2013 ( in millions for 2013,2012,2011 respectively): (Click to enlarge)As you can see below in the latest quarter, cash also went down, short term marketable securities went down, accounts receivable went down, all simultaneously and probably not as much as they should have, given the large ExactTarget acquisition we delve into with more detail below. And meanwhile, insiders and other large shareholders furiously exercised stock options and subsequently sold the underlying stock bringing in millions in new equity into CRM's balance sheet which is tax free cash inflow for CRM. In addition, CRM issued new Convertible Senior Notes in March 2013 as described in this footnote from the April 2013 10Q SEC filing.Taking a look at the CRM balance sheet shows a picture that does not bode well for CRM's business model. Here is a snapshot from their latest SEC 10Q reporting October 31, 2013 numbers (spooky things happen on Halloween):  (Click to enlarge)The cash balance at the end of April according to the same April 2013 SEC filing was as follows:  (Click to enlarge)Total cash and short term securities above are (in millions) $1,927,990 and $171,827 respectively totaling $2,099,817. This cash plus $300 million CRM raised in term debt in the quarter totals approximately $2.4 billion. With the $2.4 billion cash balance, how did CRM fund the $2.6 billion acquisition of ExactTarget, Inc. in July as depicted below from their July 2013 10Q: (Click to enlarge)The bigger question here is how does CRM end the July 2013 Quarter with the following cash, marketable securities, accounts payables and other fluctuating categories which we have highlighted with arrows below, given they have no real GAAP earnings as they explained in the excerpts from their earnings release quoted in our first paragraph: (Click to enlarge)Two more points to the mysterious category balances and transactions we have described above:1. The insiders' transactions noted above do not include a sale of securities under an SEC S-3 filing dated June 12th 2013 whose participants are shareholders from Silicon Valley, who read like a who's who in the VC world. What do they know that we don't? Here's an excerpt from the S-3 filing: (Click to enlarge)2. We conclude with our recommendation to STAY FAR AWAY FROM CRM SHARES unless you are considering taking a short position like that of Adam Shepherd, as an excerpt from a recent SA market currents update points out:If we were personal wealth managers at an investment bank, we would certainly print out the list of CRM insiders who have sold tens of millions of dollars worth of CRM's newly minted stock and woo them as customers. As a venerable investment banker told us recently about the current frothy market conditions, ""The circus is definitely in town, so we are doing our utmost to sell plenty of popcorn at the show."" In the meantime, maybe investors should ""borrow"" some of that ""popcorn"" and sell it as well.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours.

We contacted Salesforce.com to comment on the concerning trends highlighted in our article. We did not receive the courtesy of a reply. However the company did issue another press release after our request at 4:05 PM on Friday November 29th titled ""Salesforce.com Grants Equity Awards Under Its Inducement Equity Incentive Plan"". This may foreshadow that this practice will continue well into the future."
1800092,48501,2013-11-03T04:22:48-05:00,,"The last time I published an article about salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), I was forecasting a 30% share price increase. At its recent peak, salesforce.com increased about 28.5% since that time; currently the share price is up over 20% since that time. Twenty plus percent in two months is not a bad return. But now it is time to revisit salesforce.com and see what I should think about this company.To be clear, I discovered some positives and some negatives, and the negatives outweigh the positives. The ExactTarget acquisition made goodwill larger than shareholders' equity; consequently, I think the write down risk is substantial. Also, I have concerns about a privacy backlash stemming from intrusive marketeers gathering information from social media websites, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations. Those are the negatives.To expand on the privacy concerns statement, salesforce.com, according to its management team, plans to empower its customers with the ability to use people's social media posts to find out what is going on in their life and consequently be able to market products based on the social media disclosures. For instance, if I post on Facebook about my dog being ill, I would be targeted with dog wellness products. Personally I think there are too many instances where this type of marketing would cross lines that should not be crossed, privacy wise.CRM Price to Tangible Book Value data by YChartsOn the other hand, the growth rate is above 20% and the company has strategic partnerships with several technology firms, including but not limited to Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY).With that said, the write down risk is too substantial for me to risk long capital. But I would not short sell salesforce.com right now.Recent DevelopmentsFinancial Statements & ValuationsSalesforce.com has shown solid revenue growth with a gross margin over 75%.Excluding the impact of the ExactTarget acquisition, revenue would have grown 5.4% sequentially in the quarter ending July 2013 and 28.6% over the year-ago quarter.CRM Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsIncluding the ExactTarget acquisition, fiscal second quarter revenue was at the midpoint of my forecast.As a result, I'm maintaining my fiscal 2014 revenue forecast of $3.87-$4.12 billion, which is roughly inline with management's expectations.For fiscal 2015, I am predicting revenue of $4.8 billion, which is 20% higher than $4 billion; I'm expecting the growth rate to slow in fiscal 2015.I would like to see deferred revenue at the end of fiscal 2014 above $2.1 billion. At the end of fiscal 2015, I would like to see deferred revenue above $2.42 billion.The cash flow from operations growth rate since the end of fiscal 2009 has been impressive and inline with revenue and industry growth.On the other hand, management employed financial leverage while making strategic acquisitions and consequently leveraged the write down risk. I'm not impressed. The cash balance needs to grow to over $2 billion and/or total debt needs to decline.I refuse to consider taking a long position in salesforce.com while the write down risk remains significant.At the end of the July quarter, goodwill was 24% larger than total shareholders' equity.If I adjust the valuations for forecasted financial performance, salesforce.com is undervalued relative to its 5-year average valuations. On an absolute basis, salesforce.com is overvalued. On a time-series basis, salesforce.com is overvalued. Consequently, salesforce.com is overvalued.Portfolio ManagementAt this point, I know that salesforce.com is not a good long candidate. But following up on my previous thought of it being a long candidate, I will do some of the portfolio management work.CRM data by YChartsSalesforce.com is in a bull market of intermediate degree as part of a bull market of primary degree. The intermediate term bull market could be nearing an end; as a result, this is a solid point to exit long positions.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

As organizations are shifting from the traditional pen and paper approach to digitization, enterprise software companies are the ones benefiting the most from this evolution.Usually growth stocks are expensive because investors are willing to pay a premium to invest in their future.Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is one of the leaders of the enterprise software industry. During the last five years, the company's stock has realized a gain in the price of around 700% whereas in 2013 the stock gained 25.28%. Although the gain is reasonable it is less than what the company used to realize in previous years because of increasing competition posed by small competitors targeting this particular niche.Market ShareRecently CRM SWITCH conducted a survey that indicated that Salesforce clearly dominates the US market across organizations of all sizes. I think that as long as the company continues its strategy of innovation, its market share will increase further.Glimpse of the HistoryDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, Salesforce reported revenues of $1.08 billion with an increase of 36% year over year. Approximately $1 billion was contributed by the company's subscription and support business while $71.5 million was from the sales of professional services which reflected a 36% increase and other services which reflected an increase of 50% year over year.Despite reasonable top line growth, the increased cost of services amounting to $268 million as well as increased operating expenses amounting to $905.7 million both contributed to the increased losses from operations. As can be seen in the chart presented above, the cost of sales and operating expenses both increased and were higher than the growth achieved at the top line. In addition to all of these factors, the interest expense of $22.92 million also increased by approximately 179.9% year over year.It is evident that increasing competition has increased the expenses on marketing, research and development plus other sales related expenses and has resulted in the shrinking of margins. However, to some extent, the recent increase in expenses can also be attributed to the Oracle license partnership and the company's acquisition of Exact Target.The Future of the CompanyThe most important question that I would like to answer is, ""How will the recent initiatives taken by the company affect its performance in the future?""Partnership with HP (NYSE:HPQ)The recently announced cloud partnership between Salesforce and HP is a groundbreaking development. Through this partnership, Salesforce will be able to use HP's converged infrastructure hardware to enhance its data center capabilities. The company will be in a better position to offer its services to large businesses requiring exclusive virtual networks.I think this partnership will provide an opportunity for the company to charge additional fees to its existing customers and will also entice other large enterprises into working with Salesforce.Partnership with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)The partnership between Oracle and Salesforce has some tremendous benefits as both companies are leaders in their domains. Their partnership can actually increase their respective customer bases and lower the costs required for the implementation of their software and enhance their software performance. After this deal, both companies will work on integrating the software offered by Salesforce and Oracle to better serve their customers. Moreover, this partnership has been very warmly welcomed by the customers of both companies.""It's a super-big win for us,"" said Dave Hansen, CEO of security vendor SafeNet, which uses Salesforce.com CRM and Oracle for financials. ""Salesforce.com is by far the leader in CRM and is probably never going to move deeply into financials, where Oracle is especially strong"", Hansen added.Acquisition of ExactTargetExactTarget provides digital marketing solutions to customers and helps businesses to strengthen their relationships with customers through email, mobile, social media and web services. Salesforce acquired this company back in July 2013 for the total of $2.5 billion.Despite reasonable top line growth, ExactTarget has been unable to report profits since 2008 but after the acquisition, Salesforce is in a better position to tap into the true value of the company by eliminating the duplicate facilities and lower operating expenses.During the most recent quarter, ExactTarget contributed approximately $81 million in revenues. I think that after acquiring the integration of ExactTarget's services with those of Salesforce will allow for exposure to a larger customer base and this limelight will boost the company's growth.Overall Prospects of the IndustryAccording to research conducted by Gartner, the worldwide market of customer relationship management will grow at a CAGR of 15.1% increasing the total market worth from $20.6 billion in 2012 to $36.5 billion in 2017. Additionally, Salesforce has significantly improved its capabilities to claim a bigger market share.ProjectionsHistorically, the revenue's CAGR was 37.43% but in my projections I have adjusted this growth rate to include the effect of increasing competition and limited growth opportunities in the market. Despite being conservative in my growth projections, the company will grow at a greater rate than the industry average. This growth will turn the net losses into profits as expenses as a percentage of sales will decrease in coming future.ConclusionAs I have mentioned, Salesforce showed excellent top line growth in past and I don't think that there will be anything to restrict its growth in future. The company is a leader in its industry and will continue to claim the top spot in the coming future. Moreover, the stock price is currently overvalued but I think it will increase further in as the future guidance provided by the company is quite conservative. My recommendation is Buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Blackstone Equity Research research analyst.

Being the pioneer of SAAS, the hottest space for IPO underwriting (not to mention convertible issuance and secondary offerings), Wall Street needs Salesforce stock to be a winner to keep this gravy train moving. I suspect analysts have had views differing from published consensus 'Strong Buy' but imagine that these were short lived:Phil Nickelson (head of Research): Johnson get in here!Mike Johnson (newly hired analyst): Yes Mr. Nickelson.Phil (pointing to Johnson's Salesforce.com Initiation report draft): What is this garbage? $15 price target? The stock is at $53. We can't publish this.Mike: Well I just did it based on the fundamentals. The company has $4 billion in revenue this year, guided to $5 billion next year and I expect it will do $6.2 billion in 2015. I gave Salesforce the benefit of the doubt and assume they can improve operating margins 1300 basis points to 12%. This gets me to $745 million in operating income which I cap at 15x. This implies an enterprise value of $11 billion. Subtracting out the $1.8 billion in net debt gets me to a fair equity value of $9.2 billion or $15/share.Phil: What do you think this is? Some kind of free expression think tank? We aren't paying you to think! We pay you to promote! Don't you know anything about this business? We specifically told the headhunter to find us a Fanalyst.Mike (staring blankly): I was told I would be an analyst.Phil (holding the third quarter conference call transcript): Covering a pioneer in an important industry means you are a supporter of the stock - plain and simple. We aren't paying you to write what you think or what is likely to be. We want you to suspend disbelief and dream big. If you can't dream anything up, you can always ask the company for help. (Chuckles) Don't get all worried if the company doesn't make money or is unlikely to achieve what you project in the out years of your DCF. Just change directions. Try to be more like Kash at Merrill Lynch or Heather at Goldman. On the conference call, just congratulate them on their performance, irrespective of what that performance is and then ask them a nice open ended question that doesn't pin them down from a financial guidance perspective.Mike (nodding): Ok I think I see where you are coming fromPhil: Never ask them any tough questions. It will make Salesforce look bad, it makes our firm look bad, and ultimately it makes you look bad. It's all about being a team player. Don't worry about the numbers. Focus on qualitative statements and use lots of adjectives. Ignore the actual results and focus on what might go right four or five years in the future.Mike: Gotcha. The more I think about it, the more I think the stock is probably worth $65 or so.Phil: I knew you were smart. Just remember, if anyone questions anything you write in your report, just dismiss the concern as 'tired' - this will instantly discredit the asker. Then point to the chart and say 'many shorts have destroyed their careers on this stock'. Then go back to colorful adjectives and qualitative discourse.Though I know it is impolite to ask these questions, I thought it was at least worth a shot. Here are three questions a thinking person (a Wall Street bank might mimic Ellsworth Toohey and say 'We don't want any thinking men' but I digress) would want to ask Salesforce.com and it's army of supportive analysts:Based on the fundamentals, I think this is a $15/stock at best (using Mike's math above), -73% from the current price. This is using reason and a healthy dose of skepticism. I realize this is a very non-consensus call and takes both conviction and capital but when the market realizes that the emperor isn't wearing any clothes, I believe the crash will be fast and far. For those who don't want to risk significant capital, I think the way out of the money puts (Jan 2015 or Jan 2016) are a great alternative to shorting (I'm short the stock but also long the puts).Disclosure: I am short CRM.

1852911,28151,2013-11-20T15:43:39-05:00,,"On the eve of their annual Dreamforce extravaganza, enterprise cloud computing company salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported earnings, showing continued strong revenue growth, boosted by the acquisition of email marketing company ExactTarget (NYSE:ET-OLD). On the conference call, the CFO of the company stated the following:""Third quarter revenue was $1.076 billion. That's up 36% over Q3 last year or 37% in constant currency. ExactTarget and Pardot contributed approximately $81 million to revenue in the third quarter which was well above what we had anticipated.""So without the additional revenue, sales came in at just under a billion dollars, still impressive for a company that is still growing so fast. Overly zealous CEO Marc Benioff repeatedly reminded us of this 'phenomenal' growth during the call and no doubt continued to do so in his appearances at Dreamforce, as well as on Jim Cramer's Mad Money television show.Cramer actually conducted his interview for the show at Dreamforce, and I was excited to hear him ask Benioff how the company's revenue growth could be so consistent through so many acquisitions and big customer wins. I had been wondering the same thing ever since I saw a graph of salesforce's quarterly revenue in this article.The revenue plot was so linear that many readers, including myself, wondered if the author simply drew a straight line between two annual numbers. Wanting to verify it for myself, I plotted the quarterly revenue going back 10 quarters:You'll notice that I also included a linear trendline on the graph that seems to fit the data almost perfectly. The R-squared value of the linear equation is a measure of how well the line fits the actual data. A value so close to 1 is statistically improbable for a real world company that is supposedly going through business cycles, seasonality, making acquisitions, and winning exciting new business.A specific example of this is that salesforce's international revenue growth was supposed to be constrained by weaker currencies, notably the Japanese yen, as discussed on the first quarter conference call, where management warned that currency exchange rates could be a $35 million dollar headwind for the year, including $10 million in just the first quarter alone. Despite this, revenue from other sources seemed to miraculously pick up the slack and we saw nary a dip in any of the quarterly sales numbers this year.So salesforce.com seemingly has a business model that results in perfectly linear sales growth no matter what the current environment is. The buzzword laden answer Benioff danced around Cramer's question with was that salesforce was mostly signing up customers to long-term contracts, which are booked off the balance sheet as deferred revenues, which the company then recognizes, apparently as needed to meet certain revenue targets.It makes sense that the company would want to focus mostly on their revenues since the stock trades pretty much based only on sales. While the company reports non-GAAP ""earnings"", they are still fairly low even though they exclude stock-based compensation and other expenses that they don't consider to be expenses, even though they are ongoing and in some cases increasing, as evidenced by the widening gulf between these wishful numbers and the actual GAAP results.Salesforce actually lost a staggering $124 million in just the past quarter alone. This was actually an improvement over the same quarter a year ago, when they lost over $220 million, although that loss was mostly due to a tax related adjustment where they admitted that they probably wouldn't be profitable soon enough to use as much of their huge tax loss carryforward.This latest quarter's losses certainly seems to back this up, as salesforce is even further away from actual profitability, although that didn't seem to deter Benioff, who in answering a question on the conference call about when top line growth would ever flow through to the bottom line, stated, ""There's a balance between growth and profitability and we want to continue to do both.""Now I don't know if he's really so delusional that he thinks salesforce is actually profitable, or whether he's going to volunteer to give up his stock options in the future so that they won't continue to be an expense, but disingenuous comments like this make me leery of whether he's running a real business or just the greatest show on earth.The suspiciously consistent revenue numbers lead me to lean towards the latter, and while salesforce really might be changing the enterprise software business, so far it only appears to be because they are outspending the competition to increase sales no matter what. The ExactTarget acquisition was a prime example of this, a $2.5 billion acquistion at a premium of another likely already overvalued mobile/social/cloud company whose main product is spam. Not the Hormel (NYSE:HRL) variety, but targeted email marketing, which salesforce claims fits perfectly with their customer service platform.Maybe salesforce has cracked the code of helping companies reach their customers more efficiently through mobile, social, and the cloud, but the hype surrounding the company and bombastic behavior of its CEO is more than enough to scare me off, not to mention the red flags of widening GAAP losses and clockwork revenue growth. I will leave it up to you whether to buy into Benioff's story or not, but just keep in mind how suspicious the revenue trend continues to look when including the latest quarter but excluding sales from the major acquisitions:This continues to show that their legacy business is almost impossibly linear, but when we include the contribution from the latest acquisitions it looks like this:This suddenly shows the ""hockey stick"" upturn of accelerating revenue growth, which growth investors seem to go gaga for, but why is it only now making an impact to the otherwise steady sales that salesforce showed through numerous other earlier acquisitions? Were they too small to move the revenue needle or did those smaller companies fit so well with their existing business that they smoothly integrated just in time to meet perfectly patterned revenue targets?Even if there is an innocuous explanation for the unwavering revenue growth, the fact remains that these sales are nowhere near translating to even a fraction of the real earnings that would be required to support the stock's lofty valuation. I would urge extreme caution when thinking of investing in such an overhyped, overvalued company where there might be improper or at least overly aggressive accounting needed to justify the current share price.Disclosure: I am short CRM.

1851231,25120,2013-11-20T06:45:44-05:00,,"Shares of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) are in the spotlight this week. The company reported a solid set of third quarter results, yet investors are selling their shares ahead of the big conference event hosted by CEO Marc Benioff later this week.Given the aggressive accounting measures, by stressing non-GAAP earnings and poor earnings developments, I remain cautious and stay on the sidelines. Note that by now, the company pays each of its nearly 13,000 employees on average some $40,000-$50,000 per worker in stock, allowing Salesforce.com to report miniscule non-GAAP earnings.Third Quarter ResultsSalesforce.com generated third quarter revenues of $1.08 billion, up 36.5% on the year before, and beating consensus estimates at $1.05 billion.The company reported GAAP losses of $0.21 per share as Salesforce.com squeezed out non-GAAP earnings of $0.09 per share, in line with consensus estimates.Looking Into The ResultsWhile reporting headline numbers of 36% revenue growth looks very impressive, a portion of this growth is attributed to the acquisition of ExactTarget. Realistically, ExactTarget could have added some $90 million in revenues over the past quarter, boosting growth by let's say 11-12 percent point.A little disappointing is the pressure on gross margins which compressed by 130 basis points to 75.1% of total revenues. Operating expenses rose by nearly a percent point to 84.2% of total revenues. This resulted in steeper operational losses, which nearly doubled to $98 million.Add to that higher interest payments and operating losses before taxes doubled to $124 million. The only reason why GAAP losses narrowed is that the company had a $157.5 million income tax benefit last year.While the company squeezed out a tiny profit on a non-GAAP basis, I prefer to focus on GAAP measures in this case. Most of the discrepancy between the both is caused by stock based compensation, totaling $142 million over the past quarter, which is a real dilutive expense to shareholders.OutlookFourth quarter revenues are seen between $1.124 and $1.129 billion, up about 35% on the year before. Analysts were looking for revenues of $1.12 billion.GAAP losses are seen between $0.24 and $0.25 per share, while non-GAAP earnings are seen between $0.05 and $0.06 per share. As typically the case, the large discrepancy between earnings on both metrics is caused by stock-based compensation, expected around $145 million.Salesforce.com also issued its fiscal 2015 guidance. Revenues are seen between $5.15 and $5.20 billion, up around 28% compared to this year. No earnings guidance has been given as of yet. Analysts were on average looking for revenues of $5.20 billion.ValuationSalesforce.com ended its fourth quarter with $1.09 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. Total debt, mostly stemming from convertible debt stands at $1.61 billion, resulting in a net debt position of little over $0.5 billion.The guidance implies that revenues for the fiscal year of 2014 are seen around $4.05 billion, up 33% on the year before. GAAP losses are seen around $0.45 per share, as non-GAAP earnings could come in around $0.33 per share.Trading around $55 per share, the market values Salesforce.com at $33 billion. This values operations of the firm at 8.1 times annual revenues and over a 150 times non-GAAP earnings.Salesforce.com does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveOver the past decade, shares have seen very good and steady returns. Trading around $7 at the start of 2009 shares have steadily risen to highs of $58 in recent times. After a tough summer period, shares have regained a lot of lost ground and are trading with year to date returns of around 30% for now.Between the fiscal 2010 and 2014, Salesforce.com has tripled its annual revenues to little over $4 billion. Net earnings have widened to some $275 million in the meantime.Investment ThesisThe recent momentum appears to be driven by the $2.5 billion deal to acquire ExactTarget. The acquired e-mail marketing company is set to add $180 million in revenues this year, after the deal only closed later this summer.The big event for now is the Dreamforce customer conference held later this week with 130,000 attendees and a lot of high profile speakers including Benioff but also CEO Meg Whitman from Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Yahoo's (YHOO) Marissa Mayer and Sheryl Sandberg from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Ahead of the event, Salesforce.com announced a partnership with HP to offer the Salesforce Superpod. Benioff will showcase the ""Salesforce 1"" at the conference, a platform tying various products in one application.Benioff furthermore attributed the solid performance to the focus on cross-selling products to customers in sales, marketing and customer service departments. Benioff has long stressed that CMOs, more than CTOs will become more important in the long run as their tasks are converging. The relentless focus on mobile is occurring as well, as Benioff claims he now runs the company from his iPhone 5.Last month, I last took a look at the prospects for Salesforce.com, when Raymond James fuelled momentum ahead of this earnings report. Analyst Tillman raised the company to strong buy at the time, accompanied by a $64 price target. I concluded to be a bit more cautious at the time.Aggressive accounting, notably by stressing on non-GAAP numbers and a strong public relations effort, were a worry to me. The guided $500 million in stock-based compensation amounts to $40,000 per annum for each employee, which are a true costs to shareholders. Combined with the SaaS model, which creates potential higher churn rates and lower exit barriers, the competitive position is more important than ever.For now, Salesforce.com continues to deliver, and in all honesty organic growth rates are strong enough, especially for a company the size of Salesforce.com. It is the lack of earnings, combined with slower growth trends which are still putting me down and make me cautious. The company has successfully used the expensive currency of stock to reward shareholders and make deals in recent years. This leaves the company very vulnerable to make acquisitions or pay out employees if the stock were to witness a large correction.I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Quarterly revenues were $1.08 billion and exceeded the $1 billion mark for the first time. The top line grew 36% on a year-over-year basis, beating industry estimates of $1.06 billion by a small margin. Sequentially, revenues grew approximately 12.5% boosted by the ExactTarget (NYSE:ET-OLD) acquisition completed in July 2013. In addition to strong revenue growth, deferred revenues grew at double-digit pace on a year-over-year basis, indicating strong demand for cloud services. The dollar value of booked business for Salesforce stands at $5.94 billion compared to $5.36 billion at the start of the year. We believe that this strong subscription pipeline should help drive growth going forward.However, expenses continued to grow faster than revenues and this resulted in losses at the operating and net income levels. Compared to Q3FY13, cost of sales and operating expenses as % of revenues expanded by 130 and 90 basis points respectively during the quarter to stand at 25% and 84% respectively. Expenses increased due to the Oracle license partnership and the acquisition of ExactTarget. GAAP earnings per share stood at a loss of $0.21 this quarter compared to a steeper loss of $0.39 from a prior year period, supported by a favorable tax benefit.For fiscal 2014, Salesforce raised its revenue guidance by $30 million due to strong performance of ExactTarget and expects revenues of $4.05 – $4.055 billion, implying a growth rate of 33% year over year. On the bottom-line front, the company reiterated its previous guidance and expects full year earnings to range between $0.33 – $0.34.In the current article, we highlight key takeaways from the recent quarterly results which we believe could create significant value addition to Salesforce’s financials.New Platform ‘Salesforce1′ Could Present Big OpportunityBefore the start of the annual Dreamforce conference, Salesforce announced the launch of its latest mobile platform called 'Salesforce1'. This latest offering provides Salesforce’s desktop platform through a mobile interface with easier and customized services for its customers. Furthermore, the new Salesforce1 platform, intended for smartphones and tablets, has 10 times more Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) than any other Salesforce platform. This allows application developers across small, medium and large enterprises to leverage customer mobile connectivity and provide their applications across various platforms and interfaces. Salesforce reports that Internet companies such as Dropbox, Evernote and LinkedIn (LNKD), as well as ADP, are already on-board for the Salesforce1 platform to power their mobile applications for better CRM services.Targeted customer service offerings bode well for mobile and tablet customers. Combined with its recent acquisition ExactTarget, which specializes in cloud marketing services, Salesforce could provide customers utilizing the Salesforce1 platform with pin-pointed services on their smartphones and tablets. Given the growth potential within the smartphone service market, we expect good demand for the product from various enterprises and this should translate into additional revenue growth for Salesforce’s CRM business.Salesforce Inks Cloud Partnership With HP To Combat Intensifying CompetitionTo counter increasing competition from large software companies such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM and SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), who have been vying for entry into the hyper-growth cloud market, Salesforce struck a partnership with hardware player Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) to offer enterprise CRM services on HP’s Converged Infrastructure. Through the partnership, Salesforce expects to expand its data center capabilities with HP’s Converged Infrastructure hardware and increase its service reach to large enterprises requiring higher work-loads.The new offering with HP, called the Salesforce Superpod, would be made available to its largest customers at an additional fee. Customers choosing the Superpod option will get a dedicated instance of Salesforce on their own infrastructure, as opposed to the present shared infrastructure offering. A dedicated instance is beneficial for large enterprises which usually require private and isolated virtual networks instead of a shared public cloud network.In recent times, competitors Oracle and IBM have stepped up to the cloud opportunity by offering their own application software through their Convergence Infrastructure systems Exadata and Flex Systems respectively. With improved data centers in operation through the HP partnership, we believe Salesforce could challenge the growing competition from software providers like Oracle and IBM.We are in the process of revising our price estimate of $33 for Salesforce to reflect its recent Q3 results."
1845652,47391,2013-11-18T02:47:31-05:00,,"Customer Relationship Management software is a vital tool for today's marketing executives in an increasingly competitive and online world. Companies need to mine social data, track internet searches, target demographic groups, and assess competitive trends. For this kind of activity, big data and sophisticated software is needed.The market for CRM software is estimated at about $18 billion in 2012 and growing at about 12.5%.Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is the big player in the field, followed closely by SAP and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM having meaningful positions.Survey data also identify a host of smaller players that serve niche markets within the CRM space including names like ACT!, Goldmine, Sugar, Zoho, Sage CRM and a few others.The ten fastest growing providers in 2012 were Zoho (81%), Hybris (79%), Teradata (70%), Bazaarvoice (56%), Marketo (54%), Kana (44%), Demandware (44%), IBM (39%), Technology One (37%) and Neolane (36%). Salesforce.com did not make the list.Salesforce.com has reported sales growth of more than 30% a year for the past 3 years fuelled in part by acquisitions.The question for investors is simple. In a market growing at 12 to 13%, how long can one supplier growing at 30% maintain that rate of growth? The arithmetic is grade school - it is about 7 years. After that point, that supplier would have 100% market share and would represent the total industry. Growth beyond that would match industry growth, in this case 12 to 13% unless something changes to spur more growth.Of course if competition does not fold their tents and hangs on to say 50% of the market, saturation of growth is reached in about 5 years. And, if an equilibrium of market share is reached once Salesforce.com hits a 25 to 30% market share it will occur in 2016.Salesforce.com is valued in the marketplace based on growth in revenue since it has virtually no earnings at this point and none are in sight in the short term. The company is valued at more than 10 times sales.Investors are clearly betting salesforce.com revenues will continue to grow at 30% or more for the foreseeable future. They are also clearly wrong.By 2016, Salesforce.com needs pretty well everything to go its way to be a company with $6 to $8 billion in sales. It is possible and maybe even likely that competitors react with aggressive prices; new products; and, creative features to counter salesforce.com in its efforts to expand its market share. Assume they don't and salesforce.com reaches a sustainable market share of about 25 to 30% and holds on to that, with subsequent growth in line with the industry.A company growing at 12 to 13% with sustainable profits might have an enterprise value to revenue ratio of something like 2.2 to 4.7 times, based on the ratios of Oracle (3.86), SAP (4.67), IBM (2.22) or Microsoft (2.22). If it did, its market capitalization in 2016 would range between $13 billion and $36 billion.But wait, it has an enterprise value of $36 billion today!!There is a lot more downside risk to salesforce.com than there is upside potential. Momentum players have driven this stock far beyond any sensible level and may drive it higher yet. Today's earnings report is widely expected to be strong. But the smart money steps aside and the aggressive investor buys put options or sells short on the news.That would be me. I am short 17,000 shares. Given the ""bubble"" state of today's markets I may hedge my short by selling puts or buying calls going into the earnings after the close today since the sentiment is pretty positive on the stock.

1776782,21061,2013-10-27T05:56:06-04:00,,"South Park's underpants gnomes had a questionable business plan:Source: South ParkInvestors in Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) are relying on a similar vision for the future, with revenue growth as the dominant theme overriding considerations of returns on capital, profit margins, and shareholder dilution. I hope to convince readers below that when analyzed through a variety of different metrics, something is seriously wrong with CRM's business model, making the elusive profit much harder to achieve than Marc Benioff may want you to believe.A successful short investment requires a thesis for valuation meaningfully below the current market price and a catalyst causing the market to reassess its view on the business in a manner more closely aligned with the short thesis. The second component of this definition cuts to the heart of the ""never short on valuation"" mantra, as overvalued businesses can remain overvalued for extended periods while the underlying operating performance catches up with the valuation. While the interim equity performance will underwhelm during this period, the lack of a catalyst prevents the short position to realize the merits of what at a given point in time may have been a valid thesis.CRM for years has been overvalued on any reasonable set of assumptions regarding the future. The lack of a catalyst, however, coupled with a highly dynamic and proselytizing leader has propelled the stock higher during this time.First, let's acknowledge the positive attributes of the business. The company was at the forefront of the shift towards on-demand (cloud) computing. They have rapidly grown to a multi-billion dollar software company with a broad stable of loyal customers. Further, the economics of SAAS providers - high gross margins and negative working capital - should in theory provide phenomenal returns on invested capital (ROIC). However, as seen below, CRM's ROIC does not reflect a strong business model, with persistently inferior ROIC certainly below the company's cost of capital, and a trend that is rapidly deteriorating.Source: Cowen & Co.Why is it that the ""world's #1 CRM platform"" (the company's own words), during the ""heyday of the Cloud, the Renaissance, the Great Time"" (all words from CEO Marc Benioff in 2012), cannot generate returns on capital that create value? Part of the bullish argument is that CRM's outsized operating expenses, which caused the company to report GAAP operating losses every quarter since early 2011, are required to support the company's revenue growth. However, if we look at other truly revolutionary technology companies - Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) - we see that these companies in their early years (GOOG beginning in 2001 and MSFT beginning in 1982, as I was unable to locate financial data prior to then) were able to generate substantial operating margins while growing at rates similar to CRM.Source: SEC filingsCompanies with outstanding business models and defensible competitive advantages do not persistently generate inferior ROIC and operating losses. Microsoft held a near-monopoly position during the advent of the personal computing industry. Google redefined internet search and largely created the online advertising market. Salesforce, on the other hand, spends massively on sales and marketing to capture share from entrenched competitors in a largely mature market for software to assist salespeople. This is not a winning long-term strategy.Source: SEC filingsFurther, CRM's operating losses would be even worse if they were not able to capitalize R&D and other expenses acquired through acquisitions. To help maintain the company's declining revenue growth rates, CRM has looked to increasingly large acquisitions, culminating in June of this year with the company's $2.4 billion acquisition of ExactTarget. The effect of these acquisitions on the company's balance sheet is staggering, with more than 50% of CRM's total assets now comprised of goodwill and intangible assets.Source: SEC filingsSome argue that acquisitions should not be a factor in calculating free cash flow, if the net assets acquired are already generating their own returns. CRM's acquisitions, however, have largely been purchases of people and ideas, with revenue contribution (until recently) minimal and profits in all cases nowhere to be found. Therefore, CRM's acquisitions truly are more like traditional capital expenditures. However, because the goodwill associated with these substantial capital outlays is added to the balance sheet but never amortized, the company substantially underreports true operating expenses. This of course conforms to GAAP, but it is important to recognize large portions of these substantial investments are not having any effect on reported operating expenses. Their impact will, however, continue to be evident via the poor returns on invested capital referenced above.Additionally, intangible assets acquired through acquisitions represent another source of underreported expenses. As of July 31st, 2013, CRM had capitalized nearly $540 million in software development and acquired technology expenses, as well as nearly $450 million in unidentified intangible assets acquired through acquisitions. Thus, nearly $1 billion in expenses are sitting on CRM's balance sheet waiting to be slowly amortized as operating expenses over multiple years in the future. The fact that the company generates operating losses without the full impact of these capitalized expenses should concern shareholders.Perhaps Google and Microsoft in their early years are poor proxies. What about other current enterprise software companies, facing the same economic conditions as CRM? Again, the results are striking (hint: CRM is the blue diamond below the 0% EBIT margin threshold).Source: Capital IQCRM is in a class of its own, as the only publicly traded enterprise software company (as defined by Capital IQ) with revenue in excess of $500 million that does not generate operating profits. The scatterplot above generally illustrates operating leverage amongst the group, as the larger companies (by revenue) tend to generate higher operating margins. CRM is an outlier, of course, further raising serious questions about the health of their business model.Another bull argument is that GAAP income statements mask the company's substantial ability to generate cash. First, let's dispel the notion that CRM generates substantial free cash flow. Once we account for cash outflows for acquisitions, which in CRM's case are much more like traditional capital expenditures (and thus part of the free cash flow calculation), free cash flow as seen below in recent years has been negative, and sharply negative over the last 12 months.Source: SEC filingsSecond, although CRM historically generates operating cash flow, understanding the nature of that cash flow is vital. As seen below, generally more than 100% of the company's operating cash flow is from stock compensation and the growth of deferred revenue. The former is a source of ongoing shareholder dilution, while the latter is an unreliable cash source that can easily become a cash use if growth slows. Neither are high quality, sustainable sources of operating cash flow one would expect to see from a leading business.Source: SEC filingsLastly, management actions and disclosures raise significant red flags. Conference calls are surprisingly void of questions regarding lack of profitability, as analysts at Cowen, J.P. Morgan, and Bernstein, who have all taken a more sober approach to valuation, are not called upon during the question and answer periods. Benioff's use of superlatives to describe business performance borders on comical. Insider sales are rampant, including more recently exercising and selling stock options that do not expire until 2017.For all of Benioff's talk about the future, and for all of the money the company has spent to pivot from being a one-trick CRM pony, why do their SEC filings never break revenue and profitability by business unit? If I were an investor, and saw billions of my capital spent on acquisitions far outside of CRM's traditional business model, I would want to understand the returns these investments were generating.I realize I began my article stating a successful short requires both a thesis regarding significant overvaluation and a catalyst. Regarding valuation, here's a simple exercise, looking at three possible scenarios. In each case, I assume 605 MM shares out (based on CRM's basic share count in their FY2014 guidance), and a 10% cost of equity (generous in my opinion, but that's another discussion):Scenario A: Benioff's growth aspirations continue relatively unabated, growing revenue 25% annually through FY2021. The company is able to contain growth in sales and marketing expenses, leading to steadily rising net margins reaching 15% by FY2021.Scenario B: Growth moderates (as it always does over the long term) to 10% annually by FY2021. The company eventually turns profitable, but net margins end at 10% by FY2021.Scenario C: The highly competitive enterprise software market makes future growth difficult, yielding GDP-type growth of 3% by FY2021. The company eventually earns 5% net margins by FY2021.Results:A: FY2021 revenue of $19.2 billion with net income of $2.9 billion. Applying a 15x multiple on those earnings, discounting terminal value and net income up to that point at a 10% cost of equity, and dividing by 605 MM shares ~ $42.5 share price today.B: FY2021 revenue of $12.4 billion with net income of $1.2 billion. Using the same procedure in A ~ $19 share price today.C: FY2021 revenue of $10.7 billion with net income of $533 MM. Using the same procedure in A ~ $8.50 share price today.CRM would have to wildly exceed even Marc Benioff's superlative-laden expectations of the future to justify a stock price 22% below today's value. A more realistic outlook argues for a current share price 65% below today's value, and a more downbeat - but certainly not unreasonable given the creative destruction rampant in the technology world - results in a share price 85% below today's value.With a thesis for overvaluation intact, what is the catalyst? I believe the company's balance sheet has finally become an albatross weighing heavily on Benioff's talk about the wonders of the future. I would not be surprised to see significant write-downs in their $3.5 billion goodwill balance. Further, I believe sophisticated investors are finally waking to the fact this dog doesn't hunt. Given the substantial institutional ownership of the company's stock, one has to wonder who is the buyer of last resort for sizable blocks of equity? Day traders and algorithmic quant funds don't tend to make good long-term investors.Disclosure: I am short CRM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1754112,20521,2013-10-18T11:47:03-04:00,,"I recently syndicated a Technology Stocks column to Seeking Alpha. It was titled Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) platform Strategy Holds Immense Promise. The argument was as follows:The Seeking Alpha article generated a ton of comments, mostly asking why am I bullish about a company that never generates profits.The Salesforce.com stock is trading at a market capitalization of over $30 billion. It touched a life high of $54.25 soon after the most recent quarter's results were announced.It appears that I am not the only one bullish about the stock's performance.However, the question of profitability is looming large in the minds of investors, so I thought it would be a good one to address. Even more importantly, some investors are beginning to question the entire SaaS business model, so we need to take a close look at that. Our industry is fully invested in this model now, so its viability is of paramount importance.The criticisms against the SaaS business model include high sales and marketing costs, high churn, low exit barrier, etc. The points in favor are many, but the one that financial investors like the most is predictability.My observation is that Salesforce.com does have in its arsenal a strategy that should help the company become vastly more profitable, lower sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue, and also, dramatically improve churn.That strategy centers around its platform ecosystem.The Seeking Alpha article also references my recent Harvard Business Review article on corporate incubation called When Big Companies Support Start-ups, Both Make More Money:I think the platform strategy, if executed properly, holds the key to addressing Salesforce.com's profitability problem on all dimensions. The small companies building on their platform will do the sales and marketing. They will also create reasons for the customers to stay within the ecosystem, and not go to cheaper alternatives like Zoho. Once these smaller companies hit their stride, the net impact should be pure bottom line.The criticism on Salesforce.com is that it provides a lot of technical assistance to the developer network, but not much business help. This is a legitimate criticism, but one that can be addressed."
1738882,25047,2013-10-10T11:58:31-04:00,,"One of the intriguing things about bubbles is how they sometimes prop up companies that could otherwise face very serious difficulties. And one of the most amazing things about the latest tech bubble lies precisely on how some of the stocks being promoted, like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), have deeply worsening earnings trends.Obviously, this buying of these stocks is predicated on there being some point in the distant future where these companies will turn incredibly profitable. And in the short-term, such buying is also helped by cash flow generation which seems to speak of hidden value. Salesforce has this cash flow generation in spades, due to 2 sources:These sources of cash, while dilutive and temporary, are probably enough to keep Salesforce.com far from a liquidity crisis in spite of its huge spending ways. However, they're not enough to prevent what has been substantial earnings and balance sheet degradation.So much degradation, in fact, that I have turned to the Altman Z-score to try and ascertain its risk of bankruptcy. This article is the result of that endeavor. And the conclusion is startling.Altman Z-ScoreThe Altman Z-Score is defined by Wikipedia as follows:InputsThe Z-score has 5 inputs:FormulaThe inputs show above then come together using the following formula:Z = 1.2T1 + 1.4T2 + 3.3T3 + 0.6T4 + .999T5Calculation for Salesforce.comThe following data, obtained from CRM's latest 10-Q is necessary to calculate the Altman Z-score:Using this data we get the following parcels:This gives us an Altman Z-score of 3.69.Interpretation and ConclusionThe Altman Z-score is interpreted according to the following ranges (Source: Creditworthy.com):Going just from a straight Altman Z-score calculation, CRM seems very low risk. Nothing else would be expected from a company trading for such a massive valuation - CRM trades for 98 times consensus non-GAAP 2014 earnings estimates, and 450 times present EV/EBITDA.But the story doesn't stop here. Salesforce.com gets this score essentially due to T4*0.6 at 3.545, that is, due to the Market Value of Equity / Book Value of Total Liabilities ratio. In other words, Salesforce.com has a massive market valuation, and that gives it very low risk. This makes sense - if CRM needed money it could quickly raise a lot of it simply by issuing equity. But what happens if CRM drops a lot, say to one fourth of its present quote, where it would still be trading at a premium to the overall stock market?What happens is that its market capitalization would get cut to just $7.55 billion, and T4*0.6 would then be just 0.886 … bringing CRM's overall Z-score all the way down to 1.03! That is, if Salesforce.com ever saw its stock get cut to around $12.50, then the Z-score would drop all the way down to ""highly likely headed for bankruptcy""!ConclusionSalesforce.com's bankruptcy risk might well be hidden by its massive valuation premium. Were Salesforce.com stock to drop, and amazingly its Altman Z-score would quickly fall all the way down to the riskiest category - a company which can be expected to go bankrupt on short notice.This serves both for the investors to understand just how risky Salesforce.com has potentially gotten, and for the company to have the fortitude to issue enough equity now so as to mitigate this danger before it ever materializes.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours.

1761322,25120,2013-10-22T15:18:10-04:00,,"Shares of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) started the trading week on a strong note after the provider of cloud and CRM solutions received a big upgrade from analysts at Raymond James.The upgrade is providing extra momentum for shares ahead of the third quarter earnings report expected to be released in a few weeks time. That being said, I remain on the sidelines as excessive momentum could still continue to hurt those investors with a bearish stance.Upgrade From Raymond JamesAnalyst Terry Tillman raised his rating on Salesforce.com from ""Outperform"" to ""Strong Buy"". Tillman furthermore raised his price target from $55 to $64 per share, suggesting some 18% potential upside from Friday's closing levels.Raymond James got ""positive vibes"" from a customer company tour as hosted by the company last week, during which Tillman spoke to partners and customers.For 2014 Tillman now sees revenues of $4.02 billion and a net loss of $0.44 per share. Revenues are expected to increase to $5.3 billion as GAAP earnings are expected to narrow to $0.17 per share, all slightly more optimistic from previous estimates.The guidance for 2015 is based on organic growth estimates of 26%, which now may be conservative according to Tillman. Ongoing growth in the core Sales Cloud business, continued enterprise traction, and the higher revenues from the platform overall, all act as catalysts for further organic growth.Tillman is furthermore enthusiastic on the B2C area, with key wins including Coca Cola (NYSE:KO), which run much of its business on salesforce.com. Service cloud continues to ramp up significantly as well, taking share from RightNow Technologies which has been acquired by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). And last, the public offering of Veeva Systems (NYSE:VEEV), which occurred just last week, showed how successful the platform of the company is.ValuationSalesforce.com ended its second quarter with $930 million in cash, equivalents and short term investments. The company operates with $300 million in regular debt and $1.57 billion in convertible debt, for a net debt position of almost $1 billion.For the first six months of the year, Salesforce.com generated revenues of $1.85 billion, up 30% on the year before. The company reported a $8.9 million GAAP loss, on the back of a tax valuation allowance, compared to a loss of $29.3 million last year. Full year sales are seen around $4.00 billion, while the company guided to report non-GAAP earnings of $0.33 per share and GAAP losses of $0.43 per share.At $55 per share, the market values Salesforce.com at $32.8 billion. This values operations of the firm at 8.2 times annual revenues and 170 times non-GAAP earnings.Salesforce.com does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveOn the back of the upgrade from Raymond James shares are setting fresh all time highs. Shares traded as low as $5 in 2008 and 2009, but shares have ten-folded ever since.CRM's wildly energetic and enthusiastic CEO Marc Benioff has been the leader behind the rapid growth. Between 2009 and 2013, Salesforce.com is expected to triple its annual revenues to $4.0 billion. The company is expected to turn a $81 million GAAP profit in 2009 into a roughly $250 million loss in 2013.Investment ThesisIt is still a few weeks away, but Salesfore.com is expected to release its third quarter results on the 18th of November.For now Salesforce.com continues to grow at an impressive pace, given the size of the company. Salesforce.com continues to push very aggressively to drive sales, thereby foregoing any earnings at the moment. Salesforce.com aims to aggressively market its ecosystems, trying to make the company relevant and a leading platform into the cloud-dominated future.Like Salesforce.com, most of the cloud and other customer relationship firms are focusing on the SaaS business model, as investors love the model given the predictability of the future revenue and therefore cash flows streams. Traditionally, most customers made large upfront investments and committed to their supplier for years. A drawback is that Saas actually creates potential higher churn rates and low exit barriers, to companies like Salesforce.com, making a strong product and service offerings more important than ever.What is more interesting, Salesforce.com is becoming a leading platform for start-ups which use the company's solutions to develop their businesses. Actually the ecosystem allows the company to take some stakes in interesting start-ups, as they can quickly monitor their progress and get in touch early.Back at the end of August, when Salesforce.com reported its second quarter results, I last took a look at the company's prospects.I concluded that aggressive accounting and the very upbeat public relations efforts remain a worry. At the time the upbeat comments about the performance and immediate outlook send shares to fresh all time highs. This came after investors had grown a bit cautious after the $2.5 billion acquisition of e-mail marketing provider ExactTarget earlier this summer. Benioff furthermore added that investors should expect more larger acquisitions as small deals didn't bring in much revenues.Salesforce.com furthermore stressed that CMO's, more than CTO's become more important in deciding to which IT and marketing budgets will be directed. Besides customers acquisition, Salesforce.com now sees more potential to upgrade services with existing customers, trying to fortify the ecosystem it has created in the cloud, social marketing tools and the mobile environment.Back in August, I concluded to be very cautious, despite the impressive sales growth for a company the size of Salesforce.com. I remain worried about the company's prospects to transfer revenues into cash for its shareholders. Trading around 150 times non-GAAP earnings, the valuation is already high, but note that Salesforce.com excludes $500 million in annual stock-based compensation in this earnings metric.Benioff and his team continue to deliver strong results, notably in terms of revenues, for which they should be applauded. Note that I refrain from both taking a long position or a short position in the firm at the moment. The valuation is too high according to me, yet the shorts could continue to be hurt by strong momentum. The aggressive accounting, with a focus on non-GAAP earnings, makes me quite cautious.As such, I remain on the sidelines with a continued cautious stance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1782192,38201,2013-10-29T11:51:19-04:00,,"In September, two of the largest application software companies, Salesforce (CRM) and Workday (WDAY), joined hands to form a strategic alliance to provide customers with an extended range of cloud-based products. The companies will offer each other's services to their respective customers. Salesforce, which is known for sales and marketing solutions, will also provide its customers with Workday's Human Capital Management, or H.C.M, software, which is known for its human resource and financial capabilities.Workday will be utilizing Salesforce's applications and platform for its customers, which will complement its existing H.C.M solutions. Though the financial details regarding this deal haven't been disclosed, we expect it to be a perfect fit for both companies. This deal will prove beneficial for both Salesforce and Workday, enabling each to attract customers, based on the added product list, leading to growth in their respective markets. The combination of products and solutions from these two companies will provide customers with a complete SaaS application suite that they will be able to run their entire business on.Along with the solutions from Workday, Salesforce also provides solutions and dataset from Rypple, or work.com. This company is known for its cloud based social performance management platform, which Salesforce acquired last year. Salesforce will now be able to dabble in the HCM market too. On the other end, Workday will gain immense benefit from this alliance, given the strong customer base Salesforce holds. Additionally, Workday's focus towards financial management applications and enterprise resource planning applications makes its solutions unique in this market, reflecting a good growth opportunity through this alliance.Enhancement doesn't end hereMoving beyond the HCM market, last month Salesforce released a new file sharing service called Salesforce Files. This is similar to its previous file sharing service, Chatterbox. It was an offering provided to all Salesforce customers, where they could easily share files on Salesforce Chatter. With Salesforce Files, the company improved its functionality by providing further access to files, which exist in the third-party applications, like Microsoft's SharePoint and Google Drive. This service is available to all Salesforce customers, who are using its sales and marketing tools or applications.In order to provide more of connectivity-oriented functionality in its marketing business, Salesforce acquired ExactTarget last month for about $2.5 billion. This company is known for email marketing and interactive marketing products and solutions. Through this acquisition, Salesforce aims to provide its customers with sales and marketing services through platforms like social network, email, mobile applications, and the web. This will help Salesforce provide a complete marketing solution offering once it is able to access ExactTarget's social marketing capabilities, leading to further improvement in its solutions' offerings.Overall, in the past two months, Salesforce has totally changed the level of the products and solutions it offers to its customers. To hasten the transition, Salesforce executed strategies that would help the company attain cost synergies; it lay off 200 employees from its marketing cloud in order to integrate ExactTarget. These deals and alliances will help Salesforce grow its customer base, which will indirectly lead to growth in its market share in the software as a service market. On financial terms, Salesforce has shown over 7% growth in revenue consistently in the quarter results this year, generating $957 million in the second quarter of this fiscal. Looking at this growth rate, we feel Salesforce's target of generating $4 billion as total revenue in 2014 is an achievable target, based on the support of this enhanced list of products and solutions.Valuation standpointWith positive fundamentals to support future growth, we will consider the valuation standpoint of Salesforce by comparing it with its peer, Workday, and its competitor, SAP. We considered price to book ratio to find the valuation attributes of these companies. The industry ratio stood at 5 times, while Salesforce, Workday, and SAP posted a price to book ratio of 11.5 times, 21.5 times and 4.6 times, respectively. To get a clearer picture, we will add the return assets ratio, or ROA, and return on equity ratio, or ROE. In case the stock is overvalued, then the ROE of these companies will be rising, while the ROA would display comparatively low figures.The ROE of Salesforce, Workday and SAP are -9.86%, -67.80% and 22.02%, respectively, on the trailing 12-month basis. Given the overvalued attributes of Salesforce and Workday, both companies have posted very low ROE, especially when compared with SAP's great results. Additionally, the ROE of Salesforce has risen from its previous fiscal level of -13.85%, which proves it as an overvalued growth stock. In the case of Workday, the ROE worsened in the previous fiscal year, it posted -57.49%. This is mainly due to the fall in its net income in the past four quarters. Overall, we do not expect any drastic positive change in the ROE of these two companies, in the coming quarters. For SAP, the ROE has increased from 21.02% in fiscal 2012, which is a good sign. The company is presently undervalued based on its low price to book compared to the industry standards.The ROA of Salesforce, Workday, and SAP are -3.74%, -15.95% and 11.98%, respectively, on the trailing 12-month basis. The ROA of all three companies have increased from their previous fiscal years. The companies had posted -5.58%, -20.10% and 11.28%. Despite some improvement, Salesforce and Workday haven't been able to post good results in the past four quarters. On the other side, SAP has been able to improve through its rising income, which grew from $2.8 billion in fiscal 2012 to $3.1 billion on the trailing 12-month basis. Henceforth, this proves that on the basis of price to book ratio, Salesforce and Workday are highly overvalued stocks, while SAP is an undervalued stock. Still, the above discussed fundamentals provide enough confidence regarding improvement in the valuation figures of Salesforce in the long run.Worth a small portion of your portfolioCRM data by YChartsYear-to-date period shows that Salesforce posted over 27% growth in its stock price. Also, in the second quarter this year, the net income of the company rose to $77 million, from the net loss of $68 million in the first quarter of this fiscal year. The fundamentals described above show the improved range of solutions that Salesforce aims to offer. This will help its business to grow significantly in the coming years. With the aim of penetrating the entire back office work of an enterprise, Salesforce displays enough growth prospects to attract investors also.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1770412,54532,2013-10-24T15:42:17-04:00,,"Now a day's US companies are focusing on investing in new mobile, cloud and other smart technologies. Sometimes these technologies are the biggest revenue drivers for many companies. As of late, cloud computing has become one of the hottest IT enterprise topics. Within a few years cloud computing has reshaped the IT market because cloud offers 25% infrastructure savings on IT services and hardware expenses.According to research conducted by Gartner, worldwide spending on enterprise software is projected to grow by 6.8% this year to $305 billion. Gartner also finds that the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) market is a fast growing market with an estimated annual growth rate of 15% over the period of 2012 to 2017.It is estimated to reach $36 billion by 2017.Source: ForbesDue to these fast growing trends the cloud and enterprise solution market appears to be an attractive investment opportunity.Salesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE: CRM) is the industry leader in enterprise software solutionsand it is growing by 30% on a year over year basis. The company offers diversified sales services and markets products through the cloud on both mobile and desktop interfaces.Source: Y-ChartsSalesforce.com is currently trading at record high prices and appears poised to continue on this trend. Share price have increased more than 20% after reporting market topping second quarter results with a revenue growth of around 31% and earnings exceeding expectations by $0.02. Another contributor to the positive price performance is the company raising it sales forecast for full fiscal year 2014 to $4-$4.03 billion. Investors are optimistic about the recent performance results of Salesforce.com. Revenues continue to rise significantly and earnings are decreasing because of the company's acquisition strategy and heavy marketing expenditures put in place to capture market shares.Source: ForbesSalesforce.com is a globally-recognized CRM software vendor and boasted a 14% market share in 2012. They have outperformed other software peers such as SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other vendors.Recent PerformanceSalesforce.com continues to be a fastest growing company with year over year growth of 30% in revenue as well as deferred revenue and operating cash flows. Salesforce.com derives revenue from two sources: subscription revenues and revenues related to professional services. Subscription revenues account for 94% of the overall revenue generated for the first half of fiscal year 2014 which is a 31% increase from the first half of fiscal year 2013.Source: ForbesThe figure above speculates that in the coming future the number of paying subscribers of Salesforce.com will increase by a significant amount. This is due to the fact that many companies are turning to Salesforce.com because of their innovative platform. Salesforce.com has been recognized by Forbes magazine as the most innovative company in the world for the third year in a row.A useful way to evaluate the number of subscribers is to define a set of competitors in a given market and compare their inquiry level by software application category.Source: Gartner CRM Global Inquiry AnalysisAccording to the research conducted by Gartner, the inquiry share of Salesforce.com had increased by more than 5% by the end of 2012 in comparison to the results of previous years. This increase in inquiry share has resulted in an increase in the number of paying subscribers for the company. On a positive note, none of the company's customers account for more than 5% of the total revenue of the company. Therefore the company is not dependent on any one subscriber.Growth OpportunitiesRecently Salesforce.com and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), a leader in enterprise cloud application for human resource and finance departments, announced plans to integrate their product lines to enable customer success. Customers would be able to receive direct updates from Workday through the Salesforce.com chatter page. This integration will speed up the decision-making process of the customers of both platforms due to increased availability of financial and operational data. This integration could make both Salesforce.com and Workday attractive to enterprises seeking to replace their legacy system with cloud software. Companies would not have to purchase third party tools and services to combine Salesforce.com and Workday services and would also have low cost implementation.In the most recently ended quarter Salesforce.com completed its acquisition of Exact Target, an Indiana based company that develops software that allows marketers to target specific customers using e-mail and social media campaigns. Salesforce.com acquired this company for $2.5 billion.According to Salesforce.com, combining their leading sales, service, and social media solutions along with Exact Target's digital marketing capabilities would enable the company to create a world class marketing platform. Combining Exact Target with the existing cloud marketing services of Salesforce.com would provide a great level of synergy. Also, the company is considering reducing the number of employees of their marketing cloud service by 200 people.With the acquisition of Exact Target, Salesforce.com has been able to increase its sales forecast to $1 billion for the upcoming quarter. The company has spent four years trying to hit the billion dollar mark. Exact Target's contribution to overall revenues of the company in the remaining half of the year is expected to be $140-145 million.According to Gartner, marketing was the fastest growing CRM category in 2012 and grew at a rate of 21%. The research firm is also predicting a 21% growth up until 2017. The acquisition of Exact Target was a strategic move made by Salesforce.com and this will accelerate the growth and increase the status of the Salesforce.com marketing cloud.New OrdersSlaesforce.com has reported an amazing collaboration this quarter with Sysco, one of the world's largest food service distributors. Sysco has decided to use the Salesforce.com platform in their company-wide Sysco 360 initiative. This is one of the largest platform transactions in the history of Salesforce.com and is a great success for the company.Salesforce.com has also completed a transaction with the iconic Louis Vuitton brand in the luxury retail sector to provide a new mobile app to manage clientele and platform clouds for more than 460 Louis Vuitton stores around the world.

In Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $49, about in line with where it is currently trading.Before we dig in, how about a little background on our process? We think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation and its relative valuation versus industry peers is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy.We think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for an in-depth presentation about our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Essentially, we're looking for firms that overlap investment methodologies, thereby revealing the greatest interest by investors (we like firms that fall in the center of the diagram below):If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Salesforce.com posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm, its unattractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. We compare Salesforce.com to peers Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:Our Report on Salesforce.comInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsBusiness QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Salesforce.com's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 20.9%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Salesforce.com's free cash flow margin has averaged about 20.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Salesforce.com, cash flow from operations increased about 61% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 99% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Salesforce.com's shares are worth between $34.00 - $64.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's HIGH ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $49 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about -102.3 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 96.9 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 28.2% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 32.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 9.8%, which is above Salesforce.com's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 17.5% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Salesforce.com, we use a 10.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $49 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Salesforce.com. We think the firm is attractive below $34 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $64 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Salesforce.com's fair value at this point in time to be about $49 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Salesforce.com's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $67 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $49 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Intensive insider selling can be defined by the following three criteria:Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) provides cloud computing and social enterprise solutions to various businesses and industries worldwide.Insider selling during the last 30 daysHere is a table of salesforce.com's insider-trading activity during the last 30 days by insider.There have been 410,544 shares sold by insiders during the last 30 days.Lawrence Tomlinson, Hilarie Koplow, Craig Conway, Daniel Crump and Frank van Veenendaal sold their shares pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Maria Martinez and Craig Ramsey sold their shares without the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.SEC Rule 10b5-1 is a regulation enacted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2000. The SEC states that Rule 10b5-1 was enacted in order to resolve an unsettled issue over the definition of insider trading, which is prohibited by SEC Rule 10b-5. After Rule 10b5-1 was enacted, the SEC staff publicly took the position that canceling a planned trade made under the safe harbor does not constitute insider trading, even if the person was aware of the inside information when canceling the trade. This staff interpretation raises the possibility that executives can exploit this safe harbor by entering into 10b5-1 trading plans before they have inside information while retaining the option to later cancel those plans based on inside information.For example, a CEO of a company could call a broker on January 1 and enter into a plan to sell a particular quantity of shares of his company's stock on March 1, find out terrible news about his company on February 1 that will not become public until April 1, and then go forward with the March 1 sale anyway, saving himself from losing money when the bad news becomes public. Under the terms of Rule 10b5-1(b) this is insider trading because the CEO ""was aware"" of the inside information when he made the trade. But he can assert an affirmative defense under Rule 10b5-1(c), because he planned the trade before he learned the inside information.In general, it is a safer way for an insider to sell shares pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan than without it.Insider selling by calendar monthHere is a table of salesforce.com's insider-trading activity by calendar month.There have been 1,204,821 shares sold and there have been zero shares purchased by insiders this year.

Time to buy into his vision?New industry: the fused marketing systems cloudBIA Kelsey predicts social ad spending will jump 134 percent to $11 billion in five years. As consumers increasingly engage with brands across multiple social channels, business needs integrated social marketing platforms that help manage and monitor intricate ad campaigns.The answer will be a ""fused marketing systems"" cloud industry with spending of $30 billion, out of $500 billion ad spending worldwide. Salesforce has been building a portfolio of cloud services to create this new industry with recent mergers and acquisitions like:The growing collection of companies could turn the Salesforce Marketing Cloud portfolio into a true platform.Three deals show special promiseThe ExactTarget (NYSE:ET) acquisition for $2.5 billion might accelerate overall billing growth in 2014, from 19 percent to 25. Combined with a mostly in-line quarter, better enterprise fundamentals, improved sales execution, and new product launches, the ExactTarget deal acts as a positive catalyst for the second half of the company's fiscal 2014 year, causing Jefferies to raise its target price $2 to $52.With the social.com deal it added tools for managing ad campaigns delivered via social networks. Having this single domain gives clients a one-stop interface for creating and managing campaigns for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter, with over 1.5 billion users between them, thus tapping this large and growing opportunity. This makes the company a ""buy"" according to Motley Fool.Salesforce also announced a strategic alliance with Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), another of the largest cloud-based enterprise software companies, this one focused on human resource and financial software. But it is not done yet. Salesforce still needs to do more to build out this fused marketing business, like acquiring companies within sub-segments:As the largest and one of the earliest software-as-a-service firms, Salesforce.com defines a category and has delivered innovative products like Social Computing and Data.com. It's shown it can create industries like the service cloud.Salesforce' record of growthSalesforce was founded in 1999 to offer cloud-based solutions to businesses that focus on sales, service and marketing. Since the company went public in 2004, its shares have risen almost 1,000 percent, making the company worth more than $25 billion. Now its customer relationship management software defines an industry.By supporting a common hardware, networking, and software platform in the cloud Salesforce minimizes costs, letting customers avoid capital investments in on-premise equipment and software. Its customers seem eager to pay an operating expense to Salesforce instead: its revenue has been growing at a 48 percent annual rate, from $96 million in 2004, to $2.2 billion in 2012.Riding the 'third wave of computing'Salesforce shares, trading at 95 times 2014 estimated earnings, gained 27 percent in the last year. The company made a profit of $76.6 million last quarter, up from a $9.8 million loss a year ago. Revenue for the period ending in October is expected to be just over $1 billion, with a profit of 8 or 9 cents per share. Salesforce has been a year-to-date performance leader of peers in its sector, leading to expectations it will continue to outperform.Thirty seven out of 44 Wall Street analysts give CRM a ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" - but you have to ""buy into Marc Benioff's vision or else . . you're not going to own the stock,"" says Cramer.

1760592,55442,2013-10-22T13:42:17-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and other SAAS stocks have soared again in 2013. In addition to the expectation of achieving continued growth in the number of clients, investors are optimistic about the prospect of customers both developing custom applications to run on the Force.com platform and third party developers creating, selling and supporting niche applications. However, I think that the expectations for client uptake of third party vendor applications are unrealistic and could potentially create a significant liability for Salesforce.com in the future.When a business makes a decision to purchase a piece of software from a third party to perform a specific function or workflow task, it has a couple of key selection criteria: (1) Does the functionality meet the needs of the business? (2) What is the reliability of the software? (3) What is the cost of the software relative to the cost of how things are being done currently and relative to competing software products? (4) Is the software robust? Will it be updated to accommodate changes as the world changes and as the customer's business grows and changes? (5) Closely tied to #4 - Can the customer be confident that the vendor of the software will be around to maintain the software and provide services for the next 5-10 years?In the on-premise software world, customers pay software makers a license fee and then pay something called a maintenance fee (typically 18-22% of initial license cost paid on an annual basis) in exchange for software updates and customer support services. In the world of the cloud/SAAS, there is no upfront license fee per say (although customers will pay for implementation and customization) but everything (software cost and maintenance) is bundled into the monthly fee that is paid on an ongoing basis. Typically customers will investigate the financial health of a software vendor. This is one of the reasons software companies tend to have strong balance sheets with a lot of cash and very little, if any, debt. Customers want to be sure that a vendor will be around for the next 5, 10 or 20 years.While customers can see that Salesforce.com maintains an OK balance sheet with over $600 million in cash and another $300 million in non-current securities (though it has $1.8 billion in debt, a good portion of which is in the form of converts), the financial health of its third party vendors isn't very visible at all. While some customers will give 3rd party vendors the benefit of the doubt given their affiliation with Salesforce.com, IT directors tend to be fairly risk averse. Rarely are they lauded as superstars within their organizations when everything is up and running but they can certainly end up in the hot seat when something doesn't go according to plan. One of the things which can go wrong is that a third party application developer could go bankrupt. This creates uncertainty for customers. What happens when the maker of an app goes bust? Who services the customer? I don't believe there is a set protocol for these events. Given this risk, I suspect IT managers would be hesitant to invest too much into buying third party apps on Force.com.I wonder how Salesforce.com will deal with bankrupt application makers. Will it take on the responsibilities of the third party app providers by hiring people to update the apps and service the customers of the apps to try to maintain customer satisfaction? Or would the better course be to cut bait? It is a decision the company will have to make (probably not much of this happening now given the buoyant venture capital financing environment for developers) in the not-too-distant future.Should Salesforce.com opt to perform the responsibilities of its developer partners, I would think this could end up being a very costly endeavor which could impair profitability and draw heavily on the cash pile. Of course, with the stock approaching its 52-week high, this, like other questions about risk (or even the question of why this company hasn't achieved profitability yet) aren't being asked. While the market is suspending disbelief on Salesforce.com and SAAS in general, shares have soared. However, at some point, investors will start asking the tough questions again. When that happens it will be evident that the company's business model is unproven, there are potential contingent liabilities, and shares sell at extremely high multiples of revenue.

1730262,47391,2013-10-05T06:25:26-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) stock has surged in recent weeks and shows no immediate signs of stopping its rampant run up. The bullish sentiment is characteristic of a market top where fundamentals have no correlation with stock prices and investors predict only growth and future profits. SA author Paulo Santos wrote a recent article commenting on this dangerous trend using examples of fourteen grossly overvalued stocks whose price seems to defy gravity and whose buyers seem to lack common sense.Momentum traders are having a field day, and even the current government shutdown and the prospect, however remote, of a U.S. debt default no longer cause investors to pull in their horns. But the clock is ticking on the fuse to the time bomb that these companies represent and when the market corrects there will be blood on the floor for many speculators.How can one guess when the market might turn nasty? The old Wall Street saw ""The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent"" has some substance to it. Those who try to call the turns provide liquidity to those who stay conservative, a healthy situation where investment bankers and traders at hedge funds and Goldman Sachs have to make a living and could not do so without a plentiful supply of what Goldman calls ""muppets"" to prey upon.While it is hard to call the timing perfectly, the time is likely sooner rather than later and I expect a reversal in the next year. One indicator is the continued selling by insiders as illustrated by Executive Vice President Martinez Maria's sale of $1 million in stock just a couple of days ago, joining a parade of insiders who have sold recently while only one brave sole had the moxie to buy 200 shares. Another bearish indicator is the number of bullish analysts and recent upgrades. Analysts have universally recommended buying this stock this year with the most negative view stuck in neutral. If everyone followed the analysts' advice when it was given, the buying pressure must be getting a bit stale.Salesforce.com has done a great job of managing analysts' expectations to keep the bar as low as possible making a ""beat"" more like a limbo dance than a high jump. For the current quarter, the street expects income of between $0.07 and $0.10 per share versus $0.08 last year, and revenues of $1.05 to $1.07 billion, a 33.8% jump from the same period last year.The sales growth might sound impressive except that a part of the sales growth will come from inclusion of the revenues of ExactTarget which salesforce.com purchased for $2.5 billion cash on July 12, 2013. ExactTarget should add over $100 million sales to the quarter, given than ExactTarget's 2012 revenues were $292 million and the company has been growing at a rate of 50% annually. Adjusting for the ExactTarget acquisition by salesforce.com, the forecast revenues would be growing at a more modest 20% if they come in somewhere in the forecast range. Historic growth of salesforce.com revenues exceeds 25% so expect a beat on revenue this quarter.Profits will be a more interesting metric for the quarter since ExactTarget had yet to earn a profit at the time of the acquisition but was trending towards profitability. Salesforce.com before the ExactTarget acquisition rarely reported robust earnings and you might expect some of the acquisition costs to be expensed, although no doubt they will be part of the routine ""adding back"" of expenses salesforce.com makes part of its regular pattern of reporting adjusted earnings before such ""non-cash items"" as management stock option compensation. If management compensation is not an expense, I wonder what is.Given the bullish sentiment in the market and the absence of investor concern for negative trends, I don't expect saleforce.com stock to collapse on the earnings release this quarter unless it misses badly, and I think that unlikely.Fiscal 2015 will be the real challenge. With a portfolio of businesses growing intrinsically at less than 25% pre-ExactTarget and the analyst community expecting 28.7% growth next year, a lot will depend on the size of the ExactTarget contribution. According to Gartner, the total customer relationship management space is growing at half the rate salesforce.com has grown and with Microsoft, SAP, IBM and Oracle all taking a run at the space competition may also put a damper on salesforce.com growth.If there is a material sales miss in fiscal 2015, the lofty price of the salesforce.com stock will descend to earth like any punctured balloon.

1726272,55442,2013-10-02T16:56:25-04:00,,"Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) lofty valuation (8x this year's revenue) is predicated on the idea that eventually it will generate high operating margins like the 30-40% seen at Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (NYSE:SAP), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Is this a reasonable assumption? Let's use history as our guide. This is as much about Salesforce as it is about what I believe to be a bubble in the valuation of Software as a Service companies (note that we haven't seen a major takeout in this space since SAP bought Successfactors for $3.4 billion or 8x forward revs in early 2012). Without aggressive German takeouts, we are left with fundamentals..First, let me give the common long investment case:Salesforce.com has been wildly successful - look at the 10 year chart and the accompanying revenue growth which has made it the industry leader (14% share) from virtually nothing 10 years ago. It did $3 billion in revenue last year and will do $4 billion this year. When the company achieves scale we should see the 30-40% operating margins we see at Oracle /SAP. Software companies must spend a ton on marketing to generate 25-30% organic growth and can't generate operating profits while doing so. But looking forward to 2015-2016 we should have $6-7 billion in revenue and $2 billion in operating profit. Thus the $33-34 billion valuation (fully diluted), while expensive, isn't necessarily crazy. And we've got a lot of momentum.But at what point does a company achieve scale? Is it impossible to generate profitability/necessary to lose money while growing the top line at 25-50%? To answer these questions, I looked back at old financial statements of other software companies - Oracle, Microsoft, SAP from the early 1990s when they were doing $2-5 billion in revenue and growing 30-50%.Here is some Oracle history:Note the relatively low absolute revenue base, the high growth rate and…the strong operating margin.Here is German Enterprise Resource Planning leader SAP:The German Mark/$ exchange rate was 1.8 so you can see that with a small revenue base (~$600 million starting point) the company grew at a very fast rate (compound annual growth rate here is 52+%) while generating a high and increasing operating margin.Here is Microsoft:Ditto. Low absolute revenue base. High growth and strong operating margins.For those who weren't keeping score, we are 3 for 3. When Oracle, SAP, and Microsoft were much smaller companies ($2-4 billion in sales) they were able to grow at a fast rate (25-60%) and generate 20-35% operating margins. I looked up Peoplesoft (which was acquired by Oracle) and the story was the same. Note that accounting rules did not require stock options to be expensed in the mid 1990s. Thus operating margins are overstated by 6-800 basis points (adjusted range is really 15-27% operating margins).Salesforce doesn't have sufficient scale at $3-4 billion of revenue? Nonsense I say! The business isn't earning any money because either 1) its a bad business or (2) it is poorly run. There are a number of reasons to believe #1 - that Software as a service based Salesforce (with a large client base of small/midsized companies) will never be the type of software business that investors know and love/have loved (tough to argue that the market loves Oracle, SAP or Microsoft anymore but that's another discussion for another day). Reasons include: high structural churn (~15% vs. sub 5% for Oracle/SAP) because of 1) failure/acquisition in small/midsized company space (2) relatively low switching costs for Salesforce in general and software as a service specifically. While putting in an ORCL database/ERP system or SAP will take years (2-5 years) , cost tens if not hundreds of millions (not to mention organizational adaptation/training for system - interviews I've done w/ CEOs/CFOs suggest they'd almost never rip and replace an Enterprise Resource Planning system) this simply isn't the case with a Software as a service Customer Relationship Management system which can be deployed in a couple of months in some cases. High churn means Salesforce needs huge numbers of gross adds to grow. That is expensive. And if it's easy for customers to switch, it's easy for them to threaten to switch and haggle on price, thus depressing profitability.When the rose color comes out of the glasses and people start thinking of a 10-15% operating margin business (at best, after a management change/restructuring) on a ~$5 billion base we are looking at maybe $750 million of projected 2015/2016 operating profit at a multiple of 10-12x. So my valuation target here is <$20/share.Service Now (NYSE:NOW), Netsuite (NYSE:N), and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) which are all trading at huge multiples (20x!) of revenue, and losing money at the operating line under the guise of 'we need to spend to grow'. We are in a software as a service bubble fueled by the lie that it isn't possible to generate profits while growing. This simply isn't true. These companies business models simply aren't high margin models. I suspect we will see significant valuation compression over the medium term. I'm short a basket and see even greater downside in some of the smaller players.Disclosure:We/I am short CRM, NOW, WDAY, N and a few other SAAS companies.Disclosure: I am short CRM, NOW, N, WDAY.

Revenues came in ahead of consensus estimates of $937.8 million.The company reported GAAP earnings of $76.6 million which compares to a $9.8 million loss last year. Consensus estimates for GAAP losses stood at $90 million. The bottom line was boosted by a $129 million release of tax valuation allowances related to the ExactTarget acquisition. This ensured that GAAP earnings surpassed non-GAAP earnings for the quarter.GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.12, while non-GAAP earnings came in at $0.09 per share. This was ahead of consensus estimates of $0.07 per share.Non-GAAP earnings evaporate if one takes into account the quarterly $110 million in stock-based compensation. Although this does not result in cash outflows, it certainly causes dilution for shareholders.Looking Into The ResultsRevenue growth was driven by a 31.2% increase in subscription and support revenues totaling $902.8 million. Professional services revenues rose by 22.9% to $54.2 million.Deferred revenues rose by 34% to $1.79 billion, partially driven by the acquisition of ExactTarget. Unbilled deferred revenue was up by 36% to $3.80 billion.Gross margins fell by 55 basis points to 77.2% of total revenues. The costs for professional services kept rising, as cost for this service is now greater than revenues being generated with the activities. Gross margins fell on the back of the ExactTarget acquisition and a signed agreement with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) during the past quarter.At the same time, selling, general and administrative expenses rose by 180 basis points to 81.4% of total revenues. Cost increases in research and development and general administrative expenses outweighed the relative fall in marketing and sales expenditures.As such operating losses tripled to $39.9 million, coming in at 4.2% of total sales. The tax benefit was the sole reason Salesforce.com was able to report GAAP earnings of $76.6 million, or GAAP earnings of $0.12 per share.Looking Ahead To The Remainder Of The YearSalesforce.com sees third quarter revenues between $1.05 and $1.055 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are seen between $0.08 and $0.09 per share, while GAAP losses are expected to come in between $0.18 and $0.19 per share. The discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is mostly driven by an expected $139 million in stock based compensation.Analysts were looking for non-GAAP earnings of $0.07 per share on revenues of $1.043 billion.Full year revenues are now seen between $4.00 and $4.025 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are seen between $0.32 and $0.34 per share. GAAP losses are seen between $0.42 and $0.44 per share on the back of $511 million in expected stock-based compensation expenses.The full year guidance is in line with consensus estimates.ValuationSalesforce.com ended the second quarter with $930 million in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company operates with $300 million in regular debt and $1.57 billion in convertible debt, for a net debt position of almost $1 billion.Revenues for the first six months of the year came in at $1.85 billion, up 30% on the year before. Thanks to the tax valuation allowance, Salesforce.com managed to report GAAP earnings of $8.9 million, compared to a $29.3 million loss last year.Trading around $47 per share, the market values Salesforce.com at around $28 billion. This values the company's assets around 7 times guided annual revenues.Salesforce.com does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveLong-term investors are grateful to Marc Benioff as shares have ten-folded over the past decade. Shares have risen from $4 in 2003 to highs of around $20 in 2008.Shares sold off to $5 later that year amidst the financial crisis but have steadily risen to all-time highs of $47 earlier this year Shares are re-testing these all time highs at the moment following the earnings report.Between the calendar year of 2009 and 2012, the company increased its annual revenues by a cumulative 133% to $3.05 billion. An $80 million profit evaporated into a $270 million loss last year.Investment ThesisSo far Salesforce.com has done it again. The company's upbeat comments continue to spark enthusiasm among the investment community which has sent shares to fresh all time highs.Investors were cautious following the $2.5 billion acquisition of e-mail marketing provider ExactTarget last month. The company continues to focus on marketing tools alongside customer-management software, all driven by the cloud opportunities. Benioff also commented that larger acquisitions like that of ExactTarget were needed as small deals didn't bring in much revenue.The company continues to bet on the future outlook that IT budgets will flow toward Chief Marketing Officers, away from Chief Technology Officers. The company focuses on sales cloud, marketing cloud, service cloud as well as the overall platform and will more aggressively market to larger enterprises.As such the company sees enormous potential to upgrade services with existing customers. Salesforce.com is benefiting that unlike Oracle and SAP (NYSE:SAP) the company has a much better performance in the cloud, social marketing tools and the mobile environment.The growth is impressive, especially for a company the size of Salesforce.com. Still I'm a bit worried about the valuation at 7 times annual revenues, or $28 billion in total. I'm worried about the possibility to transform these revenues into cold cash for shareholders.Non-GAAP earnings are seen around $200 million, valuing the business at an incredible 140 times annual earnings. This excludes $500 million in annual stock based compensation expenses, which is not a cash outflow, but actually does dilute shareholders' interest. Otherwise losses are seen around $250 million per annum.For now Benioff has proved me wrong, but I think the high valuation in combination with aggressive accounting, a focus on non GAAP earnings vs. GAAP earnings, and a strong public relations effort boost the current prospects too much.I remain cautious and stay on the sidelines with a bearish stance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1699312,38201,2013-09-17T15:34:07-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (CRM) pioneered the use of cloud in Customer Relationship Management, or CRM, software and is continuing that pursuit. Last year the company had a share of 14% in the CRM market, topping the list of CRM vendors. The demand for cloud-based CRM software is increasing this year because of the increased usage of Software as a Service, or SaaS. The areas experiencing the demand for CRM are marketing, sales automation, and social media. Salesforce.com already has a presence in marketing automation through its service offering, Marketing Cloud, and it is strengthening this service offering by increasing the service functionalities.It looks as if it hit the right targetSalesforce.com completed the acquisition of Exact Target in July this year to strengthen its email marketing services. Exact Target is into digital marketing and generates most of its revenue from e-mail and social media marketing. The email marketing services is a component of the ""Marketing Cloud."" This acquisition will further strengthen Salesforce.com in the marketing automation business. Exact Target adds digital marketing capabilities like personalized e-mail marketing, and when combined with Salesforce.com's Marketing Cloud, it will better enable the company to penetrate email, social, mobile, and web platforms. More than 6,000 customers worldwide use Exact Target's solutions.The shift from offline marketing to online marketing is driving companies to spend more on email and social media marketing. The trend in online marketing spending is shown below.Source: eMarketerAs the online advertisement spending by various companies' increases, Salesforce.com's email customization services will provide additional revenue growth. According Radicati Group, the number e-mails generated per day last year was 144.8 billion out of which 89 billion, or 61.46%, were business emails. The numbers of business e-mails are expected to increase to 143.8 billion by the end of 2016. Emails are more effective than offline advertising mediums since they are easy to customize from customer to customer.The Marketing PlatformThe increasing demand for data analysis has led to the creation of the marketing automation platform. Salesforce's acquired Pardot from Exact Target to leverage the power of data and provide marketing solutions to its clients. Pardot, a marketing automation platform, helps companies execute and analyze sales and marketing decisions. The Pardot platform will create a larger market for Marketing Cloud; it will extend the marketing automation services offered to business to customer, or B2C, companies like Universal Music Group, Coca-Cola (KO) and Nike (NKE), etc. The increase in the usage of social networks, mobile devices and new digital technologies is leading a revolution in marketing spending.Social media campaigns are becoming an increasingly important aspect in brand building and awareness for these companies. Marketing on social media is becoming a significant part of companies' marketing budgets. According to a survey by The Creative Group, around 62% of advertising and marketing executives are expecting to increase their spending on Facebook marketing over the next 12 months compared to 53% last year. This is the underlying driver for the Pardot platform, which has the ability to provide marketing solutions for businesses.The competitionThe closest competitors of Salesforce.com are SAP (SAP) and Oracle (ORCL). SAP acquired Hybris this year to compete in the CRM space. Hybris designed a platform that can provide various marketing and sales related functions across mobile and web platforms. Hybris served a customer base of around 500 during the time of its acquisition. Through this acquisition, SAP made its entry into the enterprise e-commerce business.Oracle also made its entry into the marketing automation business through the acquisition of Eloqua in February this year. Eloqua is a marketing automation platform that helps in the implementation of marketing decisions. Eloqua and Pardot differ at multiple points. Eloqua has a built in ""Social Suite"" that helps extract, analyze and generate results from data available from social sites like Twitter, Facebook, etc. On the other hand, Pardot also scans data available on the social networking websites in its two versions, Pardot Enterprise and Ultimate Edition.A second point of difference is the way these two software options provide analytics and reporting of data. Salesforce.com collaborates with another company, which develops the software for the analysis and reporting and incorporates it into the Pardot system. This results in a significant cost reduction for the Pardot system since the software development is carried out by another company. On the other hand, Eloqua's software for data analytics and reporting is developed by Oracle. The in-house developed software costs more since the company must employ resources. We find that the social marketing functionalities of both platforms have similarities, which could lead to competition between the two companies, but Pardot has the cost advantage.Salesforce.com's Pardot platform is an effective tool for marketing automation at effective cost compared to its competitor. Although Salesforce.com has a lead on the development of marketing automation tools compared to SAP, it may receive stiff competition from Oracle.As we have discussed, Salesforce.com is taking definitive steps toward capturing a large share of the overall marketing automation business. Its early entry will definitely provide the company an advantage over its competitors. According to Raab Associates, marketing automation is expected to reach $750 million by the end of 2013, registering a growth of 50% over last year. Looking at Salesforce.com's marketing automation initiatives, we expect that the company can capture more than 14% market share this year in the CRM business.What we expectSource: Yahoo FinanceThe above table shows that the PEG ratio of Salesforce.com is much higher compared to that of SAP and Oracle. Salesforce.com's growth is more than twice that of SAP and Oracle because the company is releasing products that are at par or better than the competition. We have seen how the company is tapping into the growing opportunity of business email. Also, the company's Pardot platform will help organizations automate their marketing functions. The Pardot platform is expected to receive wide acceptability among businesses because of its functionalities in social media data analysis and cost effectiveness. This definitive focus on the marketing automation business will drive the company into a high growth phase.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1665582,23625,2013-08-29T18:19:59-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is expected to report FQ2 2014 earnings on Aug. 29 after the close. The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for CRM to report 8 cents EPS and $937.29M in revenue while the current Estimize consensus from 20 contributing analysts is 9 cents EPS and $942.07M in revenue. While the Wall Street consensus is comprised of only sell-side analysts who, in many cases, have a significant bias regarding their estimates, the Estimize consensus is comprised of buy-side and independent analysts who don't suffer from the same incentive structure issues. The Estimize consensus ends up being more accurate than the Wall Street consensus 70% of the time, and far better represents the true expectation of the market.  Over the past four months the Wall Street consensus trend for EPS has been negative, moving from 12 cents to 8 cents while the the Wall Street consensus trend for revenue has been positive, moving from $934.81M to $937.29. For many stocks, the trend in consensus is highly correlated to equity direction. Over the previous eight quarters, CRM has beaten the Wall Street consensus for EPS five times, while beating the Wall Street revenue consensus for all eight reports. Over the same time period, CRM has beaten the Wall Street consensus for EPS five times while beating the Wall Street revenue consensus on seven occasions.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on Estimize range from 8 cents to 11 cents EPS and $932.05M to $952.29M in revenues. The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A wider distribution signaling the potential for greater volatility post earnings.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is 1nvestor, who projects 8 cents EPS and $938.1M in revenue. Based on the Estimize and Wall Street data, CRM looks set to report solid numbers. Rising revenue consensus into the report should give investors confidence in the top-line expectations. Based on the wide distribution in the consensus and the relatively large delta between the Wall Street and Estimize Revenue consensus, there may be information not priced into the market at this point to take advantage of."

1668212,26031,2013-09-01T15:12:43-04:00,,"It has been 16 months since I wrote about Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and laid out my thesis for being long, and after another stellar quarter, it seems appropriate to revisit this thesis. Is Salesforce still exciting? When I first wrote about Salesforce in April 2012, shares of the company were trading at an all-time high of almost $39 per share, and I questioned whether it could continue to grow and meet its forecasts. I surmised that the answer is yes, and explained how I saw the market evolving before my very eyes. My opinion has changed dramatically since last April, and given the current circumstances, I believe a revisit is in order.I'm still long CRM. At the time this is being written, Salesforce shares are trading at roughly $50 per share, representing a ~28% return in 16 months, and I believe there is much room to grow. As I mentioned, things have changed drastically. Whereas Salesforce was barely being adopted by enterprise clients a year ago, today many of those clients have either partially or fully adopted Salesforce-based solutions. We can see this trend in a number of places. First, large enterprise clients tend to follow full-year billing cycles, and this trend typically gives Salesforce a larger fourth quarter. Revenues for Q4 2013 were roughly $2.7 billion, a 40% increase from Q4 2012. Unbilled, deferred revenue was approximately $3.5 billion for FY13, approximately $1.3 billion higher than FY12. Longer contractual commitments by enterprise customers is contributing to this figure. A second place where this is evident is the client lists of some of the large Salesforce integrators. Whereas their client lists were once a collection of small- and mid-market players, today they sport mega brands and enterprises. As a matter of fact, the largest integrators of Salesforce are actually Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Deloitte, a strong indicator of the maturing nature of the market. Finally, Keith Block, formerly a vocal sales executive with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), is a great example of the type of hires that indicate this direction, as well as the deal with Oracle that followed (or coincided with) this hiring. The deal allows Salesforce to use Oracle's software and Exadata computers, and allows Oracle to use Salesforce's customer-management software. Salesforce is maturing.Moreover, once a siloed platform, Salesforce has quickly evolved into a hotbed of innovation for third-party developers, and it has spurred an active market of integrators for support. The number of useful packages on the Salesforce platform is simply staggering and impressive. Simply put, developers are using the core platform in ways that the company never imagined, and Salesforce is enjoying a huge boost in interest from the professional community. There are many examples of this type of innovation such as new geo-location services or specific integrations packages. However, I am most impressed with the level of interest from the younger - i.e. teen - developer community. I am sure that Dreamforce 2013 will be massive!Salesforce is actively developing this market both through direct investments and supported events, is becoming an ongoing developing partner, and is constantly rolling out further support tools. Clearly it is committed to building out this platform for many years. The partnership with Good Technology announced this week is also very significant, as it will allow for the development of secure and productive mobile enterprise solutions on the Salesforce platform.What about the financials? Have they changed? Well, no. Essentially, the market has already chilled its expectations with regard to future guidance, and I expect this trend to continue. Lowered EPS numbers are concerning, however. 31% YoY growth in top line will continue to spark my expectations as well as that of many other investors. Recall that Salesforce's core platform, should it be spun off as a separate entity, is profitable. It is only after we consider the costs of developing additional business lines which will make the company competitive for many years to come that the company turns into the red. Revenue for the period ending October is around $1.05 - $1.06 billion, and profit will be in the 8 to 9 cents range. Operating cash is also up 34%, to $183 million. Unlike last earnings report, guidance is higher for next year, and the company is raising its forecast to $4-$4.03 billion, partially due to the recently completed ExactTarget acquisition which is expected to add another $140+ million to the top line, as well as the addition of a few very large enterprise clients. The purchase of ExactTarget shows how aggressive the company is getting in the Marketing Cloud space. However, it's probably worth noting that Salesforce took a $300 million loan to finance part of that purchase, potentially indicating less of an appetite for external growth. Does this mean anything? Probably not. The company has continued along its rapid expansion path, and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future.I have a lot of faith in that future market. I see it continuing to develop and I see the amount of money being made by companies with which I am involved by supporting the Salesforce platform. The dichotomy between large-scale, enterprise solutions, and self-serve platforms has become even more pronounced. The vast majority of new clients are shying away from the likes of SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle, or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and, to reiterate, so are many traditional enterprise clients. If the competition in this space, companies like SugarCRM, or ZohoCRM, were gaining significant ground (I don't view Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) as a direct competitor), I might be more cautious. However, this is not the case, and although alternative platforms are becoming more popular, Salesforce enjoys a virtual monopoly.As I stated in the onset, I'm still long CRM. I believe that Salesforce will continue to surprise traditional investors, and will continue to be a leading enterprise cloud services provider for many years to come.Disclosure: I am long CRM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1712402,20521,2013-09-25T09:31:16-04:00,,"According to Gartner’s Forecast: Enterprise Software Markets, Worldwide, 2012-2017, 2Q13 Update, worldwide spending on enterprise software is projected to grow 6% this year to $304 billion. Within the market, Gartner projects CRM market to be a fast growing market with an estimated annual growth rate of 15% over the period 2012 through 2017. A quarter ago, Gartner had projected this market to grow 9.7% annually over the same period.Salesforce’s FinancialsLeading CRM services provider, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is already witnessing strong revenue growth. Q2 revenues grew 31% over the year to $957 million, significantly ahead of the market’s projections of $937 million as it continues to add big names like Johnson & Johnson and Juniper Networks to its customer list. However, the loss for the quarter widened to $0.09 per share missing the Street’s projections of a loss of $0.04 per share for the quarter. The increase in losses was attributed to increase in R&D and sales and marketing expenses. R&D expenses grew 36% to $161 million and sales expenses grew 26% to $480.6 million.By segment, revenues from subscription and support services grew 31% over the year to $902.8 million. Professional Services and Other revenues grew 23% over the year to $54.3 million.By region, revenues in the Americas grew 34% over the year. Despite economic concerns, the European market grew 39% over the year while Asia Pacific was the slowest growing region with 6% annual growth.For the current quarter, Salesforce projected revenues of $1.050-$1.055 with EPS of $0.08-$0.09. It raised its fiscal projections to revenues of $4–$4.025 billion with an EPS of $0.32-$0.34. The market was looking for revenues of $1.043 billion for the quarter with earnings of $0.07 per share. It had pegged the company’s fiscal revenues at $4 billion with EPS of $0.33.Salesforce’s Expanding Cloud OfferingsSalesforce recently entered into a partnership with another SaaS provider, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY). As part of the partnership, the two will standardize all of their solutions for each other’s applications to help improve performance analysis and identify trends in customer relationships. Customers will also be able to receive direct updates from Workday through Salesforce Chatter to ensure greater security. The integration will also help speed up decision making by customers of both companies due to a faster availability of financial and operational performance data. Greater terms of the deal have not been disclosed. This is an interesting partnership given that neither company is on very friendly terms with Oracle, which is expanding its own cloud and analytics offering.Earlier this month, Salesforce also announced the release of its file sharing service, Salesforce Files. Salesforce had a similar offering earlier called the Chatterbox where users could share files over Salesforce Chatter. But the new offering enables anyone using Salesforce’s sales, service, or marketing software tools to access and share files residing in third-party storage applications such as Microsoft’s SharePoint and Google Drive without opening a separate application.Last month, Salesforce also expanded its marketing offerings by acquiring e-mail marketing service, ExactTarget for an estimated $2.5 billion. Through the acquisition, Salesforce will be able to enable customers to connect with end consumers across sales, service and marketing services on all platforms including email, social, mobile and the web. Salesforce hopes to be able to offer one of the most comprehensive marketing automation solutions as it will now have access to ExactTarget’s social marketing capabilities, which will complement its sales, service and platform solutions.Marketing automation tools and services are a hot market these days. Last year end, Oracle acquired Eloqua, another marketing services provider, for  an estimated $871 million, to improve its relationship marketing program. Last year, ExactTarget, through its acquisition of Pardot, had expanded its B2B marketing automation services. Pardot brought to the table additional capabilities to create, deploy, and manage online marketing campaigns. The move had also helped ExactTarget being labeled a “visionary” according to Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for CRM Lead Management. Salesforce should surely benefit from this acquisition.Salesforce has benefited tremendously from its platform strategy. I wrote a piece this week in Harvard Business Review on corporate incubation called When Big Companies Support Start-ups, Both Make More Money. There is still enormous headroom for it to grow in this arena, and I don’t think the opportunity is lost on Marc Benioff. Judging by its recent investment in Apttus, a company that has built on the Force.com platform, and has become quite successful, Salesforce is aware of the vast potential of the platform strategy. Investing aggressively in incubating these start-ups would yield handsomely for the company.The market is pleased with Salesforce’s growing cloud capabilities. The stock is trading at $52.35 with a market capitalization of $31.20 billion. It touched a life high of $54.25 soon after the quarter’s result announcement."
1666532,47391,2013-08-30T10:05:54-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported another quarter of stellar growth yesterday. The stock took off in after-market trade notching an 8% gain, painful for shorts like me.Sales for the quarter were up 31% over the prior year at $937 million. Despite the growth, the company reported an operating loss of $57 million for the quarter, wider than the $14 million operating loss in the same period last year. Operating ratios were behind the loss, with the combination of cost of revenues and operating expenses widening to 104% of sales.It is useful to look at year to date results on an incremental basis. Revenues of $1,850 million were up from $1,427 million in 2012, an increase of $423 million. In parallel, operating expenses rose to $1,507 billion from $1,149 billion, a rise of $358 million. Cost of revenues also rose to $427 million from $314 million, up $113 million. Taken together, the incremental operating expenses and cost of revenue amounted to $471 million, outstripping the rise in revenue of $423 million by $48 million. As a result the operating losses widened to $84 million from $36 million.You can spin the numbers anyway you want to, but the fact is this company continues to lose money despite its rapid growth. The company gave guidance for the balance of the year as follows:Salesforce.com now has a balance sheet encumbered by debt, a result of the ExactTarget acquisition for cash of $2.5 billion. To be specific, debt now includes a term loan of $300 million; convertible 0.75% senior notes of $534 million and convertible 0.25% senior notes of $1,035 million or a total of close to $1.9 billion. Current liabilities of $3.1 billion exceed current assets of $1.7 billion.In a September 19, 2012 presentation, salesforce.com projected that it takes six to nine quarters for new hires to contribute to profits.(Click to enlarge)The company has definitely been investing in more people.(Click to enlarge)But the profit contribution is not yet apparent, with losses forecast for the balance of this fiscal year at least. Investors in salesforce.com have bought into the company's plan and the stock has done very well for them, reaching over $47 in the pre-market trade today after a 20% plus gain year to date.(Click to enlarge)Surprisingly, insiders seem to have been oblivious to the company's success, dumping stock hand over fist, buying only 200 shares while selling 885,088 shares in the past 6 months.(Click to enlarge)You have to wonder what they were thinking. What is pretty obvious is that management and directors are taking every advantage of the option program to make sure they benefit in real time from the company's current ""success"", exercising options and selling shares throughout August of this year.(Click to enlarge)The fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2013. Throughout the last week in August insiders were selling. The company released its results August 29th after the close of trading. Is it possible that the insiders selling had some knowledge of the results before entering into their sell transactions? Is it possible they were less impressed with the company's results than the street? It is a good question.Certainly Frank Van Veenendaal, Hilarie Koplow, George Hu, Parker Harris and Graham Smith had some idea. Van Veenendaal is Executive Vice Chairman; Koplow is President of Global Sales; Hu is Chief Operating Officer; Harris is Co-Founder; and, Smith is CFO. Too bad they missed out on the 8% rise after the results were published the next day. Possibly, they were less sanguine about the market's reaction to the results and did not want to be present if the stock tanked. I am sure there is some legal loophole that protects them from an allegation of insider trading but it is hard to avoid the thought that they might have waited a day or two until the rest of the investors had some insight into the results before dumping their stock. In addition to their leaving well over $1 million on the table by selling on the eve of the results they ran the risk of leaving a bad taste in some investors mouths by trading with knowledge not yet made public.For my money, this company's operating performance is unimpressive. Sales growth that is less than expense growth rarely produces long term benefits. Insiders who exercise their stock options and can't wait to unload their stock do not inspire confidence. And, the balance sheet trend is ominous with a working capital deficit of over $1 billion.I have been short the stock for some time, hedged by writing puts. The gains on the put positions have mitigated my losses on the short position, effectively increasing the price at which I am short. I will continue this trade because, at least in my opinion, the time will come to pay the piper.Disclosure: I am short CRM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1702792,24550,2013-09-19T10:41:13-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) Wednesday (Sept. 18) announced a deeper relationship to ""join"" both companies' enterprise cloud software products. This announcement has all the standard integration talk, which sounds good for joint customers of course, but also spent some time making it clear that each company was using / planning on using the products of the other. In fact there's not a lot new in the announcement itself. Workday will integrate its HCM, financial and analytic applications to Salesforce Sales, Service and Marketing clouds. Salesforce will integrate Chatter more broadly into Workday as well. Both executives, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Workday Co-CEO Aneel Bhusri, affirmed the ongoing partnership that the two have had for several years, and agreed that each company would ""standardize"" on the products offered by the other, since there's no functional overlap between the two companies, and both had already been using some of the products anyway.The announcement though, is perhaps more interesting for a few other reasons, including:What does it mean? Well, in truth maybe not much. Pre-integrating products is certainly good for joint customers, who would save the expense of custom integration. That same pre-integration, when trying to cross sell, is a pretty good sales tool as well. As an aside, reducing the amount of integration work is probably not something the system integrator partners of both firms enjoyed hearing. Cloud applications are already reducing the amount of implementation work by quite a bit, removing integration from the revenue stream is just another reduction. I will say though, I'll reserve judgment on that until the integrations are released and I talk to a few happy customers; prepackaged integrations are notoriously tough.It's clear that Salesforce is looking for ways to leverage partnerships to gain momentum and growth, which is no surprise either. Partnering with both companies, Workday and Oracle, doesn't really seem like a bad idea from Salesforce's perspective, and any joint customers would benefit as well. Of course all of Salesforce.com's applications compete head-to-head with Oracle, but not with Workday. For me I'm most curious how Salesforce plans to operate on Oracle Fusion HCM and Financials + Workday HCM and Financials; that's a lot of overlapping software..."
1482511,25096,2013-06-05T12:06:35-04:00,,"Wall Street history is littered with highly promotional and misleading salesmen preying on the greed of short-term speculators to benefit their own interests. Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) CEO Marc Benioff has parlayed a robust personality, a sheep-herd of an analyst community, and a momentum-based investor base to expand his company and personal fortune. The company boasts commodity-like products, abysmal profitability and atrocious capital allocation, yet trades at one of the highest multiples in the market on non-existent earnings. While market participants' willingness to value the company at astonishingly high levels has unquestionably helped Salesforce.com's competitive position, the laws of fundamental finance will eventually kick in, and it will be the company's shareholders who are left holding the bag. I've written about Salesforce.com's overvaluation before so this article will touch more on the recent acquisition and the absurdity that I consider Salesforce.com's accounting to be.On June 4th, Salesforce.com agreed to acquire ExactTarget (NYSE:ET-OLD) in a transaction valued at approximately $2.5 billion. With Salesforce.com selling at 9.1 times book value, you'd think Benioff would utilize stock to acquire the company but instead he is paying all cash. Considering the fact that Salesforce issues stock like it is going out of style, I would speculate that ExactTarget's management was wary of what obviously is an overvalued currency and chose to wisely opt for cash. For $2.5 billion, Salesforce.com shareholders got a company with 2012 revenue of $292MM, operating losses of $20MM and net losses of $21MM. In fact, this company has been a consistent money loser in every year since it went public in 2009. Perhaps you are thinking that this business is blessed with tremendous proprietary advantages and that the value is masked behind short-term losses that will likely lead to long-term financial success. Just Google email marketing companies, which is what ExactTarget, is and you'll see that this is just another commodity offering with terrible margins. Marc Benioff said that this acquisition was the most important in its history, which it may well be, but I believe future write-offs of intangible assets are a likely probability.Salesforce.com has a stated goal of being the number 1 cloud company in the world and it is doing everything in its power to achieve that goal. Attaining size without regards to the cost of doing is the hallmark of an entrenched management concerned with their own interests, as opposed to those of shareholders. These acquisitions are great for management because they are able to command a higher salary, issue more super-cheap stock options below market value and improve a below-average competitive position through adding additional products and services that can be cross-sold to customers. Shareholders would be much better served if Salesforce.com used its inflated currency to buy profitable and undervalued businesses, even if they are unrelated to the cloud. Salesforce.com boasts a very effective and highly paid sales force, so there is tremendous logic in leveraging it to further their cross-sell efforts. The problem arises when Salesforce.com's highly promoted accounting metrics disregard the true costs of its acquisitions and the salaries for the sales team, which have directly negative implications for long-term shareholders' interests.The key to understanding the charade that Salesforce.com's management promotes to boost the share price is to understand what constitutes the company's non-GAAP earnings, and then looking at the business strategy that takes advantage of the bogus accounting. Salesforce.com defines non-GAAP net income as its total income excluding the following components, which the company believes are not reflective of its ongoing operational expenses. These components are the following: Stock-Based Expenses, Amortization of Purchased Intangibles, Amortization of Debt Discount, One-Time Tax Charges and Income Tax Effects and Adjustments. So let's think about things clearly to really grasp what is going on. Salesforce.com is a growth story only based on revenue growth because there is no earnings to speak of whatsoever. Acquisitions will certainly boost revenue growth while the conscientious decision to ignore amortization costs clearly hides the impact of the excessive prices paid to acquire this in-organic growth. Other companies use similar metrics and often we see large write-offs at some points such as with Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) disastrous Autonomy acquisition and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) aQuantive purchase. The fact that Salesforce.com hasn't reported substantial write-offs despite a clear lack of profitability is alarming to me and I'd be very curious to understand their accountant's justification of this.The second phase of the charade is what truly bothers me in relation to the stock-related compensation being excluded from consideration as an operating expense. Stock-related compensation has averaged close to 10% of total revenue over the last three years. This is a huge expense and is a major reason why shareholders have been diluted dramatically over the years. Think if the New York Yankees or LA Lakers paid the majority of their players with stock options instead of cash and used Salesforce.com's absurd accounting standards. The profit margins would be stupendous but of course the owners would be diluted. As a private business, shareholders would be irate believing that their long-term profit potential is being hurt by these actions, as would sensible shareholders if the teams were traded publicly. It takes a complicit Wall Street to ensure that this type of charade can continue and all you need to do is read the transcripts of the Salesforce.com conference calls to see the different atmosphere that pervades them. It works even better when an inflated currency is used to acquire real assets, albeit at inflated prices, and then the only accounting metric (amortization of goodwill) that measures the disconnect between price paid and measurable value, (outside of profitability attained through synergies which are non-existent thus far) are excluded from non-GAAP earnings. All of these actions serve management and the company itself, as it is easier to justify exorbitant salaries due to the increased size of the enterprise.There has been a long running debate in regards to stock options, as to whether they are an expense or not and how to value them if they are deemed so. Often the argument is examined only in the context of one interest group, but it is important to break it down to the various interest groups involved in a publicly traded security. For shareholders, stock options are unquestionably an expense due to the dilution that they cause to shareholders' existing equity stakes in the company. For creditors, stock options are a tremendous asset in that cash is preserved, which means that interest and principal payments are more likely to be made than if stock options weren't used. For management, stock options often are granted at super-cheap prices below market values, and give the recipients huge upside with virtually no downside. For the average employee, stock options can be a benefit if the stock performs well, but when compensation is skewed towards equity options it can also have disastrous consequences when that stock comes out of favor, negating the value of years of hard work. It is laughable to me that the technology industry is the only real industry where there is a widespread promotion of adjusted earnings excluding stock options. This might be appropriate in a fixed income presentation, but it is a promotional concept driven by many of the same constituencies that drove the excessive speculation in the late 1990s. Valuing the options is exceptionally difficult but I believe the current model using Black-Scholes is as good as any other that can be reasonably used.In summary, I'm very surprised that there has not been more activist involvement in Salesforce.com. I personally don't like taking the short side of an investment, but I will from time to time sell deep out of the money calls with the willingness to go short if the odds are stacked in my favor, and I have done so successfully in the past with CRM. Because I don't currently have a stake in the company in either direction, I find myself objecting to the misleading tactics of management and what I rightly or wrongly believe to be incompetence by the majority of analysts covering the stock. It is interesting how when Bill Ackman's presentation against Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) made headlines implicating the company as a pyramid scheme, market commentators jumped on the story but very little is said about something, that in my estimation, seems far more ill-conceived and misleading. The key is differentiating between constituencies as opposed to looking at a company, management, creditors and shareholders as all having the same interests. Salesforce.com is maximizing the company and management's interests and shareholders are in the worst position. The stock market can make a rational person look like a fool over reasonably long periods of time, which is why I'm not short, but I openly encourage a discussion with Salesforce bulls or analysts on why my argument is wrong.Disclosure: I am long MSFT, HPQ.

1483621,24550,2013-06-05T17:27:07-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) announced its intent to acquire email marketing and marketing automation vendor ExactTarget (NYSE:ET-OLD) for ~$2.5B or $33.75/share, ending a few years' worth of speculation as to which marketing automation vendor it would eventually acquire. The leading contender up until last December was marketing automation heavyweight Eloqua (NASDAQ:ELOQ), but Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) ended that line of thinking by acquiring it for $871M, or $23.50/share. The field was still fairly ripe with candidates including the other market leader, Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO), which just went public last month.Other contenders could have included Responsys (NASDAQ:MKTG), Silverpop, and Yesmail. While Marketo might have seemed the most obvious target after Eloqua was swept off the table, there's a sense that it would have always been expensive and particularly now after the very successful IPO. Among the other contenders though, ExactTarget had something that the others were lacking -- strong marketing automation capabilities from a product that was acquired last October, Pardot. Although only a slightly under $100M acquisition, Pardot is a big part of the whole deal in my opinion.Make no bones about it, the price is high. That makes one wonder if there was, as Salesforce hinted yesterday, another bidder. Who that bidder might have been, though, is a little perplexing. Both SAP (NYSE:SAP) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) need a marketing automation solution, but neither seemed very interested in ExactTarget -- although what happens behind closed doors is anyone's guess. In SAP's case I admit that I've thought for a while that Marketo might be its target acquisition, particularly after Oracle bought Eloqua. I suppose the other bidder could also have been Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), but, again, that's blind guessing.So why all the interest in marketing automation software all of a sudden? It's what I'd call the CMO opportunity. The leading enterprise trend today is focused on customer experience (CX), and the CMO is emerging as the key executive in most company's CX strategy. And the CMO role is in flux, requiring many CMO's to work way out of their comfort zone with lots of new digital marketing technology. In fact, in many companies the CMO is starting to feel like the chief digital officer. Many CMOs are now managing quite large technology budgets and struggling to solve a deluge of new marketing and CX problems.Today, there are few ""complete"" solutions available for CMOs that are integrated and flexible to fit a changing/evolving CX strategy. This has led many marketing executives to end up with a fragmented and complex environment of disparate technology that does not solve their problem. CRM vendors are starting to respond and put together solutions and the battle ground is heating up significantly.Salesforce had moved over the past couple of years to add social marketing capabilities by buying social media monitoring/analytics vendor Radian6 and Buddy Media, but this still left a large hole in the middle of the marketing cloud. This deal is designed to strengthen the marketing cloud around the social assets by adding strong lead management, email marketing, and marketing automation. Salesforce needs to broaden its offering in the marketing cloud, which it had not really addressed in a comprehensive manner in the past. Its SFA offering is seen as very strong -- after all, it started with this pillar and in recent years it has added significant capabilities to its Service Cloud -- but core marketing remained a question that now has an answer.The addition of core marketing automation, lead management, etc., to the Salesforce marketing cloud should help position it more effectively against some of its key competitors -- most specifically against Oracle, which has acquired several cloud assets for marketing over the past 18 months and has assembled a very strong set of capabilities (although it is still in the process of integrating some of the solution). The acquisition should also put pressure on SAP and IBM to add to their cloud marketing portfolios, which may lead to more acquisitions shortly.The big question will be how tightly Salesforce decides to integrate ExactTarget into the rest of the Salesforce platform, something that for now is an open question -- especially since it was indicated that ExactTarget will continue to operate as a standalone entity. Still, I expect to see some aggressive moves by Salesforce to go after its own customer base and compete more directly with Marketo and Oracle in marketing."
1485791,24462,2013-06-06T14:28:13-04:00,,"A few days ago, after Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) announced its $2.5 billion cash acquisition of Exact Target, Inc. (NYSE:ET-OLD), Jim Cramer asked a question to CEO Marc Benioff about the concept of adding back stock compensation to CRM. I would have asked the question a little bit more directly by simply asking ""Why do you add back stock-based compensation to your GAAP EPS?"" Jim took a different approach but at least he brought up the subject:Cramer's Question:The Answer, If You Can Call it That (I've emboldened all the superlatives):Adding back stock compensation to GAAP EPS is a ludicrous exercise and the fact that Wall Street analysts go along with this concept, in my view, is scandalous. Salesforce.com is not alone in taking this approach but it is one of the most visible. In its most recent quarter, stock-based compensation of $115 million represented a whopping 12.9% of $893 million in sales.However, after examining this a little more in depth, I believe I can come up with a valid theory to support CRM's view and this is how it works. When a profitable company gives out free shares to its employees, current shareholders are diluted and EPS declines. So there is clearly a negative effect on the income statement. However, what if a company's business plan is to aggressively grow revenues but never earn a profit. Well that assumption changes the picture entirely with regard to stock-based compensation. Suddenly, handing out all these shares just is not so bad anymore. If a company anticipates losses indefinitely, every share of stock that a company gives out now actually increases EPS by spreading these losses over a wider shareholder base. The EPS loss contracts and EPS rises! Could this be CRM's justification?Those of you, and there are many, who have been critical of CRM's treatment of stock-based compensation and other aggressive accounting treatments, like adding back the amortization of goodwill, may just want to take another look at this issue.Disclosure: I am short CRM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1482421,48501,2013-06-05T11:38:25-04:00,,"There are a couple of portions to this article. One is about the bright future of cloud computing. The second is about the salesforce.com Inc. (NYSE:CRM) acquisition of ExactTarget Inc. (NYSE:ET-OLD).There are some challenges that are facing the cloud computing wave. Most of the challenges stem from the human fear of the unknown. As time passes, those fears should give way to capital budgeting analysis that suggests cloud computing as a desirable alternative to traditional IT.Salesforce.com acquired ExactTarget in a deal some analyst are calling pricey. From a pure analytic perspective, that is true. If you include strategic analysis and adjust the models for the impact of ExactTarget's growth strategy, the deal is a win-win for salesforce.com and ExactTarget. At this point, the evidence suggests the continuing growth of the ""as a service"" model. Consequently, this was a great deal for salesforce.com. With the valuation beginning to decline, there could be a good accumulation price in the not-too-distant future.Clouding Computing: The Future of ITInternational Data Corporation calls cloud computing the foundation of the technology industry's next 20 years of growth. According to IDC, public clouds and private clouds will account for about 26 percent of IT spending in the next couple years. Almost all new software offerings will be available as cloud services. The catalysts for the transition to cloud computing are high-speed Internet and the decreasing cost of storage.Small- and medium-sized businesses are rapidly migrating to the cloud while larger enterprises have been slower to transition to the cloud, but these transitions are coming with challenges.Setting prices may be a challenge for cloud service providers [CSPs] as cloud monthly service fees may be compared with the amortized cost of ownership. In contrast, cloud offers rapid access to new technology. Another area of uncertainty is the interoperability among clouds and between clouds and in-house infrastructure.There are three cloud computing categories: infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software as a service. Business processes as a service is slowly developing and combines multiple components of each of the primary three to deliver an entire business process. Over the next several years, new services should develop based on the ability of business experts in different domains to optimize a process and deliver it via cloud-based IT services.Security is often cited as a reason not to adopt cloud services. That should change in the coming years as CSPs invest more in security than any typical organization. Among the cloud adoption accelerants is cost savings. A report by the Brookings Institute finds government agencies can reduce their IT costs by 25% to 50%. Also among the accelerants is security as a service.One of the cloud adoption inhibitors is the ""we can do it better ourselves"" belief. In financial analyst jargon, the bargaining power of customers, part of Michael Porter's ""five forces"" framework. Another challenge is the ethical aspect of maintaining the privacy of customers, business partners and employees.CSPs face regulatory challenges because some governments restrict where data and processing can physically occur. Regulatory changes can be slow, if they occur, and governments can adversely impact profits. Product pricing is another challenge CSPs face. A key issue impacting CSPs will be interoperability. Customers want low switching costs while CSPs want to ""lock-in"" customers. How low will the barriers to exit be? Lower barriers to exit could make service offerings more commodity-like and increase competition in the industry.Despite concerns about security, privacy and regulatory, legal, and compliance issues, as well as changing corporate IT cultures, I think cloud computing will be successful, because companies will be attracted to the pay-as-you-use business model. Also, the potentially lower total cost of ownership should be particularly attractive to enterprises.Source: ""Cloud computing issues and impacts;"" Ernst & Young.ExactTarget: A Great AcquisitionSalesforce.com Inc. and ExactTarget Inc. announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which salesforce.com will acquire ExactTarget in a transaction valued at approximately $2.5 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, salesforce.com will commence a tender offer for all outstanding shares of ExactTarget for $33.75 per share, in cash. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both companies.ExactTarget is a global provider of cross-channel, interactive marketing software-as-a-service solutions. The company's solutions provide marketers with a suite of integrated applications. The company's suite of cross-channel, interactive market applications include e-mail, mobile, social media and sites, and is built on its flexible multi-tenant SaaS platform.The $33.75 per share valuation represents a roughly 53% premium to June 3, 2013's closing price. The takeover price represents a 74% premium to ExactTarget's enterprise value of $1.44 billion or 7.89 times 12 trailing months sales. ExactTarget's gross margin is in the mid-60s, and the selling, general, and administrative expenses were in the 50 percent of sales range. Salesforce.com will be able to cut the selling expenses and add about $350 million to the next 12 month's sales.Following the acquisition, Jefferies lowered its price target for salesforce.com to $50 from $54. That may have to do with the seemingly high price salesforce.com paid for ExactTarget. The net present value of the deal is negative: this deal destroyed shareholder wealth. That was reflected in salesforce.com's share price today; the portion of the daily return that was company specific was -7.14%. From a strategic perspective, it is an expansion project meant to increase salesforce.com's presence in the cloud-based marketing solutions space.From a financial perspective, this deal should add about $350 million in revenue this year. Assuming ExactTarget's revenue contribution continues to grow at an average rate of 35 percent annually, the contribution to revenue in five years would be $1.57 billion. If I ignore best practice and judge this deal based on revenue, the deal created wealth for shareholders.There is the traditional analysis perspective that suggests this is an awful deal. But, on a forward looking basis, assuming salesforce.com reduces operating expenses at some point in the next five years, this may not be as bad of a deal as traditional analysis would suggest. Also, the cost of capital is extraordinarily low; consequently, the required rate of return on investments is low. To use traditional models without adjustments to analyze this deal may be an error.Finally, salesforce.com increased guidance on revenue to $4 billion; the high end of my revenue forecast range is $4.1 billion, which I may increase to $4.2 billion. The valuations are starting to decline. I will look to accumulate shares once the valuations stabilize at, hopefully, lower levels. I do not pre-commit to buy zones in favor of conducting real-time analysis.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

We expect the company, which recently pipped SAP to become the market leader in the customer relationship management (CRM) market, to continue to post double digit growth rates. Its Sales Cloud and Service Cloud offerings continue to see strong traction. Other products such as Marketing Cloud have also been gaining traction with customers.However, despite the impressive revenue growth, we expect more pressure on its operating margins due to soaring marketing and R&D costs. In the last quarter, Salesforce reported quarterly revenues of $893 million, 28% growth on a yearly basis. For this quarter, the company guided revenues of $931 -$936 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.47-$0.49. Below we take a look at the key trends that affected the company’s performance during the quarter.We currently have a $33 Trefis price estimate for Salesforce.com, which represents almost a 25% discount to the current market price.Continuing Adoption of Cloud Services To Drive Growth While the on-premise software market continues to remain weak due to dwindling IT spending as reflected in the earnings of SAP (SAP Earnings: Software Licenses Decline But Cloud And HANA Lend Support) and Oracle (Oracle Doubles Dividend, Steps Up Buyback As Software Sales Disappoint), the adoption of cloud-based software is growing rapidly. The global on-demand portion of the CRM software market is growing at a double digit rate compared with low single digit growth for the on-premise segment of the CRM software market. The Software as a Service (SaaS) model makes it cheaper to adopt and easier to integrate deployment on the cloud. In particular, small and medium businesses are driving the demand for cloud software. Salesforce has been the pioneer in providing CRM software on-demand through the cloud and therefore is benefiting immensely from this trend. A couple of months back, Salesforce ended the dominance of long time leader SAP to become the largest player in the CRM software market. [1]. Further, Salesforce has also been expanding its offerings through new launches and integration of other services.In the last quarter, deferred or unearned revenue on the balance sheet grew 30% over the same period last year to approximately $1.7 billion. Deferred revenues are created when the contract has already been signed and advance payment has been received against it. Further, unbilled deferred revenue, which is the revenue that is contracted but not yet invoiced and was off the balance sheet at that time, was close to $3.6 billion. This would ensure a continued high growth in the near term.The spurt in consumer and business use of social networks, mobile devices, and new digital technologies is leading a revolution in marketing spend. Social media campaigns are becoming an increasingly important aspect in brand building and awareness. Marketing spend on social media is becoming a significant part of companies’ marketing budgets. Salesforce is tapping this demand with its Marketing Cloud suite, which includes Buddy Media, Radian6 and Social.com. These tools enable clients to listen, engage, gain insight, publish, advertise and measure social marketing programs. Intensifying its efforts, Salesforce recently acquired a cloud marketing company, ExactTarget, for a whopping $2.5 billion. ExactTarget generates most of its revenues from e-mail marketing and will fill in the gap in Salesforce’s offerings, which lacked a significant presence in email marketing (Read our note Salesforce Targets Social Media Marketing Spend With ExactTarget)Rising Costs Will Continue In the previous few quarters, the cost of revenues as a percentage of sales has trended higher and came in just under 20% in the last quarter. We expect gross margins to continue to remain under pressure in the near term. Further, as the company enters new businesses and beefs up its efforts to promote them, we expect R&D costs and marketing expenses to outpace revenue growth before trending lower. Last quarter, these expenditures were up by ~25% to 40%. The other concern is hyper growth in huge stock-based compensation expenditure, which has been increasing as a percentage of sales.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
1481431,36491,2013-06-05T04:45:00-04:00,,"Shares in Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) plummeted on June 4 after the company announced that it had agreed to purchase ExactTarget (NYSE:ET-OLD) for roughly $2.5 billion. Salesforce closed at $41.04 on June 3. By the end of the day on June 4, the online customer management software maker was trading at under $38.BackgroundThe acquisition marks the latest for Salesforce -- and there have been a lot. Over the last five years, CEO Marc Benioff has spent at least $4 billion on more than 40 deals, including ExactTarget. ""We couldn't just keep making these small acquisitions -- that strategy was taking, honestly, too long,"" said Benioff on a conference call discussing the acquisition. ""Salesforce.com wants to be the number one CRM company in the world... We've of course have to be number one in sales, which we are. We have to number in service, which we are. But we also need to work even harder to become number one at marketing."" The ExactTarget acquisition is meant to fill that gap in Salesforce's offerings and improve synergies within its existing product family.ExactTargetExactTarget was founded in 2000. The company makes software that allows users to customize emails and social media ads based on their respective preferences, as tracked through clicks. The company gets roughly 80% of its revenue from email, so the technology fills a huge gap in Salesforce's offering. But ExactTarget is still very young. The company hasn't reported a profit since 2008, and is forecasted to be in the red this year and next at a minimum. Rumor is that rival business management software maker SAP had considered buying ExactTarget, but ultimately passed on the deal.Effect on the BottomlineSalesforce ended up paying 7.6 times ExactTarget's revenue to acquire the company, or more than 53% the company's closing price on June 3 -- but it is a deal the company expects to pay off sooner rather than later.Salesforce expects ""about $0.05 of the $0.16 non-GAAP EPS reduction to fall into the second quarter, most of that's related to due-diligence, banking fees and other transaction related costs along with two weeks worth approximately of operating losses for ExactTarget,"" explained CFO Graham Smith. ""As a result, we expect the acquisition to reduce full-year 2014 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.16, resulting in an updated FY14 non-GAAP EPS estimate range of $0.31 to $0.33... That's up slightly from our prior guidance.""Smith stopped short of providing a forecast for the full-year GAAP EPS, saying that the company will provide that guidance in tandem with its second-quarter results, after the transaction closes.One Stop ShopThe ExactTarget acquisition was a bold move, but when it comes to expanding efforts into an area, like marketing, Salesforce only had two choices -- create or acquire -- and something was necessary in order for Salesforce to retain its crown as the top customer management software provider. Becoming a one stop shop is a smart move, as long as the company puts in the leg work to make everything work together easily -- and it looks like it will.In the June 4 conference call, CEO Benioff was careful to say that this is the last acquisition for a while. I think this is a strong clue that the company is going to spend the next several months working on integrating everything together tightly to drive engagement from its customers. Also, there is already a lot of client overlap so uptake of an integrated product should be strong. Moreover, synergies from that integration should lower Salesforce's operating costs enough that the gains from the acquisition are felt across the board.ConclusionSalesforce may have taken a hit after announcing the ExactTarget acquisition, but this just makes it a better opportunity for the long term investor.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Hats off to Verne Troyer, all 2-foot 8-inches of him, for his portrayal of Mini-Me in two ""Austin Powers"" movies. So enlisting a corporate Mini-Me in one of the great stock market comedies of our time, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), seems only fitting.Salesforce, of course, has kept us laughing (or if you've tried shorting it, weeping) by pushing its sales and stock price ever upward while running its business in a way that produces large and continuing net losses. It agreed yesterday to buy its tiny double, money-losing ExactTarget (NYSE:ET-OLD) for $2.5 billion, or $33.75 an ExactTarget share, a roughly 50% takeover premium.If you're planning on following this story, you can expect to hear the term ""Non-GAAP"" a lot.SalesForce and its CEO Mark Benioff have built a $22 billion market cap on the good humor that is its Non-GAAP accounting (One frustrated short seller took to counting the number of times in each earnings release Salesforce used the term ""Non-GAAP""; it was dozens, by the way). And ExactTarget has been smoking some of that Non-GAAP happy weed, as well. In a bit, we'll get to the details.But first, the Salesforce story has grown just a bit complex in recent weeks, as its stock has tanked by nearly 20%, as seen in a stock chart.CRM data by YChartsShort sellers are hoping that, at last, the market has turned against Benioff and his company, and that this is the beginning of a long slide for Salesforce shares. Could be, but don't count on it. The path to today's nearly-800% gain in Salesforce shares over the past decade has included plenty of dips. And if you had shorted it along the way, in all likelihood, you'd be the punch line in a Benioff joke about road kill. So, be careful.CRM data by YChartsSalesforce, as if we need reminding, sells cloud software, which means the stuff sits on its servers, not yours, and you pay a subscription fee rather than buying a one-time license. Lots of businesses use Salesforce programs to keep track of sales teams and customer relationships. It had sales of $3 billion in the year ended January 31 and a net loss of $270 million. (Perusing Salesforce's financial data, by the way, doesn't do the company justice; one needs to read the 10-K to appreciate Benioff's fine work.)Digital marketing - helping clients send out all those annoying emails and texts, among other things - is a huge growth area, one Saleforce had already nosed into with the August 2012 acquisition of Buddy Media for $736 million. ExactTarget has software in that field. And 6,000 or so customers, some of them big outfits like CareerBuilder and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), which spent $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, on ExactTarget services last year.But overall, ExactTarget had 2012 sales of just $292 million and a net loss of $21 million. Yes, it's growing, with sales up 41% last year, and by 39% in this year's first quarter, but one would have to be laughing pretty hard to get to a $2.5 billion purchase price. Pick your multiple: 8.5 times sales? 119 times net loss?Benioff was quoted in The Wall Street Journal as calling the bidding for ExactTarget ""very competitive."" Wonder what the next highest bid was?We apologize for injecting a sour note here, but the first quarter results at ExactTarget included a troubling anomaly, or perhaps the beginning of a trend. For all of 2012, its sales and marketing expense rose just 23%, far below the rate of sales increase, to $115 million. Thus was ExactTarget able to narrow its loss for the year. But in the first quarter, sales and marketing costs soared 52%, to $38 million, well ahead of the rate of sales growth.The sales and marketing spending is troubling because that's the biggest cause of Salesforce's inability to turn a profit, too. Turns out that, as fabulous as cloud computing is, potential customers are putting up notable resistance. Salesforce spends more than 50 cents on sales and marketing for every dollar of its sales, even as it grows like a weed.Benioff has a taste for the finer things in life (he's a billionaire thanks to his 40 million or so post-split Salesforce shares), and his company has been celebrated on best-places-to-work lists, and one hears that the man throws a fabulous party.With this deal, he'll have some like-minded co-workers. ExactTarget, too, has made its way onto some best-places-to-work-lists (even if the stocks are untouchable, both of these companies might be fine places to encourage your kids to seek employment). ExactTarget notes in its 10-K that it has:ExactTarget is based in Indianapolis.More central to the business of this deal, both companies note in their 10-Ks that, as they try to sell to bigger clients, the sales process becomes longer and more expensive. So much for scaling. In announcing the deal, the companies noted the potential to sell more services to existing clients, or to cross sell. Bully. But experience suggests that large corporate clients aren't exactly bumpkins, and they often extract discounts from vendors wanting to sell them lots of stuff. Watch out, margins.We warned you we'd get to some Non-GAAP accounting stuff, and here it is:The acquisition will require $40 million to $45 million of integration costs and transaction fees. Salesforce won't likely show as much revenue from the deal as ExactTarget would have independently. ""Adjustments related to the combined customer base, and inter-company revenue elimination,"" and some cleaning up of deferred revenue values, being the reasons. And Salesforce's profits, yes the Non-GAAP ones, will shrink in fiscal 2014 (it ends next January 31) to between 31 cents and 33 cents a share, vs. earlier guidance of 47 cents to 49 cents a share.So, even the make-believe profits take a hit in this deal.The hope is that going forward, sales accelerate via cross selling, and that big corporate buyers view kindly Salesforce's wide array of cloud offerings. And, I don't know, maybe all the competition - International Business Machines (IBM), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT) -- will fold their tents and go home. If Salesforce stock is to restart its upward climb, it will be, as always with Salesforce, because investors are watching the sales growth and turning a blind eye to so much else.

1490052,46531,2013-06-10T01:47:29-04:00,,"In my latest article on Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), ""Salesforce After The Earnings: The Good, The Bad And The Ugly,"" I provided an overview of the latest results, a momentum analysis and a note on fundamentals. After carefully reviewing the stock, I concluded that Salesforce had too many risks to be a long-term sound investment. In particular, I expressed my concerns about revenue growth, which isn't fast enough to keep up with operating costs.In this note, I add 4 bear key points to my original thesis:These points reinforce my current price target of $24 per share. But before analyzing each point in detail, let us start with a quick note on momentum.Current MomentumIn the last 5 days, Salesforce's negative momentum further increased: stock price is down -12%, which shows how much investors are worried about the latest acquisition. At $38 per share, CRM is still relatively far from touching bottom, as its 52-week low price is $30.05 per share. Yet, according to my DCF valuation, it is still overvalued. Negative momentum has improved significantly after the acquisition announcement. The MACD indicator continues to decrease, but the RSI indicator is showing a mild upward trend since yesterday.The acquisition of ExactTargetHere is the skinny: Salesforce.com announced it has agreed to acquire digital marketing firm ExactTarget for approximately $2.5 billion in cash. This is the biggest deal ever made by CRM, which is very active in the acquisitions field: so far, it has acquired over 20 companies, seven of which were acquired in 2012 alone.Salesforce will pay $33.75 per share, a 52% premium to last Monday's closing price. This is an excellent deal for ExactTarget, which became public only 14 months ago, with a $19 per share IPO price.But how do things look like from the perspective of Salesforce? First, we need to understand what ExactTarget does and then analyze how this new investment can help Salesforce to increase revenue growth and improve its fundamentals.ExactTarget is a cloud-based digital marketing company with an impressive list of clients, from Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). They cover every aspect of online marketing: email, mobile, social, web, marketing automation and data analytics. Furthermore, they have a huge SaaS global services organization: more than 400 experienced marketing experts working around the clock. At first glance, this business looks very promising. Let us now move to the fundamentals. As for revenue growth, it is happening. But how about profitability? As net income between 2009 and 2012 shows, ET is far from entering profit zone. Also notice that revenue guidance for this year is just $376M - $379M. From this perspective, dropping $2.5B seems ""too much"".If ExactTarget is to become profitable one day, it will need to continue growing its revenue base at the same pace for many years (perhaps even for a decade). And even if they manage to become profitable, there are concerns about how big margins will look like, as the competition in the marketing cloud segment gets fiercer.Now, my concerns do not end here. As many of you know, Salesforce is committed to reach $1B in marketing cloud revenue over the next years, and to do so, they are relying heavily on acquisitions. In 2012 the company bought Radian6 for $336M. Radian6's only asset was its software to identify and analyze conversations about companies and products, by data mining social media platforms. Also in 2012, the company bought Buddy Media for more than $650M. Buddy Media is basically software to run integrated campaigns across Facebook, Youtube, Twitter and other sites. It helps companies to increase their fans and followers. Each of these companies may offer a different approach to cloud marketing, but in fact their services are very similar. And ExactTarget also offers tools for running marketing campaigns across Facebook and Twitter, amongst other sites! It seems to me that Salesforce is buying the same set of products three times. Perhaps a more efficient strategy involves buying the same set of products once and invest the remaining capital both in keeping the software updated and hiring a massive network of marketing advisors to work as customer support, as new marketing tools are constantly emerging and clients are very demanding.More analysts are downgrading SalesforceSoon after Salesforce announced its decision to acquire ExactTarget, it received price target cuts at Evercore Partners (to $47 from $51) and Oppenheimer (to $50 from $53). Rick Summer from MorningStar did not decrease its price target, but also believes that the acquisition price is too high: ""Although ExactTarget's product portfolio and customer base are complementary to Salesforce.com's existing marketing cloud products, we believe the deal may be too richly priced"". Salesforce was also downgraded by investment analysts at Wedbush from an ""outperform"" to a ""neutral"" rating. Wedbush currently has a $42 price target on the stock, down from $51.Is Salesforce safe?Yes, it is. But there was a successful phishing attack in November 2007 which compromised contact information on a number of Salesforce.com customers. The data was used to send highly targeted phishing emails to Salesforce.com users.Unfortunately, hackers will always try to hack the cloud because that is where all the data is going. Just like bank robbers will always try to rob banks! The company itself has illustrated clearly in the regular public filings that security is a risk strong enough to disrupt business.Unlike other competitors like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) or SAP (NYSE:SAP), Salesforce.com does not support any public cloud (for example, Amazon EC2, Windows Azure or Rackspace). Customers have limited hosting options and portability. They also have no choice but to rely on Salesforce infrastructure. As long as Salesforce continues keeping strong trust relations with its customers, things will go north. But since many customers have all their data hosted on Salesforce, I think that another severe attack will not be tolerated.Also notice that Salesforce relies heavily on third party computer hardware and software, which ""could cause errors, failures of their service and may be difficult to replace"" (10-Q on May 24th, 2013). The more you rely on other people's software, the more you are exposed to bugs.Increasing competitionCompetition is increasingly fierce, especially in the segment of cloud marketing. I may not be exaggerating if I say that at least every week somewhere in the globe a start-up decides to launch a cloud marketing service. And some of them are pretty good and easy to scale. Let me mention a promising example: SHIFT. SHIFT is a collaboration platform for marketers and agencies, which recently announced the creation of the Open Marketing Cloud, a suite of 12 enterprise applications. By acquiring SHIFT's product, companies have access to an app ecosystem.But SHIFT is not the only firm trying to make a difference in the competitive cloud marketing segment. This field is full of innovation and therefore any programmer with an original idea and design support is a potential competitor. And Salesforce cannot buy them all.Final RemarksPrice target: $24.00 / from $24.00Rating: Sell / from SellInvestment Strategy: ValueInvestment Horizon: 1 yearUncertainty: MediumDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1658872,48501,2013-08-27T09:20:28-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is a leader in CRM, which has propelled the company's revenue growth. The company's customers include federal, state and local governments, large corporations and small businesses.The biggest questions surrounding salesforce.com are about its growth and its valuation. Based on my analysis, I'm forecasting continued revenue growth which could boost the share price about 30%. My intrinsic value estimate is $56.48.I'm not in the ""salesforce.com is overvalued"" camp. I think over the next twelve months salesforce.com will outperform the market or, at worst, perform in-line with the market. This isn't an investment for those seeking to outperform on a risk-adjusted basis. Salesforce.com is a solid investment for those seeking to outperform on an absolute basis.The business and industry are in an excellent position. The employee and customer reviews are superb. The recent developments suggest the company is heading in the right direction, and the financial performance forecast leaves room for considerable share price appreciation.RisksThis section is not meant to include all of the risks related to an investment in salesforce.com.Business ProfileSalesforce.com, Inc. is a provider of enterprise cloud computing services. The company is dedicated to helping customers of all sizes and industries worldwide transform themselves into ""customer companies"" by empowering them to connect with their customers, partners, employees and products in entirely new ways. The company provides customers with the solutions they need to build a next generation social front office with social and mobile cloud technologies.The company's sources of revenue are subscriptions and professional services. About two thirds of salesforce.com's revenue comes from the Americas and one third comes from international operations. In terms of international exposure, Europe is about 62% of international revenue. With Europe emerging from recessionary conditions, the continent could be a continued significant source of revenue growth.Management classifies deferred commissions as an asset, which is unusual because they are expensed in future periods. Deferred commission represents payments to be made to the company's direct sales force. It is deferred compensation which is typically a liability. I consider this a yellow flag.At the end of the fiscal first quarter, salesforce.com had over $2 billion of cash on its balance sheet; that is a substantial amount of liquidity and could be used to make a strategic acquisition or repurchase shares. I would consider a share repurchase program to indicate that management believes strong financial performance is likely to occur for the foreseeable future. Given the potential share dilution, I would say that there is a pretty good chance that management will initiate a share repurchase program.The business profile is bullish for the valuations of salesforce.com as the company is a leader in CRM. Also, salesforce.com has significant exposure to an improving U.S. economy. Lastly, hopefully the Board of Directors implements a share repurchase program in FY14.ReviewsIn order to obtain a more complete picture of the company, I examined employee and customer reviews.From what I read, the employee reviews are positive. No one is complaining about compensation. Employees call it a ""great company"" with ""smart people."" That said, one negative appears to be the long hours that people spend working. Another negative is the influx of talent from other companies that bring the attitude of their previous employer(s), such as the Oracle ""close big deals"" attitude.Salesforce.com is an Editors' Choice CRM product, but the offerings can be pricey.Recent DevelopmentsGiven its growth rate and relative standing in its industry, it comes as no surprise that Goldman Sachs lists it as the fourth cheapest stock on its list.Forecasted Financial Performance & ValuationsAt the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, management raised the FY14 revenue guidance to $3.835-$3.875 billion. My revenue forecast for FY 14 is $3.87-$4.12 billion. The higher end of management's guidance is at the lower end of my expectations. Management expects growth to slow this year from the mid to high 30 percent paces of FY12 and FY13 to at least 25.7%. Salesforce.com is forecasted to continue to remain a growth stock.I'm looking for a FY14 operating margin in the -3% to -6% range; operating income often fluctuates with cost of revenue and sales, general, and administrative expenses. The net profit margin should be in the -6% to -9% range. Management is forecasting a net loss per share of ($0.33) to ($0.31) while I'm forecasting a range of ($0.59) to ($0.39). I would look towards the higher end of my range as the more likely EPS for FY14, because my operating expense forecasts may be on the high side.In terms of the FY14 second quarter, I'm forecasting revenue in the $930 million to $988 million range. Management is forecasting revenue in the $931 million to $936 million range. I'm maintaining the same operating margin and net income margin for the second quarter that I am for the full year. I'm looking for a net loss per share of about ($0.10).Moving on to the valuations, I don't expect salesforce.com to pay a dividend anytime soon, so I am going to use the multiplier models to value the common shares. The current share price is $43.59.Using the historic valuations, the intrinsic value using the price/book ratio is $43.17, using the price/sales is $42.46, using the price/cash flow ratio is $49.92. The average of those valuations and the intrinsic value is $45.18. Consequently, salesforce.com is fairly valued.That said, given the growth forecast, I estimate a conservative upside of 30%. In other words, my fair value estimate including the growth forecast is $56.48, which is 29.6% higher than the current share price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1462281,46531,2013-05-27T02:18:44-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), also known as the world's largest customer relations management software company, announced its latest earnings results on May 23th. In this article, I provide an overview of the latest results, a momentum analysis and a note on fundamentals.Relative PerformanceFirst, I compare the stock performance of Salesforce.com with other competitors. Although some competitors are not exactly in the same business, all of them have either a cloud computing or CRM component in their revenue: Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS), Rackspace (NYSE:RAX), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and VMware (NYSE:VMW). Salesforce.com's one year stock performance, 13.51%, is far from the top (that is, SAS, with 31.19%) gainer. On one hand, things could have been worse, as a good number of competitors show negative returns. On the other hand, we should notice that the current stock price level has not changed that much since early 2011 ($39.2 per share). This stagnation is hard to ignore.Current MomentumIt should be clear by now that the latest results disappointed investors. As it can be easily noticed, the stock price increased almost every day between May 1st and May 20th. The bullish momentum was probably caused by high expectations on the earnings call scheduled for May 23th. Perhaps most investors were thinking that the ""stagnation"" period of Salesforce.com was over, and were optimistic about the company's aggressive acquisition strategy. However, the graph shows that a strong bearish sentiment has completely replaced the bullish trend. With both the RSI and MACD indicator decreasing fast, I see no indicators of improvements in upward momentum for the next days. Finally, the stock was down 5.34% on Friday, indicating that a massive adjustment of expectations took place.Earnings Overview: The GoodEarnings Overview: The BadEarnings Overview: The UglyBasically, this demonstrates that subscription and support costs are rising faster than revenue. After looking at these poor profit figures, revenue figures do not seem that amazing as they seemed in the beginning. In the words of Mark Moerdler, analyst at Bernstein: ""They're moving from organic to inorganic growth. And inorganic (growth) is very expensive"".FundamentalsI believe that even at $40 per share, Salesforce.com could be overvalued. But first, let me walk you through some key ratios. According to Morningstar, Salesforce.com's inability to generate profit is no recent history. Operating margin figures for 2012-01 and 2013-01 (margin of % sales) are -1.55 and -3.63 respectively. Next, we move to the free cash flow. Using Old School Value spreadsheet for financial analysis, I plot the free cash flow trend (the latest earnings call data is not included):This kind of trend shows me that Salesforce could be a one-hit wonder. Notice the massive increase in FCF that occurred in 2011. After that, there is only stagnation. Just like the stock price!Matt Mandel from ClearBridge Investments suspected that Salesforce.com could be overvalued as early as one year ago. In a note published in Sumzero Elite, he notices:To confirm this, I run a DCF valuation using Old School Value software, which always gives me very accurate fair value estimates. My assumptions are optimistic. First, we assume an average growth rate of 12% for the next 10 years, a terminal growth rate of 9% and a discount rate of 9%. I obtain a fair value estimate of $24.70 per share. Therefore, according to my DCF model, Salesforce.com is also overvalued, even at $40 per share. I attach a screenshot of my model, which includes a sensitivity matrix:In conclusion, Salesforce.com has too many risks to be a long-term, sound investment. Revenue is growing, but not as fast as operating costs. As a result, it is hard for the firm to break the buck. More yen devaluation could further damage the profitability of the firm for the next quarter. Finally, due to low barriers to entry, we can be sure that competitors will continue increasing in number (both in the cloud computing and CRM fields).ReferencesOldschoolvalue software was used for the DCF valuation. Data comes from Morningstar. The earnings call document was obtained from Seeking Alpha.Final RemarksPrice target: $24.00 / from N.A. Rating: Sell / from N.A.

1460151,22263,2013-05-24T13:24:07-04:00,,"Any keen observer of the psychology of markets would be intrigued by Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) earnings call, which was an exemplary performance in creating a parallel reality.Right from the outset the company claimed (link to transcript here), ""Please note that our commentary today will be primarily in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for both reported results and our forward guidance can be found in our earnings press release.""It reminds me of a writer's objective of drawing a reader into his fictional story by providing a credible scenario which allows the reader to suspend his/her disbelief. In a similar vein, this earnings call was not about GAAP or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, but CRM's version of the world.I have written previously about how the conference calls seem staged to portray how ""great and amazing"" the company is (here). And on this call also, virtually every analyst started his/her question with ""great quarter guys…"" (even as the share price - in real time in the aftermarket - began to register weakness) before giving the CEO, Mark Benioff, the stage to eulogize the company's exploits.I will not elaborate here my main problem with CRM's altered reality, or more specifically, its version of earnings (see the previous article linked above for detail). But suffice it to say that for this quarter, a GAAP loss of $67.7m (12c loss per share) is ""transformed"" into a Non-GAAP profit of $60.9m (10c per share) by ignoring $114m of wages it pays to employees, as these wages are paid via the issue of options in lieu of cash.This article focuses on a new concern. Salesforce.com has always portrayed itself as a growth company. Admittedly the revenue growth has been stellar as it secures its status as the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) vendor of choice for corporates that wish to monitor, understand and harness social media.For this quarter, the company registered a 28% increase in YOY revenues. The company also states that Deferred Revenue climbed to $1.7bn, up 30% from the previous year, very impressive numbers given the macro-economic context.It is only through reading the fine print that a more ominous concern raises its head.Some background. About 2 years ago, the SEC questioned CRM on its earnings disclosures. Particular concern was raised about the nature of deferred revenue and whether CRM was extending the horizon of deferred revenues to inflate growth. Since the enquiry, CRM has been obliged to detail the term of deferred revenue, and this statement from its April quarter is typical: ""Current deferred revenues increased by 33% year over year to $1.67bn, benefited in part by longer invoice durations.""The market has become aware of the potential to manipulate growth by extending the invoice duration, and it has also become more vigilant on the combination of revenue and deferred revenue growth, namely the billings growth. This metric provides the best gauge of overall success at winning business, whether it falls into this quarter (current revenue) or a new client is secured and billed for subsequent quarters (deferred revenue). The table below illustrates the revenue growth and the billings growth for CRM.As can be seen, although the revenue momentum has been maintained, the billings momentum tells an entirely different story: the momentum has almost halved from 28.5% in the January 2013 quarter to 17% in the just-published April 2013 quarter. This is the lowest billings growth rate since July 2009.How did this happen, despite the impressive array of other metrics? The change in invoice duration in the January 2013 quarter (in part) allowed a quantum jump in deferred revenue (from $1,380m in Jan 2012 to $1,863m in Jan 2013). This amount was then ""in the base"" from Jan 2013 onwards. In the April 2013 quarter, the QOQ change in deferred revenue was actually negative 133m, leading to overall billings moving from $650m in April 2012 to $760m in April 2013, a yearly increase of merely 17%.The graph below (the table above in graphic) illustrates the dramatic downturn of momentum in billings.(Click to enlarge)Conclusion:As Mark Benioff, the CEO stated on the earnings call:""And honestly I think we are doing a great job of that, I think you are going to see, you saw some great new technologies from us this quarter if you have it seen what we have delivered on the app stores, it is incredible and this summer you are going to see some more amazing things we are going to completely transform the CRM market and by the time we get dream for us the end of this year, I promise you we will have completely transformed our vision and our core for CRM market and how we are operating and - we do in whether it's user interface or application programming interfaces and I will tell you it is not a focus of our competitors, because if you go and look at there, if you go and look at their conferences, that are seminars, the webinars, which I do it's my job to do that, they are not focused in this area, they are focused in other areas, what they probably should be focused in other areas, because that's their core, but our core is the customer here at Salesforce and…""He's right; when he looks at his competitors' webinars and seminars, they probably focus on other things like GAAP earnings.But even if one adopts the altered reality of CRM, even if one judges it purely on sales and billings momentum, (in total isolation of any realistic profit or valuation metric), the company's results unarguably depict a dramatic slowdown.Is the lovefest over?Disclosure: I am short CRM.

1480881,20488,2013-06-04T17:23:59-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) just paid $2.5B for a company with $292M in sales and who has lost $20M/year for the last three years. I'll skip over the various accounting shenanigans going on at CRM as I have addressed them in the past. I'll simply focus on this.Details Regarding the Proposed ExactTarget AcquisitionUnder the terms of the transaction, salesforce.com will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of ExactTarget for $33.75 per share in cash, subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of a majority of ExactTarget shares in the tender offer and expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. Following the successful completion of the tender offer, ExactTarget shares not tendered in the tender offer will be converted in a second step merger into the right to receive the same $33.75 per share in cash paid in the tender offer.The transaction is expected to close late in salesforce.com's fiscal second quarter, ending July 31, 2013.Financial Impact of the Proposed ExactTarget AcquisitionFY14 Revenue: The acquisition is expected to increase total revenue by $120 to $125 million. This estimate reflects an approximately $65 to $70 million reduction relating to fair value adjustments to billed deferred revenue and unbilled backlog, adjustments related to the combined customer base, and inter-company revenue elimination.FY14 non-GAAP EPS: The acquisition is expected to reduce non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.16. This estimate reflects reduced revenue expectations as described above, and standard integration costs and transaction fees expected to be in the range of $40 to $45 million.Q2 FY14 non-GAAP EPS: The acquisition is expected to reduce fiscal second quarter non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.05. This estimate reflects reduced revenue expectations as described above, the company's operating results for the fiscal second quarter and standard integration costs.Based on the above, Salesforce.com is updating its guidance previously reported on May 23, 2013 as follows:Q2 FY14 Guidance: Based on an expected late fiscal second quarter close date, this transaction is not expected to have any material impact to salesforce.com's fiscal second quarter FY14 revenue results previously guided on May 23, 2013. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.07.Full Year FY14 Guidance: Revenue for the company's full fiscal year 2014 is projected to be in the range of $3.955 to $4.0 billion, an increase of 30% to 31% year-over-year.Why would they do that? Well, revenue growth. The word GAAP Profits never exit CEO Mark Benioff's mouth. Sure he will ramble on about ""non-gaap"" results that exclude stuff like the $513M worth of stock he and his fellow insider have dumped up in the last three years. You'll also never hear him mutter a word about the ~$270M in GAAP losses his company has racked up the three years through Q1 FY2014. You'll also never hear him talk about the 10% dilution of shareholders that has taken place since FY '10 and that there is plenty more of that coming. Notice the above release ONLY references ""non -gaap"" numbers. That would be because GAAP number show large and growing losses.What you will hear him talk about is revenue growth. That is all that matters. Nothing else. So when revenue growth fell when CRM reported Q1 this year from north of 30% to 28% and then the company guided the remainder of the year in the 26% range. One would have had to have been a fool to think Benioff would do anything other than what he has done for the last 5 years. Pay up big time for more revenue growth. To be sure he will get that with ExactTarget (NYSE:ET). The company has grown revenues from $134M to $207M to $297M that last three years but has also lost $60M over that same time (~$20M/year).Last year he paid $781M for privately held Buddy Media, an acquisition that cannot be explained any other way than a disaster at this point. Results there have been below their initial targets and it is unlikely the unit turns a profit in the next several years.Now onto ExactTarget. Benioff, in need of an outside source of revenue growth (it is NOT coming from within CRM) decide to pay $2.5B for ET. That comes to over 8X revenues which is ironically roughly the same valuation CRM trades at. We have to value CRM on revenues because, well, there aren't even a hint of earnings to value it at. This compares to ~4X for Oracle, just over 2x for IBM (NYSE:IBM) and ~6X at SAP (NYSE:SAP)Here is the 5-year revenues growth and EPS chart:CRM EPS Diluted TTM data by YChartsOf course we will forgive the 2009 EPS drop due to the recession, most folks had one. What we see here is that since the recovery began, EPS and revenue growth have been declining. What is even more startling is that the chart above has it at 32% and before this acquisition, CRM was projecting 26% for the full year which would have made the chart above even more dramatic.Now, the bulls will say ""you just do not understand CRM and what they are doing"". Can anyone tell me when overpaying for unprofitable revenue growth has EVER been a winning strategy in the long run? Ever? Bulls again will talk of ""synergies"" within the various technologies. So, I take this to mean that company ""A"", who is losing money with its own operations can go out and pay exorbitantly for companies ""B"" and ""C"" which themselves are unprofitable and somehow we sprinkle magic pixie dust on the whole thing and its becomes profitable?Now, I'll admit I did not major in math but the last I checked adding two negative numbers together did not produce a positive one. Unless maybe you live in the ""magic quadrant"" Benioff is always talking about? To quote Billy Preston, ""nothing from nothing leaves nothing"".Finally the bulls will claim that when CRM gets appropriate scale, they will flick a switch and turn profitable. Here again we have to turn a skeptical eye on this claim. How will they do this? They'll have to either cut expenses (massive layoffs in sales and support) which means revenue growth slows further OR increase revenue through price increases. Now, they could cut costs the aforementioned way way but that would mean an admission 30% plus revenue growth is gone and the stock would immediately revalue to a level of its peers ~30% to 50% lower.The other claim is they can raise prices. This dubious at best. With the likes of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM and SAP now making a hard push in the area (see IBM's news today), raising prices is not a viable solution. This is especially so when you consider all 4 are profitable and have the financial ability to undercut any CRM price increase. Again, this is a non-starter.Now, I'll not claim to know how long this farce can continue. Crazy stuff like this can continue for years (it has already) but one thing has been true since markets were created. Value always, at some point, matters. At some point investors will demand profits and when they are not delivered, shares will be punished.Disclaimer: The information in this blog post represents my own opinions and does not contain a recommendation for any particular security or investment.

1480581,25047,2013-06-04T16:14:06-04:00,,"As has been customary with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), each time it makes an acquisition it takes the chance to lower its estimates going forward. At some point one could even ask himself why make acquisitions if most of what they serve for is to guide down estimates.Salesforce.com's acquisition of ExactTarget (NYSE:ET-OLD) is no different. Once again, under the guise of an acquisition, what we see is lowered guidance. While guiding earnings estimates lower could somehow be understood because of tangible and intangible acquisition costs, this time the guide down also affected revenues substantially.In this article I will concern myself mostly with the revenue guidance. First, let's take a look at the existing Salesforce.com revenue consensus estimates before the acquisition (Source: Yahoo Finance):As we can see, FY2014, ending in January 2014, was at $3.87 billion.Now the same for ExactTarget (Source: Yahoo Finance):This shows a CY2013 revenue estimate of $378.4 million. At the Salesforce.com acquisition price of $2.5 billion, and minus $0.1 billion in cash, Salesforce.com is thus paying 6.3 times estimated 2013 revenues.Revenue guidance for FY2014Taking into account a late FQ2 close for the deal, Salesforce.com guided its new FY2014 revenue expectations as follows:Now, between the end of FQ2 (July 2013) and the end of FY2014 we have six months of additional revenues from ExactTarget. ExactTarget is on a (growing) monthly revenue rate of approximately $31.5 million, so six months would be an additional $189.2 million in revenues from the acquisition alone.This would mean that Salesforce.com's previous $3.87 consensus revenue estimate ought to go up to $4.06 billion. Yet, Salesforce.com guided towards a range of $3.955 to $4 billion, with a midpoint of $3.98 or $81.7 million below where the simple addition of ExactTarget ought to place it.Since the market's consensus was near the top end of the previous guidance, perhaps we can say that the reduction is just around $60 million, but it still constitutes lowered guidance. Salesforce.com seems to explain this lowered guidance in its acquisition press release:The explanation points towards part of ExactTarget's revenues coming from Salesforce.com. But then that means that Salesforce.com is not really paying 6.3 times revenues, but some larger number. After all, $65-$70 million is nearly 20% of ExactTarget's revenue base, and this is just for six months, meaning it's more like 30-40% of ExactTarget's yearly revenue! This in turn is strange when we take into account that ExactTarget says it has no customer over 5% of its revenues, as stated in its 10-K:ConclusionOnce again Salesforce.com is taking the opportunity to lower its own earnings and revenue expectations while doing an acquisition.The lowered revenues are seemingly blamed o inter-company revenue elimination but the company being acquired did not list any large enough customers to account for the discrepancy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1480001,25120,2013-06-04T13:32:37-04:00,,"Shares of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) take another leg towards the downside in Tuesday's trading session. The leading provider of customer relationship management solutions announced the acquisition of ExactTarget (NYSE:ET-OLD).The deal is the largest to date for Salesforce.com and discomforts its investors. Shareholders are fed up with the continued dilution of earnings and large acquisition related charges.The DealSalesforce.com announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire ExactTarget in an attempt to reinforce its position as a leader in cloud based CRM solutions. Under terms of the deal, shareholders in ExactTarget stand to receive $33.75 in cash for their shares valuing the firm at $2.5 billion.Salesforce.com will combine ExactTarget's leading digital marketing capabilities with its own sales, service and social marketing solutions, thereby boosting its offerings as a world class platform for email, social, mobile and web-based solutions.A citation from research company Gartner in the press release from Salesforce.com reveals that marketing spending on digital campaigns is expected to rise quickly. By 2015, about a third of traditional marketing budgets will be spent online, a trend expected to continue going forward.ExactTarget reported full year revenues of $292.3 million, up 40.9% on the year. Net losses narrowed to $21.0 million over the past year. The company ended its most recent quarter with $101.0 million in cash and equivalents and $5.7 million in total debt, for a solid net cash position. The deal values operating assets at approximately 8.5 times last year's annual revenues, a multiple expected to come down to 6.6 times this year's annual revenues.The deal which is unanimously approved by the board of both companies is expected to close in the current second quarter.An Update To The Full-Year OutlookOn the back of the deal, Salesforce.com expects to increase its annual revenues for 2014 by $120 to $125 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to fall by sixteen cents on the back the deal and $40-$45 million in integration and transaction charges. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share will be diluted by an expected five cents.Full year revenues are now expected to come in between $3.96 and $4.00 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are now expected to come in between $0.31 and $0.33 per share, while Salesforce.com expects to report GAAP losses of $0.47 to $0.49 per share.ValuationSalesforce.com ended its first quarter with $3.1 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company operates with $1.7 billion in convertible debt outstanding and capital lease obligations, for a net cash position of around $1.4 billion. Following completion of the deal, Salesforce.com will operate with a modest net debt position.Trading around $39.50 per share, the market values Salesforce.com at around $23.4 billion. Based on the updated full year guidance, shares are now valued at 5.8 times expected annual revenues and roughly 125 times non-GAAP earnings.A Holiday Break From Future M&A ActivityInvestors are not happy with the latest purchase which sent shares to levels around $39.50, thereby sending almost $900 million market capitalization up into smoke. This is understandable given the $800 million premium which the company offers for shares of ExactTarget.The company's transformation from being purely a CRM business into the cloud has resulted in numerous acquisitions in recent years of which this one is the largest to date. Last year, it paid almost $700 million to acquire Buddy Media, while it paid several hundreds of millions as well for Jigsaw, Heroku and Radian6 in recent years.Investors are obviously not too happy with this given the dilutive effect of the deal and the high one-time costs related to the integration. Perhaps they should be comforted by comments from CEO Benioff which suggested the company might take a ""vacation from M&A for anywhere between probably 12 and 18 months.""Investment ThesisAs recent as last week, I took a look as the prospects for Salesforce.com following the release of its first quarter results.While I noted that the revenue multiple is not even that excessive for a promising growth company, the earnings valuation is. I concluded that shares were rich on the back of an expected increase in future competition. Furthermore, the company uses its own stock as an overvalued currency to make acquisitions which boost reported revenue growth. The large discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is an issue as well given the sizable stock-based compensation expenses.The deal with ExactTarget is simply a repetitive move. Interestingly enough, the company is using cash this time to finance the deal instead of its stock. This is after the company recently raised cash with a convertible bond offering, which could still lead to future dilution of the shareholder base. While the deal will boost reported revenues, the bottom line will take a renewed hit.Shareholders are not buying into the story of improved offerings, and potential cross selling to ExactTarget's 6,000 large customer base including names like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Gap (NYSE:GPS) and Nike (NYSE:NKE). While Salesforce.com claims the deal will most likely create long-term value for the company, investors are looking towards the short term now and are focusing on the 16 cents dilution to non-GAAP earnings for the year.It is easy to spot the winner in this deal. ExactTarget's shareholders receive a 53% premium compared to Monday's close, while investors in Salesforce.com have to pay for the premium.I reiterate my stance on the stock. As Wall Street becomes impatient and disappointed with the stock, a bearish position might continue to offer the best risk-reward in the short-to-medium term.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1465141,24473,2013-05-28T15:09:00-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has been playing an interesting accounting game for the past 2 years. Despite the non-stop exuberance on the company's conference calls, Salesforce has been struggling by most traditional financial metrics.1. The NumbersThis chart from Google Finance pretty accurately depicts the Salesforce short thesis.Although revenue has been growing at a healthy pace since 2009, profits and margins have been diving.Here is a table outlining Salesforce's key profitability metrics from FY10-FY14.*Projected numbers based on management's guidance & annualized Q1 numbers for GM.2. Q1 FY14: Operating Loss DoublesAfter 2 full years of operating losses, investors must be eagerly awaiting some sort of reversal in profitability. Salesforce stock has climbed over 400% since the beginning of 2009, even with declining profitability. Apparently revenue growth north of 30% has sustained the share price, which has clearly been fueled by a consistent P/S multiple of around 8-10.Salesforce's rapidly declining operating income is showing no signs of slowing down. Q1 FY13 was a particularly brutal quarter in which the company lost $22.25M (operating income). Besides Q3, that was the biggest operating loss Salesforce reported in FY13.Q1 FY14 confirmed that Salesforce's losses will continue to expand for a 3rd year in a row. Salesforce reported an operating loss of $44.54M in the quarter. In other words, Salesforce is losing twice as much money as it was this time a year ago.3. Consistently Missing GAAP Profitability ProjectionsNo one seems to notice or care that Salesforce has been consistently, and horrifically, botching its own GAAP earnings estimates.*GAAP EPS numbers/guidance are divided by 4 to adjust for Salesforce's recent stock split.Salesforce has reported lower GAAP earnings for the past 3 years. Not only are Salesforce's GAAP earnings declining (and negative since FY12) but it's been at an accelerating pace. In FY13 Salesforce guided to lose between $0.55-$0.51 per share, and ended up reporting a loss of $1.92 (unadjusted for the recent split). For some reason Salesforce guided to lose less in FY14, and report a GAAP loss of $1.22-$1.18 (still unadjusted). Q1 guidance was for a GAAP loss of $0.44-$0.42 per share. Guess what? Salesforce missed those numbers and reported a GAAP loss of $0.48 per share.Salesforce has already missed Q1 EPS, but luckily provided very safe guidance for Q2. Salesforce has guided to lose between $0.06-$0.07 (or $0.24-$0.28 adjusted) for the quarter, which would be more than triple the GAAP loss of $0.07 it reported in Q2 FY13.Let's recap. Salesforce missed GAAP guidance in Q1 and doubled its losses from the prior year. For Q2 Salesforce is guiding to triple its losses from the previous year on a GAAP basis. Either management has finally come to its senses about GAAP guidance and is showing real projections for Q2, or the company is sandbagging another, much bigger loss than we are expecting. We'll just have to wait and see.4. Bad Acquisitions and Mounting GoodwillSalesforce's recent growth strategy has been acquisitions. This by itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it has become a weak point for Salesforce.It's no secret cloud computing companies are fetching sky-high valuations across the public and private markets. Who's paying these nosebleed prices for companies with negligible revenue and exponentially growing customers/losses? Salesforce.Let's take the recent purchase of Buddy Media as a recent example. Salesforce bought the company for about $730M, at 12-15X sales. Buddy Media isn't profitable, and Salesforce guided that the acquisition would add between $20-$25M in revenue in FY13.So, how much additional revenue did Buddy Media end up adding to Salesforce's topline in FY13? $19.646M. Salesforce also recorded over $700M in Goodwill and Intangibles for the purchase. Does this mean that $700M listed as an asset on Salesforce's balance sheet is already impaired?Any hypergrowth tech company missing revenue estimates by 10% (from midpoint of guidance) in the first 6 months is in trouble. What does this say about Salesforce's ability to make smart acquisitions? This is of particular importance considering the company just raised $1B in debt to fund even more purchases like the one of Buddy Media.5. Dilution and Insider SellingSaleforce has persistently been diluting its stock for the past 5 years. Even after adjusting for the recent split, Salesforce's OS (Outstanding Shares) has quintupled since 2003. This dilution has actually been accelerating and is showing no signs of stopping in FY14 or beyond.This dilution is mainly a byproduct of Salesforce's non-GAAP accounting game, which allows it to pay employees in stock. This compensation isn't an expense according to Salesforce (I have no idea why). This is the main reason for such a huge divergence between Salesforce's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. Either way, as a result of paying employees in stock, current shareholders are being continually diluted.Insiders have been selling relentlessly for the past several years. In May 2013 insiders have already sold over 55,000 shares, amounting to around $2.5M. At this point Salesforce has become notorious for the amount of insider selling that goes on. In retrospect, after a major share price correction, the market may finally catch on to what this insinuates.ConclusionEach quarter that passes where Salesforce increases its losses year over year, dilutes its shareholders and insiders sell, is a confirmation of the Salesforce bear case. Q1 FY14 was a strong indicator that we have at least another year of these headwinds.For the first time in many quarters, the stock actually fell after reporting earnings. Could this be the start of a much overdue reversal for Salesforce?Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The full year revenue guidance came in a bit softer than expected as well.First Quarter ResultsSalesforce.com generated first quarter revenues of $892.6 million, up 28% on the year, and up 6.9% on the previous quarter. Unfavorable currency movements shaved off 2 percent points of total revenue growth. Revenues came in just ahead of consensus estimates of $887.1 million.Salesforce.com posted first quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.10 per share. The company reported a $67.7 million net loss on a GAAP basis, with GAAP losses per share tripling to $0.12.Look Into The ResultsDespite the sizable revenue growth, gross margins fell by some 160 basis points to 76.6%. There was no benefit of operating leverage to be found in operating costs as well.Total operating expenses actually increased by 20 basis points to 81.6% of total revenues. A 90 basis points drop in marketing and sales expenditures was offset by increased investments in Research & Development.Looking Into The Remainder Of The YearFor the current second quarter, Salesforce.com guides for revenues of $931 to $936 million, up 27 to 28% on the year. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to come in between $0.11 and $0.12 per share, while GAAP losses are expected to narrow towards $0.06-$0.07 per share.On average, analysts expected Salesforce.com to guide for non-GAAP earnings of $0.12 per share on revenues of $934.6 million.Full year revenues are expected to increase between 26 and 27%, and should come in between $3.835 and $3.875 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to come in between $0.47 and $0.49 per share. Mainly due to large stock based compensation expenses, Salesfore.com expects to report GAAP losses of $0.31 to $0.33 per share.Analysts were looking for full year non-GAAP earnings of $0.49 per share on revenues of $3.87 billion.ValuationSaleseforce.com ended its first quarter with $3.1 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company operates with $1.7 billion in convertible debt outstanding and capital lease obligations, for a net cash position of around $1.4 billion.Factoring in a 5% correction in Friday's trading session, the market values Salesforce.com at around $25.3 billion. Factoring in the net cash position of $1.4 billion, operating assets of the firm are valued around $23.9 billion.This values operating assets of the firm at 6.2 times 2013's expected annual revenues. Operating assets are valued around 100 times expected non-GAAP earnings. Note that this excludes stock-based compensation expenses.Given the lack of profits, Salesforce.com does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveLong term shareholders have seen incredible returns. Shares have more than ten-folded over the past decade, and have seen very strong returns, especially in the second part of the decade.Shares traded around $6 in the aftermath of the financial crisis and have moved in a strong uptrend ever since. Shares reached levels in their high-thirties back in 2011. After a consolidation phase, shares recently hit all time highs of $47 per share.Between its fiscal 2010 and 2013, Salesforce.com has increased its annual revenues by a cumulative 133% to $3.05 billion over the past year. While the company reported solid profits of $80 million in 2010, the company was forced to report a $270 million loss over the past year as expense growth outpaced revenue growth.Investment ThesisWhile the revenue growth rate at Salesforce.com continues to be impressive, investors are not pleased with the lack of improvements in the bottom line.Revenues continue to grow at a healthy pace. North America, which generates roughly two third of total revenues, saw a 30% increase in first quarter revenues. European revenues grew by a solid 38%, while Asian revenues grew by merely 7%, heavily impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange movements. A stronger dollar, notably against the Yen, shaved off 10 percent points of revenue growth in the continent.The lack of operating leverage, continued costs related to acquisitions, and the discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings are causes for concerns. Even as the company guides for full year non-GAAP earnings of $0.47-$0.49 per share, implying non-GAAP earnings of $270 million, the company is still valued around 100 times non-GAAP earnings.Worse, Salesforce.com expects to take $0.78 per share in stock-based compensation expenses, some $450 million per year. These expenses are currently not being taken into account in the non-GAAP earnings estimate, while they really represent their normal cost of business for the company.Unlike some of its competitors, the revenue multiple at 6 times 2013's annual revenues is not even that aggressive. Yet Salesforce.com is already much larger in size, preventing Salesforce.com's growth rates from keeping up with some of its competitors' due to its size, despite a quite aggressive acquisition strategy.Yet it is not revenues that investors are most concerned about. Investors and analysts are slowly becoming disappointed with the lack of profitability improvements. Earnings furthermore came in line with consensus estimates, while the company has a tradition to beat on estimates.With cloud based software companies being the hottest area in the wider technology sector, few are accounting for an expected increase in competition. Large names like SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are showing an active interest in the market, while smaller competitors have raised a lot of capital as well in recent times. The increased focus of large established players will undoubtedly result in increased competition.Overall I remain slightly bearish. With its inflated currency, the company's own stock, the company made a string of acquisitions in recent years, thereby boosting revenue growth. The lack of non-GAAP profitability and the significant stock-based compensation expenses should be accounted for as well.With shares trading near all time highs I remain very cautious. As Wall Street becomes impatient, a bearish position might offer the best risk-reward in the coming period.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Below I have highlighted this quarter's earnings estimates as well as provided a fundamental look at the company's financial position and current valuation.Profile and EstimatesSalesforce.com has a market cap of $27.33 billion and currently trades for $46.33 per share. Shares are up 10.23% YTD and trade 54.21% above their 52-week low of $30.04. Analysts have a mean target price of $49.11 and a median price target of $51.00 on the shares. Forty analysts have an average first quarter earnings per share estimate of $0.10 (Non-GAAP) on estimated revenues of $887.08 million, 27% higher than revenues in the first quarter of FY13.Financial Position and ValuationSalesforce.com has been extremely effective at building the company's revenues from its cloud based CRM software. Revenues have grown 32.7% on average over the last three years, much higher than the industry's respective 6.4%. However, this growth, the company's low D/E of 0.1 and its large cash position ($868 million) are the only few things I see that the company's financials have going for them.Book value improved via acquisitions last year but intangibles grew much faster (up 77% last year to $1.8 billion). This, coupled with the tangible book value falling 15.6% to $518 million, and on top of a 4.4% share count increase (due to stock based compensation) paints a much uglier picture for shareholders (and I didn't even mention last year's $270 million loss).Take AwayShares for Salesforce.com have performed extremely well over the past year but it would appear management, and not the shareholders, have been the real winners. Analysts on consensus are still expecting the shares to move higher and it would appear the possibility of this short term is high as Mr. Market seems to have turned a blind eye to the company's fundamentals.

1455071,23479,2013-05-22T17:28:21-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is set to announce its Q1 fiscal 2014 (ending April 31, 2013) earnings on May 23. The company provides enterprise cloud computing and social enterprise solutions across businesses and is a market leader in the cloud customer relationship management (CRM) segment. We expect it to continue to post double digit growth driven by the growing adoption of its Sales Cloud and Service Cloud offerings. New products such as Marketing Cloud for social analytics have also been gaining traction with customers. However, despite the impressive revenue growth, the company will continue to face pressure on its operating margins due to rising costs.Last quarter, Salesforce reported quarterly revenue of $835 million, up 33% y-o-y. For Q1 FY 2014, the company guided revenues of $882-$887 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.40-$0.42. Below we take a look at the trends that affected the company’s performance during the quarter.Continuing Adoption Of Cloud Services, Social Media To Drive Growth The adoption of cloud-based services by small and  medium size businesses is growing at a rapid pace as the Software as a Service (SaaS) model makes  it cheaper to adopt and easier to  integrate the deployment on the cloud. The global on-demand portion of the CRM software market is growing at a double digit rate compared with single-digit growth for the on-premise segment  of the CRM software market. Salesforce has been the pioneer in providing CRM software delivered on-demand through the cloud and is benefiting immensely from this trend. Salesforce has also been expanding its offerings through new launches and integration of other services. The company recently launched Desk.com, a service cloud, to cater to small  businesses. Overall, we expect the Sales Cloud and the Service Cloud divisions to continue to post robust growth.Further, marketing spend  on social media is becoming a significant part  of  companies’ marketing  budgets. Salesforce is tapping this demand with its Marketing Cloud suite, which now includes Buddy Media, Radian6 and Social.com. These tools enable clients to listen,  engage, gain  insight,  publish, advertise and measure social marketing  programs. Saleforce also launched a new  Twitter ad platform to use Twitter’s advertising application  programming interface  (API). Its Marketing Cloud suite continued to make inroads into the market with the company beefing up its efforts to promote the product, which was evident from a significant increase in its marketing expenditure.Soaring Costs To Continue To Hurt In the previous few quarters, the cost of revenues as a percentage of sales has been trending  higher and came in just under 20% last quarter. We expect gross margins to continue to remain under pressure in the near term. Further, as the company enters new businesses, we expect R&D costs and marketing expenses to outpace revenue growth before  trending lower. Last quarter, these expenditures were up  by more than 50% and 40%, respectively, on a yearly basis. Another factor affecting its GAAP operating profit is the huge stock-based compensation, which has been increasing as a percentage of sales.We currently have a $33 Trefis price estimate for Salesforce.com, which is about 30% lower than the current market price. The stock is currently trading at a whopping price to sales ratio of 8, significantly higher than its peers. We will revise our price estimate post earnings.Disclosure: No positions."

And if you're going to buy $1 billion of it, you don't pre-announce you plans and drive up the price.But here are four potential acquisition themes, based on Salesforce's new company positioning and the emerging competitive dynamics with Oracle's (ORCL) recent cloud acquisitions.On February 26, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff led a presentation in New York announcing Salesforce's direction as the Customer Company. The customer revolution, he said, will connect companies to their customers in radically new ways - he had nothing short of nine factors driving this revolution: Social, Touch, Local, Big Data, Identity, Community, Ecosystem, Cloud, and Trust. This revolution, he said, would lead to much more connected customers, partners, employees and products.While we've seen 'customers, partners, and employees' in similar presentations since the late 1990s, adding products is new. Benioff talked about the 'Internet of Things,' where your camera, your fridge, your car all provide data that connect you back to the vendor.He envisioned (in a positive light) a Minority Report like experience of walking into a Canon store and having the salesperson walk up and (since your camera would tell him who you were) ask, ""How's that DSLR you bought in January working out for you?""The presentation laid out a big vision. To build that vision, Salesforce is going to need more product. More product means more acquisitions. And apparently that means about a billion more in cash.Like most good long-range vision statements, Benioff's presentation packed a mix of new innovation and competitive positioning. On the innovation side, it's brilliant to parlay Salesforce's cloud-based CRM data into the central platform for all mobile apps, social communities, and interconnected products. It essentially says, 'when you get serious about any of these initiatives, come talk to us first.'This leverages a natural strength of the Salesforce platform into a powerful vendor lock-in. What customer wants to build a platform for dealing with very high scale product analytics from scratch, then integrate it into their Salesforce system, if they can just start with the Salesforce platform?It's also great positioning against a very serious Oracle threat. Oracle has put together an extremely powerful platform of customer-centric SaaS products. RightNow for customer service (a weak spot for Salesforce), Eloqua for marketing automation (another weak spot for Salesforce), Vitrue for social (probably the better buy at a much better price than Salesforce's BuddyMedia buy), and ATG for eCommerce (a hole in the Salesforce platform).Now it's time for a bit of disclosure. I worked in product strategy at Adobe, where we rolled out a fairly similar vision to the Customer Experience vision of Oracle (they call it CX, launched in NYC last June, we called it Customer Experience Management). And the 'Customer Company' vision is an interesting twist on the same trend. Oh, and I also worked at Oracle after the PeopleSoft acquisition (well before Larry's SaaS buying spree, though). And a ton of my colleagues at PeopleSoft are now at Salesforce (but I haven't talked to any of them about this article). So I may be biased toward seeing the predictions we made about Customer Experience Management come true. </disclosure>Unlike Salesforce, however, Oracle doesn't have a central platform on which to build new apps. In fact, even getting all of the above solutions to use a single customer database to do their current jobs is a real stretch. So the Customer Company vision puts the focus on Salesforce's strength and Oracle's weakness.So, what are they going to do with the $1 billion? Here are some ideas:What's not on this list? I don't think that Salesforce needs to buttress its core Sales Cloud offering. There's a ton of innovation in new tools for helping salespeople sell. And, thanks to the growing number of app stores (iOS, Android, Chrome, etc.), these startups can now sell direct to the salesperson.Why doesn't Salesforce need to move in this area? Because all of these start-ups have, or will, integrate with Salesforce (which is easy) and not Oracle (which is very hard, given the number of products) or SAP (which requires on-site software installed by IT in most cases).So that leaves companies like Yesware, Clearslide, Crushpath, and Selligy to build great tools for salespeople - putting Salesforce even more into the lead as the customer platform. Linda Crawford's SalesCloud presentation had a ton of content about the Customer-Connected Sales team, but left plenty of room for the Salesforce ecosystem.(Final disclosure! My current job is at Selligy, where we're doing just that: building a great application on top of Salesforce to help salespeople sell.)Given Oracle's massive buying campaign, Salesforce needs to outflank its new rival, not re-trench into its core. These are my guesses as the probable moves.Then again, what couldn't you do with a billion?Disclosure: I am long ADBE. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1429121,47391,2013-05-13T08:10:08-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is and has been a stock market darling since it went public. Trading at over 8 times sales and an incalculable multiple of earnings, the market has been kind to CRM shareholders. The stock price increased from less than $10 a share in 2009 to over $40 a share today, a blistering four-to-five fold return. Shareholders have every right to be happy. What is there to criticize with that kind of performance?(Click to enlarge)As I see it, there is a lot to be concerned about. First and foremost Salesforce.com has a very poor record of profitability. In the past 3 years, Salesforce.com has been profitable only once and has a cumulative net income of negative $218 million.Salesforce.com Income StatementsOver the past 2 years Salesforce.com has incurred losses of more than $218 million.During the same interval, Salesforce.com officers and directors have been exercising their options and selling the underlying stock. In total, these sales by insiders have returned a total of $1.3 billion as set out below:Proceeds from sale of Salesforce.com Stock by InsiderSource: Edgar filings listed on Yahoo.com FinanceIt is not a new game. Management awards itself sizeable stock options and promotes the stock with elegant presentations, forecasts of continued growth and assurances of future profitability. Compensation committees meet regularly and with the assistance of consultants in executive compensation bandy about words like ""alignment with shareholder interests"" and ""incentive compensation against measurable results"" and fashion a compensation package that provides the chief executive office and some chosen lieutenants with a package of salary, bonus, stock options, restricted stock awards, and other benefits to be certain the company is ""competitive"" and does not risk losing its key talent to competitors. It sounds terrific.And, in many companies it works well. Management receives more than satisfactory cash compensation and looks to long term appreciation of capital as the share price grows to reflect increases in profits and cash flows. Options are exercised only when they are close to expiry and the managers sell only a sufficient number of shares to pay their tax bill, keeping the remainder of their shares to ensure their interests are the same as those of shareholders and to express confidence that they will over time build an institution of significant value.In other companies, it is a game of chance with only one winner - management. Options awards far outstrip any sensible compensation, and the managers both aggressively promote the stock while at the same time selling every share they can sell as soon as they are eligible to do so, and persuading their compensation committee to replace the sold shares with new options to keep the game going.The test of which kind of company you are invested in is a simple one - calculate what percentage of the cumulative profit before stock options and bonuses the managers receive over a reasonable period of time, and if there is a common sense fairness to the sharing of the rewards, you are invested in one of the first companies - one where the compensation system works well.But if you do the same arithmetic and find that management compensation is not a share of cumulative profits but a multiple of them, run for the hills. Sooner or later, such a company will bite you. I think Salesforce.com is such a company. Management owns less than 3% of the company but takes out more than 100% of its profits.Does management work for the company or does the company work for management? You decide. I am short the stock.Disclosure: I am short CRM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1445851,34821,2013-05-19T15:54:00-04:00,,"SalesForce.com (NYSE:CRM) announces earnings after the close on Thursday, May 23, 2013. The company provides enterprise cloud computing solutions to various businesses and industries worldwide. Founded in 1999, it sports a market cap of $24 billion even though it has never showed a profit.Not showing a profit makes it difficult to calculate a P/E ratio, forcing analysts to look at revenue as an alternative proxy to measure enterprise value. YOY revenue growth has been high, about 32%, which gives some justification for its forward P/E of 74. This compares to its competitors' forward multiples of 12 for Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and 20.5 for SAP (NYSE:SAP). CRM seems pretty pricey, even if the company turns the corner to profitability.Here are the results after the earnings announcement for the past four quarters, with the stock price change from the close on the day before the announcement until the closing price on Friday (when the weekly options expire):For each of the last four quarters, the company has exceeded estimates by such a large margin that you might wonder what the analysts were smoking when they made their analyses. Actual results were over ten times greater than estimates almost every time. They weren't even in the same ball park. How could they be so far off so consistently for four consecutive quarters? Something is fishy here.A conspiracy believer might suggest that they low-balled estimates and whispered to their bosses to buy shares. This might get them a raise because after every announcement the stock has moved higher by an average of 6.6%.The pattern of analysts not being close to reality seems to be continuing. The current estimate ($.11) is after the 4 - 1 stock split declared on April 18th, so it is essentially $.44 compared to the old numbers. But last quarter the company reported earnings of $.51 and this is not a seasonal business, and with sales reportedly growing at 32% YOY, you would expect that earnings would be much higher. So why are estimates so much less than last quarter's earnings?Over the last several months, I have been testing the proposition that the level of expectations prior to an earnings announcement is a better indicator of what the stock price will do than the actual earnings themselves.I have been using several indicators to determine whether expectations are unusually high (or low) leading up to an earnings announcement and what the stock price is likely to do after the announcement:If expectations are usually high, there is an excellent chance that the stock will be flat or fall after the announcement, regardless of how much the company might surpass estimates, and conversely, the stock is more likely to move higher when expectations are low, even if estimates are merely met.In addition, I have checked out recent hedge fund activity (are hedge funds buying or selling the stock?) to get a better handle on whether the stock is likely to rise or fall after the announcement. While hedge funds are not always right, they can be counted on to have conducted some serious due-diligence work before making a decision to commit or divest, and they have far more resources at their disposals than any individual could hope to have.I have had some serious success with this model, including eight consecutive winning pre-earnings calls without a loss - see results.CRM presents a serious challenge to my model. By the measures I have used so successfully, the current level of expectations is seriously high. Check out the recent price action:The stock has picked up about 15% over the last six weeks and reached a new high last week while whisper numbers are $.13, or about 18% higher than estimates, and RSI is 94 (very overbought), all important indications that expectations are unusually high.Institutions have added just over a million shares over the past quarter (an insignificant number for a company with 586 million shares outstanding), just about equal to the number of insider sales, so the hedge fund statistic is not much of an issue here.People seem to either love or hate this company. In the week preceding the last earnings announcement, several articles were published on Seeking Alpha that panned them.A sample, with a quote from each:What's The Deal With Salesforce.com?Something Is Seriously Wrong With SalesforceSalesforce Earnings Preview: 7th Consecutive GAAP Loss ExpectedWith comments like these, how could anyone expect the stock to move higher after the earnings announcement that came out after the close on February 28th? But it managed to go up by 7.6%.Indeed, there is a lot to not like about CRM. Executive compensation, for one. Marc Benioff, co-founder and Chairman, collected $110 million in salary and options exercise last year (seems like an unreasonable compensation for running a company that chalked up an operating loss of about $270 million). Three other top managers earned an average of ten times their million dollar salaries in options exercise as well.For some (unknown to most of the public), most analysts seem to love the company. Fourteen rate it a strong buy, 24 a buy, and continuing the love-'em-or-hate-'em theme, 5 rate it as underperform or sell and only 4 are neutral, calling it a hold.Maybe the analysts are low-balling estimates to make the company look good, waiting for the stock to move higher after earnings because they beat earnings so badly, and justifying their ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" ratings so they get to keep their jobs for another quarter or so.If I liked this company, I would buy shares before the announcement because of the remarkably consistent pattern of besting estimates and having the stock move higher after the announcement.If I were bearish on CRM (or if I had total faith in my expectations hypothesis), I would take advantage of the escalated option prices for the May 4-13 weeklies which carry an implied volatility (IV) of 80 compared to 48 for the June-13 options. I would invest in 10 diagonal spreads, buying June-13 50 puts and selling May4-13 (expiring 5/24/13) 47.5 puts.I would also buy 7 June-13 - May 4-13 call calendar spreads, paying about $.40 just in case the stock does manage to move about 6% higher, continuing the historical pattern. This is the risk profile graph if you bought this combination of spreads, assuming that IV of the June options would fall from 48 to 40 after the announcement, shelling out about $2500:These positions should make a gain if the stock moves as much as 6.6% higher (the average change for the past four quarters) after the announcement or falls by any amount. The maximum gain (about 50%) would come if the stock remained essentially flat. I think I will try this play with only a small investment because while my expectations hypothesis would predict a flat or lower stock price after earnings, there is a conflicting strong historical pattern of the stock moving higher after announcements. These spreads seem to cover both possibilities and should only lose if the stock moves up 7% or more.The wonderful thing about options is that you can be wrong and still make a gain, just as long as you aren't terribly wrong. The CRM earnings announcement history makes it a particularly challenging earnings play, regardless of whether you prefer stock or options.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: I plan to buy the CRM option spreads outlined in the article prior to the earnings announcement.

1383111,44731,2013-04-30T01:18:05-04:00,,"Salesforce.com Inc. (NYSE:CRM) operates on a global scale. It sells cloud computing and services such as marketing research, performance management and consulting. It is a significant, though not dominant, player in the technology/app software sector. Based on a broad view of the industry, broader economic trends and thorough fundamental analysis, buying salesforce.com for a mid-term trade is advised.Competitor and Economic PerspectiveOracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP), both direct competitors, have market caps of over $90B and EBITDA values of $17.29B and $7.19B, respectively. CRM is small by comparison, with a market cap of about $24B and EBITDA of $84M. This data indicates room for growth and stock price increases as CRM figures more prominently with large-scale potential customers and clients. Cash flow and competition analysis hints that CRM has substantial room to grow. Though the stock is volatile, the overall trend is likely to be further increases in the price of the stock.The company has grown to an enterprise value of $23.7B since its inception in the late 1990s. An impending widespread recession can provide a great shorting point; smaller events or market corrections are not likely to shake CRM to any significant extent. Nevertheless, broader economic analysis can offer some clues as to when a shorting point could develop. Some argue that the stock market rise since 2009 is due to currency printing by central banks in the U.S. and elsewhere. A recent article titled ""The Next Country To Collapse Isn't In Europe"" extrapolated current trends in Japanese debt and monetary policy. It predicted a substantial stock market pullback roughly 18 months from now, around October 2014. If this happens, CRM will reach a selling or short sale entry point in late summer or early fall of 2014.FundamentalsBy some measures, the last twelve months have not been kind to Salesforce.com Inc. Profit and operational margins were significantly negative during 2012. Return on equity was nearly -14% in 2012. Current ratio of 0.69 and a high forward P/E of 64.71 contribute to skepticism about CRM's future prospects. These company statistics are important, but need to be considered in light of more comprehensive company performance data. Consider company financials between 1/30/2011 and 1/30/2013:• Balance sheet: Assets and liabilities increased at an even pace, roughly 77% from January 2011 levels. Notably, capital surplus rose over 120%, with stock option warrants adding an additional $53.6M to CRM stockholder equity by 1/30/2013. These two factors boosted stockholder equity 80% over the 2011-2013 reporting timeframe. If this trend continues, it would argue very strongly against a short-sale in the near future.• Income statement: The most recent data shows that CRM's gross profit increased by 43.6% since Jan 30, 2011. However, Research and Development expenses increased by 128% during the same timeframe. And with general and administrative expenses nearly doubling in two years, profit could not keep up, resulting in a swing from $64.7M net income as of 1/30/2011 to a net loss of $270.4M as of 1/30/2013. In itself, this data signals that CRM stock is losing steam, giving an entry point for a short sale.• Cash flow: Most importantly, CRM's operating activities generated over $736.8M in positive cash flow as of Jan 30, 2013. This is a 60% gain over two years, with no comparable gain from investing and financing cash flow. Even with far smaller investing and financing cash flow, strong operating cash flow performance justifies CRM's reputation as a strong long investment.Fundamental data hint that the last year has been unusually rough for CRM, hence some of the negative metrics in reference to recent company performance. However, an in-depth look at Salesforce.com's cash flow and balance sheet data indicates that this company is not likely to decline in the near future. Steadily increasing operating cash flow and a substantial capital surplus on the balance sheet argue that CRM will likely see an increase in share price.Technical AnalysisCRM stock has gone up in price unless there seemed to be a very good fundamental reason to drop. Since 2005, it has consistently outperformed S&P 500 (ticker: ^GSPC). Between 1/3/2005 and 4/22/2013, CRM recorded an 800% gain. The broader ^GSPC index recorded only a 33% gain. The 200 SMA has acted as a price support since January 2005. Price corrections on May 2006-Sept 2006 and July 2011-Feb 2012 were short-lived, uncertain, and would have given a relatively small return on a short sale. The price trend since 2005 strongly argues against shorting CRM anytime in the near future. That could change if costs are not kept in check and expansion were to take a turn. For now I would recommend CRM as a buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1321671,23469,2013-04-04T15:22:37-04:00,,"ProfileSalesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a worldwide company that brings enterprise cloud computing solutions to businesses. CRM provides a variety of cloud services including Sales Cloud, aimed to help companies grow their sales pipelines, close deals, improve sales productivity, and gain business insights; Service Cloud, a product that helps companies connect with their customers and address their service and support needs; Marketing Cloud, that enables customers to listen to conversations on public social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and blogs; and Salesforce Platform, a product that helps customers, independent software vendors, and third-party developers to develop applications in a number of programming languages. CRM primarily sells and markets its products and services on a subscription basis through its direct sales force. Founded in 1999, this company holds its headquarters in San Francisco, California.IntroductionThis application software company specializes in cloud computing solutions for its customer companies that can be found around the world. Our price target analysis predicts that its current stock price of $175 will depreciate around 7% to $163 by the end of the fiscal year. Given the projected growth due to new services CRM will become more fairly valued over the course of the year. The company has announced it anticipates 25-27% increases in revenue YoY, partially due to its new services: Salesforce Chatter and Service Cloud Mobile. Many of these new services are already available to customers, and the rest will be available by the middle of the year. CRM believes these are unique products that will work against market competition. Though there are possibilities that these new services could either fail completely or bring even more revenue than anticipated, we firmly believe that given the plans for 2013 and the potential for growth CRM should be upgraded to a ""Hold"".ThesisValuation CRM has no PE and has a future PE of 69.9, much higher than the industry average of 18.9. Due to operating at a loss during the past fiscal year CRM does not have a PE ratio. A future PE ratio of 69.9 projects that CRM will start operating at a profit in the next fiscal year.For the full fiscal year CRM saw $835 million in revenue, and increase of 32% YoY. The company also projects a continued increase in revenue for the future fiscal year of 25-27%. Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), a market competitor increased revenue 19% YoY to $845 million, for the first nine months of the year. CA Technologies (NASDAQ:CA), again a market competitor of CRM, reported a 4% decrease to $1.195 billion in their Q3 earnings. During the 2013 fiscal year CA expects revenue to fluctuate anywhere between a -1% decrease to a 3% increase that would bring the company to a revenue range of $4.58 to $4.67 billion. When compared to other companies in the market, CRM shows a steady increase in revenue with the potential to begin operating at a profit.At the end of the 2012 fiscal year CRM is reporting an ROA at -5.6%, ROE at -13.9%, and ROIC at -11.4%. RHT reports its ROA at 6.3%, its ROE at 10.9%, and its ROIC at 10.9% as well. CA reports its ROA at 7.8%, its ROE at 17.3%, and its ROIC at 13.1%. CRM's key ratios reflect its lack of profit. If CRM produces the growth that is projected for the current year these numbers will turn positive.CRM has been operating at a loss for the past fiscal year but analysts and CRM itself are projecting growth for the company that will help CRM begin to operate at a profit. Where will this growth come from and how does it justify our ""Hold"" rating? In the following section we will explain CRM's recent press releases announcing its newest services on the market. We believe that these new developments give the company a certain amount of opportunity but its stock is still over-valued. Even with the potential for growth from new services our price target analysis predicts CRM's stock to devalue to a more fairly priced level.Catalyst In recent press releases CRM has announced different actions planned for the forward fiscal year that will grow the company and will balance out the value of CRM so it is fair valued. On March 21, 2013 CRM announced a 4-to-1 stock split to take place between April 3 and April 17 of the current quarter. This stock split will bring the number of common stock from 400 million to 1.6 billion shares. The split will significantly lower the price of shares as it stands presently. CRM also recently announced their new generation of Salesforce Chatter, its software that enables customer companies to sell, service, and market to its customers on any Android or iOS device. CRM explains that, ""With new Salesforce Chatter, for the first time ever, companies will be able to access, create and act on customer information-all in the Chatter feed, from any mobile device"". Salesforce Chatter is available now for Android and iOS devices and is included in Salesforce editions. The Salesforce Chatter creates and edits record capabilities are currently scheduled to be available during the second half of 2013. In February of 2012 CRM also unveiled its New Service Cloud Mobile. This new software will transform customer companies to deliver the industry's first mobile co-browsing, mobile communities, mobile chat, and touch-based agent interface technology designed for customer service on any device. Some companies that have deployed Service Cloud include Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), GE (NYSE:GE), and NJ Transit. The Co-browsing service will be available in the second half of 2013. The Mobile Service Cloud Communities is already available at no extra cost to customer companies. Service Cloud chat is currently available and is priced at $50 per user per month for customer companies. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) currently offers its Fusion Applications that boast many features similar to what CRM is developing. They are a Software-as-a-Service (NASDAQ:SAAS) provider just like CRM whose services facilitate communication between employees within the business process and with their customers all through cutting-edge cloud technology. These new developments for CRM will make it a stronger competitor in this very fast-moving market but it is difficult to tell how long these innovations will give it a competitive edge.Economic Moat CRM is among a number of software companies that offer cloud services to large companies. Some of the new services and products that CRM has announced in the recent past will help to strengthen CRM's economic moat. Because Chatter is built on the Salesforce Platform, CRM is the only company that can deliver social and mobile innovations that enable companies to connect with its customers, partners and employees in entirely new ways. This internal communication update will allow users to access information as projects and deals are being planned and executed. There is no longer a need to wade through user profiles, which will boost productivity and allow all parties involved to be completely mobile. Many of CRM's competitors recognize the opportunity CRM has acknowledged and are working to develop services for its customers that compete with CRM's innovations. CA's CEO, Mike Gregoire, recently summed up with dilemma in a recent press release stating, ""We are in the midst of an unprecedented era for CIOs and IT-where IT sets the stage for game changing business innovation"". This coming from one of CRM's top competitors alongside IBM and ORCL show just how tough the rising competition is. Technology innovation moves quickly and becomes obsolete even faster, so we believe CRM even given its newly developed services has a fairly light economic moat.Revenue and EPS Outlook As stated before, CRM saw a 32% increase in revenue during Q4 of the past fiscal year. The company has also announced an anticipated 25-27% growth in revenue for the forward fiscal year. With new services already available to customers, and the rest of these new projects scheduled to be available mid-year, CRM is working to make itself unique and desirable amidst market competitors. Our price target analysis projects CRM to begin operating at a profit this fiscal year during which we predict the stock price to increase 11%. CRM's EPS is predicted to increase from 0.48, what it stands at presently, to 1.97 by January of 2014. All these signs indicate healthy future growth, which will bring CRM to a more fair-valued stock, which is why we upgrade our rating of this stock to a ""Hold"".Price Target AnalysisThe following price target was configured through a 5-year projected discounted cash flow analysis. The model projects operating income, taxes, depreciation, capital expenditures, and changes in working capital. Using that information, we can project what the company is worth. We can then use that projection and compare it to current prices.Here is how to calculate price targets using discounted cash flow analysis (all figures in millions)Step 1.Project operating income, taxes, depreciation, capex, and working capital for five years. Calculate cash flow available by taking operating income - taxes + depreciation - capital expenditures - working capital.Step 2.Calculate present value of available cash flow (PV factor of WACC * available cash flow). You can calculate WACC, but we have given this number to you. The PV factor of WACC is calculated by taking 1 / [(1 + WACC)^# of FY years away from current]. For example, 2016 would be 1 / [(1 + WACC)^4 (2016-2012). WACC for CRM: 7.76%Step 3.For the fifth year, we calculate a residual calculation. This number is calculated by taking the fifth year available cash flow and dividing by the cap rate, which is calculated by taking WACC and subtracting out residual growth rate. Residual growth rate is typically between 2-6%. 4% is average growth for industry. Companies with high levels of growth have higher residual growth, while companies with lower growth levels have lower residual growth. This is why higher growth companies tend to have higher PE ratios. We will give you cap rate. Cap Rate for CRM: 2.26%Step 4.Calculate Equity Value - add PV of residual value, available cash flow PVs, current cash, and subtract debt:Step 5.Divide equity value by shares outstanding:Profit/Value Industry ComparisonsProfitability:CRM has seen a decrease in its profitability margins YoY. They are still operating at a loss and have moved from -1.5% operating margin to -3.6%. CRM's gross margin has moved form 78.4% in 2011 to 77.6% in 2012. Lastly, CRM's ROE has moved from -0.8% to -13.9% this past fiscal year. How do these key ratios compare to competitors?RHT has also decreased its operating margin from 18.1% in 2011 to 15.4% in 2011. Its gross margin increased form 83.9% to 85.0% YoY. RHT's ROE decreased slightly from 7.9% to 7.2% during this same time period. CA increased its operating margin from 5.8% to 20.4%, its gross margin decreased slightly from 86.9% to 86.6%, and its ROE increased as well from 15.6% to 17.3% YoY. Sap AG ADR (NYSE:SAP) increased all its profitability margins. SAP's operating margin increased from 20.8% to 34.3%, its gross margin increased slightly from 68.8% to 69.4%, and ROE increased from 19.8% to 30.6%. When compared to other companies in the market CRM is the only one with a negative operating margin and a negative ROE. Across the board gross margins are high in this market, and CRM fits in well.Value:Because of a lack of operating profits CRM does not currently have a PE and projects a future PE of 69.9. This high valuation is attributed to the profits and growth CRM is forecasted to experience during the 2013 fiscal year. Let's look at CRM's competitors.RHT has a PE of 68.7 and a future PE of 36.8. CA has a PE of 12.9 and a future PE of 10.0. SAP has a PE of 26.4 and a future PE of 20.3. NSIT has a PE of 10.0 and a future PE of 8.3. Although CRM is not the highest valued at present, it will be one of the highest valued stocks in the market after the current year. We believe it is smartest to wait and see how this high valuation pans out.VariantWhat could go wrong in this argument? Much of CRM's increase in valuation hinges on the company operating at a profit and growth. If the company does not sell the new products as successfully as it anticipates they will run into problems. Especially in a software-based market competition is always an issue. Products and services become obsolete quickly and companies need to stay on the cutting-edge of technology in order to stay competitive. Failure for CRM with these new services would mean even more serious failure for the company in general. While we anticipate healthy growth that will bring CRM's key ratios to positive numbers, they could also experience growth larger than expected.The Bottom LineWe believe that CRM is a company that will begin to operate at a profit within the current fiscal year. It has announced new services to its customers and are continuing to meet the application software needs of companies worldwide. While its 2013 key ratios were not strong, its projected growth is expected to turn these numbers positive and set CRM as a fair-valued stock in its market. This being said, we do not see a huge opportunity for gain in this investment. CRM's continual innovation combined with its global presence going into the fiscal year is why we upgrade this stock to a ""Hold"".Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The Oxen Group is a team of analysts.

1258551,24802,2013-03-08T04:40:59-05:00,,"The world's equity markets often present investors with a form of theater that cannot be found anywhere else. Only here can investors watch billionaires battle over whether or not a company is a pyramid scheme, whether or not the world's most iconic technology company is losing its edge, or when the stock many see as the poster child of corporate greed and malfeasance will finally collapse. It is this third example that we wish to focus on in this article.Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is a unique stock to follow. Led by charismatic CEO Marc Benioff, the company's shares have soared since its 2004 IPO, all while the company's GAAP earnings have gone in the opposite direction. Critics of Salesforce deride the company for its focus on non-GAAP earnings, vociferously attack the company's management team, and argue that the collapse of Salesforce is imminent. And through all this, shares of Salesforce continue to climb, and are currently sitting near all-time highs, on the back of a well-received (by the markets) quarter and a fresh round of analyst price target and estimate increases. For the record, we have no position in shares of Salesforce because we believe, as do the company's critics, that its shares are overvalued. However, we believe that the best investment in Salesforce is no investment at all. Salesforce critics who argue that the stock must be shorted have, in a quest to prove their indignation with the company, lost sight of one of the (if not the) most important rule in investing: it is more important to generate profits than be right. And while those 2 goals are often in alignment, they sometimes diverge. And few companies serve as better examples of this divergence than Salesforce.Emotions and Hyperbole: Why They Need to be RemovedWe have laid out this view several times in previous articles on Salesforce, where we laid out our argument that while the short thesis for Salesforce is theoretically correct, it is virtually impossible for it to become a profitable thesis as long as the present dynamics surrounding shares of Salesforce remain in effect. While many readers praised our work, there were many that condemned it. It seems that for some, any research that does not espouse a bearish view of Salesforce is seen as an affront, and an attempt to manipulate investors into buying shares of Salesforce so that the company's existing investors can unload their stakes. We have been accused of not only being agents of Fidelity (Salesforce's largest investor), publishing articles here on Seeking Alpha to help the company unload its 15%+ stake in the company, but of secretly being a part of Salesforce's public relations team, publishing articles here on Seeking Alpha in an attempt to suppress negative coverage of the company. In our view, such statements highlight the irrationality that many in the Salesforce short community hold. For many critics of the company, the desire to see shares of the company collapse has clouded their judgment, and blinded them to several of the dynamics surrounding Salesforce.Fundamentally, we believe that the short thesis for Salesforce is correct. Salesforce is overvalued on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis (the shares currently trade at 95.32x fiscal 2014 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.95). But that does not mean that it is wise to short Salesforce. The company's long investors are deeply entrenched, and as we have discussed several times before, it is these investors that are standing in the way of the short thesis.Focusing on the WhalesSalesforce's shares are underpinned by a large and deep base of institutional investors, who are led by Fidelity, which owns 21,298,679 shares of Salesforce, or more than 15% of total shares outstanding (in Q4 2012, Fidelity boosted its stake in Salesforce by nearly 500,000 shares). We have stated several times that one of the key ingredients needed to drive the short thesis for Salesforce is capitulation from the company's institutional investors. However, as of Q4 2012, that has not happened. Over the course of Q4 2012, 13-F filers boosted their holdings of Salesforce by 4.59% to an aggregate of 147,257,236 shares. Based on the share count provided in Salesforce's Q4 2013 earnings release (the company has yet to file its 10-K for fiscal 2013), 13-F filers collectively own 96.12% of the company's shares.For the short thesis regarding Salesforce to become a profitable one, the company's stock must decline. But that is something that is difficult to achieve when long-term investors who are, on average, adding to their positions, hold virtually all of the company's outstanding shares. Until there is a meaningful decline in the amount of shares held by investors such as Fidelity, we believe that it will be difficult for the short thesis regarding Salesforce to be a profitable one.Measuring Salesforce's Value Creation: Can it be Done?One of the hardest aspects of measuring the value of Salesforce is that it is not easy to determine the right metric. GAAP earnings cannot be used, for there are none. Non-GAAP earnings are, the company's critics charge, a deceitful tool used by management to sustain the company's share price. And because most of Salesforce's operating cash flow is generated through stock-based compensation, the company's critics charge that it should be ignored. However, the amount of stockholder's equity that Salesforce has on its balance sheet is, in our view, an appropriate measure. The company's stockholder's equity allows for the conflicting aspects of Salesforce's GAAP income and its operating cash flow to be reconciled. It incorporates the accumulated deficit that Salesforce has generated through its GAAP losses (caused in large part by stock-based compensation), but also accounts for the cash that the company generates (largely due to stock-based compensation). The table below shows Salesforce's book value over the last 5 fiscal years.Salesforce Book Value (in Thousands of $)*Share count based on the outstanding share calculations presented in Salesforce's Q4 2013 earnings release; the company's 10-K for fiscal 2013 has yet to be filedAs the table above shows, the reconciliation between Salesforce's cash flow and its GAAP losses shows that the company is failing when it comes to growing tangible book value per share. While it is true that on a non-tangible basis, Salesforce is growing its book value per share at a solid rate, that growth is based on a surge in goodwill, which now comprises the majority of Salesforce's stockholder equity. When the effects of Salesforce's acquisition spree are excluded, book value has been falling since fiscal 2010, on both a per share and absolute basis. The surge in Salesforce's goodwill highlights the fragile nature of the bullish thesis for Salesforce. But that does not make the stock a viable short.Playing With Fire: Warnings for Both SidesIn our view, the best investment in Salesforce is none at all. For bulls, it is easy to be reigned in by the company's continued revenue growth and operating cash flows, as well as continued support from sell-side analysts. But this thesis is built on a house of cards. Salesforce's incessant issuance of stock has negatively affected even its book value per share, which we see as a way of reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP effects of the company's stock issuance. While it may be true that Salesforce does not burn cash through the issuance of stock, the company is issuing so much of it that the amount of cash that can be claimed by each share of Salesforce is falling. And all of the growth in Salesforce's nominal book value can be traced to the surge in the goodwill that the company holds on its balance sheet. In our view, no bullish thesis for Salesforce can be valid given such dynamics. However, shorting shares of Salesforce is not the answer to this.As we have stated several times, institutional investors are preventing the short thesis for Salesforce from playing out. In Q4 2012, these investors increased their holdings of Salesforce by over 4%, and control virtually all of the company's outstanding shares. And these institutional investors, for better or worse, listen to what sell-side analysts say and write about Salesforce. And given that Salesforce is continuing to meet the demands of the sell-side when it comes to non-GAAP earnings, deferred revenue, and other metrics, price targets and non-GAAP estimates are likely to continue to rise, thereby providing continued support to the company's share price. Short-sellers should also consider the opportunity cost of shorting Salesforce. We see little reason to tie up capital in shorting a stock where the dynamics are ""stacked against"" short-sellers in such a meaningful way, and we believe that there are a variety of investing opportunities (on both the long and short side) than shorting Salesforce. The best investment in Salesforce is no investment. The bullish thesis for the company is weak, but there has been little, if anything to suggest that the short thesis will be able to play out. We believe that investors considering an investment in Salesforce should avoid the temptation to play with fire and look elsewhere.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1261561,30951,2013-03-10T21:57:31-04:00,,"In a recent article I wrote about what I believe to be the ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) ""bubble,"" I got the following comment from SA member, Kafkaesque2 regarding trying to short a stock on valuation:Now, I don't generally follow Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), but I know people have been margin called trying to short this secular growth story for quite a while. That being said, as I have explored this analogy, it has become increasingly clear to me just how cheap Salesforce.com is compared to ARM Holdings. Let me explain.Use Free Cash Flow For Hyper Growth, Not Earnings Per ShareHigh growth stories often need to reinvest heavily in their businesses, which means that during the growth spurt, EPS is not the right metric to use; free cash flow is. Free cash flow allows investors to get a solid handle on the financial health of a company in a way that goes beyond the GAAP EPS measure. Eventually, GAAP profits need to come in, but until then as long as free cash flow is healthy, then investors are likely to swallow a really strong top-line growth story.Revenue Growth: A ComparisonSalesforce.com's Y/Y quarterly revenue growth has been and continues to be >30%, thanks to a pretty secular cloud SaaS play, although it seems that revenue growth (naturally) has been slowing:CRM Revenue Quarterly YoY Growth data by YChartsARM Holdings' sales growth has also been slowing, and current sell-side analysts expect FY2013 to see revenue growth come in at ~15%, which is a slowdown from FY2012's 19% growth.ARMH Revenue Quarterly YoY Growth data by YChartsValuations: Price/Free Cash FlowThe core of my argument is that while Salesforce trades at a forward P/E of 75, the company generated $470M in FCF over the last 12 months, meaning that it trades at 57x FCF. Quite expensive, but did you know that ARM Holdings, at a $19.5B market cap (compared to Salesforce.com's $27B market cap), generated only $83M in FCF in the last twelve months? This means that ARM trades at an astoundingly expensive 234x FCF. Just looking at cash flow, we see ARM gets a lot cheaper at ""only"" 77x cash flow.ConclusionSalesforce.com is growing faster, generates significantly more free cash flow, and is quite obviously cheaper than ARM Holdings. Just some food for thought.Disclosure: I am short ARMH. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1286281,21305,2013-03-19T12:36:39-04:00,,"Salesforce.com inc. (NYSE:CRM) provides enterprise cloud computing solutions to various businesses and industries worldwide. It was the initial leader in its field, but now it is seeing vastly increased competition from such companies as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP), and many others. This extra competition is likely to increase CRM's costs even further, and they will help to make CRM a strong sell. CRM may buy another new company (new program that Benioff praises as #1), but CRM's financial performance will allow it to get hammered. The now likely US slowdown/recession will show CRM as a low revenue growth company that is losing money every quarter. This kind of company is typically punished by the market. Below are the many negative headwinds CRM faces.To start, the above listed companies are not small competitors that you can just laugh off. In fact Oracle's Larry Ellison announced last year on CNBC that Oracle had just completed a seven year development cycle for its new ""cloud"" products. This included rewrites of many of its software packages for use in the cloud. This process clearly gave Oracle the opportunity to architect a consistent software package that would have a consistent user interface. CRM's products are just a mismatched bunch of programs from companies bought out by CRM. This will make them much more expensive to maintain. In fact the chart of CRM's quarterly R&D expenses shows clearly that they are rising much faster than revenues are.Revenue only rose 32% in Q4 2013 and 35% for FY2013 (CRM's fiscal year ended January 31, 2013). This growth is expected to slow in FY2014 to 25%-27%. By contrast R & D costs increased by 45% to $430 million in FY2013. From recent announcements, CRM is likely to keep up this pace of growth in R & D (or even accelerate it). Marketing expenses grew by 40% in FY2013 to $1.6B. Advertising expense was $110.7 million in FY2013 versus $80.3 million in FY2012 (about +38%). Cost of revenues grew by 40% year over year in Q4 2013 to $683 million. In other words, CRM's expenses are growing much faster than its revenues. This doesn't look good for the future.Some point to CRM's growing earnings. However, these are just adjusted earnings. I quote CRM's 10-K, ""We expect to incur net GAAP losses in the future. We have incurred net losses in each fiscal quarter since July 31, 2011."" Overall the downtrend in GAAP earnings has been in place for at least four years. FY2010 GAAP net income was $80.719 million. FY2011 GAAP net income was $64.474 million. FY2012 GAAP net income was a loss of -$11.572 million. FY2013 GAAP net income was a loss of -$270.445 million. A good portion of the FY2013 loss was a write off of expiring tax deductions that CRM wouldn't be able to take because it isn't profitable. We may see more of this in the future. CRM has a net profit margin of -8.87% (NYSE:TTM). It also has 11.30% short interest, and it is one of the most highly shorted stocks in the S&P 500.Some point to CRM's deferred revenues that reached roughly $1.9B by year-end 2013. However, all of this is not necessarily guaranteed. Plus those same people completely ignore the fact that CRM has $1.2B in stock compensation that needs to be amortized to costs and expenses from fiscal 2014-2017, and this does not even include any new stock compensation that will be granted in those years. For instance this $1.2B includes $491.0 million in FY2014 costs, not including the further stock compensation awards during FY2014 (this year). In this light those deferred revenues don't look quite so great.Yes, cloud technology is supposed to be a growing field. However, the competition from truly big players has been growing much faster than CRM or the cloud market. Oracle is near a $1B in run rate already. It expects this to grow considerably in FY2013. IBM's cloud revenues were up 80% year over year in Q4 2012. By 2015 SAP expects its cloud business to be worth 2 billion Euros. I had trouble separating MSFT's cloud revenues out, but they are growing quickly too. Even MS Office is in the cloud. I could go on, but the point is that many big businesses are growing their cloud segments quickly. They have been around for years, especially IBM. They have great long-term enterprise customer relationships. They are positioned to take some of CRM's cloud business in the future, especially in the enterprise arena. This will impact CRM's churn rates and overall sales negatively.CRM has also recently closed a sale of $1B of convertible notes, which mature in 2018. The initial conversion rate will be 3.7628 shares of common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of notes ($265.76 per share). CRM additionally entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers. CRM entered into warrant transactions with its hedge counterparties. This all effectively dilutes the current number of shares, albeit at higher prices than the current stock price. This will tend to put a cap on the stock price, and it will make greedy growth investors unhappy. Some may exit their stock positions after a re-evaluation of the risk/reward ratio.After the BuddyMedia acquisition in 2012, a considerable amount ($1.53B) of CRM's assets are actually only goodwill. Some investors consider this nothing but hot air. This huge amount of goodwill on the books will probably discourage some serious investors.Mark Moerdler of Bernstein Research asserts that CRM's results would be much lower on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis if CRM used the more conservative accounting practices of other software firms. Two items that he was particularly disturbed about were that CRM capitalizes both sales commissions and software development expenses instead of expensing them as other companies do. CRM also adjusts out stock based compensation. I have already pointed out above how big an expense this is. Benioff's wink and a smile are anything but the actions of a friend.On top of all of these negative factors, CRM has to deal with the fact that $525.304 million (17%+) in revenues for FY2013 were from Europe. $2,123.736 million of revenue was from the Americas (about 70%). The rest of revenues ($401.2 million) were from the Asia Pacific. The Euro Area is in recession already with the last two 2012 GDP growth readings at Q3 -0.60% and Q4 -0.90%. The EU recession seems to be getting worse. Other data substantiates this.The NY Times reported recently that 1,000 Italian businesses have failed each day for the last year. Spain has 26.6% ""official"" unemployment, huge real estate problems, huge banking problems even after the recent bailout, and a December 2012 retail sales growth figure of -10.7%. Further neither Spain or Italy is coming close to meeting its deficit reduction goals. Greece has only 26% unemployment. This should give you an idea of just how ill Spain's economy is. The Eurozone unemployment is at a record high of 11.8%. This all means that CRM's European sales are likely to be significantly negatively impacted in its FY2014 (FY2013 for most companies).In the US, the Q4 2012 GDP Growth was only +0.1%. Subsequently the payroll taxes were increased by about 2.9% of income for the average American at the beginning of January 2013. Plus a variety of tax increases on the capital gains and dividends were added on the ""rich."" At the beginning of March 2013, Obama signed an order activating the sequester spending cuts. Together these two actions are expected by many experts to cost the US economy roughly -2% in GDP growth in 2013. This could very well mean a US recession in 2013. It will almost certainly mean lower revenue growth for CRM.Investors in high growth stocks don't like it when that growth slows down. Revenue growth for CRM was already expected to slow from about 35% to about 25% in CRM's FY2014. When you remember CRM's expenses are almost all growing at rates of approximately 40%+, CRM as an investment starts to look ugly. When you further remember the fact that CRM has actually lost money on a GAAP basis for every quarter since July 31, 2011, you should think about selling your CRM. It has been trending downward in GAAP net income for much longer than that. With all of the other negatives listed above, you should have no doubt about selling now. If you are crazy about the company and its stock, you could consider buying it back after the US economic slowdown/recession in 2013. If you are an aggressive trader, you may want to short the stock. CRM is likely to get hammered this year. Plus remember it does already have 11.30% short interest. This is before real economic trouble and before increased competition asserts itself.The two-year chart of CRM provides some technical direction for this trade.The slow stochastic sub chart shows that CRM is close to overbought levels. The main chart shows that it has been in an uptrend since the early fall of 2012. With its high short interest it could continue to go up in the short term if the overall market continues to go up. Momentum stocks with high short interest that are somehow unconditionally adopted by the big brokerages often get short squeezed higher. However, the overall market is currently overbought. Many are calling for a pullback. CRM's uptrend seems to be weakening. Plus CRM is fundamentally a big loser. The company says so itself in its 10-K and 10-Q statements, if you bother to read about GAAP net income in them. A US recession in 2013 could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Performance may be so miserable that Benioff's boasting will no longer be believed.At the very least that believability should take a hiatus. If you are willing to stay in a short position through a possible short squeeze, you should be amply rewarded by August 2013 when the US Q2 GDP number comes out, although that may not be the nadir for the stock. If Congress or the Fed take action that you believe will change that GDP outcome, you may wish to re-evaluate your position.If you merely own the stock, I would sell it immediately - the fundamentals of this stock are far too negative. A strong 4-year downtrend in GAAP net income is strong enough evidence for me. The myriad other negatives just reinforce my opinion due to the GAAP net income trend. I do not like stocks that consistently lose money.CRM is a sell. It has no PE. It has a 69.1 FPE, but this number has proven to be a mirage for the last two years at least. The old saying, ""fool me once shame on you; fool me twice shame on me"" comes to mind. Benioff has been fooling people for quite a long time. Some people have made money due to his excellent snake oil salesman skills. However, a recession will make him much less believable. Further CRM fell roughly 70% in the last recession as ""growth"" stocks tend to do. CRM is a ""shoe in"" to fall dramatically in a US economic slowdown/recession, especially with the Europe in a still deepening recession. The average analyst recommendation for CRM is 2.0 (a buy). The CAPS rating on CRM is one star (a strong sell). Usually when the dichotomy between these two ratings is this great, the major brokerage analysts are the ones behind the curve. Listen to the CAPS people.NOTE: Some of the financial information above is from Yahoo Finance.Good Luck Trading.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours.

We compared the sales growth rates of both firms, but we didn't get into much detail about Salesforce.com. In this report, we'll go into more detail when we compare those two companies and other firms competing in the industry.That said, ultimately, our goal is to reach an investment recommendation based on the facts. Hopefully, that investment recommendation will improve our risk-adjusted performance. Oracle's share price tanked about a week after the release of the report, and investors who followed my recommendation saved money. If I can correctly forecast Salesforce.com's share price, investors will save some of their hard earned capital.In this report, we'll cover Salesforce.com's historic financial performance relative to its peers. Also, we'll discuss the statement of cash flows, balance sheet, and stock-based expenses. Next, we'll forecast fiscal 2014 financial performance and develop a forward valuation. Finally, we'll conclude the report with an investment recommendation and suggestions for further research.Salesforce.com's valuations are a bit extended; thus, investors should reduce long-equity exposure. Now, we'll discuss the firm's financial performance relative to its peers.Financial PerformanceWe'll compare Salesforce.com's historic financial performance to IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), SAP (NYSE:SAP), and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). Workday and Salesforce.com are both growth firms. IBM, Oracle and SAP are established firms that I categorize as growth at a reasonable price firms. That said, I'm comparing these firms because they compete in the enterprise software, including cloud-based applications, business. In other words, we are doing industry analysis on the application software industry. We'll do some in-depth analysis of the historic performance of the six firms.Between fiscal 2003 and 2013, total revenue grew at an annual compound rate of 51 percent. In fiscal 2011, revenue grew 27 percent; in fiscal 2012, revenue grew 37 percent, and in fiscal 2013, revenue grew 35 percent.Revenue from subscriptions and support grew 28 percent in 2011, 37 percent in 2012, and 35 percent in 2013. That is in-line with consolidated revenue growth. Adobe's marketing cloud revenue grew 35 percent in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. IBM's services revenue increased almost 7 percent in fiscal 2011 and declined 2 percent in fiscal 2012. Oracle's software revenue increased 17 percent in fiscal 2011 and 9 percent in fiscal 2012; service revenue increased 19 percent in fiscal 2011 and 1 percent in fiscal 2012. SAP's software revenue increased 20 percent in 2011 and 13 percent in 2012; the cloud subscriptions and support revenue is insignificant but increasing. Workday's subscription and services revenue increased 115 percent in fiscal 2013. Salesforce.com's revenue is growing faster than its competitors, the exception being Workday.Salesforce.com's consolidated gross profit margin declined from roughly 80 percent to 78 percent. Adobe's gross profit margin is roughly 89 percent. IBM's gross profit margin is roughly 47 percent; the service business has a gross margin closer to 66 percent. Oracle's gross margin was unavailable. SAP's software and services gross margin is just below 60 percent; the gross profit margin is 69 percent. Workday's gross profit margin increased from roughly 51 percent to 57 percent. Compared to its competitors, Salesforce.com had a higher gross margin.Salesforce.com's operating expenses warrant covering in detail. Research and development spending increased 42 percent in fiscal 2011, compared to 2010, 57 percent in 2012, and 45 percent in 2013; as a percentage of total revenue, R&D spending increased from about 11 percent to about 14 percent. Marketing and sales grew 31 percent in fiscal 2011, 48 percent in fiscal 2012, and 38 percent in fiscal 2013; as a percentage of revenue, marketing and sales increased from 48 percent to 53 percent. The firm spends a substantial amount of its revenue on marketing & sales; in other words, Salesforce.com is using marketing and sales spending to drive revenue growth. As a result of marketing and sales spending, operating income was negative in fiscal 2012 and 2013.In comparison, IBM spends about 6 percent of revenues on R&D. Oracle spends roughly 20 percent of revenues on sales and marketing and roughly 13 percent of revenues on R&D. SAP spends roughly the same percentage of revenues on R&D and about half as much on sales and marketing. Workday spends considerably more on R&D and about the same percentage of revenues on sales and marketing. Salesforce's R&D spending is in-line with the industry; however, the sales and marketing spending is well above the industry. That said, if sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue declines, Salesforce.com's sales growth will probably slow.Salesforce.com remains a growth company. I like what they are doing with the sales and marketing spending as a percentage of revenues. However, I would like to see the firm spend more on R&D. Next, we'll analyze the firm's cash flow statements.Cash FlowsCash is king. In this section, we'll examine the historic cash flows of Salesforce.com. The cash flow statements will give us an idea of how much money the firm is generating from operating activities and how it is using that money. While the firm is generating a net loss, cash flow from operations is positive.There are a few key non-cash expenses that when added to net income create a substantial cash flow from operations. Depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred commissions and the expenses related to stock-based awards are huge non-cash expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities is about 24 percent of total revenue. Also, net cash provided by operating activities grew 20+ percent the past three years.The past three years, Salesforce.com has spent a substantial portion of its revenues on business combinations. Thus, the firm is pursuing a growth through acquisition strategy rather than spending the money on R&D to innovate products in-house. Capital expenditure the past few years was less than 10 percent of revenue. Also, Salesforce.com continues to raise capital from investors.The two key points from the cash flow statement are that the firm generates a substantial amount of operating cash flow and that it is pursuing a growth through acquisition strategy.Balance SheetIn this section, we'll discuss the financial position of Salesforce.com. We'll analyze the liquidity and solvency of the firm. Also, we'll analyze some of the balance sheet account trends. Equity-holders are subordinated to debt holders during bankruptcy; thus, it is essential to examine the creditworthiness of the institution.Between the end of fiscal fourth quarter 2012 and fiscal fourth quarter 2013, the cash ratio declined from 0.72 to 0.67: the firm became less liquid. During the same period, the financial leverage ratio declined from 2.50 to 2.33: the firm became more solvent.Accounts receivable increased substantially between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2013: accounts receivables growth is confirming revenues growth. Also, the deferred commissions account increased substantially during the same period: the deferred commissions account is confirming revenues growth.While solvency improved, I would like to see a continuation of that trend. Also, the firm is liquid. The activity accounts are confirming increased business activity. Next, we'll discuss stock-based expenses.Stock-based ExpensesStock-based expenses is a significant portion of the firm's expenses. Thus, we'll do some analysis of the reported expenses. Stock-based expenses dilute current shareholders.The growth rate of stock-based expenses is well above the growth rate of revenue. Most of the stock-based expenses goes to R&D and marketing and sales personnel. About 12 percent of the marketing and sales expense is composed of stock-based expense.That said, the firm is going to have to reduce the pace of growth of stock-based expenses at some point in the near future. Next, we'll discuss my 2014 forecast and the forward valuations.Fiscal 2014 Forecast & ValuationForecasting financial performance is an essential part of valuing equity securities. That said, Salesforce.com is a growth company; consequently, I'll adjust my valuation methods.I'm forecasting total revenue in 2014 of between $3.87 billion and $4.12 billion. My forward price-sales ratio is between 6.33 and 6.72. Using a current share price of $177.34, the current price-sales ratio is 8.73.I would say on an absolute basis, the valuation is high. That said, Salesforce.com is a growth firm and a higher valuation is expected. Thus, relative to its recent valuation history basis, the firm is overvalued. Next, we'll move into the conclusion.ConclusionBased on the valuation, I think it would be a good idea for investors to reduce their long-equity exposure to the share price of Salesforce.com. Overall, the company is performing well and is a major competitor in the application software industry. At some point either sales growth will slow, or marketing and sales expenditure will slow and then sales growth will slow. For right now, this is a growth story.Further research should add more depth to the company and industry analysis.Disclaimer: This article is not meant to establish or continue an investment advisory relationship.

1285021,25096,2013-03-19T05:21:25-04:00,,"What would you pay for a company that had just over $3 billion in annual revenue last year, and lost $270MM? If you are a long-term shareholder since 2004, you've been diluted by around 35%. In a low asset industry, the return on assets has averaged 2.35% over the last decade, while the return on invested capital has averaged less than 4% over the same time period. Operating margins have never exceeded 9% and the business operates in a rapidly changing, ultra-competitive market environment. If you answered roughly $25-$26 billion, then it is very likely that you could be a shareholder, or even better an analyst with a buy rating, covering Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). In my investing experience, there are no bigger warning signs than when a CEO is outrageously promotional, or when a company's expense structure is inexplicable in contrast with a complete lack of profitability. CEO Marc Benioff might be able to sell an Eskimo air-conditioning, but the numbers tell me the stock is a house of cards, waiting to fall once all of the alchemy in non-GAAP earnings doesn't turn the company into gold.There is a very big difference in revenue and profit growth, and per-share revenue and per-share profit growth for Salesforce.com. Salesforce.com has grown revenue robustly, but profitability, and just as importantly per share profitability, has been abysmal. It is one thing to use non-GAAP earnings to exclude one-time charges, or possibly even amortization of intangibles to measure cash flow, but to exclude recurring stock-based compensation when it is one of your highest annual expenses, while being abnormally promotional on presenting the company's financial results is extremely misleading. The company epitomizes everything that was good and bad about the technology bubble of the late 1990's. Rapid innovation that enhances its users' experience is offset by a speculative excess in the stock price, which will most likely lead to disaster for Salesforce shareholders. Snake-oil salesmen charms and outrageous claims from the CEO are described as simply being gregarious or quirky, instead of slimy or misleading, because of a rapidly ascending share price. Reading the transcripts of the analysts' Q&A on a Salesforce.com earnings call is like what I imagine Justin Bieber's twitter to be like, full of love-drunk praise, without any hard-hitting commentary such as, when will this fast growing company actually turn a profit? While tech dinosaurs such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) produce prodigious free cash flows and economic profits, yet trade at less than 10 times earnings, Salesforce.com shows no sign of becoming profitable. When you think about software as a service (SAAS), no company is more prominent than Salesforce.com, but when I look at the financial statements I see a low margin business, that is growing through acquisitions and huge compensation expenses, which are propelling its sales efforts.The whole idea of the ""cloud"" sounds so exciting. The cloud serves as a portal for customers to access technology without uploading from a disk, or having to create an internal IT infrastructure to execute tasks. I have no question that cloud-based technologies will lead to tremendous profit margins for a great deal of companies, but the fact that Salesforce is unable to crack the profitability code raises serious alarm flags about its products and business structure. Having been a user of Salesforce's products and its competitors' versions, I've noticed very little distinguishable differences. There are even free versions of CRM products, which is Salesforce.com's bread and butter, that are not that bad for an individual user. Good technology businesses generate free cash flow. Salesforce.com does not generate material amounts of organic free cash flow; therefore it has to access cash from the capital markets to fund its growth initiatives. Because Salesforce is a technology based company with a relatively short history, equity capital is the ideal source to fund this growth. It is here where Marc Benioff, non-GAAP accounting, and some of the worst stock analysts in the business converge to create one of the great ""growth"" stories. The use of non-GAAP accounting and its acceptance by the analyst community allows Salesforce to pay top-dollar to talented sales reps, which can push the company's competitive products. Sales is a people profession, and just like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) attracts the top talent to pitch various investments, Salesforce.com does the same thing to promote its software and services. Funding the salaries would be impossible if the company were primarily using its cash flows, so diluting shareholders with stock issuances for employees is the only way to accomplish this. The Silicon Valley talent pool does not generally concern itself with the fundamentals of the hot stock they are being paid with, so as long as there is the perception of success and extremely high compensation, there is no reason for them not to pursue a potentially lucrative career at Salesforce. All of this leads to the illusion of growth and innovation, in excess of what is really occurring. Look no further than Benioff's claim ""Salesforce.com is on the path towards $10 billion in revenue."" If housing prices did nothing but go up, Lehman Brothers might still be thriving but gravity impacts everything, and Mr. Market might be in a coma when it comes to its valuation on Salesforce, but when he wakes up to reality, the drop could be quite steep.Broadcast.com was a very innovative company developed by Mark Cuban, but what separates Cuban from other paper-billionaires during the tech-boom was that he knew he had to cash out somehow. When his company was acquired by Yahoo, he collared his stock and cashed out when he was able to do so. Marc Benioff and Saleforce.com would be wise to do the same thing by using its inflated stock as a currency to acquire more businesses, with more attractive economics and free cash flows. It is like a game of musical chairs where the last one standing is knocked out of the game, or in this case holding Salesforce.com stock when sober valuations matter. Benioff is already filthy rich as are many long-term employees who have been able to sell their stock, but any reasonable valuation on the company would disillusion recent hires who have been paid with stock that would decline in value substantially, and no longer would seem to have the promise that they assumed it had when they took the position. The reduced valuation would make it more costly and difficult to make acquisitions or hire top talent, and the relatively commoditized flagship CRM product sales growth would very likely slow down materially, perpetuating the decreasing valuation cycle. Innovations such as the Marketing Cloud or Salesforce Chatter would be harder to come by if the stock had to fund R&D efforts using organic cash flow.On February 28th, Salesforce reported 4th quarter revenue growth of 32% to $835MM, and for the full year revenue grew 35% to $3.05 billion. In constant currency, revenue grew by 37%. Subscription and support revenue accounted for $2.87 billion of the total $3.05 billion of revenue, while professional services and other revenues were $181MM. Deferred revenue grew by 35% to $1.86 billion, while unbilled deferred revenue increased to approximately $3.5 billion. Full year operating cash flow was $737MM and non-GAAP earnings were $0.51 and $1.63 per share, in the 4th quarter and for the full year, respectively. Salesforce's liberal use of non-GAAP earnings in the 4th quarter excluded $108MM in stock-based compensation expense, $21MM in amortization of purchased intangibles, and $6MM in net non-cash interest expense related to the company's convertible notes. For the full fiscal year, the company's non-GAAP results excluded the impact of $379MM in stock-based compensation, $149MM related to the one-time tax valuation allowance established in the 3rd quarter, $88MM in amortization of purchased intangibles, and $24MM in net non-cash interest expense related to the convertible senior notes.Despite robust revenue growth, Salesforce still cannot generate economic profits, posting losses of ($0.14) per share in the 4th quarter, and ($1.92) per share for the full year. No sensible analyst would take the non-GAAP figures seriously, when the stock-based compensation figures are so consistently large and material. Stock-based compensation of $379MM is equivalent to a whopping 12.4% of total revenues. That would be like United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) excluding fuel in reporting its earnings. As of January 31st, 2013, Salesforce had 9,800 employees. This would mean that on average, each employee is making just under $40K in bonuses, but of course this is highly skewed towards management and the sales staff. Salesforce is known for its lavish parties, amenities, and compensation, which I'm sure, makes it a great place to work. For investors, however, the company is far less-friendly. Diluted shares outstanding have increased from 95MM in 2004, to 145MM in January of 2013. This means that investors in 2004 now own roughly 35% less of the company than they did in 2004. This is probably excused by most investors in the stock due to the wonderful share performance, but when Mr. Market's mood changes, and the company is no longer valued at 90 times a completely fabricated non-GAAP earnings estimate, these type of dilutive measures might be seen in a different light.To be clear, Salesforce is very wise to use its stock as a currency to pay salaries and to acquire other companies. It is like paying debt in Venezuelan bolivars, where the stated value is beyond any reasonable metrics of valuation based on intrinsic value or fundamental analysis. Because Salesforce is so far away from being profitable, the only reason the company generates free cash flow is because it is able to pay exorbitant salaries using its inflated stock. If this jet fuel were taken away, the cash burn would be significantly greater than it is, likely forcing the company to take on more debt. Acquisitions would be much more difficult to finance, and Salesforce's ambitious growth plans would be much more limited considering its $429MM R&D budget last year, is relatively meager compared to what the competition can spend. Salesforce.com is completely dependent on its stratospheric stock price to finance its operations in a rapidly changing technological landscape that requires rapid innovation. The biggest hope for shareholders is if the company can parlay its overpriced stock currency into acquiring, or developing an actual business that is capable of generating free cash flow without the benefits of absurd stock-based compensation expenses. In the last fiscal year, free cash flow excluding stock-based compensation was a paltry $178MM. Therefore, at approximately $175 per share, Salesforce.com trades at roughly 143 times trailing adjusted fee cash flow.In the company's earnings release, Salesforce raised its FY 14 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance to $3.82-$3.87 billion, and $1.93-$1.97, respectively. Salesforce continues to forecast losses in the range of ($1.22) to ($1.18) for the full year. Of course the company would be profitable if it eliminates $503MM in stock-based compensation expenses, $85MM in amortization of purchased intangibles related to acquisitions, and $27MM in net non-cash interest expense related to the convertible notes. Using the high-end of Salesforce's revenue estimates, stock-based compensation will be the equivalent of 12.9% of revenue generation. For Q1 FY 14, Salesforce forecasts revenue to grow by 27-28% to $882-887M. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.40-$0.42, while the GAAP loss per share is expected to be in the range of ($0.44) to ($0.42). The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP forecasts are the $113MM of stock-based compensation expenses, $24MM of amortization of purchased intangibles related to acquisitions, and the $7MM in net non-cash interest expenses related to the convertible senior notes that the company excludes from the GAAP numbers.Even if you take Benioff at his word and believe the company will get to $10 billion in sales, and if you extrapolate profit margins at 20%, you get a company with $2 billion in earnings power. That sounds wonderful but the current valuation would still be in excess of 10 times those lofty aspirations, providing limited upside and huge downside if the company cannot meet its goals. A shareholder today will likely own far less of the company 3-5 years out. There are also huge risks that competitors such as Microsoft, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) will gain further headway into Salesforce's key markets. If Salesforce was in a less competitive business with more durable competitive advantages, I'd be far less concerned with the lack of profitability, but I can think of few things more unpredictable than the cloud. For these reasons I'd stay far away from this stock. For an extremely risk-tolerant, long-term investor, selling out of the money calls might be a profitable endeavor assuming one is willing to go short upon being exercised.Disclosure: I am long CSCO, HPQ, MSFT.

1296221,40031,2013-03-22T18:24:41-04:00,,"Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) was among the leaders of the 2009-2010 bull run, rising more than 400% in the period. Being part of a cloud computing frenzy, it managed to bring in momentum and growth investors in that period. Much has changed since then, and the stock did not make much headway in more than two years. It has underperformed the market much of the time since late 2010. It still has above average growth levels, but that does not seem to support the current blown up valuation.Positive developmentsIn September 2012, Salesforce announced several new products: Chatterbox, which competes with Dropbox and Box; a cloud employee solution Work.com; and Marketing Cloud, which ties together solutions from Buddy Media and Radian 6, and presents competition to Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).Analysts are not shy about their opinion, with several upgrades and new coverage of Salesforce. There have been nine out of ten buy/outperform ratings, and only one neutral coverage since April 2012. William Blair's Laura Lederma said a month ago that her ""channel checks"" and also discussions with users, partners and sales reps suggest ""demand environment remains strong and that very large deals are in the pipeline."" Wedbush updated their outperform rating on 25th February citing several factors will drive revenue upside: increasing traction in the customer service market, continuing share gains in sales automation and large enterprise license agreements (ELAs).The company's CEO Mark Benioff said in the latest conference call that they are going to be aggressive on the acquisition front. He was very optimistic, citing the company signed more than 150 multimillion dollar transactions in the quarter, and nine of them were 8-figure transactions. The company also raised full fiscal 2014 revenue guidance to $3.82 billion to $3.87 billion range.Fundamentals and valuationAll of the optimism translates into an expected 27% revenue growth rate for this year, and a slower growth rate of 24% next year. Non-GAAP earnings have grown 17% in fiscal 2013, and are expected to accelerate to 20% this year, and to 27% next year. That leaves the company grossly overvalued, with a forward PE of 68, and the current price to sales ratio of 8.29. The growth levels are not near the level needed to accommodate such a hefty valuation.A ten year chart below shows the quarterly revenue growth levels and the price appreciation of Salesforce. A massive growth deceleration trend stopped in 2010, and the revenue growth accelerated again, together with the rising share price. Revenue growth peaked roughly at the same time the price did, and they diverged in late 2012, when the revenue growth continued to decelerate, but the share price moved higher. Earnings were mostly in negative territory, so they are not of much use to put in the chart. The projected adjusted earnings growth is in the 20% to 27% in the next two years. That is not nearly enough acceleration to justify the current price. CRM data by YChartsCompetitionEarly on, Salesforce enjoyed the first mover advantage in cloud computing. Much has changed since, and many large tech companies entered the field, and that is putting pressure on Salesforce, and will continue to do so, as more companies catch on. The big players are certainly there, with names as Oracle, IBM (NYSE:IBM), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Oracle has been aggressive in the cloud computing area, with its acquisitions of cloud companies: Taleo, RightNow Technologies and Eloqua. Combined with their own cloud solutions, the company expects that cloud offerings will contribute about 10% of more than $10 billion revenue from software license and subscription fees in fiscal 2013.IBM announced in their earnings call in January that their cloud operations revenue was up 80% over the same period last year. According to IBM's 2012 Business Perspective, the company expects cloud revenue to reach $7 billion by 2015.SAP has also aggressively entered the cloud field with two acquisitions: SuccessFactors for $3.4 billion and Ariba for $4.3 billion. The company said that the annual cloud related revenue reached $1.1 billion, with 95% of revenue coming from SuccessFactors.As more competitors enter the field, they will put more pressure on Saleforce's margins, growth rate, and overall profitability and market share. I am not sure it is all factored into future expectations by overly optimistic analysts, and the company itself.Price actionSalesforce's price action confirms the bullish expectations of analysts. It broke out to new all time highs in December 2012, after struggling to move higher since late 2010. The $160 level should serve as strong support. A move below $160 would confirm the possible weakness of the stock, and perhaps present a short sale opportunity.Source: StockchartsConclusionSalesforce is a weak growth story given the current fundamentals and valuation. In order to support the current valuation, it needs a much higher top and bottom line growth than it currently has. Given all the evidence currently available, it is a stock to be avoided on the long side, as there are much better opportunities elsewhere in the market.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1240481,44451,2013-03-01T14:23:20-05:00,,"This article will primarily concern itself with the overvaluation of Salesforce.com.Salesforce.com, (NYSE:CRM), is a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing and social enterprise solutions, and is dedicated to helping customers transform into social enterprises. Cloud computing refers to the use of internet-based computing, storage and connectivity technology that is used to deliver a variety of services. Salesforce is founded on the concept of delivering customer relationship management ""CRM"" and has augmented this service with new editions and enhanced features since its introduction in 2000. The business model is sound, but when looking at the performance of the company over the last decade it is clear that the company doesn't deserve its current valuation of $24 billion.To begin, it's necessary to address the competitive sector in which Salesforce.com operates. Its largest competitors include the giants, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and SAP. It also competes with smaller companies such as Zoho, which have proven capable of undercutting Salesforce by targeting small enterprise accounts. This two-sided battle with the giants for big corporate accounts and the business of smaller firms requires a tremendous amount of marketing (and a big portion of those sales dollars). This is a contributing factor as to why earnings have been unimpressive as of late.Source: MSN MoneyAs you can see, while sales have grown at an annual compounded rate of 31.90%, earnings are lower than they were in '08, even negative for the trailing twelve months. This begs the question - why Salesforce trades at a market capitalization of $24 billion dollars?It seems investors are simply building castles in the air. Since 2009, shares have climbed near a low of $20 up to $177 after hours as of 02/28 ($1 shy of the all-time high). When viewed from the fundamentals, the current valuation of Salesforce is absurd.At its current price level, Salesforce can only be regarded as a speculative issue, which has long since left the realm of trading relative to its underlying fundamentals. Would you pay $24 billion for a company that lost $11 million FY 2012 and whose CEO is too embarrassed to speak of its real GAAP earnings? After reading last night's earnings call transcript I wasn't surprised that the CEO spoke mainly of the tremendous revenue growth made this year while only addressing earnings per share in terms of non-GAAP. To put it candidly, the real GAAP earnings for Salesforce are too embarrassing to discuss. Also, there is no shareholder value being returned via dividends or share buybacks, and it certainly is not coming from real income.With this said, where's the real value? Salesforce.com income isn't relative to its market capitalization nor has its price-to-earnings ratio ever been relative to its competitors, averaging a multiple in the hundreds. Salesforce appears to be trading on hopes and headlines such as ""revenue growth of +32%"" when revenue growth is not even relevant because profits aren't keeping pace.In conclusion it seems that some of the craziness of the late '90s still remains today and is showing itself in the guise of Salesforce.com. The company has departed all standards of value and is only worth as much as what the next person is willing to pay for it. This article has not been intended as an immediate short play. Although the current valuation of Salesforce.com is irrational, it is uncertain when the stock price will come back to reality.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1238481,25047,2013-03-01T07:22:31-05:00,,"As I write this, Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) earnings are being celebrated in the after-hours session, with the stock now trading at $177, up 4.6% from the session close.Salesforce marginally beat revenue estimates, reporting $835 million versus a $830 million consensus. Salesforce also beat a $0.40 non-GAAP EPS consensus estimate by reporting $0.51. Salesforce mostly guided in-line on both revenues and non-GAAP EPS.Salesforce.com's wide gulf between GAAP earnings and non-GAAP earnings continues to widen, with it reporting a FY2013 GAAP net loss per share of ($1.92) and a non-GAAP net profit of $1.63. But that's not why I am writing this article.There is something seriously wrong going on at Salesforce.comThe reason why I am writing this is because I've become more and more aware of a seriously disturbing trend in Salesforce.com's earnings. The table below illustrates this trend.As we can see, Salesforce.com's share dilution is not only keeping up with its reported growth, but instead is racing ahead of it. By every conceivable measure something is wrong with this picture. Not only has stock-based compensation gone from 7.2% of revenues to 13.1% as estimated from Salesforce's guidance, but more amazingly, Salesforce guided diluted shares for FY2014 so high that it implies the issuance of 8.1% of the existing diluted shares in a single year. This too is accelerating from 3.6% of the diluted shares issued during FY2012, the first year where we can calculate the chance in non-GAAP diluted shares.No reason can be found for this accelerated pace other than perhaps a conscientious effort by the company to goose non-GAAP earnings by paying more and more of its compensation in shares. But even then an investor has to wonder when in a single year the company issues shares equal to 8.1% of the existing diluted shares, or whose value would amount to a full 52.4% of the entire yearly revenues!ConclusionAt the pace Salesforce is diluting its shares, there are two conclusions one can take: Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours.

Revenues and gross profit were also a record. CEO and cloud visionary Marc Benioff saw Salesforce conclude a ""spectacular finish to its fiscal year"" and then a CRM stock pop of +7.55% the next day.Along with the 7th consecutive quarterly GAAP net loss and loss per share, a 9th consecutive GAAP operating loss was reported. The cumulative GAAP operating losses during this period are now -$146.2 million and the cumulative net losses are -$282.5 million. A $157.4 million tax benefit at October 2012 results in a lesser cumulative net loss. No matter, CRM stock closed at an all-time high of $182.00.As I reviewed in detail in a previous article, Why the Salesforce GAAP Vs. Non-GAAP Divergence?, the Non-GAAP earnings per share, the core operations, have been a consistent profit while GAAP losses per share have been occurring since the quarter ending July 2011. Hence the anomalous results to-date:The year-over-year growth rate for total revenues of +32.1% just beat the expected +31.5% for the quarter ending January 2013. While still exceptional, the pace has been slowing. The initial estimates for April 2013 and July 2013 are +27.5% and +27.6%, respectively. Both revenues projections were raised slightly by analysts after the latest earnings report.The year-over-year growth rate for Non-GAAP earnings per share was +18.6% and easily beat the projected contraction of -6.9% for the quarter ending January 2013. The initial estimates for April 2013 and July 2013 are a dip to +13.5% and a rebound to +29.7%, respectively.GAAP gross margin of 78.0% reversed a downtrend and is a three-quarter high. The 15-quarter average is 79.2%. Recurring stock based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles have been allocated to cost of revenues, reducing the gross margin, and to operating expenses, reducing the operating margin. Net margin is therefore negatively affected by both. Other GAAP expenses, one-time and recurring, have also been allocated. Both current operating and net margins continue negative at -2.49% and -2.50%, respectively.Segment revenues consist of Subscription and Support (94%) and Professional Services & Other (6%). The proportion of these revenues vary little from quarter to quarter.Regional revenues year over year have increased across the board, as indicated in the impressive rise in total revenues from the prior year (+32.1%). At January 2013, these were: Americas +33.7% (70% of total revenues), Europe +37.4% (18% of total revenues), and Asia Pacific +17.3% (12% of total revenues).Deferred revenue (current and noncurrent) was an all-time high of $1.86 billion at the quarter ending January 2013. This was a strong, but slower, year-over-year increase of +35%. The quarter-over-quarter increase was an incredible +44%.Salesforce generates cash, is liquid and capital is adequate. There are no dividends or stock repurchases. Instead, Salesforce authorizes and reserves stock for future insider incentives.For the next quarter ending April 2013, management projects a GAAP loss per share of -$0.44 to -$0.42 and the analysts' average is -$0.42. A Non-GAAP earnings per share of +$0.40 to +$0.42 is estimated by management and the analysts' average is +$0.48. That is a substantial and potential divergence of $0.85+ between GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share for April 2013. The eight-quarter average for this GAAP and Non-GAAP divergence has been $0.62.Even after this latest record Non-GAAP performance, I continue risk-averse about CRM stock. My unwillingness to join the Salesforce parade is not because of the cloud business model, which is a technology sector success story. My reluctance is because of both my lower-risk profile and a general uneasiness about the insider ransacking of company wealth. As a higher risk and faster trader, I would play this on the technical analysis side and dispense with the dismal fundamentals. Therefore, I consider CRM stock a technical, fast long (or short) trade as appropriate with volatility and not a fundamental, value investing buy and hold long trade.I think the risk is, and has been since July 2011, that all Non-GAAP earnings, the core operating profit, are returned to insiders via stock incentives. This results in an ongoing GAAP loss, which more accurately reflects the outside shareholders' lack of participation in and reduction of the value of the CRM stock.The insider enrichment plan and structure implemented by management and the Board of Directors leaves no ongoing or future company wealth available to outside shareholders. Accordingly, I do not see how there can be a positive valuation of outsider shareholdings other than their portion of what has not been extracted by insiders. If management intent is to continue taking all the earnings via stock incentives, there is no future earnings stream available for outside shareholders and then no future upside valuation.Regardless, the market has spoken post-earnings and outsiders have stepped up to purchase CRM stock. Fast trade and realize gains while you can. The market is the final arbiter on this issue.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1248631,23479,2013-03-05T15:11:20-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported strong Q4 and fiscal 2013 results as revenues passed the $3 billion mark for the year ending January 31, 2013. Quarterly revenue came in at $835 million, up 32% y-o-y, while full year revenue was up 35% at $3.05 billion. Full year operating cash flows was $737 million, an increase of 25%. Growth was mainly driven by its core businesses Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, with new products such as Marketing Cloud also gaining traction with customers.As the pioneer in cloud-based platforms, Salesforce.com maintained its position as the top cloud-based CRM and marketing solutions provider in fiscal 2013. While the company has always reported high revenue growth, costs remain a concern. For the full fiscal year, GAAP net loss per share stood at $1.92 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63. [1]Below we examine some key results and trends affecting the company.Outlook For Q1 FY 2014Based on strong growth of existing products and growing adoption of its new offerings, the company raised its revenue guidance by $20 million. It now expects fiscal 2014 revenues between $3.82 billion and $3.87 billion, up 25% to 27% y-o-y. It also expects full year non-GAAP EPS to range between $1.93 and $1.97. For Q1, the company guided revenues of $882 – $887 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.40-$0.42.Rising Costs A ConcernThe cost of revenues has been trending higher and grew nearly 40% y-o-y to $683 million. This reduced gross margins slightly from 78.5% to 77.5%. R&D costs have gone up by more than 45% to $430 million as the company has been investing in new business lines. Marketing expenses are up by more nearly 40% annually at $1.6 billion. As the company enters new businesses, we expect this to grow faster than revenues in the short run before trending lower. We will keep an eye on this metric in the future.Social Media Key Driver For 2014The key change in the cloud-based software landscape is that more software sales are being driven by marketing and IT spending is no longer restricted to IT departments of a company. This is the main reason for Salesforce.com’s entry into the marketing software space. The company expects much of its software expenses coming from marketing departments and the focus of this software division has been shifting from technology departments to the Chief Marketing Officer’s departments. Salesforce has beefed up its social media offerings by acquiring companies such as Radian6 and Buddy Media as it expects marketing spend on social media to become a significant part of companies’ marketing budgets.Owing to these changes in business performance, we currently have a $131 Trefis price estimate for Salesforce.com, which is about 20% lower than current market price.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

Despite the decline, however, overall short interest is still relatively high at 9.51% of float.02/25: Wedbush Securities is looking for Salesforce to deliver solid 4Q results on Thursday, according to a report on StreetInsider.com. The firm cited increased enterprise momentum, market share gains, and an enhanced partner program designed to lure larger contracts. The firm has an Outperform rating with a price target of $195.02/20: William Blair reportedly believes that recent channel checks show Salesforce continues to operate in a strong demand environment with solid deals in the pipeline, according to a post on Barron's Online.

The firm cited opportunities for more enterprise deals.Technical ReviewSalesforce.com shares are off about 6.7% from the recent high near $179, dropping to key support near $162.50 - a key level going back to the end of last year. With sentiment on the high side, Salesforce remains vulnerable, with risk down to $160.00 in the event of a negative surprise, followed by $155.00, and the 200-Day SMA near $150.00. Conversely, resistance is at the 20-Day/50-Day SMA cross-over near $170.00, followed by $175.00, and the aforementioned high near $179.00. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummarySalesforce.com is widely expected to deliver solid top and bottom-line results for the 4Q 2013 period, thanks to increasing market share, wider adoption of software-as-a-service (NASDAQ:SAAS) applications at U.S. corporations, opportunities for larger enterprise deals, solid billings, and reports of a rich deal pipeline. The company is also plowing forward in spite of lingering macroeconomic uncertainty in the U.S. and abroad. While Salesforce.com is widely seen topping its previous guidance for the 4Q period, much of the focus will center on the guidance for 1Q 2014 and the full fiscal year.

GAAP operating losses began earlier than the net losses, in January 2011 vs. July 2011.

The quarter ending January 2013 estimate is management's outlook midpoint: an estimated non-GAAP earnings per share of +$0.39 and an estimated GAAP loss per share of -$0.24.GAAP gross margin has been in a downtrend and was a multi-year, if not all-time, low of 76.4% last quarter. The 14-quarter average is 79.2%.

However, this was a small decrease quarter-over-quarter of -3.4%. Deferred revenue peaked at an all-time high of $1.38 billion in January 2012.

This would then enable outside shareholders to perhaps realize their dwindling share of the company wealth accumulated. Originally, the ultimate goal and purpose of a corporation was to maximize shareholder wealth.

1222281,42751,2013-02-25T15:52:50-05:00,,"The enterprise cloud computing company Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) reports quarter ending January 2013 earnings on Thursday, February 28, after market close. I'll preview the details in a later post. Cloud visionary CEO Marc Benioff is once again expected to report a GAAP loss and Non-GAAP earnings.This GAAP / Non-GAAP divergence has been occurring for years, as it does with other companies. However, please note that not all companies report Non-GAAP. Some report only GAAP [e.g. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Rackspace (NYSE:RAX)]. Usually the most common and material differences in Non-GAAP and GAAP are employee stock incentive plans and amortization of intangibles such as goodwill.The issue I have with Salesforce is a Non-GAAP profit and a GAAP loss with increasing items to reconcile. The GAAP EPS dropped to $0.00 for the quarter ending April 2011, then to a loss for July 2011. A GAAP loss per share has subsequently been reported for 6 consecutive quarters. The divergence has, on average, generally increased. What's going on here? Should investors be concerned?As can been seen in the chart below, the core operations Non-GAAP earnings per share have been consistent. The GAAP loss per share and divergence from Non-GAAP earnings per share speaks for itself. The quarter ending January 2013 estimate is management's outlook midpoint: an estimated Non-GAAP earnings per share of +$0.39 and an estimated GAAP loss per share of -$0.24.For the 7 quarters ended October 2012 (from April 2011) the averages have been:GAAP Loss per Share -$0.26+ Stock Based Expenses +$0.49+ One-Time Tax Charge +$0.14+ Amortization of Purchased Intangibles +$0.13+ Amortization of Debt Discount +$0.03+ Quarterly Change in Valuation Allowance $+0.02- Income Tax Effect of Non-GAAP Items -$0.20= Non-GAAP Earnings per Share $0.35These items above are causing this divergence in Non-GAAP earnings per share and GAAP loss per share. The components of this difference, the reconciling items, are charted below. Most of these adjustments are recurring items. Two new items were reported for the latest quarter October 2012: a One-Time Tax Charge and a Quarterly Change in Valuation Allowance which are related. The Quarterly Change in Valuation Allowance is a new and yet another recurring item.Frankly, after being an auditor for over 30 years, the more reconciling items the more suspicious I become. However, the Non-GAAP versus GAAP game is open for all to play, especially including management. In fact, management has enough leeway to define their very own version of Non-GAAP for reporting purposes. That is, tout the Non-GAAP earnings and ignore the GAAP loss. CEO and CRM promoter Benioff is adept at this gamesmanship in the quarterly earnings calls and ongoing conferences (analysts, DreamForce, CloudForce, technology, etc. to ad nauseum). Let the Games Begin!For the latest quarter October 2012, these two new material items appeared and boosted Non-GAAP earnings per share: a +$0.99 ""One-time Tax Charge"" and a +$0.17 ""Quarterly Change in Valuation Allowance"". These items are based on management's judgment, and creativity, and increased the Non-GAAP earnings. For the sake of some brevity for this article, these ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" or exclusions are defined and explained by Salesforce in the prior quarterly earnings press release here beginning on page 4.Amortization of Purchased Intangibles, usually Goodwill, is not necessarily a bad thing and can actually be pointless. Goodwill is basically the premium paid for the acquisition of a company. The fair market value of Goodwill is dynamic, not a static accounting balance being amortized. So, if the acquisition is astute, the fair market value of Goodwill could increase and amortization of same is pointless. However, if the acquisition is a blunder, the fair market value of Goodwill could decrease to possibly even $0. All or a portion of the Goodwill may eventually be charged-off as an impairment. The HP (NYSE:HPQ) acquisitions of Compaq and Autonomy are recent examples of subsequent huge impairment charge-offs of Goodwill. So I will give Salesforce this Amortization of Purchased Intangibles as an acceptable exclusion from Non-GAAP earnings per share which is averaging +$0.13 per share per quarter.That leaves Stock Based Expenses as a material recurring item excluded from Non-GAAP earnings per share. This too is a common practice, especially with technology companies I cover. These are stock incentives given to CEO Benioff, officers, and employees of Salesforce. The argument is, and I agree, that being a stakeholder changes your perspective and motivation compared to being just a salaried employee. Of course, the issue is how much should these stock incentives be because the outside shareholders are seeing their share holdings diluted and their share of earnings decreased. How expensive should the incentive plan be? Should insider incentives be allowed if a GAAP loss results?Stock Based Expenses have been averaging $+0.49 per share per quarter since April 2011. Considering Salesforce has not made $0.49 per share in a quarter during this time period, this means all Non-GAAP earnings from core operations have essentially been given to CEO Benioff and other insiders. For the outside shareholder, that means $0 in earnings has been reserved for you.For perspective, as of this writing, Salesforce had approximately 140+ million shares outstanding. Per the SEC Form 10-Q filed November 28, 2012, for the quarter ending October 31, 2012, the number of shares reserved and available for future issuance under a variety of stock incentive plans was 35+ million or just under 25% of existing shares outstanding.So what is my point? A significant amount of shares are being reserved and ultimately issued to and sold by insiders per SEC Form 4 and other filings. Therefore, the GAAP earnings per share is actually a good measure of what earnings are being diverted to management and directors. The GAAP data is a better measure for outside investors such as you and me as to what our earnings or loss is. A long position taken by you may well be a purchase from an insider who is exercising his share incentives at a very low cost or basis and reaping the rewards.This is not a criticism of the quality of Salesforce cloud operations or ability to turn a profit. I am giving you my perspective of the incentive and enrichment structure designed by insiders and provided to insiders. That is, the Salesforce operation is first and foremost to enrich the insiders. To enable this enrichment the stock must be pumped and your greed excited via the Non-GAAP financial results, which are not for the outside investors. The GAAP financial results more accurately report your position as an outside shareholder.I have traded CRM stock in the past as a long and realized a gain. You may trade CRM stock now or in the future as a long and realize a gain. Just be aware that GAAP financial results are there for you to review and consider long-term plus reveal some risk. That is, the longer the GAAP losses persist, the higher the risk for outside investors as in no company financial resources left for you. The insiders' basis, their actual cost, in CRM stock is very, very low. They can survive a plunge in stock price. Can you?Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1133251,30811,2013-01-25T05:37:38-05:00,,"Shares of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) have returned 49.2% over the past 12 months. At $170.42 per share, the stock is trading very close to its 52-week high of $176.96 attained just recently. Will the solid price uptrend continue? In this article, I will elaborate on my valuation analysis which may assist you in formulating the investment decision.From a relative valuation perspective, CRM's valuation appears to be stretched based on the company's financial performance relative to its peers (see comparable analysis chart below). Sell-side analysts on average predict the firm's revenue and EBITDA to grow at CAGRs of 24.6% and 28.2%, respectively, over the next 2 fiscal years. The consensus growth estimates are markedly above the averages of 16.4% and 19.4%, respectively, for a group consisting of CRM's primary peers. However, the firm's EBITDA margin is forecasted to expand by just 1.0% over the same period, compared to the peer average of 1.4%. On the profit side, most of CRM's profitability and capital return metrics are substantially below par. The company carries a relatively higher level of debt as reflected by its above-average debt to capitalization and debt to EBITDA ratios. In terms of liquidity, CRM's free cash flow margin is only slightly higher than the peer average. Both the company's current and quick ratios are below par, reflecting a mediocre balance sheet performance.To summarize the financial comparisons, CRM's superior revenue and EBITDA growth potential would be the primary support to the stock's valuation. However, given the firm's weak profitability, I believe the stock's fair value should not trade at a substantial premium over the peer-average level. Nevertheless, the stock's various valuation multiples are trading at an average premium of 67.9% over the peer-average trading multiples (see chart above), suggesting that CRM's strong growth prospects have been fully priced in and the stock valuation may be stretched.Moreover, CRM also appears to be expensive from a historical valuation standpoint. The stock's current trailing EV/Revenue multiple of 8.5x is now trading at 11.0% premium over its historical 5-year average at 7.7x (see chart below). I believe the trading multiple premium cannot be substantiated by the firm's fundamentals provided that 1) CRM's capital return measures including ROE, ROA, and ROIC have declined gradually over the past 5 years and are currently in a negative territory; 2) the firm's profitability margins have also been trending down over the same period; and 3) despite a recovery in the top-line growth since fiscal 2009, the current revenue growth rate is still considerably below the level 5 years ago (see charts below).I also performed a DCF analysis to support my view (see DCF chart). The model incorporates the market's consensus revenue and EBITDA estimates from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2018. The purpose of this analysis is aimed to gauge the assumptions that are embedded in the current share price and thus to test the investment's margin of safety. The terminal revenue growth rate is set to be 5.0% and the terminal EBITDA margin is assumed to be the same as the market's estimated margin for fiscal 2018. Other free cash flow related items including depreciation, tax expense, capital expenditure, and net working capital investment are projected based on their historical ratios relative to the total revenue.Based on a WACC of 10.3%, a terminal growth rate of 5.0%, and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of 15.8x, the model yields a stock value of $170.92, which is fairly close to the current share price at $170.42. From my view, some of the assumptions used in the model appear to be somewhat aggressive. The 10.3% WACC appears to be low for a high-growth stock like CRM that has a 5-year beta of 1.41. Since both revenue and EBITDA are projected to grow at 5.0% in the terminal year, the model's implied terminal year EV/EBITDA multiple of 15.8x is relatively high given that CRM's peers whose revenue and EBITDA growth rates are fairly close to the 5.0% level are currently trading at a much lower valuation in terms of the EV/EBITDA metric (see comparable analysis chart above). Moreover, the model assumes the capital expenditure/revenue ratio to be constant at 5.0%, which is notably below the historical average at 6.7%. Hence, the DCF analysis suggests a limited margin of safety on CRM's valuation.Morningstar's research analyst, Rick Summer, had the following view in a recent research note which I tend to agree (sourced from Thomson One, Equity Research):The market's current sentiment on CRM remains very optimistic. According to Thomson One, of the total 42 analyst ratings, there are 13 strong buys and 22 buys. The chart shown below indicates that the market's consensus revenue estimates for CRM from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2015 have been steadily trending up over the past 18 months.Bottom line, despite CRM's robust growth potential and the market's optimistic sentiment, the stock's elevated valuation level and limited margin of safety suggest a very unfavorable risk/reward profile. From a contrarian perspective, I would assign a sell rating to CRM.The comparable analysis and DCF charts are created by the author, all other charts are sourced from Capital IQ, and all historical and consensus estimated financial data in the article and the charts are sourced from Capital IQ unless otherwise specified.Disclosure: I am short CRM.

As this industry is fairly new and seems to bring exiting possibilities and accelerated growth, many forget that a stock still needs to be able to generate positive cash flows to justify holding a stake in a company.This stock has had an impressive run up, all the way up to $170 as of this writing. I will present the reasons why this stock is the short of the year. Data Source: Salesforce's financial reports.Insiders are sellingInsiders have been selling stock as the share price has gone up these last couple of months: On January 15th, 2013,  Graham V. Smith, Salesforce's CFO, sold 1,400 shares, with proceeds of $241,388, selling at an average price of $172.42. Parker Harris, EVP of Technology, sold 4,441 shares with proceeds of $776,064, selling at an average price of $174.75.Insiders know their company inside and out, and knew that the share price was very high, and wasted no time getting rid of these shares. This tells a lot about what insiders really think of the company's ability to maintain its share price.Competitors are better investmentsSalesforce's competitors have more room for stock price growth, as its competitors' Price to Sales ratio is lower than Salesforce's 8.2x sales. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has a P/S ratio of 3.6x, and SAP (NYSE:SAP) has a Price/Sales ratio of 5.3x.Red Flag: Salesforce has too many marketable securitiesThe company currently has over $886 million in marketable securities, which is more than its fixed assets. This number keeps growing, with CRM acting like it was an investment bank, not a high-growth company.The fact that the company has so many investments with a 1% yield troubles me, because it sends a message that the company has no better projects or allocation for that cash than to get a yield of around 1% (as per the company's own 2012 Q3 report).It could instead be aggressively acquiring smaller companies, paying dividends, repurchasing shares, entering new business ventures, or allocating its capital into higher-yielding investments.This policy of allocating cash to 1%-yielding investments could also be an indication that its high-revenue growth year after year could be coming to an end, and its share price could follow.Margins related to sales are steady but decliningAs you can see, marketing and sales costs have been climbing, reflecting more difficulty in selling the company's products and services, consequently eroding net margin.The bright spot on these margins is that Salesforce is allocating greater resources to R&D, reflecting the company's need to innovate in the expansion of its product portfolio. The margins have been steady, and I have used these assumptions in the DCF valuation projections.Earnings and Cash flows are not improvingA company's operating cash flow should be positive, as it proves it is operating effectively, growing earnings and operating cash flows. In Salesforce's case, this is a red flag, as the company has razor-thin operating cash flows, which are largely driven by depreciation charges, which positively affect the operating cash flow of the company.Piotroski's F-Score: 4 out of 9According to Piotroski's way of evaluating a company's operations, which I go into detail in my article about the F-Score, this company scored 4 out of 9. Next up are the results.DCF Valuation tells it like it isNext up is a discounted cash flow valuation, in which I share the assumptions used so you can see what needs to happen for the company to be valued at each price level.As always, I have incorporated three scenarios for this company:Business as UsualPrice Target: $102.14Optimistic ScenarioPrice Target: $172.28Pessimistic ScenarioPrice Target: $89.50Weighing these three scenarios, giving a 50% chance of the ""Business as usual"" scenario playing out, a 35% of the optimistic scenario playing out and a 15% chance of the ""pessimistic"" scenario playing out, my price target for Salesforce's shares is $124.80. Standard & Poor's has a $152 price target for this stock.Identifying irrational behavior - before reality sets in - brings rewardsBehavioral economists have done countless studies to check if people react rationally (like rational economists say they do) with issues regarding money and investments.  In one experiment, a $20 bill was auctioned. The rules were simple: the highest bidder would get the $20 bill, and the runner-up will need to pay his last bid and get nothing in return. Rationality tells us nobody would pay anything above $19.99 for a $20 bill, but the results were impressive: The winner paid $28 for the $20 bill and the runner-up paid $26 and got nothing in return. This tells us of the irrational behavior of people that defies efficient market and rational economic behavior, but that is a topic for another article.Technical picture looks bearishAs the wedge continues to close, a rapid price drop is expected. This stock would be fairly valued at somewhere around $100-$125, and aligns perfectly with the December 2012 low.Next Report DateEarnings, fundamentals and technical factors will be impacting this stock before, during and after its next quarterly report, which is on February 21st, 2013.That's why I suggest the following trade to profit from the fall of Salesforce's share price back to reality.The TradeWhile waiting for the herd of investors to react rationally, I suggest a medium-term options trade to take full advantage of the moment when fundamentals finally catch up with Salesforce's share price, which can take a while, and that's why I am giving this trade until March expiration to work in your favor.Short call spread:Sell to open CRM March 2013 100 strike price calls at $69.40Buy to open CRM March 2013 170 strike price calls at $8.80This is all done for a credit of $60.55, with a maximum loss of $9.45 per contract.The trade will look like this at expiration:Risking $945 per contract with a maximum upside of $6,055 seems like a very acceptable risk/reward for me.You can push the contracts to a longer time frame to give the market time to wake up, but I do think the loss or small profit the company will eek out on February 21st, combined with profit-taking by investors will be enough to take the price down.ConclusionsWhile I do think the cloud industry will keep growing at a rate of above 25% for at least the next five years, the fact that this company is valuated at twice its competitor's sales is astounding and irrational. As you saw, the market loves the shares and today is at the very top of its valuation range, the ""optimistic"" scenario.For everyone that is going to defend this stock because of its high institutional ownership, remember what happened to Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), which had higher institutional ownership, before its earnings, and the article I wrote just before it imploded.Don't be suckered into buying the shares, sell the hype and short the shares before the price drops.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours. I have an open order to execute the recommended trade, still not filled as of Wedesday 24, 2013. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1110291,22762,2013-01-14T11:27:58-05:00,,"By Alex WilliamsSalesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff is a charismatic guy for someone who leads a company that serves the stodgy world of the enterprise. He's so well-recognized that he was put on stage this past week in Las Vegas to give a keynote at CES, the world's largest consumer electronics show. Let me say that again: an enterprise guy gave a keynote address at the world's largest consumer gizmo show. That has to be a first.But there is something nagging at me about Benioff. For all his boasting and vision of the future, Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) income statement shows a considerable loss. And so while I consider Salesforce.com an innovator, I get hung up on what the numbers say. In part for my own benefit, I took a look at the company's financial data and what others are saying about Benioff. I did this because I sense a certain amount of risk Salesforce.com is taking by showing such a loss. Of course, the swashbucklers will say: ""But matey, this is the land of pirates and scalawags - risk is just part of the sword fight. Here, have a whiskey.""The worst thoughts I have are of Benioff's castle crashing down if the tide does not turn and investors sense trouble. ""Walk down the plank of my billion-dollar sailboat, you foolish ninny, Larry is back to buy you up. Or do you want to face the sharks? They can smell you from here. How about a dime for what's worth a dollar?""Creative license is not just for wise-ass journalists, it's also a game the powerful love to play. It's not an entirely far-fetched scenario for a company's stock to take a beating. That's clear. Salesforce.com, though, has lots of supporters, including Motley Fool, which is bullish on Salesforce.com. It may look ugly but all is not what it appears to be:Yes, its revenues show the success of the SaaS model, Benioff's drive and a cohesive corporate culture. Revenues continue to climb from about $1 billion in 2009 to $2.25 billion in 2012. But in turn, Salesforce.com net income has dropped from $80 million in January 2010 to a negative of $220 million as of October 31, 2012.Here's a breakout from Seeking Alpha:Salesforce.com does not expect to have profits for the foreseeable future, sccording to a 10-Q filed in the Fall as pointed out in a Forbes post by Jeff Bailey, editor of YCharts:Revenues do continue to increase but you also have to consider what it is costing the company to do that. Marketing costs now represent more than 50 percent of revenues. And the company keeps hiring. As of January 31, 2012, Salesforce.com had 7,785 staff up from 5,306 a year earlier. In its investor call at the end of November, Salesforce.com said it added more than 550 new employees in the third quarter, including about 250 people from its acquisition of Buddy Media. That puts its total headcount to more than 9,300, up 34 percent from the third quarter last year.CRM data by YChartsIn the meantime, Benioff boasted on CNBC on Wednesday that the company has made $1 billion in acquisitions. Still, it now faces an even tougher battle with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), which last month acquired Eloqua, a marketing automation company. Salesforce.com now has to be on the hunt for an acquisition of its own. The problem? Salesforce.com doesn't have the cash reserves that Oracle has. Granted, Oracle is a much more established company, with $45 billion in major acquisitions over the past several years.Salesforce.com painted a much different picture in its third-quarter earnings call. It pointed to its growth and the historical strength of its fourth quarter. The company expects revenue in the range of $825 million to $830 million for year-over-year growth of approximately 31 percent. For the full year, Salesforce.com is in the range of $3.04 billion to $3.05 billion. Preliminary estimates for fiscal 2014 is for revenue in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.85 billion.Las Vegas is built on the illusion that is America. It comes of the belief that the future is paved with gold. Benioff sells that dream every day. He has a command of the language about ""social"" and the ""cloud"" that resonates with business. He talks about connecting businesses with Facebook and Twitter. How social technologies will change every business. But its CRM business is still its bread and butter, and CRM is now considered a pretty mature category. Social CRM is the new play for Salesforce.com. It sounds great but the cost of selling it is proving considerable.I know a lot of smart people at Salesforce.com. I love its platform play and how it is building a developer community. But as well, Benioff does not have all the answers and should be viewed with skepticism even if he is an enterprise guy who can wow a consumer electronics crowd.Original post"
1101041,36591,2013-01-08T15:55:09-05:00,,"SaaS or software as a service has become the new hot water for salesforce (NYSE:CRM). The valuation of the share overestimates the innovative and game-changing nature of this trend. In the late nineties, the idea of ""applications on demand"" started as an alternative to the incumbent software providers. The enterprise software stack ran a company on its proprietary network in a closed ERP system or centralized relational database. In order to break the license and maintenance fee model, a new approach was in order. The market had to wait another 10 years before the idea really took off. The bottleneck was the cost and the reliability of the bandwidth that feeds the data from the external servers to the company.Bandwidth was the catalystThe exponential improvement in bandwidth to Gigabits per second led to a better utilization and scalability of IT power. This trend has many shapes and forms and the market is easily confused about the potential on each level. The benefits of ""cloud"" computing are now uncontested. However, the virtualization trend has already swept through the large enterprise landscape. The success of VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) is well documented. Many large enterprises have reaped the benefits of low bandwidth costs and outsourced their IT infrastructure. They have already rationalized their software stack. There is little incentive for these companies to switch from their virtual infrastructures to a complete SaaS solution. Most of the immediate cost benefits have been utilized. For strategic reason, companies still want to own the key application software or at least the database behind it. This article gives some more background on the cloud infrastructure flavors and explains some of the difficulties of running a SaaS shop. The appeal of salesforce.com is well illustrated with the Obama election team contract. For a fast and flexible solution without much going concern, there is probably no better alternative.No party like 1999The latest round of broker target hikes have compared salesforce.com growth with the growth track records of MSFT and ORCL. The weakness in this comparison is that MSFT and ORCL quickly became unique in their size and offering. They competed against one or two equal size players and a bunch of smaller competitors. They generated so much cash from the early days, they could swallow the competition in new verticals. Oracle bought Siebel in 2005 to add CRM capacity for $5.8bn. Peoplesoft was bought after a two-year battle in 2004 for $10 bln and launched Oracle in the core ERP stack. Salesforce.com is growing fast, but its cash generation is by no means sufficient to take out Microsoft, Oracle or SAP. The incumbent players also offer cloud services, but are reluctant to cannibalize their steady maintenance revenue. The ""social network"" image of CRM is neither proprietary or impossible to integrate for the large incumbents. They can spend more R&D or buy a start-up in social enterprise media if it becomes a critical factor for its large clients. That is the advantage of a cash-rich incumbent that can leave the first mover mistakes to the challengers.CRM is an inflated M&A currencySalesforce.com is acquiring companies as if it tries to soak up all new initiatives before the incumbents can get their hands on it. This is unlikely to succeed. There is too much innovation and most new media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are open platforms. All the cash that enters the company, including deferred sales, is invested in new growth acquisitions. This growth generates higher CRM share prices, because the stock is purely valued on growth. The company seems to avoid making profits in order not to get stuck on a PE multiple. It has been able to sustain an Enterprise Value to Sales of around 7 to 8 times. This was easy to explain when it was a nimble company with a couple of 100 million in sales and huge growth potential. It is a bit awkward with a company already pushing billions in sales. The high multiple is the currency that the company needs to keep the key people from the acquisitions on board with stock options. Since the IPO in 2002, 30 million new shares have been created or a salary equivalent of $4.8 bln. The company simply needs a high valuation to stay successful. It acquires left, right and center to add sales to the core business. The new people and functionality have done little for the profit line as EBIT losses have increased.Show me the growthThe core CRM business does not generate anywhere close to the growth rates needed to sustain a 7x sales valuation. From sales automation, the CRM opportunity was an easy expansion for the company. Between 2005 and 2008 the company increased its market share in CRM from 3% to 9%. The CRM market itself grew from $9.0 bln to $10.5 bln. CRM grew its CRM sales from $270m to $945m, a 51% annual growth rate. The IDC overview now shows a 10% market share in a $11.9 bln market, a mere 7.4% annual growth rate. As the growth slows down, CRM is caught in a catch-22. It needs growth to support its share, so it can buy other companies and keep the people on board with stock options. This shares some characteristics with a pyramid game, but the model is not new in the technology sector.CAPEX is spent before cash is earnedThe subscription model of SaaS is more capital intensive than the traditional license-maintenance fee. Because it has to gain market share in a crowded market, there is no visibility on the long-term profitability of this model. CRM also needs to buy infrastructure with infrastructure providers that enable the service. How much profit it leaves on the table for companies like IBM Websphere is hard to estimate. It is clear that unlike CRM, IBM is a for-profit company that has been able to monetize part of the cloud trend. Also Oracle is not unfamiliar with running infrastructure.What is the risk of shorting CRMCRM is labeled a growth stock. Growth has become a scarce commodity in the current macro environment and can demand a premium. There is nothing wrong with that. The biggest growth stock in the universe, Apple, has lost its image as growth ""perpetuum mobile."" The sheer size of 600 bln of 'growth equity' mass has now been reduced to 500 bln. That is 4x the market cap of CRM. Growth funds that are running away from Apple have very few options. Amazon has a similar opaque business model as CRM and PE multiples are also meaningless. The short interest is relatively high with 15 million shares betting on a share price decrease. This might indicate common sense. It also constitutes a significant risk on a short squeeze. The top-20 institutional shareholders control 73% of the free float and are mostly buy and hold types. This is the ideal hedge fund pump and dump territory. Some brokers are front running the share price with higher targets. The two last quarter results were hardly exciting. The consensus has become immune to the losses. In 2008, the consensus expectation was calling for EBIT margins of 19% by 2011. That did explain the share price at the time, but now the market has ditched profitability as a valuation instrument.The price a fool will payHow long and how high the stock can go before rationality sets in, is the $25 bln  question. The stock just got a technical boost from breaking the $160 level. Broker targets are edging now toward $200 and will have a hard time re-setting higher without positive news momentum. An acquisition by a competitor is unlikely. Even for Oracle, $30 bln is a lot of money, despite Bernanke's printing efforts. The recent strong market momentum has also benefited CRM with a beta of 1.40. A short position can be taken with a horizon beyond three months. A stop-loss is needed as the pump risk is quite large. I would keep some cash ready if a short squeeze materializes and an opportunity north of $180 arises.Disclosure: I am short CRM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1066951,24513,2012-12-16T10:31:02-05:00,,"I'm attracted to companies that are growing at high rates and have management with significant insider ownership. One of the most interesting growth stocks to analyze is Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). The company is expanding into new markets, executing cost optimization measures and its management is optimistic on future growth, according to the company's last earnings transcript.The company just reported very solid earnings in late November that made the stock approach new high levels. I am always looking for compelling growth opportunities. Salesforce.com is 65% YTD and several institutional investors have been buying the stock in the recent quarters. Salesforce.com shows a strong combination of innovation and growth. Analyzing Salesforce.com EPS and sales trendsThe first step when analyzing Salesforce.com is evaluating its recent earnings per share performance. Certainly, how a company has performed in the past is helpful information because it gives you strong clues about how it will handle the future. Barring some unforeseen circumstance, most companies move in a predictable manner. CRM increased last quarter EPS at -3% compared to the same quarter in the previous year. I think the company will improve its quarterly EPS growth in the near future. I am looking for quarterly growth rates above 15%. I am not encouraged to see that CRM generated less than that number. Past growth winners (Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), etc) generated quarterly EPS growth above 15% and I am certainly looking for that level.Analysts recently upgraded its estimates for the current year, increasing their EPS projections 9%. This shows that sell-side analysts are confident in the company. In addition, Salesforce.com generated 3 year average annual EPS growth of 14%. I do not like that Salesforce.com grew less than 15% in the past 3 years, which is the minimum annual growth level I am looking for when investing in growth stocks. This fact does not prevent me from potentially investing in CRM but it is certainly a red flag.A key step in analyzing Salesforce.com is studying how sales grew in the recent quarters or years. Why is this important? Revenue growth can not be masked with accounting tricks or via cost cutting strategies. This metric tells you in simple terms how demanded a company´s products or services are. Salesforce.com revenues grew 35% last quarter year over year. CRM generated strong quarterly growth levels. I am confident in Salesforce.com's continued success in emerging economies. It is a very solid signal that CRM generated quarterly revenue growth above its last reported earnings growth levels. In addition, the company shows a 3 year annual sales growth rate of 35%. CRM sales went up more than 15% (minimum growth I require) in the past 3 years, a very encouraging signal. I think that strong sales growth levels show that the company is doing well.Salesforce.com management execution analysisIn addition to understanding CRM past EPS and sales growth it is essential to focus on analyzing ROE. The ROE is useful for comparing the profitability of a company to that of other firms in the same industry. The ROE of Salesforce.com is -14%. I do not like to see a ROE below 17% because I have found that the best growth stocks historically had ROEs above that level. A higher return on equity means that surplus funds can be invested to improve business operations without the owners of the business (stockholders) having to invest more capital. It is essential to evaluate Salesforce.com ROA which is -2%. This ratio measures a company's earnings in relation to all of the resources it has at its disposal (the shareholders' capital plus short and long-term borrowed funds). Thus, it is the most stringent and excessive test of return to shareholders.Institutional investors have been buying Salesforce.comI also evaluate recent institutional activity in the stock. In other words, I want to know which hedge funds bought the stock in recent quarters. In the recent quarter, both GLG Partners and Balyasny Asset Management among other prominent investors bought CRM at an average price of $145.Competition analysisIn this step I analyze Salesforce.com competitors. I track their most important multiples in order to easily understand how the market prices each company in comparison to CRM. Let´s review each company:One of Salesforce.com's key competitors is Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) which trades at a market cap of $156 billion and a P/E of 16x and a P/S of 3.6x. The fact that Oracle keeps expanding in both the US and emerging markets could be a potential threat to CRM core segments. Oracle trades at a lower P/E than CRM. Sometimes this shows that the market places lower expectations in Oracle. It is important to understand whether Oracle fundamentals are much better than Salesforce.com's.Salesforce.com also competes against SAP (NYSE:SAP) in some areas. This stock trades at 25x earnings, 5.28x sales plus a market cap of $95 billion. I find interesting that SAP trades at a lower P/S than Salesforce.com. Is this a signal of lower revenue expectations for SAP? I am very confident in CRM growth.Intiuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is another competitor to take a look at. It trades at 25x earnings and 4.25x sales, compared to CRM's P/E of 82x and P/S of 7.7x. I will also evaluate Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This stock trades at 14x earnings and 3.08x sales. MSFT competes in several cloud segments.Valuation analysisThe final step is evaluating how cheap or expensive Salesforce.com stock is in relation to its industry and the market. I like to use simple multiples as the current and forward P/E and P/B and P/S to analyze whether CRM is cheap or expensive. Salesforce.com is trading at 82x trailing P/E in comparison to its industry average P/E of 32x and SP&500 P/E of 15x. Salesforce.com trades at a premium to the general market. I think that investors have high expectations on CRM projected EPS for 2013. The company trades at a premium to the industry average P/E of 32x. This indicates that the market has good expectations for CRM numbers for 2013. It is essential to evaluate CRM 5 year average P/E ratio in order to get a complete perspective. The company has a 5 year avg. P/E of 800x. In addition to its P/E, CRM trades at 10x book and 7.7x sales.ConclusionI think that the stock is a very compelling growth opportunity. I do not like the fact that the company trades at very high valuation levels but institutional investors keep buying it and analysts keep upgrading its expectations. This is one of the most interesting tech picks to consider.Disclosure: I am long CRM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1029761,21305,2012-11-27T05:48:05-05:00,,"In Q3 2013 (the quarter ending October 31, 2012), Saleforce.com (NYSE:CRM) lost $220.3 million in net income. This is the GAAP income. It is the only valid long-term way of assessing a company's viability. CRM's trend in net income has been going consistently downward for years.The net income for the last few years has been:The above is a clear and steady downtrend. Benioff's boasting about CRM's growth is questionable at best. In reality it seems a ""growth"" in losses. A pictorial approximation of the above data is below.Another factor is expenses. Revenues grew to $788.0 million in Q3 2013 (+35% year over year). However, other expenses grew even faster. The chart below shows the quarterly R&D expense growth. This has grown approximately 100% over the past two years (FY2011 and FY2012). This is a faster growth rate than the above-mentioned revenue growth. It is showing no signs of abating.If anything, the R&D expenses have been accelerating. When you consider that CRM's programs are almost all programs bought from other companies, it is easy to see how R&D expenses as a proportion of income almost have to grow quickly. Logically, programs without any overriding architectural guidance as they were being written should be harder, more expensive, and slower to maintain and/or expand. When many use different languages, etc., they are again more difficult, slower, and more expensive to maintain and expand.R&D expense growth is likely to be a continuing problem for CRM. If you compare the quarterly R&D expense in the Q3 2012 quarter ($114.07 million) to the year earlier quarter's expense ($76.05 million), the growth rate is about +50%. This is far higher than the revenue growth of roughly +36% year over year for the same period. When cash from operating activities falls sequentially from $136.2 million in Q2 2013 to $105.9 million in Q3 2013, the fact that R&D expenses are growing so quickly is extremely disturbing.Expenses in sales and marketing are going up quickly too. I have not looked up the figures for recent quarters, but they have risen faster than revenue in the recent past, and I expect more of the same with greater competition from major competitors such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and SAP (NYSE:SAP), who are putting increasing emphasis on cloud application sales.Further, forensic accounting experts have voiced many complaints about the legitimacy of CRM's accounting practices. They generally assert that CRM's accounting is technically legal. However, they say it is far riskier than most comparable software companies. Mark Moerdler of Bernstein Research asserts that CRM's results would be much lower on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis if CRM used the more conservative accounting practices of the other software firms. Two items he seemed particularly disturbed about were that CRM capitalizes both sales commissions and software development expenses instead of expensing them as other companies do. Then too CRM adjusts out stock based compensation. Some say everyone does this. However, Moerdler indicated in 2011 that stock based compensation was slated to grow by 100% in 2012, while revenues were only slated to grow by 34%. It is easy to see how a company can get into significant financial trouble in this way; and CRM seems to be doing just that. CRM is a SELL.The two year chart of CRM provides further guidance for a CRM trade.The slow stochastic sub chart shows that CRM is overbought. The main chart shows that CRM is far above both its 50-day SMA and its 200-day SMA. It is also above its upper Bollinger band. All of these things indicate that CRM is far overbought in the near term. Further CRM appears to be near a point at which it could (and most likely will) put in a triple top. This would be an extremely negative technical indicator.If CRM's Q3 2013 had been great, you might say that there was good reason for the stock to continue upward. However, the reality is that CRM lost $220.3 million in net income for Q3 2013. It managed to adjust out just about everything as a one-time result. However, this just is not valid. Zacks asserts that if it adjusted out everything but the stock based compensation, which CRM uses as effective salary money, it would still have lost -$0.31 per share compared to a profit of +$0.19 per share in the year-ago quarter. By almost any measure CRM is doing badly. The recent rise is most likely a short squeeze of 14% shorted CRM during the recent rally by HFT/momentum traders. CRM has no fundamental impetus for a rise in stock price. Anyone who believes Benioff's ""new accounting"" malarkey deserves the losses they will most likely soon incur. CRM does not have a PE, as it has lost money over the last 12 months. The FPE is 80.11, which is far too high for the current fundamentals. Plus the FPE is probably a pipe dream. A year ago, CRM was claiming an even lower FPE, yet now it does not even have one. CRM is a SELL. If you are an aggressive investor, you may wish to short it.Note: Some of the above fundamental data is from Yahoo Finance.Good Luck Trading.Disclosure: I am short CRM.

1029121,25062,2012-11-26T17:27:49-05:00,,"Look, I understand the case for Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).Although some people think it is overvalued at 6-7x expected revenues, there is a legitimate fundamental case for buying CRM. After all, Cramer describes CRM as the heart of the cloud, the Facebook (FB) of enterprise.Contrary indicator permashorts hate CRM like they have long hated Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Unlike them, I do not ignore revenue growth. I understand the concept of a ""gazelle"" stock which can have a growth valuation based on revenue, not earnings.Testing highs at $159, CRM could ""breakout"" like AMZN did in fall 2010. So I understand why Cramer has gradually changed his mind about CRM after several years ago saying ""stay away"" at $24 and ""I think the stock should be lower"" at $43 and ""even great companies can be too expensive"" at $54.I could care less that CRM uses non-GAAP measures to label stock-based salaries as profit, because we're only talking about half a billion dollars annually at most, which would only translate to $3-4BB in overall valuation in their $22BB market cap.Yet I am short.Shareholder demography is important to me. For example, seeing that Yuri Milner and Sean Parker had invested in Spotify was instrumental in a previous trade. So my question is: who (besides Cramer) thinks CRM stock is going up? And, who thinks CRM stock is going down?Smart MoneyCRM is the only short position in the portfolio of enterprise application investor David Heinemeier Hansson (37signals, Basecamp, Ruby on Rails). Hansson went short CRM at current levels. I consider him ""smart money"".Do you think Nassim Taleb is an idiot? Then you probably also disagree with me on Hansson. Hansson's investment style resembles the anti-fragility philosophy of Nassim Taleb.Short interest spiked in November of last year; this ""could"" happen again after last week's uninspiring earnings report. Currently at $159, the stock could selloff before January 2013 and breach $100 (like it did at the end of 2011).Dumb MoneyAndor Capital, the portfolio linked here, disclosed the largest of all hedge fund allocations to CRM. What else has Andor bet on? Andor's 13f is brimming with high-momentum growth-valuation picks.An iconic example: Andor bought Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) stock last quarter. Based on recent disclosures, Andor has by far the biggest bet on MLNX among hedge funds..But what is MNLX? It is one of 9 short picks made by Seeking Alpha Contributor Infitialis. Below is Infitialis' perfect record. Keep in mind, the probability of making 9 correct picks in a row randomly is less than 1 in 500.(Courtesy Infitialis, Infitialis has explicitly articulated the strategy which achieved these returns: identifying exceptionally irrational herd-like behavior. Or as I like to think of it, walking around the casino and seeking out the poker table with suckers.Unsurprisingly, Andor's herd-like momentum strategy preceded the fund's shut-down in 2008. It reopened in 2011. This was not an isolated occurrence; this is symptomatic of a pattern behavior.Institution Investor Alpha in 2004 describes Andor's loss of half its value in a $7BB Technology Fund--in one month. Critics described the fund's ""technology wave"" portfolio as: ""too high and too unrealistic [growth premiums]"".Fast-forward to 2012. Top-5 holdings as of latest 13f are: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple, Amazon, Salesforce and Linkedin (LNKD). These 5 popular picks alone account for over half of the disclosed funds. Perhaps Andor has some brilliantly paired short positions, or an ingenious correlation strategy among longs; perhaps I am wrong in my assessment that Andor is passing off a generic high-beta tech ETF as a hedge fund.Heads I Win, Tails You LoseThe fact that people/entities continue to entrust their money to Andor highlights the performance-chasing mediocrity incentives which often exist in management of other peoples' money. Mark Cabaniss writes a truly outstanding article on this theoretical situation in regards to Salesforce. I believe Andor Capital gives us a tangible example.When Nassim Taleb discusses anti-fragility, what really pisses him off? Decision-makers not having skin in the game. After repeatedly and dramatically failing to manage risk properly (at least by my standards), Andor Capital still gets hundreds of millions in AUM from ""select investors"". With past failures so repeatedly forgiven, one can only imagine the executives feel they have little skin in the game. I'm sure trend following has brought them great years in the past; I'm not taking that away from them. But in corrective environments Andor has proven fragile. So are its holdings--especially Salesforce.Disclosure: I am short CRM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1025051,25120,2012-11-22T23:49:51-05:00,,"Shares of Salesforce.com (CRM) rose almost 9% in Wednesday's trading session. The provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions reported its third quarter results on Tuesday after the market close.Third Quarter ResultsSalesforce.com reported third quarter revenues of $788 million, up 35% on the year. Revenues exceeded analysts' expectations of $776.5 million, despite a $13 million headwind caused by a strong dollar.The company reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.33 during the quarter, exceeding analysts' consensus by a penny. The company reported a net loss of $1.55 per share on a GAAP basis, mainly driven by $149 million charges related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets.Deferred revenues which are on-balance sheet rose 41% to $1.29 billion. Unbilled deferred revenues which are not listed on the balance sheet rose to $3 billion.OutlookFor the fourth quarter of its current fiscal 2013, Salesforce.com anticipates revenues to come in between $825 and $830 million, up 31% on the year. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to come in between $0.38 and $0.40 per share, while the company will report an expected GAAP loss between $0.23 and $0.25 per share.For the fiscal year of 2013, Salesforce.com expects full-year revenues around $3.04 billion. The company will report a GAAP net loss of $2.00-$2.02 per share, with non-GAAP earnings coming in at $1.50-$1.52 per share.Salesforce.com already issued a full-year revenue guidance for its fiscal 2014. For the year, the company expects revenues to come in between $3.80 and $3.85 billion, up roughly 26% compared to this year. The revenue guidance is in line with analysts' consensus of $3.83 billion.ValuationSalesforce.com ended its third quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company operates with a modest amount of debt, but has $515 million in convertible senior notes outstanding.For the first nine months of its fiscal 2013, Salesforce.com generated revenues of $2.22 billion. The company reported a net loss of $249.6 million, or $1.78 per diluted share.The market values Salesforce.com at $22.1 billion. This values operating assets at roughly $21.2 billion, assuming the non-conversion of the convertible senior notes. As such, operating assets are valued at roughly 7 times annual revenues and approximately a 100 times non-GAAP full-year earnings. The revenue multiple will come down to 5.5 times next year.Some Historical PerspectiveYear to date, shares of Salesforce.com have risen some 56%. Shares started the year around the $100 mark and quickly advanced to $160 in April as technology and cloud stocks in particular were hyped up in anticipation of the Facebook (FB) public offering. Shares fell back to $120 in August, but are currently exchanging hands again at $159 per share.Over the past decade, shareholders of Salesforce.com have enjoyed a good ride. Shares steadily rose from $15 in 2005 to levels around $75 in 2008. Shares fell back to $25 during the financial crisis and steadily rose to levels around $160 at the moment, trading around all-time highs. Between its fiscal 2009 and 2013, Salesforce.com almost tripled annual revenues from $1.08 billion to an estimated $3.04 billion this year. The company reported a modest profit of $43 million in 2009 and is expected to post a net loss of almost $300 million this year.Investment ThesisSalesforce.com has generated strong revenue growth over the past decade. Strong underlying revenue growth and a string of acquisitions resulted in annual revenues exceeding $3 billion this year. The strong stock performance gave the company a strong currency to buy technology companies to boost growth.Despite the tremendous revenue growth, the company is still expected to post a net loss for the full year. Even on a non-GAAP basis, the valuation multiples are extreme. More worrisome is the fact that Salesforce.com classifies stock-based compensation expenses not as a recurring expense on a GAAP basis. In the third quarter alone, Salesforce.com handed out $105 million in stock-based compensation to its employees in order to keep them motivated.CEO Benioff continues to excessively promote the company. Instead of pointing out its revenue outlook of $3.80-$3.85 billion, he comments ""I'm delighted to announce that we expect to surpass a $4 billion annual revenue run rate during our fiscal 2014.""Combining it all, I see a lot of red flags. Salesforce.com uses an inflated currency, its stock, to make acquisitions which boost revenue growth. Furthermore, its CEO seems to have a full-time job in promoting the company and its stock price. Accounting metrics are a little shady as well, with stock-based compensation expenses of $105 million in the third quarter alone being wrongly classified.I think it is clear that I won't consider a long position. However, shorting a popular stock is dangerous as well, even if your investment thesis is the right one. The market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent, so how to benefit from a share price which is expected to fall when you don't know the timing?Shares are trading around all-time highs at $160 at the moment. Shares hit these levels already back in 2010 and 2011, so on a technical basis, it could indicate that we have reached a plateau. Bearish investors could gradually over time add on to their short positions or simply initiate one at these levels.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours.

1024431,25096,2012-11-21T21:07:51-05:00,,"At a time when IT departments are tightening their belts in regard to spending, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), which we profiled in more detail before, continues to grow its top line robustly. Promotional CEO Marc Benioff won't hesitate to let you know how well Saleforce is executing, and later I'll state my case as to why I believe he is so aggressive in these efforts to boost perceptions of the company he runs. Unfortunately for long-term investors, revenue growth with negative profitability is not a winning combination, when combined with a stratospheric valuation. Few companies have been as successful or foresighted in predicting the technological shift to mobile and the cloud, but at what point do basic accounting principles and financial analysis matter? The thought that it doesn't, or that there is something else at play is what led to problems for speculators in the late 1990s, and I'm afraid that the lesson will be learned like it was when Netlfix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was trading above $300 per share. Much of Salesforce.com's ability to acquire businesses and compensate employees richly is related to the nonsensical valuation. If the gravitational impact of semi-efficient markets creeps into the picture, Saleforce.com shareholders might find themselves holding the bag for management's profligate spending practices.On November 20th, CRM reported very strong growth. Total Q3 revenue was $788MM, up 35% YoY, led by subscription and support revenues of $741MM. The numbers would have been even better if not for about $13MM in FX headwinds. What was really impressive was CRM's growth across a broad geographic. In the Americas, revenue grew by 38%; Asia by 29%; and most extraordinarily, 29% in Europe. Once again, these numbers were even better, excluding FX changes. Very few technology companies are holding flat in Europe, let alone growing by nearly 30%! You have to give credit to Saleforce.com's product assortment and marketing program, and it isn't difficult to imagine growth accelerating over the short-term if the global economy actually sees some tangible improvement. Attrition is a huge obstacle for any subscription business and CRM is no exception, with a low-teens percentage. This accounts for a big reason why CRM must continue to spend so aggressively on marketing. The company can't just rely on keeping its current clients, but must grow at a rate above attrition or raise prices to maintain revenue growth. Salesforce.com's number one business is its sales platform, which is a nice product, but it is also somewhat commoditized by other similar offerings, in my estimation. Benioff has done a great job expanding the offering portfolio to marketing, HR, etc., which has helped keep things moving in the right direction. Fortunately, the company is seeing the attrition rate improve, which augurs well for future revenue growth.The GAAP loss in the quarter was ($1.55) and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.33, or $77MM. Part of the reason for the GAAP loss was a one-time, non-cash $149MM charge as an allowance against its deferred tax assets. It seems reasonable that the company will recoup that charge in the future. Another big reason for the disconnect between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers is CRM's absurd accounting practices of eliminating stock compensation as an expense in the non-GAAP figures. This would be relevant for bond investors where the ability to pay off debt is all that matters, but for stock analysts, it is impossible to deny that stock compensation is an expense, and CRM's extremely liberal utilization of stock compensation is one of the worst examples that I have ever seen. Every quarter, shareholders are finding their ownership stakes reduced, and the reason why this doesn't cause outrage among the masses is that the stock has performed very well. Unimpressively, non-GAAP operating margins were 10% in the quarter, and while there were some charges that impacted results, CRM's farcical non-GAAP accounting doesn't even make the company look highly profitable on its ""imaginary"" basis.Operating cash flow in the quarter was $106MM, down 18% YoY. For the full year, Salesforce.com expects operating cash flow growth of about 20%. CapEx in the quarter was about 6% of revenue, or $51MM. Saleforce.com likes equating free cash flow as operating cash flow -- CapEx -- so this would result in $56MM in the quarter. Not bad, except when you factor in the reality that $105MM was expensed as stock compensation. Therefore in relevant accounting, free cash flow was a negative $49MM. Sometimes when you see a CEO who is abundantly promotional in every setting, it makes sense to ask why. What necessitates that attitude instead of letting performance stand for itself? As a long-term investor, I enjoy seeing my stocks decline when  I'm acquiring positions, and I've never been interested in having an executive play the role of cheerleader. Instead, a clear and concise statement of facts is the most effective way to deal with issues, and a perfect example of this is how the CEO of Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), Richard Handler dealt with Sean Egan's inaccurate research report in the fall of 2011. For those not aware of what happened, Handler broke down in amazingly clear detail the company's trading positions, funding structure, liquidity options, and other details that is rarely, if ever, done on Wall Street. So why does Benioff utilize this silly accounting gimmick when such a huge percentage of expenses are stock compensation?When companies don't generate substantial free cash flow, they must rely on the financial markets to fund their operations. For a growth company that relies on attracting top talent, acquiring emerging technologies in the hottest space, and that doesn't have a cash flow to support debt, the only solution is to tap the equity markets. It is alarming to shareholders when companies conduct stock offerings, as it highlights the fact that their ownership stake is being diluted, and that the company doesn't generate enough internal cash flow to fund its operations and growth initiatives. In Silicon Valley, many employees are willing to accept stock as a large part of their compensation, as long as they are optimistic that the stock will be worth something or it is perceived as hot to own. If the stock performance isn't good, then top employees might want compensation to be weighted towards cash, forcing Salesforce to adjust its operations to focus on cash generation and profits, versus top line revenue growth. Therefore, it is necessary for companies like Salesoforce.com and others to develop and utilize a non-GAAP accounting system that misleads unsophisticated investors. This inflates the currency, allowing the company to pay compensation and for acquisitions with what equates to ""monopoly money."" By paying fake currency for real businesses and talent, Salesforce.com's operations just continue to improve. Everything works great as long as that currency stays inflated. But like we saw with Greek bonds, at some point markets get it right, and when that happens, you don't want to be caught holding the bag.Since 2003, shares outstanding have grown from 26MM to 155MM. Yes, revenue has grown from $51MM to an annual run rate of $3 billion, but this is not a business that grows organically. The company's ""real"" free cash flow generation is negligible, so the top-line revenue growth, which is the basis for the valuation, is highly reliant on this inflated currency for acquisitions and compensation. After CRM's stellar third quarter non-GAAP ""earnings,"" the stock rallied to $158.80. At this price, the company has a market cap of $24.6 billion. As Warren Buffett says, ""price is what you pay and value is what you get."" Well in this case, the investor is getting $3 billion in annual revenue, which is growing nicely, operating losses, and a group of employees whose motivation would end up highly deflated if the stock were to drop precipitously. Great businesses generate earnings over time, and they generally aren't highly reliant on capital markets to propel growth. They certainly shouldn't have to consistently access equity capital because of poor cash flow generation. Eight times forward sales, over 100 times an inaccurately high earnings estimate, 11.8 times book value, and 30 times cash flow are prices that should only be paid for a great company. Maybe Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at the IPO would have warranted such a price, but those were businesses that ultimately had much greater economic fundamentals than CRM.If I were Marc Benioff, I'd use that stock to acquire profit-producing businesses. Currently, the valuation of CRM is similar to that of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), despite HPQ generating $7.5 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. Imagine how much better the financial statements would look for CRM if it had HPQ's cash flows and normalized earnings power. At that point in time, CRM would likely not need to constantly dilute its shareholders to fund the company's operations. For long-term investors, I'd suggest ignoring the hype of CRM. You might miss out on some short-term profits, but a disciplined and value-oriented approach ultimately leads to the best performance. You aren't going to win a popularity contest at your neighborhood barbecue talking about out of favor financials, or large-cap tech, but hopefully over time, you'll be able to fund your children's college tuition and retire in some comfort. I wouldn't short CRM directly, but I have sold calls on it occasionally and with success. I believe that as long as you are willing to ultimately get exercised and go short, selling calls to manufacture a better short entry point makes some sense at these levels.Disclosure: I am long HPQ, MSFT, INTC, JEF.

1016821,24802,2012-11-19T03:20:42-05:00,,"Perhaps no stock is as criticized here on Seeking Alpha as Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). There is no shortage of critics who argue that CEO Marc Benioff and his executive team are lining their pockets at the expense of the company's investors. These critics argue that the company is overvalued, with little to no competitive moat, and that its shares must fall, and that the fall must be steep.We have written about Salesforce several times, outlining our thinking as to why the stock has not collapsed, even if the merits of the short thesis are solid. At its core, the shares have not fallen for several reasons: the collective ""ignorance"" of the company's institutional investors who, along with Marc Benioff, own much of the company's shares, and sell-side analysts that emphasize non-GAAP earnings and metrics to make their bullish cases for the stock. Readers who wish to learn more about these issues can read our prior articles, linked to above.In this article, however, we will offer a preview of Salesforce's Q3 earnings, and what the company needs to deliver to keep gravity at bay once again. For the record, we hold shares of Salesforce indirectly, via a stake in the Fidelity Growth Company Fund, but hold no direct stake, and have no plans to go long or short the stock.Setting the StageSalesforce's performance over the past month defies logic, at least from a short-seller's point of view. As the S&P 500 has sold off due to worries regarding the fiscal cliff (and other issues), it would make sense that Salesforce will underperform the index by a large degree. After all, as a high beta technology stock, it is reasonable to assume that it will underperform. And when the company's weak fundamentals are added to the mix, this should, in theory, spark a decent-sized fall.As the chart above shows, this has not been the case. While Salesforce has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past month, it has dropped by less than 1% beyond the S&P 500, and has slightly outperformed the NASDAQ. Once again, Salesforce has traded far better than what its fundamentals would indicate. But, with Q3 earnings set for Tuesday, November 20, there will be a fresh opportunity for the shares to fall, depending on what kind of earnings release the company reveals.But, the shares could also rise. With Salesforce, it is important to remember that while short-sellers may not value the metrics that keep the stock propped up, they are deemed to be worthy indicators of performance for analysts and institutional investors, who view Salesforce through the prism of these metrics.Q3 Earnings: What to Watch for Regarding GuidanceAccording to Reuters consensus data, Salesforce is estimated to post non-GAAP EPS of 32 cents per share for Q3 2013 (fiscal). That matches almost precisely with Salesforce's own guidance of 31-32 cents per share for Q3 2013, which it gave when it released Q2 results at the end of AugustSalesforce will also give Q4 guidance when it releases earnings on November 20, and the current consensus estimate is for non-GAAP EPS of 40 cents per share. Salesforce has shown an ability to ""talk"" its way out of weak quarters in the past, offering convincing (if not necessarily valid) explanations as to why guidance is lighter than expected.With each quarterly earnings release, Salesforce also offers updated guidance for the full fiscal year. Currently, analysts estimate non-GAAP EPS of $1.50 for fiscal 2013 on revenues of $3 billion, which matches closely with Salesforce's existing guidance of $1.48-$1.51 in non-GAAP EPS on revenues of $3.025-$3.035 billion.Traditionally, Salesforce also uses its Q3 earnings to initiate guidance for the next fiscal year, and we expect this tradition to continue this quarter with initial guidance for fiscal 2014 to be announced.Watching the Metrics: Unbilled Revenue, Deferred Revenue, and Cash FlowMost sectors of the market have different financial metrics that investors use to gauge performance and financial strength. Airline investors look at metrics such as EBITDAR (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and aircraft rent) and CASM (cost per available seat mile). Bank investors look at Tier 1 Capital, and the percentage of loans that are non-performing. And investors in Salesforce look at unbilled deferred revenue, a key metric that measures the amount of revenues that have been contracted, but not yet billed.Essentially, it is a measure of Salesforce's backlog, as it represents future revenue that is not yet on the balance sheet as deferred revenue. Unbilled deferred revenue has no financial impact to Salesforce on either a GAAP or non-GAAP basis. It is off the company's balance sheet, and is not included in measurements of operating cash flow. IF this is the case, what is its purpose? Salesforce's investors (primarily institutional investors) and sell-side analysts utilize unbilled deferred revenue as an indicator of future prospects at Salesforce.Deferred revenue, which does show up in both the company's balance sheet and operating cash flow, plays a major role in the Salesforce bullish thesis. After all, the company's own earnings releases give deferred revenue the third bullet point of the company's list of accomplishments during the quarter, behind only revenue and operating cash flow. In the last quarter, Salesforce's deferred revenue rose by 43% compared to the previous year, to $1.34 billion. Salesforce needs to deliver continued growth in deferred revenues to maintain the bullish thesis. It should be noted that Salesforce's deferred revenues have, over the past several quarters, benefited from a change in the company's invoicing policies. Salesforce is shifting its invoicing to an annualized basis, which has no real effect on the company's finances over the life of the contract in question.But, the shift towards annualized billing, which is an ongoing process, serves to benefit deferred revenue. For example, consider a contract that Salesforce signed a contract with a customer for $10 million of service over the course of a fiscal year. If the company bills its customer twice a year (in Q1 and Q3, for 2 quarters of service at a time), it would place $2.5 million of that bill as deferred revenue during the quarter in which it sent the bill (assuming that the bill was sent at the beginning of the first quarter). But, suppose that Salesforce now sends its customer a single bill, for the entire fiscal year. In its first quarter, the company would still recognize $2.5 million of revenue, but place $7.5 million as deferred revenue.From a fundamental standpoint, business has not grown. There will still be $10 million of revenue during the fiscal year, the only thing that has changed is the timing of revenue recognition. However, deferred revenue is now higher than what it would be if billing cycles were shortened. Given that investors view deferred revenue as a sign of growth at Salesforce, expectations could be inflated due to what is, in the end, a zero-sum change to Salesforce's finances.As CEO Marc Benioff stated on the company's Q2 2013 call, ""operating cash flow is one of the best measurements of success at Salesforce."" And yet, CFO Graham Smith indicated on the company's Q2 call that operating cash flow for the third quarter would be down both sequentially (from $136.197 million) and year-over-year due to 3 reasons: the acquisition of Radian6, which will reduce cash flow by $5 million, a $15 million headwind due to working capital changes (particularly in accounts payable and prepaid expenses) and a $10 million payment due to the final part of a settlement with the state of California regarding wages.Based on CFO Graham Smith's statements, it would seem as if Salesforce's cash flows are to be impacted only by one-time issues, and that cash flow is not down because of a fundamental deterioration in the company's core business. Investors will most likely be watching Salesforce's cash flow closely to see just exactly what has impacted cash flow. Is it truly down only because of the issues that Smith discussed on the company's Q2 call, or are other, more material factors at work?ConclusionsDo we think that Salesforce is a buy? Given the current share price, as well as the company's fundamentals, it is difficult, in our view, to formulate a credible bullish thesis for the company's stock. But, that does not imply that we think investors should short the stock. For us, the best investment in Salesforce is no investment at all, from either the long or short side.As we have stated several times in prior article, a confluence of factors serve to create a floor in Salesforce's stock, and it is a floor made not of sand or dirt, but concrete and steel. And tomorrow, when Salesforce releases its Q3 2013 results, investors in Salesforce, both from the long and short side, will be able to determine whether or not cracks in that floor are forming.Disclosure: I am long CRM.

In a word -- losses.CRM released an amended 8-K today and in it are year-over-year comps for Buddy Media for the first six months of both 2011 and 2012. The results are a bit ugly. Losses are surging and the company is bleeding cash from operations:A note regarding cash flows: Focusing on operating cash and not the aggregate cash flow numbers, Buddy Media sold $83 million  in preferred stock in 2010 and 2011, so that will make the numbers look far better than the reality. Just looking at the ending cash balances  will give one the impression cash is growing. It is, but not because the  company is producing cash from operations -- those results continue to  get worse. They just sold preferred stock.Now would be the time to point the $20 million loss in the first six months of 2012, which is larger than the $14 million loss for all of 2011. But -- and this is what CRM will focus on if Buddy Media results are mentioned during the earnings call -- revenues increased. This is the same story with CRM -- increasing revenues and increasing losses. I'll go back to the analogy I  have used countless times before: I can sell $1 for $0.75 and increase  my revenues all day long. I'll also increase my losses, which is what we  are seeing at CRM.  The theory for the bulls seems to be they will somehow sprinkle ""profit  pixie dust"" on their financial results and magically begin to turn in  profits.I doubt this more every day as we are only now seeing both Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) make serious pushes into the cloud CRM space. So, if CRM has not been able to make any money when it essentially had the cloud  CRM category to itself, how the heck does anyone really think they  will be able to do it when two 10,000lb gorillas come running after  them? It can't go any lower on prices; its financials pretty much  tell us it is already there.One could make the argument that both IBM and ORCL could make a serious push to undercut CRM on prices in order to steal shares, as they both have ancillary products to buffer any hit to results they may take in doing that. CRM has no optionsDoes this mean CRM is going under? Not by a mile. It does mean that the value of the stock is but a fraction of the current price. Price and value always  eventually meet, and the value of CRM stock is well under the triple-digit share price it trades at now. They  can only buy revenue increases for so long until reality hits and  people start to expect these goofy little things like profits. When that  day comes, it will be dramatic.Disclaimer: The information in this blog post represents my own opinions and does  not contain a recommendation for any particular security or investment.

In my mind, I can't find a fundamental catalyst that will cause the valuation to compress and the stock to fall. So I'm going to hunt other game.Short Selling Nirvana:Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock beautifully represents the risk / reward of short selling irrational stocks.For about 2 years, Netflix marched unrelentingly higher despite frequent heartburn over the stock being ""over-valued"" or ""unjustifiable."" This analysis was ultimately correct, but many short sellers got their face ripped off during the interim. It was also nearly impossible to determine when this inflection point will occur. In fact, it was only when Reed Hastings shot his company in the foot with a 60% price increase and announced a split of the DVD and streaming business. This caused the decline, but who had this turn of events in their short thesis?The flip side is that once the story ""broke,"" there were massive short selling gains to be had (-83% from top to bottom, to be precise). Once the irrationality bubble pops, valuation compresses quickly as investors can no longer use momentum as their investment crutch.Valuation Is Crazy, But It Doesn't Matter (For Now):Until there is a fundamental catalyst to cause the P/E ratio to compress, it will be very hard to short Salesforce. You'll need a major slowdown in bookings or revenue growth. But this is unlikely for a few years because: 1) the company has a great set of products, 2) the addressable market is large and growing, and 3) the company's aggressive acquisition binge will extend the revenue ""story"" for a few more years.When compared with other high-tech names, only Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) trades at a higher multiple (which is also unfathomable). But Amazon, Salesforce, and Rackspace (NYSE:RAX) have had monster rallies over the past 2 years. With the overall market trading closer to 14x forward earnings, it's certainly tempting to short stocks at such insane valuations. But I am not going to fall into this temptation because I can't predict the negative fundamental catalyst with enough precision or confidence.Control Your Environment:As an investor, I focus on putting the odds in my favor by doing a lot of homework and staying disciplined. However, I find it very hard to put the odds in my favor when dealing with irrationality. Like Keynes said, ""the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.""There are so many other ways to make money in this market, so I am going fishing in another pond.Disclosure: I am long RAX.

839611,24802,2012-08-31T01:41:25-04:00,,"One of the most controversial companies here on Seeking Alpha is, without a doubt, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Actually, when we think about it a bit more, it is not that controversial. Controversy requires at least one opinion. And here on Seeking Alpha, the only opinion regarding Salesforce seems to be that it is one of the worst stocks in existence, and that the stock is destined for collapse. But rather than rehash the reasons to short the stock, we felt it would be more appropriate to provide an update on our view of the company. Our last article on Salesforce laid out an argument that the company's institutional investors are preventing the short thesis from playing out, and that the shares cannot truly fall until institutional investors head for the exits. Our article received a wide range of responses, with some readers praising our work, and other criticizing us for not stating that Salesforce is a terrible stock. But now that Salesforce has reported its Q2 2013 (fiscal) results, we felt the time was right for an update.Q2 Results: Even Salesforce Admits That Growth Is SlowingSince going public in 2004, Salesforce has always styled itself as a growth company, in terms of both revenues and earnings (in this instance, we mean earnings as Salesforce sees them, which may not be reflective of how all investors perceive them). Salesforce emphasizes non-GAAP earnings, for the company believes that they better reflect how the company truly performs. Setting aside the GAAP vs. non-GAAP debate for a moment, Salesforce is not a cheap stock by any measure. As of this writing, the stock trades at $142.69, a multiple of 95.765x the company's fiscal 2013 non-GAAP EPS estimate of $1.49 (the midpoint of guidance). On its own, a multiple of 95.765 is not inherently bad. If the company can deliver substantial growth, then perhaps such a multiple is justified. But, buried within Salesforce's Q2 results is an admission that growth is set to slow.If we subscribe to the idea that non-GAAP earnings are the way to value this company and measure its profitability, then the company needs to at least deliver non-GAAP EPS growth, even if GAAP losses continue. When Salesforce reported its most recent results, the company provided updated guidance for fiscal 2013, which is posted below.As always, Salesforce's GAAP losses are driven by the company's stock-based compensation practices, which result in expenses that overwhelm all of the company's GAAP income. But, that shouldn't matter, as long as non-GAAP EPS keeps growing. At least that is the argument that Salesforce wants investors to accept. The problem with this line of thinking is that the company actually lowered non-GAAP EPS estimates for fiscal 2013. Provided below is Salesforce's guidance from Q1 2013.As you can see, Salesforce expected to post $1.60-$1.63 in non-GAAP EPS back in May. But, 3 months later, it expects non-GAAP EPS of $1.48-$1.51, a drop of 7.43%. Growth companies such as Salesforce, especially ones that have multiples well over 90 (on non-GAAP earnings), are not supposed to lower earnings estimates. While Salesforce's Q2 non-GAAP EPS of 42 cents per share did beat its guidance for 38-39 cents per share, we believe that the lowered full-year outlook is more material. So does this mean that the stock should fall? Our analysis, which we will detail below, suggests that for the moment, Salesforce will remain at, or near current levels. But before we get into our thesis, we would like to provide some perspective on the emotions surrounding this company.An Overvalued Company is Not a FraudSalesforce, and its CEO Marc Benioff have been regularly accused of fraud, and of duping unsuspecting retail investors. We see such statements in many articles regarding this company, and often come across statements comparing Marc Benioff to a used car salesman, or a scam artist intent on enriching himself at the expense of regular investors. And since he founded Salesforce, Marc Benioff has indeed enriched himself (his current net worth is $2 billion, according to Forbes). But, Benioff has also enriched investors greatly, creating billions in shareholder value since the company went public in 2004. Though most people remember Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) as the most famous IPO that year, it is Salesforce that has given investors more profits. Since going public, Salesforce is up over 800%, compared to over 529% for Google, a gain of over 23% for S&P 500, and a gain of just over 53% for the NASDAQ.Salesforce may be overvalued, but that does not make it a fraud. Nor does the company's focus on non-GAAP earnings. By law, Salesforce is required to file GAAP financial statements with the SEC, which it does. Its 10-Q and annual filings lay out the company's GAAP losses, and they are available for any investor to see. What investors and critics of this company need to remember is that this is where the Salesforce's obligations end. The company is not required to discuss its GAAP financials on its earnings calls (aside from customary disclosures about reconciling non-GAAP financials to GAAP), nor are analysts required by law to reference them over non-GAAP financials in their research reports, even if they should do so. Salesforce is not the next Enron, for there is no fraud occurring here. And we do not subscribe to the idea that Salesforce is duping investors. The company's GAAP financials are available for any investor to analyze and if you are an investor who has made a conscious decision to invest in this company (or any other company, for that matter), then you should have examined the company's quarterly and annual filings. Do we feel Salesforce is a sound investment? Not really. We would be hard pressed to present a persuasive argument to buy shares. But, that does not make this company a fraud, nor does it make Marc Benioff a poor CEO. He has created billions in wealth for his investors. Will that wealth remain intact? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But until Salesforce comes crashing down, Benioff's track record of creating shareholder value will remain intact. Investors need to ensure that their emotions do not cloud their judgment. Salesforce's valuation may be stretched, but the company has not done anything illegal, a fact that many critics seem to forget.Whale Investors: The Elephant in the RoomOur last article on Salesforce (linked to at the beginning) focused on the company's institutional investors. In essence, our article argued that the Salesforce short thesis was being held back by the fact that the majority of the company's stock is held by institutional investors, who have been unwilling (and in some ways unable) to sell their shares. And now that 13-F filings have been released for the second quarter, we can see that this trend is fully intact.In the second quarter, 13-F filers boosted their holdings of Salesforce stock by 4.836%, to 140,213,536 shares, which represents the vast majority of Salesforce's outstanding shares (the company has not yet filed its 10-Q for this quarter, so we do not have an exact share count). And no institutional investor better illustrates the dilemma here than Fidelity. Fidelity is Salesforce's largest and oldest investor (the company has been an investor since Salesforce went public). Fidelity owns over 15% of Salesforce, and in Q2 boosted its stake by 274,944 shares to 20,808,798 shares. As we explained in our previous article on Salesforce, Fidelity is essentially trapped. It is likely sitting on large unrealized gains, due to the fact that it has owned Salesforce stock since 2004. But, because Fidelity owns over 15% of the company, it is almost impossible to sell of a meaningful amount of shares. If Fidelity began unloading stock, the sheer size of its selling will likely overwhelm the markets and send Salesforce plunging. Fidelity is hardly the only institution in such a quandary. Investors such as Sands Capital, T-Rowe Price, and Winslow Capital are all in the same boat, albeit to a lesser degree. In our view, institutional investors remain the biggest hurdle to seeing the short thesis regarding Salesforce play out. Until we see definitive proof that the company's institutional investors are capitulating, we cannot formulate a credible scenario in which Salesforce's stock plunges by a substantial amount.An Alphabet Soup of ValuationThe drama surrounding Salesforce is compounded by the fact that, in essence, every single sell-side analyst covering the company is bullish. While many critics of Salesforce believe that analysts, much like Salesforce and its CEO are defrauding investors, we do not believe this to be the case (in our view, this issue is part of a larger debate as to what the proper role of sell-side analysts should be, an issue that is beyond the scope of this article). Readers need to remember that, for better or worse, institutional investors buy into the theory that sell-side analysts provide a valuable service, and they do believe in the research that these analysts produce.That being said, we are amazed by the creativity of sell-side analysts in arriving at price targets for Salesforce. Given that a GAAP P/E multiple cannot be used for this company, other metric need to be used. And Salesforce's analysts use many interesting ones, which we break down several of them below.Do we think that these are proper multiples to value Salesforce? Yes and no. On the one hand, we do believe that a P/E multiple is not the only valuation metric that investors need to calculate when analyzing a company and its stock. On the other hand, we think that even these multiples are stretched. 31 times forward free cash flow? We present these valuation models not as an endorsement of them, but to show readers how analysts are molding the data to support their own conclusions (fundamental equity analysis is an art, not a science). And we think that far too many critics of Salesforce are forgetting that as long as the company has the unwavering support of Wall Street, it will be difficult to crack the stock. That being said, short-sellers must be vigilant. They need to watch for signs of capitulation, just like with Salesforce's institutional investors. All it takes is just one analyst to break away and begin questioning just exactly what is going on at this company. And if and when such a thing does indeed occur, that will be a clear sign that Salesforce's fall could be at hand.ConclusionsBefore condemning us for writing an article that does not label Salesforce, its CEO, and the analysts that cover it as fraudsters, we would like readers to understand our rationale for writing such a piece. Here on Seeking Alpha, we enjoy reading articles that offer a bearish view on the stocks we own far more than those that offer a bullish view. We do not need to hear the bullish thesis for Company X. We own Company X because we believe in that thesis. What we would like to hear is the bearish thesis for Company X, so that we can evaluate whether or not we have missed something, and whether or not our bullish view is as strong as we think it to be. And we wrote this article with that view in mind.Are we suggesting investors rush out and buy Salesforce stock? No. We find it difficult to offer a credible thesis as to why the stock is a good buy at this price. That being said, we find it difficult to believe that the time to short Salesforce is at hand, even if the company itself has admitted that growth is slowing. Salesforce's support amongst institutional investors and sell-side analysts is as strong as ever, and until cracks appear in that support, we believe that it will be difficult for shares of Salesforce to fall substantially. We hope this article provided readers a different take on Salesforce, and that it proved beneficial.Disclosure: I am long CRM, GOOG. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

922231,22762,2012-10-14T03:17:43-04:00,,"By Bruce ClevelandMost of us are familiar with the adage by George Santayana, who, in his biography said, ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" You may recognize it as, ""Those who ignore history are bound to repeat it."" Either way, I agree.This truism is applicable to the high-tech industry, specifically when it is applied against transformational technologies. For example, the change from mainframe computing to client-server computing. Or, for those of you old enough to remember, the move from Codasyl databases to relational databases. Companies that remain steadfastly adhered to old architectures (e.g. ADR or Cullinet - who were unassailable technology giants in the early 80's) are eventually upended and replaced by companies with new technology architectures (e.g. Oracle).The ""old"" technology that once served as a weapon to win customers, market share, employees, partners and profits eventually turns into an enormous anchor of status quo that then sinks companies into oblivion. In the enterprise, these tectonic technology shifts happen about every 10 years. The last big technology transformation was SaaS and cloud computing - led by Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM).And while enterprises are just beginning to really understand and absorb SaaS/cloud computing, an even bigger quake is shaking up IT: mobile computing.According to a recent article by Technology Review, an MIT publication, called ""Are Smart Phones Spreading Faster Than Any Technology in Human History,"" mobile computing has the potential to reshape the technology landscape faster than any other technology in history.""It took almost a century for landline phones to reach saturation, or the point at which new demand falls off. Mobile phones, by contrast, achieved saturation in just 20 years. Smartphones are on track to halve that rate yet again, and tablets could move still faster, setting consecutive records for speed-to-market saturation in the United States.While it wasn't popular at the time - consumer Internet companies were all the rage - my firm, InterWest Partners, began making serious investments in enterprise technologies in the early 2000's - in areas such as cloud/SaaS and mobile.As a result, we now have investments in cloud computing and SaaS companies that are helping enterprises to completely transform their business processes and IT infrastructure. These companies are experiencing significant year over year growth (Aria Systems, Aryaka, Get Satisfaction, Marketo, Spredfast, Virsto and Workday).At InterWest, we have put mobile at the top of the list for quite some time. In fact, we have been deliberately investing in startup companies that have architected their enterprise products with mobile as the first targeted platform. The web/browser is a secondary consideration. Companies such as Appmesh and Doximity are representative of these new ""mobile first"" companies.We believe - and the data from the Technology Report supports our thesis - that the primary compute device for all employees in the enterprise will soon become the smartphone and/or tablet. Yet, most incumbent enterprise technology providers continue to treat mobile as just another endpoint. They have not re-architected their products for mobile computing - they are not ""Mobile First."" They are ""Mobile as an Afterthought.""This ""Afterthought"" approach is similar to the approach of the now defunct Cullinet and ADR who, instead of re-architecting their products, simply ""bolted on"" a relational layer and offered it as an option. It was a kluge. The company knew it. Customers knew it. And yet, due to the need to ""preserve status quo,"" they stuck with it. Unfortunately, customers didn't stick with them.So, if mobile computing becomes a dominant enterprise platform, could this be the new battleground for innovation with a new breed of mobile-born disruptive companies?Keeping this in mind, let's take a look at some recent news. With more than 100,000 companies as customers and with 90,000 attendees at Dreamforce, Salesforce is without question one of the major forces in enterprise computing.Salesforce is clearly making big strides and acquisitions in the ever-popular social space - which, by the way, has yet to prove itself as a viable revenue channel. But just like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Salesforce doesn't seem to have a cogent strategy for mobile, arguably the biggest technology transformation the world has ever experienced.The recently announced Salesforce Touch application development environment doesn't support native iOS or Droid - it is HTML5. That approach didn't work out so well for Facebook. And Touch's functionality is going to take a while to catch up with native Salesforce web applications.We are seeing enterprise customers adopt mobile extremely fast and looking to their technology providers for solutions. Unfortunately, Salesforce's approach to mobile feels a lot like Cullinet's and ADR's approach to relational - somewhat half-baked and bolted on and certainly not tightly integrated and well thought through as many of Salesforce's other strategies have been.No one from Salesforce asked me - and they are unlikely to do so - but if they were to ask, here is how I see their options if they want to capitalize on the mobile computing transformation:The big question I have is whether they will take George Santayana's advice? At the very least, it will make for interesting history.Note: Bruce Cleveland is a General Partner with InterWest Partners  focused on software and services sector investments with an emphasis on  cloud computing, mobile and analytical applications.

The stock is up over 50% so far this year. Go back five years and it's doubled. But the stock has been running into headwinds lately. It is currently five points off its April high, and was headed down today.The reason may have been disappointment over its annual Dreamforce conference, where it doubled-down on its proprietary cloud with social and mobile applications. The company is pushing itself as a platform for application developers, seeking to make itself a corporate version of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) app store driven in part by acquisitions like Heroku, whose software can be used to transfer Java apps to Salesforce.com.Salesforce is betting that clouds will evolve as they've been evolving, with public clouds having an immense cost advantage over private clouds or enterprise applications, and enterprises moving at all deliberate speed to take advantage of this. Tim Travis writes that this reminds him of 1999. Even if earnings move up 30% as the company estimates, he thinks the stock is overvalued.The concern here -- and I'll admit I share it -- is that we expect the cloud to evolve as past platforms have evolved. That is, we expect enterprises will want their own clouds, that they will eventually reject the public cloud over concerns of security, just as time-sharing gave way to minicomputers in the 1970s.The problem with that, as my old ZDNet colleague Joe McKendrick writes at Forbes, is that those fears are overblown, and those assumptions may be in error. The cloud is actually more secure than hosting your own applications. Add that to the cost advantages and it starts to become irresistible.There will be other objections. Salesforce can expect more direct competition from applications hosted at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). It can expect closer competition from enterprise software leaders like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Also, IBM (NYSE:IBM).Maybe. What investors are buying right now is Amazon-like growth and Amazon-like profit margins. In fact, the two stocks have been tracking pretty closely together throughout this year, although if you go back further in time you'll find Salesforce with an ever-widening lead.So be as bearish as you like. Investments often climb the wall of worry to move ahead. If everyone is buying, that's when you should panic. In other words, until you start seeing more bullish commentaries here at Seeking Alpha, Salesforce remains a buy.Disclosure: I am long GOOG, IBM, MSFT.

857361,24888,2012-09-10T13:50:20-04:00,,"Many Seeking Alpha contributors have already highlighted the dubious accounting tricks of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) in order to glorify the performance of the company. Here are just a few of those articles.Actually it's not really the accounting itself - after all, the true numbers can all be dug up from the SEC filings - but rather the way they are presented by the company and most analysts.No offense meant, but I believe most investors buy a stock just because it's ""hot"", because it goes up, or because their brokers tell them to. ""If others want this stock, how can I go wrong?"" I don't have the illusion that pointing out the truth on Seeking Alpha can fight the hype of mass media, still I feel that what the critics try to explain may lose part of the readers by the amount of detail.Therefore I will give it a try to simplify their message on what Salesforce.com is doing: To complement salaries of employees, they give them stock options instead of cash.Then they say: because we did not pay our employees 100% in cash, we saved ourselves the cash, so we will not count stock-based compensations as costs and we will add the saved cash to our cash flow, as if we will never have to pay it. Moreover, we will treat the saved cash as profits and thus add them to our non-GAAP earnings.You see, because the stock-based compensation is rising and counted as non GAAP profit, they were able to ""beat"" on non-GAAP earnings. In reality, in GAAP accounting, the stock-based compensation should be counted as a real expense, this is mandatory by the SEC. That's why you see increasing GAAP losses.It's a Ponzi scheme that works as long as the stock price goes up, because if it goes down, employees will not accept stock based compensation as salary, which also means the company can no longer add this expense to its artificial cash flow.An added expense to the shareholder is the dilution that these increasing stock-based compensations are causing. Every quarter, the share count is rising. So the shareholder is fooled in a double manner. By dilution and representing costs as profits.This business model would be sustainable if some day the costs would somehow be canceled or gravely reduced, but that is very hard to imagine. You could fire half of your workforce stripping salaries and stock options, but you will need that workforce to service your customers and maintaining revenue growth. Revenue growth is the only factor that keeps investors attracted - it can't be profits since they are accelerating losses - so you don't want to imagine the effect on the stock price when revenue growth comes to a halt, or worse.Once investors realize it's a Ponzi scheme that can't keep carrying itself, the crash will be swift and hard. The only problem is that I cannot predict how much longer the investor can be fooled, in other words, when he wakes up. The evidence that investors keep falling for the story is illustrated by a recent article, Cash Growth From This Cloud King.Sunil Shah, Todd Sullivan, Christopher Wallace and others highlight the ""catches"" in Salesforce's marveled rising cash flow.Without deeper insight, instinct would tell you there must be a catch, simply by asking the following question: How can you raise cash by spending more than you earn? Spending more than earning is exactly what Salesforce.com is doing, as evidenced by the company's increasing GAAP losses.The summary is that Salesforce.com excludes the huge expense of stock based compensation to present NON GAAP profits (masking that this expense results in GAAP losses), but on the other hand they include it in their cash flow statement to present rising cash flow (masking that true cash flow from operations is falling).That is why Todd Sullivan ends his article with:Disclosure: I am short CRM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
838491,25096,2012-08-30T13:26:06-04:00,,"While the S&P 500 is not overly cheap at this point in time, it seems to me that businesses facing short-term headwinds such as Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE:HPQ) trade at all-time low discounts to intrinsic value, while a market favorite such as Salesforce.com Inc. (NYSE:CRM) can trade at valuations that remind this investor of the tech mania that was so pervasive in the late 90s. To be clear, Salesforce has an exciting business and is a leader in the ""cloud"" industry, which is likely to be one of the most attractive growth areas over the next 3-10 years; it seems to me that the current stock price offers no reflection of the intrinsic value of the business. As Warren Buffett said ""You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.""Salesforce, at close to $150 a share, offers no margin of safety and a high likelihood of undesirable future investment returns. I'd imagine that most market participants involved with Salesforce at these prices are insiders or employees, who may have difficulty selling their stock depending on certain conditions, and speculators riding the momentum train thinking that they can jump off before it derails. For institutional investors such as hedge funds, Salesforce offers a compelling short opportunity, and an even better target for call-selling for the purposes of either generating income or initiating a short position at an even more favorable entry point.To understand the expectations placed on Salesforce's future prospects, it is important to look at the raw data. The company currently trades at about 170 times the median 2013 EPS estimates, 11.1 times book value, 8.1 times sales, and 30 times cash flow. The market capitalization of $20.2 billion is greater than Dell Inc.'s (DELL-OLD) market capitalization of $19 billion, despite Dell having produced about $35 billion in net income over the last decade versus Salesforce's relatively paltry $223MM.Now obviously stock prices should reflect the discounted value of future cash flows, but it is amazing how much credit Salesforce is given despite extremely low profitability. Salesforce hasn't posted a return on equity greater than 10% at any point in the last decade, and return on invested capital has been even worse. While the business model of Salesforce is geared towards reducing acquisition costs for customers to leverage sales and marketing by reaching a critical mass, it is troubling to see a business that, despite robust revenue growth and considerable money spent on acquisitions, has been unable to generate profits above its cost of capital. R&D expenditures have been extremely high averaging just over 9% over the last ten years, but where are the returns reflecting the fruits of this spending? Technology has quite arguably the highest rate of obsolescence, so there is a huge risk that technology developed now could become obsolete 3-5 years from now. Therefore, the window to generate profits on that spending must be shorter than say for a biotech concern, but even in that world, the rate of return on R&D has been poor.In all fairness, Salesforce is a wonderful success story and is a true innovator in customer relationship management and enterprise cloud computing. Revenue has grown from $51MM in 2003 to nearly $2.5 billion over the last 12 months. Cloud computing offers an ample runway for growth, and Salesforce is as well positioned as any firm to be able to capitalize on that. Salesforce has astutely used its rich stock price as a currency to make acquisitions, which have dramatically broadened the solutions that the company can offer to clients. CEO and Chairman Marc Benioff has been a true visionary as a leader of Salesforce.com and has created a powerhouse, which has forced tech behemoths such as Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) to radically adjust their business models. Salesforce has created an ecosystem which can be accessed with incredible ease, and quite affordably, to companies both large and small for many essential enterprise technological solutions. Previously, these solutions were only really accessible through software which was only customizable for companies with large IT budgets, and were often quite ""buggy"" for lack of a better term. Non-GAAP EPS has followed the upward trajectory of revenue, and for fiscal year 2013, the company expects Non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.48-$1.51.Investors should not be slaves to GAAP, which has tremendous limitations for various businesses, but Salesforce offers one of the more egregious examples, in my personal opinion, of a company misleading market participants through emphasizing distorted figures to provide an overly optimistic view of the business. Shareholders should be looked at as partners. While management and analysts cheerleading can seemingly be forgiven when the stock performs well, if things end badly for shareholders, current activities may turn out to be seen through the rear view mirror as being less than one would hope for from a fiduciary. Non-GAAP earnings exclude the effects of stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles related to acquisitions, and net non-cash interest expense related to convertible notes. This figure does accurately portray cash flow, but a lemonade stand that expands throughout the United States while paying employees and acquiring other stands using an immensely inflated stock as currency would also show explosive non-GAAP EPS and revenue growth. Many companies issue stock and buy back nearly the equivalent amount to offset dilution, but Salesforce.com has taken dilution to a whole new level. Between 2003 to July 2012, Salesforce's share count has grown from 26MM to 139.425MM, representing a 530% increase. While an investor who previously owned 10% of the company would now own less than 2% might forgive management based on the explosive returns in the common stock, the fact that management is not including what equates to be one of the largest recurring expenses of the company in how it is evaluating its own performance should be extremely concerning. GAAP earnings are rarely mentioned in earnings calls and clearly little effort has been made to reduce dilutive practices.While software providers such as Microsoft and Oracle were initially reluctant to acknowledge the threat of cloud computing, the winds have changed and both companies along with a host of others are developing competitive solutions which could severely impact Salesforce's future profit potential. Most people that have used a CRM product know that they are fairly interchangeable, and while Salesforce has used that business to expand to being the leading innovator of other cloud technologies, anything less than Google-like growth and margin expansion would make the stock a loser at the current price. While many companies would love to buy Salesforce at an appropriate price, the $20 billion market cap is impossible to justify for well-informed perspective business buyers, which reduces the downside risks of making a bearish bet on the company. Former momentum favorites such as Cisco and Dell had businesses that performed exceptionally well over the last decade, but saw their stock prices decline by 80% or greater based upon their Salesforce-like valuations before the bubble burst in March of 2000. Those companies operated in industries with similar opportunities to what the cloud offers now, but they had less ridiculous accounting, a much better track record of profitability, and, in my opinion, more durable competitive advantages relative to Salesforce. Now my point is not to say that Salesforce can't eventually grow into its market cap, and if management uses its rich stock as a currency to invest successfully in profitable and undervalued companies, my thesis would change materially, but I thought it would be helpful to look at what type of growth Salesforce would need to achieve to warrant the current valuation.In the table below, we took the median estimate for CRM's earnings which is $0.88 per share, and we showed what the EPS would be, assuming 10%, 20%, and 30% compounded EPS growth respectively.Even if Salesforce compounded earnings at 30% a year, in year 10, EPS would only be $12.13. Assuming a 10 times earnings multiple, the stock at its present price would have offered no value whatsoever. While that multiple might seem extremely low in context with how Salesforce is currently viewed, all one has to do is look at the multiples of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google, MSFT, CSCO, and Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) to see that it is very possible. If somewhat heroic assumptions are needed over a ten-year period just to come close to justifying the current price, where is the actual profit potential for a long-term owner of the stock? At that point in time, the market will be worried about the future just like it is now and not the past, so past performance will only count for so much. For those that think 30% EPS growth is conservative, I'd encourage you to look at how few companies have achieved that type of growth, especially those that have little track record of profitability. Also it is important to note that dilution will likely continue at an aggressive rate making strong EPS growth an even larger hurdle to jump over. Salesforce is financially sound, but the more established technology heavyweights easily have the financial heft to acquire emerging technology concerns, which could increase the odds of competing successfully in Salesforce's key businesses.To be clear we don't engage in a lot of short selling and I believe that there are ample long investment opportunities to keep an investor fully invested. With that said, Institutional Investors looking to hedge portfolios using a value oriented, long-term philosophy would do well to consider a bearish bet on Salesforce. One might look to sell the January 14 200 calls for about $1,300 per option. I'd only engage in doing this if I were willing to be short the stock upon potentially being exercised, and what is nice is that the short investment thesis would be that much greater at over 200 times 2013 median EPS estimates. This might seem to be a wimpier track than shorting the stock directly, but our philosophy is based on maximizing the margin of safety and avoiding permanent losses of capital. It is very possible that Salesforce can jump over the short-term due to a short squeeze, or in response to a general market rally, but a disciplined dollar cost averaging approach to shorting the stock seems quite attractive particularly given the relative overvaluation to other businesses.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

875921,32551,2012-09-19T11:25:00-04:00,,"By Jason Born, CFAOn-demand hosted application providers (a.k.a. cloud computing companies) have seen and are expected to continue to see robust growth over the coming years. One such provider is Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) which has produced dizzying annual revenue growth of about 35% over the past five years. Since we expect much of that growth to continue, this article is not about how we think the market is overly excited by future growth opportunities. Instead our piece is about how a company that has proven itself capable of driving fantastic revenue growth has an intrinsic value considerably below the current market price and therefore becomes today's shorting opportunity.Salesforce.com began in 1999 by providing Customer Relationship Management software over the web. Its core business of CRM has grown substantially from humble beginnings while related areas such as technology for service management, social computing, and marketing oversight have been acquired. These four business areas are lumped together as ""Subscription and Support"" in the company's filings. They make up 94% of CRM's revenues with the balance coming under the professional services segment.Our first stop in any analysis of a company is the balance sheet. Nothing here sends us running for the exits. Debt is very low in the form of convertible senior notes which now price more like a stock since they are safely above the conversion price. CRM has $1 billion in cash and even if it had to pay off all its debt (unlikely given the convertible nature) it would still have $500 million in cash. Goodwill makes up 44% of the company's book value, which in our conservative minds is a bit high, but not out of the ordinary for a fast-growing, fast-acquiring company in the technology space.Next we swing by the income statement and statement of cash flows for all the fun they bring to the party. Right away we are struck by the wonderful top line growth numbers - truly fantastic. Gross margins are hefty as they've averaged about 80% for several years. Strong gross margins are to be expected from a hosted application provider of any stripe and CRM delivers well in this regard.If only we could then make the tell-tale sign of a needle being carelessly torn from a spinning record as can be heard in nearly all terrific comedies when the hero finally realizes something unexpected. CRM has negative operating margins. ""OK though,"" we say at first, ""CRM is in a hyper-growth mode and is spending some extra bucks to build its client base so it may ratchet up margins and profitability in the future."" The best response we can offer to this supposition is a resounding, ""Maybe.""The company has been alive and growing revenue for 13 years. In that time period the single best annual operating margin ever recorded came in the fiscal year ending January 2010. That year the operating margin was an underwhelming 8.8%. To put that into perspective we took a run through some other application-type companies and found operating margins consistently ranging from 15% for Blackbaud (NASDAQ:BLKB) to many in the mid-twenties (Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), SAP (NYSE:SAP), and Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM)).It turns out that CRM spends two-times as much money as a percentage of revenue in marketing its product to new customers compared to peers. Even as the revenues have grown, the money spent on marketing remains remarkably elevated. We offer two possible explanations for this fact, neither of them all that encouraging. Our first stab is that perhaps cloud computing in general, while wildly profitable from a gross margin standpoint, will prove to be less compelling from an operating standpoint as customers do not have the intense sunk cost in infrastructure to utilize a vendor's cloud offering. Therefore, the switching costs between competitors will prove to be low and so to keep customers, hosted application providers will have to spend oodles of money on marketing and service. A second less glamorous possibility is that CRM is just a bad operator.To see if all this talk is worth any value at all, we ran some projections (see the table and assumptions).Please note that our share count starts at 146 million outstanding, which assumes that every convertible note actually converts, which is entirely rational given the current price of the stock. We further assumed that the share count grows every year by two percent, which is in the historic range due to incentive plans and the like.The resulting fair value of $110 per share of CRM would indicate that the company is 45% overvalued at a recent price of $160 per share. Some bulls may take umbrage with our assumptions, but we believe that assuming a growth rate of 10% into eternity is quite generous. The rest of the assumptions are easily defended based upon this company's and similar fast-growing companies' results. We encourage our readers to build a similar simple spreadsheet and change the assumptions as you wish. We believe you will find that your inputs need to be exceptionally optimistic to come close to justifying the current price. One eternal truth in investing is that the price an investor pays, determines much of his return. We've found that CRM is priced too high. Avoid the long of CRM and stick with the short.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

849131,24888,2012-09-06T03:36:48-04:00,,"As an investor from The Netherlands, I remain amazed about the huge wild swings, up or down, that stocks can make on Wall Street. They are truly much bigger than in Europe. It is obvious to me that American investors are much more driven by sentiment and emotions, rather than valuations. They also appear to be more driven by the opinions of analysts.That is a quite peculiar phenomenon because the majority of analysts are generally more wrong than right. Many studies have been published on this, including ones that showed a chimpanzee throwing darts at stocks had better results than the average analyst. In general it is my opinion that the average investor may find better information for rational investment decisions, short or long, on a website like Seeking Alpha.The hypes of today are cloud computing and big data, which is becoming a crowded field with recent and upcoming IPOs like Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Service Now (NYSE:NOW) Cloudera and Workday at valuations that boggle the mind.More established companies in the sector are Netsuite (NYSE:N), SAP, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM and Salesforce.com. This last company is generally marveled at by analysts as the undisputed leader and fastest growing star in the field, deserving a 25% higher valuation in 12 months, representing an additional 7 billion to the current marketcap of 20 billion.To illustrate what I mean by huge wild swings, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has fluctuated its market cap over the last year back and forth between $11 and $22 billion, while the company's revenues grew roughly $1 billion at increasing net losses.Much has been written on Seeking Alpha about Salesforce.com, mostly by fact crunching authors not subscribing to the bull case and arriving at different conclusions than these analysts. These authors include myself as can be witnessed here and here. I agree fully with those authors ringing alarm bells despite still growing revenues of Salesforce.com. Simply because these revenues are achieved at a growing, but understated expense of the shareholder.These expenses represent the following issues:- Accelerating negative EPS/GAAP net losses.- Accelerating stock based compensations for employees, increasing the share count, diluting the shareholder.- Accelerating decline of cash flow.To the prudent investor these issues should be cause for grave concerns. Fuel is added to those concerns for the following reasons:- No clarity from management as to when these trends will stop or turn around.- Continued focus on Non GAAP earnings, that even management had to revise downwardly in the latest earnings report.- Less than truthful statements that cash flow is rising.Hence, where management and analysts are cheering the rise of cash flow, there is in fact an opposite development going on.The crux of these problems are accurately described in this Motley Fool article by Keki Fetakia: Should you buy into CRM's growth story?As well as in these articles by Todd Sullivan:I would like to add the following comments: ""An Overvalued Company is Not a Fraud."" - Very true, but that is not the point.The point is that a company who focuses on NON GAAP earnings, at the same time suggesting that real earnings (which are accelerating losses) do not matter, is less than open and honest to its investor community. The same point is true for a company that adds stock based compensations to its cash flow. You could argue that a company is entitled to present its results as positive as possible without breaking the law. Salesforce.com may still fit within that margin, but ""fair play"" is an entirely different animal.So the real issue I have, as excellently described by Seeking Alpha author Mark Cabaniss, is with the analysts assisting in this scheme, instead of pointing the finger to the worrisome developments and questionable accounting.Just another little detail on the marriage of Salesforce.com with the analyst community: Piper Jaffray brought the news that Salesforce.com had scored its biggest deal in history. I have not seen clarity on that alleged deal in the earnings conference call.But that is a side matter. My point is: The company itself declined to answer on the rumor, citing its ""quiet period"" before earnings. So if Salesforce was not entitled to leak such information, how come Piper Jaffray knew about it? They added that the deal was ""unexpected"", indicating management as the source. The evidence suggests a deliberate leak to prop up the stock price. I question the coincidence that the news was met by huge insider sales, the largest over the past year.As Todd Sullivan (yes, him again) points out, it was also met with a filing to sell all of the 184 million worth of shares, issued to the owners of recently acquired Buddy Media: Even Buddy Media Folks Don't Want CRM Stock.Institutional support is fine, but misrepresenting company results is another matter. Remember Enron? The thesis that Lee Harvey Oswald killed JFK has a lot of institutional support too, but that doesn't mean it is true.Stock based compensation expenses are climbing from $84 to $99 million next quarter and to $382 for the year. When will investors grasp this is diluting them massively and hacking equally into real cash flow and profits? ""GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in the range of ($0.75) to ($0.72)"". With 140 million shares outstanding (and growing) that is about a 100 million net loss.$382 million stock based compensation is about 20% of total cost of revenue. It should give thinking investors chills on their backs.From the conference call:To add a final point, consider this: Many of those analysts, some of whom have a direct or indirect vested interest in the company, give this stock a 12 month target price of $200.If a stock price of $150 is a market cap of $20.5 billion, a stock price of $200 is a market cap of roughly $27 billion. So what they are in fact saying is that the stock should be worth $7 billion more in 12 months. The truth is that $7 billion alone would already be a rich valuation for the company as a whole as 2.5 times the revenues is actually quite lofty for a stock that gives its shareholders ongoing dilution and increasing net losses.Disclosure: I am short CRM, SPLK.

829641,34571,2012-08-27T07:38:44-04:00,,"How do investors know which stocks to buy and sell? Well, they get advice, they think, and they read. They read stuff (a euphemism) in the mainstream business press about different companies, and how they are doing, or not doing. Sometimes this ""stuff"" is informative. And sometimes it is not.Case in point: consider some of last week's coverage of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Salesforce released quarterly earnings last Thursday after the bell. The company reported actual, GAAP ""earnings"" of negative $.07 per share, and imaginary, non-GAAP ""earnings"" of $.42 per share. (Note to younger readers: ""negative earnings"" used to be known as ""losses."") Non-GAAP ""earnings,"" are numbers contrived by taking out whatever you want to take out of the real earnings, to arrive at the new, better-looking non-GAAP ""earnings."" In the case of Salesforce, the number they like to take out is their large option expense. Various articles, including my own, have questioned Salesforce's earnings, specifically the company's habitual practice of emphasizing non-GAAP earnings over GAAP earnings.While it is understandable that a company like Salesforce, without earnings, or with negative ""earnings,"" would choose to accentuate the positive, what is more difficult to understand is why anyone in the business press would choose to go along with this game, of even reporting the company's self-serving non-GAAP ""earnings."" It is even less understandable why a mainstream business press story would omit the company's real, GAAP earnings. It is even less understandable why a mainstream business press outlet would misidentify the company's imaginary, non-GAAP earnings as real earnings, as simply ""earnings."" And yet, at least two such stories appeared in the business press last Thursday, just prior to and after Salesforce's earnings release. The first was an article in TheStreet, which contained the following sentence:The second story appeared in Forbes, and contained the following sentence:Both of these stories were referring to imaginary, non-GAAP ""earnings.""Others can troll through the media dreck surrounding the Salesforce earnings release and come up with more examples of mainstream business press stories (that term is chosen intentionally) using the term ""earnings"" in reference to imaginary, non-GAAP numbers; I haven't the stomach. But a question remains: why would business reporters report non-GAAP numbers as though they were GAAP numbers?One explanation is laziness: The reporters simply regurgitate whatever mush the analysts spoon-feed them. Another possible explanation is ignorance -- the reporters, despite being employed as business reporters, don't know the difference between GAAP earnings and non-GAAP earnings, or that there is a difference. They may have been absent that day or week or year in business school when the professor covered the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings.I posit a possible third reason -- the reporters do know that there is a difference between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers, but they do not think it makes a difference to investors. But the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers is important to investors. To explain why the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is important to investors, allow me to submit the following analogy:Suppose that your spouse is a traveling salesman, or saleswoman, and you are the stay-at-home parent, raising the children. Your spouse gets an expense account, out of which they pay all their needs, food, shelter, cell phone, etc., lavishly. Their expense account comes off the top. It is a component of gross sales, essentially everything that remains after other expenses. Your husband or wife's expense account spending is not closely scrutinized as long as sales are going up. You, on the other hand, have to rely on net income.So, when your husband or wife comes home from a road trip you say ""Where is the paycheck? How much is it? We're broke!"" Your spouse answers, ""Don't worry! I had an AWESOME, BLOWOUT quarter with a huge REVENUE RUN RATE! I've been eating like a king for the past three weeks in the most expensive restaurants in this quadrant of the universe, and I took a Hummer limo from the airport home! We're doing great!"" ""We are?"" you say, ""The kids are hungry! We're behind on our rent!""This encapsulates the difference between the interests of management and the interests of shareholders in a profitless company like Salesforce. Management is doing great. Management at Salesforce is being compensated handsomely. In fact, their stock-option compensation is arguably the main reason the company is profitless, as illustrated in my linked article.To management, all is well. Just look at that revenue run rate! (Also known as ""gross income."") If it hadn't been for all those headwinds (formerly known as ""expenses,"") why, the quarter would have been even more successful! But the stock of a company without earnings is bound to fall, eventually, as it is simply a hot potato for mo-mo investors, also known as speculators, operating on the greater-fool theory.I hope that this analogy is simple enough for all to understand. A company that keeps some of its gross income as profit is a company that is being run for the benefit of shareholders. A company that spends so much of its income on compensation for management that it doesn't even make a profit is a company that is being run for the benefit of management, not shareholders.End note: I tried to be fair and balanced when writing this, and consider the other side of the argument, and present it to readers, so that they could make up their own minds. Only there isn't another side. There is no excuse for business reporters to omit information as fundamental and momentous as the wildly-divergent GAAP and non-GAAP numbers of Salesforce when said reporters write stories about Salesforce's ""earnings.""Disclosure: I am short CRM via long-dated puts.

834311,33031,2012-08-29T01:15:13-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has been a company that has continually increased its investment in the cloud computing space to increase its revenue and its operating cash flow. In this article, I will show that the marginal efficiency of those investments have been decreasing and that the metrics of revenue and operating cash flow have masked a business model that is increasingly becoming broken.What Salesforce Wants You to KnowSalesforce.com wants you to focus on two things: revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings measures. Salesforce.com is showing growth in both of these measures and they want you to think that because of this, they are doing a good job with their shareholders investment.(Source: All figures in this article sourced from Salesforce.com)In the most recent quarterly conference call, these were the two metrics that flamboyant CEO Marc Benioff talked about. GAAP earnings were not discussed.What You Really Need to KnowWhat you really need to know falls in two categories: how Salesforce.com is performing on other metrics and how their investments in their business are starting to show diminishing marginal returns.What are those other metrics to look at, and how have they performed?First, GAAP earnings must be looked at. Say what you want about how other metrics provide information about the business (and I think they do), but you simply cannot overlook the most important of them all: GAAP earnings.This obviously tells a much different story. Why is that? First, Salesforce.com's use of the Operating Cash Flow metric is not uncommon and while not ""according to GAAP,"" it is not a bogus metric either. It is basically GAAP earnings that have been adjusted for non-cash items. This is done to demonstrate the cash-generating power of the company. Fair enough, cash generation is certainly important. But what Salesforce.com is not telling you by reporting Operating Cash Flow as they do is that two items contribute to that number that are not directly to do with how well their core operations are doing. Those two items are changes in working capital and stock-based compensation expense.Cash generated from working capital is simply the net change in current assets and current liabilities. These changes can generate cash by collecting receivables and by dragging payables. They are not strict functions of profitability. Those changes are included in Salesforce.com's Operating Cash Flow numbers and should be backed out in order to get a truer picture as to cash generated by operating their core business. Further, Salesforce.com uses issuance of its shares to employees as a part of their compensation. Since the issuance of those shares does not consume cash (a share certificate is issued as opposed to a company check), that expense is backed out when Salesforce.com computes Operating Cash Flow. Again this distorts the true picture on the profitability of operations. Sunil Shah covered this point in his SA article and quoted legendary investor Warren Buffet who is absolutely on point: ""If stock options aren't a form of compensation, what are they? If compensation isn't an expense, what is it? And, if expenses shouldn't go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they go?"" When one adjusts for these two items in Operating Cash Flow, a much less rosy picture emerges.This startling figure shows that real operating cash flow (as adjusted above) has in fact declined in 2012.But what I find even more of a concern is a look at some of the return metrics at Salesforce.com. They reveal a trend toward a broken business model.The Salesforce.com business model is to invest in its core business of offering a suite of cloud computing services to its worldwide base of customers. They do that through investing in their own research and development, through investing in an ever-expanding group of employees and through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Those investments used to pay off handsomely and allowed Salesforce.com to grow and become profitable. But those investments in R&D, headcount and acquisitions are not paying off today as they once did. Investments in their business are now generating diminishing marginal returns as shown by a look at the following return metrics. Despite management crowing about incredible returns and delivering awesome results, a sober look at the numbers reveals that these investments in their business are delivering less return.In the table below, I look at Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) in two different ways, the GAAP return and the Adjusted Operating Cash Flow return. Both metrics show that capital employed in the business is now showing declining returns. Their absolute level is nothing to brag about, and certainly not the stuff to create a lofty valuation.Investing in more employees is increasing revenues and increasing adjusted operating cash flow at a diminishing rate. Increasing spending on operations is also demonstrating diminishing marginal returns as that ratio has been rising.Salesforce.com's business model appears to be breaking down. Investments in their people, in their operations and in newly acquired assets are generating less return than they used to. The growth machine is consuming more resources to grow at the same rate, and increasing investment in the core business is therefore showing diminishing marginal returns. If Salesforce.com's investments in its own business are showing declining returns, what is an investment in their stock likely to show? Salesforce.com's lofty valuation of 7.86 times sales, 10.98 times book value, 170.25 times EBITDA and PEG of 3.61 (source: Yahoo Finance) are not justified by these diminishing returns.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours.

829321,30811,2012-08-27T04:55:53-04:00,,"Shares of salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) have posted a strong YTD return of 46.40%. Disappointing financial forecasts in the last week appear to have had almost no impact on the stock. After dropping 5% after-market on Thursday, the stock recouped all the losses on the following day. However, I believe the forecast miss may likely be another indication that CRM's valuations are becoming increasingly risky.In this article, I will illustrate the thoughts that helped formulate my investment decision. My comparable analysis primarily includes a set of CRM's comparable peers such as Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), and NetSuite Inc. (NYSE:N) etc., and the vale analysis is based on five peer-average trading multiples - EV/Sales, EV/EBITDA, EV/FCF, P/E, and P/S.Click to enlargeIn terms of growth potential, CRM outperforms almost all of the peers. Analysts on average predict CRM's revenue, EBITDA, and EPS to rise by 2-year CAGRs of 29.9%, 169.4%, and 109.8% over the current and next fiscal years, substantially faster than the peer averages of 19.7%, 55.6%, and 20.3% (see table above). The fast growth, along with CRM's leading market position, are the primary valuation drivers at present.On the profitability side, CRM has an excellent LTM gross margin at 78.1% compared to the peer average of 66.5%. However, as the company spends (i.e. acquisitions, marketing and attractive pricing) significantly in driving the exceptional revenue growth, other profitability measures suffer. Its LTM EBITDA margin is only 4.5% compared to the peer average of 17.5%. The firm is not even breaking even at the EBIT level. Net profit margin is also negative as well. As such the company did not generate a positive return on the invested equity and total capital measured by LTM ROE and ROIC (see table above).Despite weak profitability, CRM's free cash flow generating capability remains robust. Its LTM FCF margin of 24.0% is above the peer average of 19.7%. But it assumes an above-average leverage, and both the current and quick ratios are below the peer averages, suggesting a relatively weak corporate balance (see table above).Overall on the growth and financial fundamentals, CRM's only bright spot is on the fast growth, which is achieved by sacrificing profitability. However, as a company grows and becomes more matured, enhanced competitions in the industry will eventually weigh on the top line growth. The market will then increasingly focus on the company's profitability in valuing the stock. The same case would likely happen to CRM. Big competitors like SAP and ORCL are heating up the competition in the SaaS industry, and CRM will suffer in a way or the other.The current situation is somewhat reflected in CRM's financial estimates. Revenues estimated have multiple upward revisions over the past 12 months, suggesting growth may continue. But the EPS estimates have been slashed significantly over the same period, implying an increased competition is likely going to undercut margins (see tables below).CRM's current price of $148.54 implies a valuation premium of 35% over the five peer-average trading multiples (assuming each multiple is equally weighted in determining the stock value) (see below). The large valuation gap is tough to be justified by CRM's weak profitability and the current industry headwind.Moreover, the CRM's P/S multiple remains at the same level as where it was in five years ago (see below). But the revenue growth around five years ago was much higher at 75.7%, 60.4%, and 50.6% in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. There was also less participants and thus competition in the industry five years ago. As such, the P/S multiple today should have been discounted to factor in the slower growth and the less attractive industry environment.Accounting for the estimated earnings growth, CRM trades at a whopping 3.4x PEG, a much higher level than the peer average of 2.2x, indicating a possible overvaluation relative to the firm's growth potential.Bottom line, as CRM is facing increased competitions, growth will continue to slow down and profitability will be of critical importance. Nonetheless, the current stock valuations are not reflecting that situation and still have plenty of optimistic expectations factored in. I am of the view that at $148.54 per share, the investment in CRM would offer almost no margin of safety, and thus investors should avoid this stock with a lot of speculative substance.Comparable analysis table and relative valuation tables are created by author, other charts are sourced from Capital IQ, and all financial data is sourced from Morningstar and Capital IQ.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Why did the stock price of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) go down by over 7% in the last quarter when it already surged by 11.38%, against the S&P500 average of 2.38%, in the last six months to date? What's wrong here?Is the dwindling operating income margin negatively affecting the confidence and loyalty of the investors? It might, very well, be the reason. If you look at the enterprise multiple (EM), which is a better modified version of the P/E ratio, Salesforce.com's EM stands at 192.15x compared to 8.76x of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and 11.41x of SAP AG (NYSE:SAP). As my Alpha colleague, Kevin Quon, eloquently wrote:Even when the year-over-year sales revenue seems to be ratcheting up, why do you think the operating margin is tanking down over time?It's because of the rising costs of production and operational expenses nonetheless. If I remember what I studied in my Economics class, scale does matter a lot when it comes to production costs and operational expenditure. When you are competing with big giants, the likes of SAP AG and Oracle, it sure takes a lot of guts and money to snag that piece of market share away. That certainly shows in the income statement of Salesforce.com.The big doubt is how long the company will be able to sustain if it keeps on incurring losses in operating income quarter after quarter. If this goes on, this will seriously affect the market viability of the company, and it just might end up in another acquisition. Maybe that's the reason why analysts estimate Salesforce.com's PEG ratio at 3.64, much higher than industry average of 1.29 and sector average of 1.01.But numbers doesn't tell the whole story, do they? What is Marc Benioff (CEO, chairman and co-founder of Salesforce.com) going to do about all this? You can't just write off the wisdom and knowledge of a man who has been in the industry for almost three decades now and has already served one of his biggest competitors, Oracle Corp. What does he say about the second quarter of FY2013?One thing that strikes me is the number of acquisitions completed since last year.So you mean to say that all these acquisitions are going to waste and you should sell your Salesforce.com stocks as soon as you can? It beats my common sense. Even Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) acquired Demandforce for $423.5mn with a view to expanding into high-value software-as-a-service products for small and medium-sized businesses. In addition to the above acquisitions, Salesforce.com has already entered into global strategic alliance with Twitter and has also displayed eagerness to enter into the public sector with its new government cloud. Two-thirds of U.S. federal Cabinet-level agencies and governments in more than 80 percent of U.S. states trust Salesforce.com to power their social enterprises.Online marketing is all about market presence, and with the line-up of acquisitions and alliances coming every other day, Salesforce.com just increases its so-needed presence in the online world. With proper monetization methods, nothing can stop it from making money.Having said that, I agree with Kim that investors ought to be cautious about every move made by Salesforce.com, but as it goes, HOLD at the moment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The fast growing cloud computing and social enterprise company reported its second quarter results.Second Quarter ResultsSalesforce.com reported second quarter revenues of its fiscal year of 2013 of $732 million, up 34% on the year. Subscription and support revenues rose 35% to $687 million, while professional service revenues advanced 20% to $44 million. On average, analysts expected the company to report revenues of $728.2 million.The company reported a GAAP net loss of $9.8 million, or $0.07 per share. Last year, the company lost $4.3 million, or $0.03 per share. Non-GAAP earnings, which exclude among others, stock based compensation and amortization of intangibles, came in at $0.42 per share. Non-GAAP earnings came in ahead of analysts consensus of $0.39 per share.The company reported a 43% increase in ""deferred"" revenue to $1.34 billion. Unbilled deferred revenues only rose by a mere $100 million to $2.8 billion.CEO and Chairman Marc Benioff commented on the results:Segmental InformationThe Americas remain the most important geographic area for the company. Revenues rose 38% on the year to $508.0 million. Noticeable was the strong revenue growth in Europe. Revenues grew 40% on the year to $124.6 million. In comparison, year-on-year growth in the first quarter came in at 33% for the continent. Asia-Pacific revenues were up 28% to $99.1 million.OutlookFor the third quarter of its fiscal 2013, Salesforce.com anticipates revenues of $773-$777 million, up 32-33% on the year. On a GAAP basis, it expects to lose between $0.26-$0.27 per share, while non-GAAP earnings are expected to come in between $0.31-$0.32.The non-GAAP earnings outlook fell short of analysts expectations of $0.34 per share, while revenues came in slightly ahead of the $772 million consensus.For the full year of its fiscal 2013, the company anticipates revenues of $3.025-$3.035 billion, up 33-34% on the year. GAAP net losses are expected to come in between $0.72 and $0.75 per share. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated at $1.48-$1.51 per share. For the full year, Salesforce.com expects to spend $382 million in stock-based compensation. Furthermore, amortization expenses of intangibles related to past acquisitions are expected to come in at $95 million.ValuationSalesforce.com ended its second quarter with $1.8 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company operates without any meaningful debt. It does however have roughly $0.5 billion in convertible notes outstanding. For the first six months of 2012, Salesforce.com generated revenues of $1.34 billion. It net lost $29 million, or $0.21 per share.Factoring in a 6% decline in after hours trading, the market values the firm at $19 billion. Excluding the net cash position of $1.8 billion, this values the operating assets at roughly $17 billion. Based on the company's full year outlook, Salesforce.com is valued at 5.6 times annual revenues, and almost 100 times non-GAAP earnings. On a GAAP basis, the company is expected to lose a lot of money.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of Salesforce.com trade with gains of almost 40%. Shares drifted from $100 at the start of the year to peak at $160 during spring. Shares hit a low of $120 during the summer months, but recovered, now trading around the $140 mark.Over the past five years, shares have risen over 250%. The company aggressively grew its revenues from $1.1 billion for 2008 to an expected $3.0 billion in 2012. At the same time, profitability remained under pressure. Salesforce.com earned $43 million in 2008, or $0.35 per share. For 2012, it is expected to lose roughly $100 million or $0.72-$0.75 per share, on a GAAP basis.While the growth is impressive, it is in large part the result of a string of acquisitions. In 2012 alone, Salesforce.com acquired Stypi, Buddy Media, ChoicePass, Thinkfuse and GoInstant. The $689 million acquisition of Buddy Media was the largest in the company's history. Furthermore, valuations of acquisition targets are driven up as financially stronger competitors, Oracle (ORCL) and SAP AG (SAP), have announced their ambitions in the cloud-based industry.In May, I already took a look at the prospects of Salesforce.com. Trading around the $133 level at the time, I concluded that I saw more room towards the downside than the upside. I remain skeptical of the valuation despite the impressive revenue growth figures. A premium revenue multiple and lack of operating profits, make me wary.Today, I reiterate my stance seeing room for a correction towards $100 per share. The weak guidance and lack of GAAP earnings improvement is worrying.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

826501,22263,2012-08-24T11:06:20-04:00,,"One can only marvel at the flair and flamboyance of Salesforce.com’s (NYSE:CRM) founder and CEO, Marc Benioff as he surfed through the second quarter’s results. I don’t doubt he would have cast even HPQ’s dismal results in a positive light. I did a word count on the words ""best great incredible,"" and they were used no fewer than 21 times in the conference call, including the ""and we've got a great concert that night with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.""Now don’t get me wrong. 32% Revenue growth is ""great."" However there was not one single reference to GAAP earnings in the entire hour. In fact the only mention of it was ""reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for both our reported results and our forward guidance can be found in our earnings press release."" So if you want the real rundown, go dig for our financials.I find this absolutely staggering. What’s more galling is that not one financial analyst quizzed them on the financial metrics. The questions seemed posed to give Marc greater airtime to wax lyric on how great things are. Not one question on GAAP earnings or the decline in sequential cash flow, from so called financial analysts, who are meant to first and foremost analyze the financials. Bizarre.What could the analysts have quizzed the company about? Believe me, there are numerous red flags. I list the main ones:The subject I take most issue with is the version of operating cash flow (up 64% on a YOY basis). This company measures ""operating cash flow"" after the inclusion of options exercised by staff. In other words, the more wages they pay their staff, the higher their cash flow. Now I know this is a company in the cloud, but how on earth do they think they can misguide investors so blatantly? As I wrote after their last earnings call (here), real cash flow never lies. Well hardly ever. Look at the table below, which highlights the crux of the problem.Click to enlargeSo they claim operating cash flow grew by 64% YOY. But of $136m, the majority was derived from cash received from staff as they exercised the options. A whole $70.7m came from wages. Being rather Buffettian in this regard (his great quote on the subject: “If stock options aren’t a form of compensation, what are they? If compensation isn’t an expense, what is it? And, if expenses shouldn’t go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world do they go?” Note: for CRM’s witch doctor spin on cash flow these wages actually boost the numbers) I exclude it.As per the table above, the real operating cash flow for the quarter was $65.4m, down sequentially from $215m or by 69%. Yes it was up on a YOY basis (July 2011 not shown above), but this is a significant sleight of hand to flatter the results.Another problem I have is them trumpeting their ""raise in guidance."" For Fiscal 2013, they raised their revenue forecast from $3.02bn to $3.03bn. Big hairy deal. 10 million dollars. What they don’t mention is that they just acquired Buddy Media for a whopping $300m and this probably accounts for the entire raise.So how much is CRM worth? Let’s say they can continue to grow revenue by 30% per year. (It’s unlikely as the revenue run-rate is now $3bn a year and the competition is clearly intensifying.) This won’t translate into a 30% growth in earnings or cash per share as they issue shares to staff at a prolific rate of about 3% per annum. Hence this would translate into cash growth per share of 26% per year.How much would I pay for a company growing at 26% per year? I would pay a maximum of 30X. Note that there are numerous shares on a PE of 10 growing eps at nominal GDP growth of 5%, even in these distressed times.I estimate a clean operating cash flow of $400m per year. Less capex of 150m per year, (and this excludes acquisitions) giving a clean net operating cash flow of $250m per year. Let’s grow this at 30% to give you $325m for the next 12 months.The table below computes the price derived on a range of cash multiples, and adding back cash on their balance sheet. Even a 50X cash flow multiple delivers a price target of $120, or about 20% below the current valuation.Conclusion: There is no doubt CRM is an impressive company. However it is grossly overvalued. Not even the abundant gusts of hot air from Marc Benioff can defy financial gravity forever.Dislcosure: I am short CRM."
825861,25258,2012-08-24T02:49:58-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is a leading solutions company that provides customer relationship management applications to businesses through a cloud-based operation. The company provides computing solutions to businesses around the world as they look to adjust from the traditional sales model to one adapted for increased interconnectedness. Salesforce.com helps create an infrastructure for businesses in such a way that they are able to operate more efficiently and with greater ease.On Thursday, August 23, Salesforce.com announced its 2Q earnings in which it reported a loss of ($0.07) but gained non-GAAP diluted earnings of $0.42. This topped earnings expectations by $0.03, and was combined with a beat on revenues as well. The company's revenues grew 34% year-over-year to $731.6 million from $546 million, and topped analyst expectations of $728 million. However, in the after-hours session, the market proceeded to punish the company as shares dropped over 6% despite the positive report on earnings and revenue.The downbeat sentiment was largely attributed to the company's guidance for the upcoming period ending in October. Excluding certain items, the company stated that it expected earnings in a range of $0.31 to $0.32, which falls short of the average expectation of $0.34 by analysts. The lowered guidance has largely been attributed to increased competition as companies like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) move more aggressively into this cloud computing model.While seemingly late to the trend, the abundant resources of Oracle and SAP AG suggest that Salesforce.com may find a more difficult environment to operate in as the need to competitively price its services becomes more pressing. In light of its leadership stance in their respective industry, Salesforce.come has been largely priced to reflect this. The company currently trades at a lofty price-to-book ratio of 11.33 and a price-to-sales ratio of 8.35. Taken from the standpoint of its enterprise multiple (EV/EBITDA), Salesforce.com's current price reflects a lucrative 192.15.Accounting for these commonly accepted metrics, it is clear that the market has placed the company on a pedestal of its own. Salesforce.com has largely been measured by the market on the basis of unhindered growth progress. For cautious investors, the recent share price collapses of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) show the repercussions of growth investments that fall out of favor with the optimism that once surrounded them. As it stands now, Salesforce.com currently supports a PEG ratio of 3.64, a rather high value considering the rapid growth already underway. It remains clear that the market must remain convinced that the company will be able to convert its largely growing revenue stream into very rapidly growing earnings.Yet this latest shock to the stock price remains a potential indicator that such uncertainties have not yet been placed to rest. The inability for the company to yield more meaningful earnings to date, the arrival of well-founded competition into a market space with limited barriers to entry, and the increasing need to spend more on acquisitions to remain competitive all stand as reasons investors should remain cautious on this seemingly well played-out growth story.While the company is likely to continue outperform on the revenue front, the promises of future earnings potential may begin to hold less weight in the shorter time frame. It remains uncertain whether the focus by investors and analysts will patiently continue to center around Salesforce.com's promising capabilities. Undoubtedly, the underperformance of the recent guidance does little to keep the heads of investors in the clouds above.Disclaimer: Please refer to my standard disclaimer found here.Disclosure: I am short CRM.

826301,21305,2012-08-24T09:18:50-04:00,,"Each quarter Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) CEO Marc Benioff's boasts seem to get bigger. Yet each quarter Salesforce.com's (CRM) GAAP earnings seem to get worse. This quarter he boasted that CRM recently bought two #1 social media marketing companies, Buddy Media and Radian6. He said CRM left all the cannon fodder out there for others. He then went on to expound that CRM would have the seers of these companies (Michael Lazerow and Marcel Lebrun) working on CRM's new view of the sales and marketing platform to be presented at Dreamforce 2012 -- the Salesforce Touch platform. This was no doubt a deliberate allusion to the magic of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Benioff expounded that the Salesforce Touch platform will be largely based on HTML5. This will make it available to all computers with network access. Benioff went on to mention the many other ways Salesforce.com was #1. I admit I was a bit swept up in the rhetorical magic of this great salesman's words. Then I did what any analyst should; I took a hard look at CRM.First CRM has gone from a high multiple growth company to a higher multiple growth company to a no multiple growth company. In other words it lost money in FY2012 on a GAAP basis. It has loss money in the first two quarters of FY2013 on a GAAP basis. CRM hides salary expense with stock/options gifts to employees. It hides hiring and R & D expenses by buying other companies. In other words it ""adjusts"" combination expenses as one time items. The list of ""adjustments"" is long. This is not the mark of a financially strong company with $3B in sales. When you get to be a $3B business, you are expected to make money on any basis, especially a GAAP basis. CRM is not; and it has not been for some time. It posted a GAAP net loss of $9.8 million for Q2 2013. The act of continually buying companies partly so your adjusted earnings look better is a technique Mark Hurd used to perfection at Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ). Look at what has happened to Hewlett-Packard recently. The same thing will soon happen to CRM.I admit I was tempted to get swept up in Benioff's almost magical words but I stopped believing in fairy tales when I was a child. CRM is growing its revenues but it is spending ever larger amounts of money to do so. Billings grew 30% to $734.1 million in Q2 2013. Sales grew 34% to $731.6 million. However, sales and marketing expenses alone rose 34% to $380.2 million. This is nearly 52% of total revenues all by itself. What about all of the other expenses the company has such as accounting and administration, R & D, etc.? the 52% figure seems very high. After a quick check I discovered that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a competitor in the customer relationship management cloud space, spends 18%-19% of its revenues on sales and marketing. One authority quoted the average as 20.7% for technology companies. This means CRM's products are not so good that they are selling themselves. Rather, Benioff has put on a big push to gather as big a legacy business as he can before CRM's many competitors become more formidable. With the cloud customer relationship management business expanding at a good pace, virtually all of the big database companies are fast tracking new CRM products. These include: Microsoft , International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), etc. In fact Oracle and SAP are selling sales and human resources software over the web in emulation of CRM's business model. Is nothing sacred? Oracle says it has already booked $1B from its cloud computing offerings (and the associated companies it has acquired in the last year). This sounds like competition. The year is only half over and Oracle is by far the bigger, more established, enterprise company. This has prompted even cloud space followers such as Sanford C. Bernstein & Co, to put an underperform rating on CRM.On top of all this you hear stories. CRM has such high sales personnel turnover that it offers $10,000 to employees referring an account executive who gets hired. It offers the account executives base salaries of $250,000+ with the possibility of $1+ million in actual earnings. The problem is that many feel slighted by being given relatively poor territories to work. Many burn out. Apparently ethics in hiring are questionable too. The following is a quote from a former account executive, ""If you are crazy enough to take a job here, be sure you get the exact territory you will be covering written down as part of accepting the job offer -- the bait and switch to lure people in here is well known. You will be promised Chicago and leave your current job, get in the door, take your seat, and be given Louisiana."" Some former employees complain of PTSD, after they were pushed hard to make lower performing areas perform well. This kind of employee treatment will eventually catch up with a company.From an engineering standpoint CRM is in trouble too. Its products are a largely collage of products of purchased smaller companies. The products are kludged together into CRM's enterprise relationship management product suite. From the users I have talked to, they are increasingly less satisfied with CRM's products. They find them cumbersome, complex and increasingly harder to use.There are many technical problems with CRM's approach (see the list below).CRM has one other big problem. It has hired a lot of new salespeople recently. Unfortunately for CRM, the EU crisis is pushing the world economy into a slowdown or a recession. This will likely prove to be a good year for cutbacks instead of huge new labor forces. Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) already announced layoffs of 27,000 employees. Others have been following since then; and more are sure to join the parade, especially if the fiscal cliff and tax-maggedon are reached. In CRM's case this will likely be the year propagandized huge growth turns into huge ""real"" losses. Someone has to pay all CRM's sales people. The world market does not seem to want to do it this year. The world market likely will not want to do it next year. Will CRM fire a lot of the salespeople? If so, will it then have to pay to train new ones in two years time? CRM is caught between a rock and a hard place. It will be fighting this quandary as it loses money. It may lose even more money as a consequence.Other bigger companies will have long term money to pursue long term strategies. IBM, ORCL, MSFT, SAP, etc. will spend these next tough two years catching up technologically. Then they will be ready to take CRM's business away when the world starts buying strongly again. They are already making headway. Even the most bullish analysts on Wall Street will soon be forced to see this. Events may be conspiring against CRM's stated strategy; but the events are ""reality."" Ultimately companies have to live with their realities, no matter how unfair or unpleasant. CRM would have encountered these same realities in time. The EU crisis has just moved up the date.The five year chart of CRM provides some technical direction for this trade.(Click to enlarge)The slow stochastic sub chart shows that CRM is overbought. Of course this was before the fall after the earnings announcement after hours on August 23, 2012. The main chart shows that CRM has been in a long consolidating pattern. This has produced three main tops. A triple top formation is usually thought to be extremely bearish for a stock. It is a sell signal.Given the current situation in Europe, the weakening economic indicators in the U.S., Brazil, India and China, etc., CRM seems almost sure to head downward, barring huge infusions of stimulus from the Fed or from Congress over the very near term. If you own it, it would seem wise to sell it. If you are an aggressive trader, it is likely a good time to short it. It has some support at $120, some at $110, and some at $100. The strongest support of the three is at $100. This is by no means the limit of a down move. This stock could easily trade at $10 given its current fiscal fundamentals. When this hot air balloon pops, the air may go out of it very quickly.Note: Some of the fundamental fiscal data is from Yahoo Finance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours.

The enthusiasm for this company probably derives from its role as an industry leader and from how Salesforce.com is a movement unto itself. The company introduced the cloud computing concept to the information technology market before the term ""cloud computing"" existed. It pioneered the SaaS (software as a service) business model when most people only considered traditional purchase for their software needs. Salesforce.com was the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) of the business-to-business world years before Netflix became popular.Unfortunately, Salesforce.com is priced much higher than other application software providers. The high price multiples of CRM stock should dissuade investors from buying until its valuations descend closer to those of its competitors.Computing Future Valuations from Growth ProjectionsInvestors should buy stocks trading at prices which make them good deals. A poor company trading at a dismal price may be an excellent trade. CRM shares are trading at the other extreme: Salseforce.com is a company trading at incredibly enthusiastic valuations which should be avoided. Its metrics are provided with other software companies:*Since the trailing CRM earnings were negative the forward p/e was used for all stocksSalesforce.com posted a net loss for the trailing twelve months, so the firm's projected forward price-to-earnings ratio was used.Do the higher growth estimates of CRM justify its higher valuation multiples? Future valuation multiples of CRM and its peer stocks were modeled by combining expected growth and trailing valuation multiples. Graphs of future price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios based on analyst earnings growth estimates and historical sales growth follows:These projections illustrate the absurdity of current valuations for Salesforce.com. Analyst estimates for faster-than-economic growth are not predictive after three years or so, yet somehow investors are paying prices for CRM shares which imply they can see earnings at least eight years ahead.Estimated convergence years were calculated below for CRM and its competitors:The projected crossover dates span well into the distant future for the price-to-earnings multiple, demonstrating how CRM shares are overpriced. Investors should avoid Salesforce.com at current prices. Instead, they should consider other companies on this list as more reasonable alternatives which can be justified without extending forecasts beyond a 3-year horizon. In particular, CA Technologies is trading at better valuations which are attractive when contrasted with Salesforce.com. CA Technologies starts at much lower price multiples and its growth trajectory maintains its dominance over Salesforce.com for a decade based on forward earnings and three years based on sales projections.Please read the article disclaimer.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The company, busted in 2001, fit much of the aforementioned criteria. For its trading operations, the firm used the merchant revenue recognition model, as opposed to the agent model that was used by most trading companies. The merchant model was known to be far more aggressive in how it recognized revenues.Outstanding revenue growth in the order of almost 70% characterized the company's ""success,"" while the energy sector grew at single-digit rate.Here's an excerpt from Enron's 2000 Annual Report. I had to chuckle a little bit while reading it:The buzz-words are the key giveaway. The terms ""growth,"" and ""potential"" are constantly referenced all throughout the report. Furthermore, saying that ""at minimum,"" you see your potential tripling over the next five years is incredibly unprofessional.The focus on EPS is a red-flag as well; I'd prefer the management of companies are focused on quality, ""owner"" free cash flow.Lastly, I still don't understand how Enron made its money. I've Googled, I've read the report, I just don't get it. The company didn't care to explain much in its SEC filings either.Potential Fraud: Salesforce (NYSE:CRM): Throwing around the ""f"" word is dangerous, and oftentimes kills the credibility of those who accuse it. So rather than calling Salesforce.com a fraud, I can honestly say that company is simply very questionable.The constant pumping of Salesforce on the behalf of Marc Benioff (the CEO) reeks of textbook salesmanship and is quite unprofessional.From its 2012 Annual Report:Incredible. Amazing. Fast. Awesome. Everything about Salesforce's growth is out of the ordinary - ""unbelievable"" as Benioff has said on Cramer's Mad Money time and time again.Since Benioff has been able to convince Wall Street that GAAP accounting principles aren't relevant for his company, let's take at the in-depth accounting and share issuance to see just how much shareholder value CRM has created.In 2003, there were 26 million fully diluted shares outstanding for CRM. By 2007, that figure had grown 361% to over 120 million. Today, 138 million shares are outstanding.As for CRM's cash flow, the overwhelming source of the ""growth"" has been from the exercise of employee, dilutive stock options.For example: For the three months ending April 30th, 2011, FCF was $113 million; $47 million of which came from stock-based expenses.For the same period ending in 2012, FCF was $169 million; $81 million coming from stock-based expenses.With only $56 million in growth - $34 million being derived from an increase in stock-based expenses - the growth story begins to look very unattractive.For fiscal 2012, FCF was a stated $440 million ($230 million, or about 50%, coming from SBE). In fiscal 2011, FCF was $369 million ($120 million, 33%, from SBE). Accounting for this gimmick, FCF growth was non-existent. In reality, even without delving into CRM's inflated deferred revenue policies, true free cash flow is about $200 million. This is a huge difference; CRM is really trading at an obscene 100 times FCF, with the growth story actually reliant on continued growth in SBE.Also of note was a stunning $374 million recent write-down of its marketable securities. I'm assuming this came from a realized loss on a large holding of mortgage backed securities.Over the last six months, 370,000 shares ($50 million at current prices) have been dumped by insiders, with no purchases to speak of. No purchases whatsoever? Why should you be buying if they're not?After accounting for warrants, stock awards, and convertible senior notes, another 20 million shares will be added to the float for a grand total of about $160 million shares.ConclusionsFraudulent? I'm not sure. However, the incessant pumping on the part of Mr. Benioff, the focus on non-GAAP earnings, excessive share dilution, massive insider sales, and free cash flow growth that is 50% composed of the exercising of stock options is quite worrisome.All in all, Salesforce is a fantastic example of a questionable company with many red-flags.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
715141,30111,2012-07-11T13:48:26-04:00,,"Trading at 66x 2013 EPS and 8.0x revenue, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is one of the most expensive stocks in the world. Although we think the business model is great and the company is exposed to favorable long-term trends, we are only willing to pay 50x forward earnings. We get to this metric by using a 1.5x PEG ratio (35% EPS growth * 1.5 = 50x P/E). Under this framework, Salesforce.com should trade at $100, implying 23% downside.Below is our summary financial model. It shows that the company needs to sustain massive revenue and earnings growth over the next five years to justify the valuation. If the company can achieve these growth rates, then the stock is valued at 21x 2017 EPS. This is still not cheap as the S&P 500 is normally trading at 15x.Based on our valuation framework, we think there is 23% downside to $100 over the next few quarters. Below our process for getting to our price target:We are comfortable paying 50x for high-growth companies, and own Rackspace (NYSE:RAX) and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) on this premise. But 68x forward P/E is excessive and places the odds of a sharp sell-off too high for out investment style.Another minor concern we have is the highly-acquisitive nature of Salesforce.com lately. Does this suggest the organic growth is slowing more than expected? Recently the company has acquired Buddy Media ($689M), Thinkfuse, Stypi, Radian6 ($326M), Rypple, and ChoicePass. Even yesterday they did an acquisition. This time they bought GoInstant for $70M. That is A LOT of empire building over the past year. Who does Mark Benioff think he is, Larry Ellison? Perhaps internal innovation has dried up and they need to look for outside help. That is not a great signal.Competition: Salesforce.com is locked into a fierce battle with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT),  Red Hat and SAP (NYSE:SAP). The company has competed very successfully for a while, but any missteps will be costly.Risks to our Thesis: We think that Salesforce.com has a compelling business model and a unique service offering with their core products. So we expect continued growth in revenue and EPS over the next several years. The trend towards Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is unstoppable and CRM will be a beneficiary. Unless the business experiences some softness in fundamentals, a pull back in valuation may not be warranted.Bottom Line: At 68x 2013 EPS, the risk/reward for Salesforce is not favorable. We would look to get more constructive on the stock at or under $100.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
683261,21305,2012-06-26T03:53:53-04:00,,"For some time now we have heard Marc Benioff and many Wall Street analysts propound on the great prospects of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). This has gone on for more than five years now. At some point one has to say, ""Enough!"" With the current world economic problems, that time has come. It is time for investors to say, ""Put up; or shut up!"" to Marc Benioff and Wall Street. It is time to sell CRM. If you are an aggressive trader, it is time to short CRM.The trend in the net income (GAAP) data for Salesforce.com over the last several years tells the real story for CRM. The last three years data are listed below.The trend is strongly downward over this time. To get a look at the latest data, the quarterly net income data is in the table below.Each of the last four quarters all have negative GAAP earnings, and the latest quarter was down by far the most. This is at least partially due to the significant economic slowing in Europe, which is one of CRM's major sales areas. Notably CRM lost more in Q1 2012 (the quarter ending April 29, 2012) than it did in all of FY2012 (the year ending January 30, 2012). In a short amount of time we will soon see that CRM is going to lose a lot more money in FY2013 (the year ending January 30, 2013). This will finally put the lie to Benioff's boasting. He won't be able to ignore losses in the $100+ million area for the year. Amazingly adjusted income on Yahoo Finance still shows CRM making an expected $1.49 per share for FY2013. With 138 million shares outstanding, this amounts to adjusted earnings of $205.62 million. How does Benioff justify adjustments of $300+ million without any major changes to the business occurring? At some point even the most bullish investors in the ""cloud"" , are going to acknowledge that CRM is not a hugely profitable business with a bright future. When it is clearly a big money loser, this should be easy for even the most die hard bull.CRM is competing against some of the biggest and most successful companies in technology. A lot of these were late to the cloud party, but they may have planned it that way. Often major corporations plan to be the third or fourth big entrant into a market so that they can avoid some mistakes that are made by others early on. Then they try to move up from there. Benioff's pompous boasting has not planned for this. Companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM), SAP (NYSE:SAP), and others tend to be slow and lumbering. However, they are huge machines with even bigger lists of enterprise contacts. IBM has been serving US businesses for 100+ years. CRM has been doing this for little more than 10 years. CRM cannot hope to match IBM's great enterprise relationships list, no matter how many sales people CRM hires. It cannot hope to match Big Blue's long term built up trust. Eventually CRM will have to win customers with a clearly superior product.Does CRM have a clearly superior product? From a purely engineering standpoint you would have to say no. CRM has made a practice of expanding its offerings with new cloud products from fledgling companies it has bought out. It has then kludged these products into its enterprise relationship management product offerings. From the users I have talked to, they are increasingly less satisfied with CRM's products. They find them cumbersome, complex, and increasingly harder to learn.There are many technical and other problems with this approach (see the list below).CRM has one other big problem. It has hired a lot of new salespeople recently. CRM's stated intention is to grab as much of the cloud market as it can before the many new and often bigger players can become consequential in the marketplace. Unfortunately for CRM, the EU crisis is pushing the world economy into a slowdown or a recession. This will likely prove to be a good year for cutbacks instead of huge new labor forces. Hewlett-Packard already announced layoffs of 27,000 employees. Others are sure to follow. In CRM's case this will likely be the year propagandized huge growth turns into huge ""real"" losses. Someone has to pay all CRM's sales people. The world market does not seem to want to do it this year. The world market likely will not want to do it next year. Will CRM fire a lot of the salespeople? If so, will it then have to pay to train new ones in two years time? CRM is caught between a rock and a hard place. It will be fighting this quandary as it loses money. It may lose even more money as a consequence.Other bigger companies will have long term money to pursue long term strategies. IBM, ORCL, MSFT, SAP, etc. will spend these next tough two years catching up technologically. Then they will be ready to take CRM's business away when the world starts buying strongly again. Even the most bullish analysts on Wall Street will soon be forced to see this. Events may be conspiring against CRM's stated strategy; but the events are ""reality"". Ultimately companies have to live with their realities, no matter how unfair or unpleasant. CRM would have encountered these same realities in time. The EU crisis has just moved up the date.The two year chart of CRM provides some technical direction for this trade.The slow stochastic sub chart shows that CRM is neither overbought nor oversold. The main chart shows that the price line seems to be trying to breech the 200-day SMA. The 50-day SMA has turned down toward the 200-day SMA. The two year chart shows a double top or perhaps a triple top formation. This puts strong technical pressure on CRM to move downward.Given the current situation in Europe, the weakening economic indicators in the US, Brazil, India, and China, etc., CRM seems almost sure to head downward, barring huge infusions of stimulus from the Fed or from Congress over the very near term. If you own it, it would seem wise to sell it. If you are an aggressive trader, it is likely a good time to short it. It has some support at $120, some at $110, and some at $100. The strongest support of the three is at $100. This is by no means the limit of a down move. This stock could easily trade at $10 given its current fiscal fundamentals. When this hot air balloon pops, the air may go out of it very quickly.On the other hand this week is the end of Q2. Consequently it is possible that many fund managers will be doing ""window dressing"" on their portfolios. Many stocks have been known to go up undeservedly during this time. When they are highly shorted stocks such as CRM, which has 11.30% of the float short interest, they can easily be short squeezed upward. Since both institutions and insiders have been selling CRM, it seems less likely that this will happen. Still averaging into a short position is a good idea. Since CRM does not pay a dividend, CRM is a cheap short.Good Luck Trading.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours."
638731,24888,2012-06-05T14:26:00-04:00,,"This is the key question that investors need to ask themselves.Marc Benioff's line is : ""It's all about the top line, not the bottom line. Let's grab market share before the pie has been taken by others.""This strategy tacitly assumes two things:1) Once we have the biggest piece of the pie, nobody can take it away from us.2) Once we have the biggest piece of the pie, we can start making money.Both assumptions are wrong in my opinion. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is trying to grab market share at the cost of profitability. It invests heavily in sales and marketing to the extent that these costs are bigger than the gross profit. Moreover it is paying its key executives with stock-based compensation. This is not only dilutive for the shareholder, but it is less attractive for employees when the stock price starts to fall. Why would you want stock instead of salary if the stock is worth less?With a current valuation of 10 times the sales at negative EPS, having the thinnest (in fact negative) operating margins in its industry, the odds are that the stock price will sooner or later collapse, taking away the incentive of stock-based compensation, forcing the company to compensate with real salary costs, increasing its costs further, jeopardizing its (non)profitability even more .As to assumption 1, Salesforce.com has few barriers to competition from its many competitors, some of them much bigger, well funded profitable companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and SAP (NYSE:SAP). It's just a fairy tale that these mastodons would not be able to take away the pie from Salesforce.com once they decide it is serious business (which they appear to have done).We have seen this many many times before. Compaq/HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell (NYSE:DELL) taking over the lead from IBM in PC's. Microsoft word blasting away Wordperfect, Microsoft Explorer crushing Netscape, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) blowing away Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and BlackBerry (RIMM).Facebook is under pressure because it has such a high PE (of 100) and price/sales ratio. Salesforce.com does not even have a PE! When they will have one, if ever, the PE will start between 5000 and 10000. If you want to talk about hyperbolic PE's dwarfing Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB), look no further. Just two weeks ago we saw that Saleforce.com can drop from 157 to 133 in just a week (from 150 to 135 in one day) because of one bit of negative news. It is now at 150 again. From 133 to 150 roughly means 2 billion in market cap. That's real money, about the entire yearly revenue, that investors are throwing into a company that is not even making real money for them. As long as this hyper craze continues, the stock could well rise more, but sooner or later the awakening will come, and the stock will collapse suddenly and with more force than many anticipate.Many will know I am not a fan of Salesforce.com. In fact I believe it's the biggest bubble of the last decade. So take my analysis with that color.With the current valuation (10 times sales at 50 cents loss per share) I honestly see very little upside, while I see tremendous potential for a classic collapse. Let me share a few more thoughts:I believe the hype is helped by Wall Street analysts who have vested interests in the company, not always visible to the naked eye. A critical analysis would show anyone with a brain, that these analysts are less than honest. I mean, come on, do you really believe that Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) believes that a company valued at 10 times the sales and losing half a dollar per share, is in fact worth 15 times the sales and should have stock price of 225?In addition, the hype is augmented by the hypnotic salesmanship of Marc Benioff. I have never seen a CEO spending more time advertising his company instead of running it. The only running he does is from conference to conference, in between swimming with his dolphins. Separating the trees from the forest I can only see big black bears on the road ahead.You might argue that 10 times the sales and losing money is in some cases justified for a promising tech company with big potential. But that would be true for a small company at the start of its growth cycle. You might also see profitability on the horizon, if such a company keeps hitting all cylinders and growing into its valuation. The only problem: Salesforce.com is by no standards a small company anymore. The law of bigger numbers commands that the growth rates of the past cannot be sustained. It's always easier to grow from small to big, than from big to bigger at the same growth.The next problem is that the more Salesforce.com grows, the more money they lose for the shareholder. Last year the company went from positive EPS to negative EPS, forecasted to grow more negative, with no clear promise as to when profitability returns. I am talking about GAAP EPS of course, because contrary to what Salesforce.com wants you to believe, GAAP EPS is the only EPS that matters. There is a reason why it stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, mandatory by the SEC.Add to that into account that Salesforce.com is paying its acquisitions and key executives largely by stock options, dilutive for the shareholder. Especially the prices it pays for acquisitions, like the most recent (planned) Buddy Media purchase, are outrageous and maybe sustainable as long as the stock price keeps rising, but very problematic when the stock price starts falling. To me, this company is literally acquiring itself to the ground. Low stock price means no more acquisitions (as the cash is lacking) and key employees switching over to the competition. Besides, fresh millionaires who just sold their company do not exactly make up for the best motivated employees.Speaking about competitors, they are just getting serious in the cloud business. Google, Oracle, SAP IBM, Microsoft and Apple are all much bigger and better funded. Moreover, they offer products at prices far more competitive than Salesforce.com. Salesforce may have been the first mover, but they still have the most expensive offer at the lowest operating margins in the industry. With negative EPS already and margins under pressure from growing competitors, this should concern shareholders.Disclosure: I am short CRM, JIVE, SPLK, PANL."

No definitive word on when the deal will be accretive but short-term EPS will take a $0.14 or $0.15 per share hit. Ouch that's gotta hurt. Salesforce has been wading into the social media space with Chatter and Radian6 and desk.com. so it seems to have its six-shooter out and has a Warren Buffett style itchy finger. Except of course this is not a deep value play.Salesforce made its bones by offering a contact management service allowing sales people to manage their prospecting and sales activities. It also allowed senior management to track their sales performance by individual, by location and by what ever time frame you wanted to select. This was old school sales activity management on a computer and eventually in the cloud. Salesforce surfed the trends very carefully.Yes social media seems to be the biggest innovation to marketing since ""Mad Men style Madison Avenue Advertising"", but social media is not Salesforce`s core competency. Social media is an anti sales person approach. Salesforce may be buying up some lucrative assets but will they know how to maximize them.Buddy Media has some interesting clients. Social media is attracting a lot of experimental dollars but it is not a sure thing. Just look at General Motors (NYSE:GM) cancelling their $10 million dollar relationship with Facebook (Nasdaq:FB) just before the now infamous IPO. But what will Buddy Media continue to give over time. Social Media is a dynamic ever-changing space. No one has it figured out. There are a lot of marketing guru`s chasing trends.Marc Benioff is not a thought leader in the social media field. He has a proven track record of promotion; particularly self promotion. So the real challenge to Marc Benioff and closely allied corporate henchmen will be to prove personal use of social media to prove that they get it or at least understand some of it.But this all raises the crux of the question. Who will be minding the store and cash flow that has built Salesforce while they spend hundreds of millions developing. Who will be minding the traditional Salesforce store while they all go play social media. It's all very nice to turn on a dime and go for the next big thing but the old thing pays a lot of bills and when it starts to slide it will be panic stations in the executive ranks.So as Salesforce tries to ride two horses it will soon realize that now it has two distinct risk betas. The two risks will compete internally and may force investors from the outside (Read dissident activist investors) to call for a break up and or divestiture. Big egos will be at play and we all know how that usually turns out for investors.Much is being made of Buddy Media high-ranking developer status with Facebook and other social media sites. They achieved that as independents. With Salesforce in the not so distant background close partnership relationships will be scrutinized differently. Other developers will be allowed into the circle to balance out the power relationships. Salesforce will be competing against their own technology in the very near future.March Benioff tell me I`m wrong.George Gutowski writes from a caveat emptor perspective."
657961,30151,2012-06-13T17:37:57-04:00,,"Wednesday, June 13 2012 marked a significant technical breakdown in Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) stock.After gradually drifting towards the 200 day simple moving average, the stock defended it successfully four times before succumbing to the selling pressure, closing at $127.33, 2.7% below the current 200DMA.Using the simple moving average crossovers are not extremely dependable guides but it appears that the 50DMA is arcing quickly down to meet the other averages. At the current pace the 50 will cross over the 100 within 2 weeks and, if weakness continues, we could see a death cross (50 falling through 200) within a month.The RSI, MACD and Full Stochastics are not forecasting near term strength of much significance, the gates appear to be open for the short sellers to loot the joint.Salesforce.com: More than a MouthfulOf all of the bull cases for going long CRM, the one that makes no sense is the idea of a buyout. Bulls were calling CRM undervalued when it was at $160+ and mentioned them as a likely acquisition target for their competitors, citing previous examples like SuccessFactors for justification.All of these calls for the imminent buyout of CRM forget the fact that it is almost an order of magnitude (10x) larger than all of the other cloud and social names that have been acquired recently.Ariba - $4.3BSuccessfactors - $3.4BRightnow Communications - $1.5BSalesforce.com's Valution currently? $17.57BMaking a $1B-3B purchase when you have cash on hand is one thing, burning a large portion of your cash to buy a non-profitable company is entirely different. Let's look at the potential suitors and see how much of a chunk CRM would be (ignoring the normal 25% premium for buyouts).Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) - $58.16BOracle (NYSE:ORCL) - $29.74BSAP (NYSE:SAP) - $6.06BIBM (NYSE:IBM) - $12.39BJust a quick glance would limit Microsoft and Oracle as the only viable candidates and last I checked both of these are actively building up their offerings to directly compete with Salesforce. Why would they be willing to completely reinvent their ecosystem to incorporate CRM products from an unprofitable operation?Cash is KingSalesforce.com has a reputation for fuzzy math when it comes to their accounting. Whether it is changing their billing cycles to make deferred revenue jump, reporting all numbers in press releases using their non-GAAP earnings or changing the buzzwords in their quarterly reports, the company will do anything and everything to distract you from their non-existent profits.Since bulls cannot point to any earnings on a GAAP basis (which have declined quarter after quarter for 2 years now), the new selling point is deferred revenue and cash flow.Deferred revenue is going to be boosted on any year over year comparison until the 1Q2013 report. They doubled their billing cycle in 1Q2012 and that will artificially boost their growth rates until we are back to comparing apples to apples. Any comparisons from previous quarters will be off due to this change.Cash flow is boosted inordinately by their use of stock options to pay their sales people instead of cash commissions. With the GAAP/non-GAAP earnings difference currently at $70M per quarter and growing, extrapolating that for the year and almost 50% of their $665M in operating cash flow is coming from employees being paid in stock.While this could go on for quite some time, any market downturn that has salespeople refusing stock options in lieu of cash will see a drastic reduction in CRM's cash flow metrics.Cloudy with a Chance of WaterfallsSalesforce.com just experienced a significant technical breakdown. Further weakness is to be expected and I would expect CRM to head down to 120 where some support lies and would not be surprised if it reaches 110 in the near term.Anything lower will require the large institutional ownership to begin to question their unwavering support of CEO Marc Benioff, the master salesman. Shorting now should be an easy play with a cover target around 120 for half and 110 for the rest would be my trade recommendation.I don't recommend playing options on CRM as the premiums are normally too high, though July $130 puts at $8.85 look pretty attractive, especially if you peel them off as CRM heads lower. If you bought some at open tomorrow, I would recommend setting a stop at your loss limit and gradually removing them at $125, $120 and then letting the rest ride at breakeven playing for a drop to $110.Ever since their earnings report in May, the stock has simply met with a wall of sellers. As a former seller (of the short variety) I wish nothing but luck for those willing to play CRM short. While the fundamentals of the company are being masked to a great degree by Benioff's dolphin influenced sales techniques, the institutional support for this name is rivaled only by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with regards to valuation of a large cap company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours."

This is how Mark Cuban became a billionaire, back in the day. I was reporting on Internet commerce then and remember it well.During the height of the dot-com bubble Cuban started something called Broadcast.com, which would stream sports events for which he hadn't paid rights on the new thing called the Internet. Yahoo (YHOO) paid big for it to keep it out of the hands of rivals, Cuban sold his Yahoo stock and voila. Broadcast.com disappeared pretty quickly because (as previously noted) it wasn't in the rights business, but the hype business.Buddy Media's primary product may be a white paper that offers strategies for companies who want to post to social media walls.

On the surface, it integrates Customer Relationship Management - the CRM in Salesforce.com's stock symbol - with social media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn (LNKD). It's strategic. But such strategies are always a moving target. Once strategies are widely adopted, they usually lose their effectiveness. Customers become inured to the game, as they have become inured to, say, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN).The best way to do customer relationship management is the old-fashioned way, namely to develop a relationship with your customers. Reward the best ones, move them up the permission stack from transaction to something more stable. Do right by customers and provide real value-for-money. Oh, and if you need a friend, buy a dog.Of course, that would be hard. It would be work. It is not sexy. Thus shortcuts like this will always be in demand.

Most articles about the company focus on reasons to short the stock, and any bullish article about the company is met with a barrage of criticism: how can anyone be foolish enough to think this stock is a good investment? How can any investor in their right mind own shares of Salesforce? That is the issue we wish to explore in this article, for Salesforce's current owners are among the most powerful investors in the market, and there must be a reason for them to hold the stock. Since going public, Salesforce has risen almost 800%, trouncing the S&P 500's 21% gain over the same time period. And given the fact that the only real reason to be long a stock is to expect it to keep rising, there must be something that the company's current owners see that makes them bullish.For purposes of disclosure, we are one of those owners, albeit indirectly. We hold shares of Salesforce through the Fidelity Growth Company Fund, which happens to be the largest individual entity to own shares of Salesforce. Does that mean we are bullish on Salesforce? No it doesn't. We bought shares of this mutual fund because we liked its track record, its overall methodology, and its emphasis on companies that have secular tailwinds. Salesforce just happened to be a part of that portfolio, and should readers choose to look at their own equity mutual funds, they may be surprised to find that they too own shares of Salesforce, even if they think it is the worst public company in the world.Why Has The Short Thesis Failed?On the surface, the short thesis for Salesforce makes sense. Overvaluation, GAAP losses, endless stock-based expenditures, and debatable accounting all make a compelling case to short the stock. This view has been detailed in many articles here on Seeking Alpha. And yet, over the past year, Salesforce has declined just over 5%, compared to a rise of 2.56% for the S&P 500. That is hardly the performance that is to be expected from a company with such a short thesis. And compared to other high-beta technology stocks, such as VMware (VMW) (down over 8% over the past year), Salesforce has held up well over the past year. How has Salesforce not plunged in light of the short thesis against the company? The answer, in our opinion, lies in who just exactly who owns this company. We break down the company's key investors below. Ownership percentages will be based on the company's 138.15 million outstanding shares (as of the company's latest 10-Q).

Finance, unless otherwise noted (as a side note, we excluded Vanguard and State Street from this list because most of their stake in Salesforce is through passive index funds, and we want this list to represent the ownership stake of investors who actively chose to own Salesforce shares).*Taken from Marc Benioff's last Form 4 filing.**Taken from the company's last 13-F filing.As the chart above shows, the 10 largest active institutional investors in Salesforce control over half of the company, giving them enormous power over the share price. And based on the latest 13-F filings of all of Salesforce's major owners, those 13-F filers hold 133,745,506 of the company's shares, or 96.812%. There is little retail ownership of the stock, and as such, the price of Salesforce's stock is dictated almost entirely by what its institutional investors do. And theirein lies the reason as to why the short thesis against Salesforce has been unable to unfold. There is enormous vested interest in keeping the stock price where it is. We will use Fidelity, the company's largest investor, as a case study to illustrate this.Fidelity is one of America's largest investors' with well over a trillion dollars of client assets under management. Fidelity is more than Salesforce's largest investor. It is also one of its oldest. The Fidelity Growth Company fund (the fund through which we own shares of Salesforce) has been an investor in Salesforce since August 2004, having invested just a few months after the company went public. And the fund has steadily built a position in the company, adding over 150,000 shares in just the last month alone. This fund alone holds over 7% of the company, and it is the fund's second largest position. Why has Fidelity held onto its stake in Salesforce for so long? Surely Fidelity's fund managers have seen how the company has slid to posting consistent GAAP losses. Surely Fidelity's fund managers are aware of what is going on with the company's stock-based compensation. Why then, does the company keep accumulating shares? There are 2 possible answers to this dilemma. The first is that Fidelity is seeing something that the company's critics are not. Perhaps Fidelity's fund managers believe that Salesforce will continue to grow, and eventually return to GAAP profitability. The second answer, however, lies in the fact that at this point, it is extremely difficult for Fidelity to sell any meaningful amount of its Salesforce stock. Because Fidelity alone holds almost 15% of the company, any meaningful sale will cause the stock price to fall, thus hurting the funds that choose to retain their shares. And it would be also nearly impossible for Fidelity's funds to sell off their entire stake, given that collectively, they own almost 15% of the company. The market could not absorb such volume. In effect, Fidelity is trapped. The same situation exists at other institutional holders, albeit to lesser degrees. Meaningful share sales are very difficult, because no one would be able to sell their stake fast enough. The Salesforce short thesis has not worked because the stock has enormous institutional support. And until that support breaks, it will be very difficult to see a meaningful fall in the stock price.The Role of AnalystsThe Wall Street analysts that cover Salesforce also have a role to play in all of this. Critics of Salesforce consistently argue that the company and the analysts that cover it are engaged in a massive pump and dump scheme designed to dupe and defraud retail investors into buying the stock. Frankly, we think that this is unlikely for several reasons.Analysts play a large role, in our view, in keeping Salesforce's stock price where it is. On the company's last earnings call, not a single analyst asked about the company's GAAP losses, or its stock-based compensation. And research reports, at least those that we have seen, make no mention of GAAP earnings, focusing only on non-GAAP EPS (which measure more accurately measures a company's performance has been a debate that has been going on for years, and is not unique to Salesforce). Because the institutional clients of these investors buy into their research, the stock is essentially unable to fall to where it would trade without institutional support. Wall Street is ignoring the issues with Salesforce, and it seems that even Morningstar (MORN) has been caught up in this.Morningstar is considered by many to be more objective and impartial in its stock research, given that it is focused on research, and not generating investment banking business. On the surface, that commitment to integrity comes through in the company's rating on Salesforce. Morningstar rates Salesforce a sell, and has assigned it its lowest star rating (1 out of 5) and a fair value estimate of $81, well below where the stock currently trades. And yet, Morningstar's report makes no mention of the company's GAAP losses, or its stock-based compensation, or its accounting practices. In fact, Morningstar praises CEO Marc Benioff, writing that, ""Marc Benioff cofounded Salesforce.com and is CEO as well as chairman of the board. He owns nearly 8% of the company's outstanding equity and received total compensation of about $21 million in fiscal 2011. We appreciate Benioff's commitment to creating shareholder value, demonstrated by his high stock ownership and prior refusal of peer-level compensation for his stewardship of the company."" That statement is tantamount to blasphemy for Salesforce shorts, who view Benioff as a used car salesman presiding over a huge accounting fraud (although, to be fair, Salesforce shares have risen almost 800% under his tenure). Morningstar does criticize Salesforce for creating a misalignment between management and investor interests. But their criticism stems not from insider selling (the most obvious reason), but from the company's poison pill and staggered board, which make it more difficult for the company to be taken over. It seems that not even Morningstar sees the reasons for shorting Salesforce as being reasons the company should be rated a sell.When Will The Short Thesis Finally Work?We have written about Salesforce several times before, and regularly receive messages asking about when we think that the company's stock price will crack. Just over 10% of the company's float is sold short, and short-sellers often think that each quarterly earnings report will be the one that finally breaks the stock and sends it into a downward spiral from which it will not recover. We do not see it that way. The real owners of the company, its institutional investors, have demonstrated that so far, they do not care about GAAP losses, or any other aspect of the short thesis for Salesforce. And the analysts that cover the company make no mention of those short arguments in their research reports. In our opinion, for Salesforce to truly begin to fall, at least one of two things must happen.Short-sellers and critics of the company believe that it is each earnings release that will mark the beginning of Salesforce's collapse. However, earnings releases and 10-Q filings are not the right things to analyze in order to determine when the short thesis will begin to work. Rather, investors should look to analyst reports and 13-F filings, to see that sentiment has changed. Only when institutional investors begin selling in large amounts, and analysts begin downgrading the company will the short thesis be able to truly play out.ConclusionsSalesforce.com is a company that serves as proof that our markets are never as simple or clear as we would like them to be. The short-thesis for the company seems clear, yet it has not played out because there is enormous vested interest among major investors to keep the stock from falling. And analysts seem to ignore all aspects of the short thesis, making no mention of it in their research. Until sentiment surrounding this company changes, we do not think that the stock can plunge (and stay at those levels). While the company's future stock price may be uncertain, one thing is not: that Salesforce.com will continue to remain a controversial company.Disclosure: I am long CRM.Additional disclosure: We hold shares of CRM through the Fidelity Growth Company Fund, which gives the company a weighting of 3.61%."
602651,24802,2012-05-20T01:34:55-04:00,,"Few stocks are as controversial here on Seeking Alpha than Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Opinion seems to be universally set against the company, due to a host of well-known concerns. To us, the most prominent concern that investors have with the stock is the fact that while the company posts consistent non-GAAP profits, it posts consistent GAAP losses. It is that issue that we wish to explore. First, we will delve into Salesforce's results for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. For the record, we hold Salesforce shares via a mutual fund, but hold no direct position in the stock or underlying options. We do not mean for this article to be a recommendation to buy or sell Salesforce. Rather, it is meant to outline our view that the stock is unlikely to fall.Results & Analyst Commentary OverviewAfter the markets closed on May 17, Salesforce posted its first quarter fiscal 2013 results. The company announced a GAAP loss of 14 cents per share on revenues of $695.467 million, which beat estimates by $17.3 million. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS came in at 37 cents, beating estimates by 3 cents a share. Deferred revenue, a key metric, rose 46% over the previous year to $1.33 billion, and unbilled deferred revenue grew to $2.7 billion, up from $2.2 billion in the prior quarter. Billings growth rose 34% in the quarter, a key metric for the company.Salesforce also raised guidance, now projecting non-GAAP EPS of $0.38-$0.39 for the current quarter, compared to estimates of 38 cents per share. Revenue guidance of $724-$728 million was ahead of estimates of $713.8 million. For all of fiscal 2013, the company guided for revenue of$2.97-$3 billion, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.60-$1.63, ahead of estimates of $2.95 billion in revenue and $1.61 in EPS.The market must have liked what it saw from Salesforce, as shares closed up 8.8% on Friday, May 18. Analysts offered plenty of bullish commentary as well, and we break it down below.There is one thing missing from all these analyst opinions and notes: GAAP earnings. Of the analysts we have seen that have provided post-earnings updates, not a single one commented on the company's GAAP losses. The same thing occurred on the company's earnings call. The word ""GAAP"" was not mentioned at all. And it is not as if Salesforce hides its GAAP losses. They are included in the company's earnings releases, and they are included in its filings with the SEC. What is going on here?Paper Profits or Real Cash?One of the central, if not the central theme of the short thesis against Salesforce is that not only is it richly valued on a non-GAAP earnings basis, it is overvalued on a GAAP basis, because the company has a share price of well over $100, with no GAAP earnings. And yet, the stock does not fall. What is going on? We believe that Salesforce has broken the GAAP model, and the stock is unlikely to fall, for the simple reason that none of the institutions or analysts that move the market actually care about GAAP EPS when it comes to Salesforce.Critics charge that Salesforce.com is masking its true earnings. We disagree. Securites law requires a company to release its GAAP earnings. But there is no requirement that the company actively direct investors to look at those numbers. The assumption is that people who wish to invest in the stock market are able to interpret a company's GAAP results for themselves. And Salesforce publishes all relevant GAAP metrics. The question we wish to pose is this. When it comes to Salesforce, or any company for that matter, what metric is the best to judge performance?Salesforce critics say that the company is hiding behind non-GAAP earnings to mask its weak financials and entice investors to buy the stock. Whether or not the company is a buy or sell is not what we wish to figure out here. We are not making a call on where Salesforce is going. We are only using the financial information the company has provided in its earnings release. But, just as Salesforce may be hiding behind non-GAAP earnings, a company can hide behind GAAP earnings as well.We will use Company X as an example. Company X just reported its annual earnings, and had GAAP income of $1 billion. The company actively proclaimed on its conference call that it is in great shape. But, a closer look at the company's earnings shows that the company had an unrealized gain of $1.5 billion on its investments, which was included in its net income. Without it, the company would have lost $500 million. Worse, the company is cash flow negative. You dig a little deeper and see that in fact, Company X is consistently cash flow negative, and its income comes from those periods where it decides to shift some of its declining cash balance to investments, which you realize are very risky in nature upon reading the company's SEC filings. Under GAAP, things look great at Company X, with GAAP income of $1 billion for the year. But underneath the surface, you see that Company X is hiding behind GAAP earnings to mask its weak operating performance.Salesforce's GAAP losses grew this quarter relative to last year. But so did its non-GAAP income. And the company's cash & investments balance, arguably the true measure of a company's success (after all, there is no successful company that does not grow its cash & investments balance), is growing. Year-over-year, Salesforce grew its total cash & investments balance from $1.447174 billion to $1.657089 billion. Debt rose slightly, from $496.149 million in the previous year to $502.326 million in this most recent quarter.Cash flow at Salesforce is growing. Whatever debate may exist about GAAP vs. non-GAAP earnings, there is no way to cloud cash flow. There is no such thing as GAAP or non-GAAP cash flow. Whatever the difference between cash balances between 2 reporting periods is the amount of cash that went in or out of the company. And at Salesforce, cash flow is growing. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the company posted operating cash flow of $213.212 million, versus operating cash flow of $135.918 million in the previous year. Free cash flow grew as well, from $112.204 million to $168.491 million.When discussing Salesforce's cash flows, it is inevitable that the issue of stock-based compensation arises. It is here that our argument over whether or not Salesforce has broken the GAAP model arrives at. Issuing stock as compensation has been a fact of life for Salesforce since the company began. And under GAAP, the issue is largely a wash. If you pay an employee $100,000 annually, there will be a compensation expense of $100,00 on your annual GAAP income statement. It will not matter if they are paid in stock or cash. Salesforce has made a conscious decision to issue stock like candy to its employees as compensation instead of cash. It is now firmly embedded into the company's cost structure.Therein lies a dilemma for Salesforce's investors. Per GAAP, the company's stock-based compensation expense overwhelms any GAAP income every quarter, and every year. However, the company is steadily growing its cash & investments pile, owing in part to the fact that it issues shares to employees instead of cash. Alternatively, the company could simply pay its employees in cash. The GAAP losses would still exist (or perhaps lessened a bit), because arguably you have to pay your employees the same $ amount, be it in stock or cash. But in that case, Salesforce would be sending valuable cash out the door. In this most recent quarter, over 38% of the company's operating cash flow came from the adding back of stock-based expenses. And yet, it is impossible to deny that the company's cash is growing.Perhaps the most interesting argument for why we believe that Salesforce has broken the GAAP model is the consideration of a Salesforce dividend. Arguably, dividends (especially rising dividends) are a sign of health at a company, and consistent GAAP losses are a sign of weakness. Assume, for a moment, that Salesforce instituted a policy of paying out 100% of free cash flow as dividends. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, that meant the company would have paid out $112.204 million in dividends. Had that amount been distributed across the company's 141.062 million diluted outstanding shares that quarter, an investor would have received 79 cents per share in dividends. And in this most recent quarter, the company would have distributed $168.491 million in cash across 146.051 million diluted outstanding shares, giving each investor a dividend of $1.15 per share. In this scenario, Salesforce grew its dividend per share by over 45% in one year, and grew its share count by just 3.53%. All this without posting a penny of GAAP net income. What does this mean? It means that in theory, as long as Salesforce simply grows its free cash flow and share count at historical norms, the company can increase its dividends every year, without having to ever post a GAAP profit. For all the fears raised over the dilutive effects stock options have on Salesforce's investors, in this scenario, it is those very stock options that allow the company to keep expanding its dividends.Are we saying that GAAP EPS has no relevance? No. What we are saying, what we wish to show with the financial figures and scenarios above is that Salesforce is showing financial health on many fronts. Cash flow is growing, and the company is steadily accumulating cash & investments on the balance sheet. And stockholder's equity is growing. Even when goodwill is completely removed from equity, Salesforce grew stockholder's equity from $801.979 million in the previous year to $978.765 million in the most recent quarter. How can a company be growing its equity and cash if it does not post GAAP profits? This is an interesting contradiction. None of the analysts that track Salesforce seem to care about the company's GAAP losses. Nor do any of the institutional investors that have billions invested in the company. The GAAP losses are not hidden from them. They are included in both the company's earnings releases and its SEC filings. So why does the stock not fall, in light of such obvious GAAP losses? The answer is simple. Until the analysts and institutional investors that move the stock begin to actually care about GAAP EPS as a relevant metric with which to judge Salesforce, the stock will not fall.ConclusionsWe are not making a call on Salesforce.com in this article. Rather, we are pointing out that until market movers actually begin to care about GAAP losses, the stock is unlikely to fall. By many other measures of corporate health, the company is thriving. Its cash & investments are growing, and its stockholder's equity is growing as well, even when you take goodwill completely out of the equation. And yet, the company's GAAP losses show no sign of ending. The contradiction this presents is a very interesting one, not only within the scope of Salesforce.com, but the markets as a whole? Which financial metrics are truly the most important? When it comes to Salesforce.com, the market has, for the time being, voted that GAAP earnings are not an important metric. And until the market votes otherwise, we think is unlikely that the stock will fall.Disclosure: I am long CRM.Additional disclosure: We are long shares of Salesforce.com via a mutual fund that gives the stock a weighting of 3.61%."
607591,28831,2012-05-22T04:44:10-04:00,,"Wallstreet's darling Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported its quarterly ""earnings"", or lack thereof, on May 17. As often is the case, analysts were impressed by the growth numbers. Revenue grew 38% year over year to $685M for the quarter. Company also raised the top end of its revenue forecast for FY 2013 to $3B. This kind of top-line growth is indeed very rare, especially for a company of Salesforce's size. However, as much as Wall Street is focused on it, revenue growth does not show the whole picture.Salesforce is not profitable. It has barely ever been profitable since going public in 2004. The total balance of retained earnings on the balance sheet, a measure of profits reinvested in the business, is a mere $140 million. That is less than $18 million per year on average: a pittance compared to company's market value of over $20 billion.This kind of valuation is not unheard of for companies that are growing exponentially and have a clear path to outsized profitability in the future. In the case of salesforce.com the valuation might be justified if one believed that as the business achieves certain scale and brand-awareness, costs as percentage of revenue would go down and profits would start to flow. Unfortunately, the actual trend has been quite the opposite.As can be seen from the charts above, while revenue has grown from $305M in Q1 2010 (fiscal year) to $695M in Q1 2013, operating expenses have steadily risen as a percentage of revenue. Sales and marketing costs have increased from 47% of revenue in Q1 2010 to 53% in Q1 2013. General and administrative costs have been relatively flat at around 15% of revenues while R&D expense has increased from 10% of revenues to 14% in the same time span.The increase in sales and marketing per unit of revenue in particular is alarming. It suggests deals are getting harder to get. Increased competition is probably one of the more important reasons. New and old technology companies are putting up a fight for market share in Salesforce's turf. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) launched their cloud-based CRM solution, Dynamics CRM Online, at the end of 2010. According to Microsoft, Dynamics CRM has grown over 30% quarter over quarter in the last few quarters. Marc Benioff, Salesforce's CEO, has dismissed Microsoft as a competitor on quarterly earnings calls. However, I cannot help but notice that Salesforce's marketing and sales expense as a percentage of quarterly revenue jumped up by more than 4% quarter over quarter in Q4 FY 2011, when Microsoft launched its Dynamics CRM Online solution.Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has not been sitting idly either. In January 2012, Oracle bought RightNow, a direct competitor to Salesforce for its core CRM product. With the full force of Oracle's global sales and support teams behind it, RightNow can grow much faster than before it was acquired. Oracle has also been strengthening its own SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) and PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) cloud offerings.IBM and SAP also have been broadening their cloud offerings by acquiring enterprise cloud computing companies, as well as developing their own in-house products. IBM also has a strong portfolio of SaaS, PaaS, and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) products. Most notable is perhaps IBM's version of social enterprise offering, similar to Salesforce Chatter. SAP also recently demonstrated a strong commitment to cloud computing by closing the acquisition of SuccessFactors for $3.4 billion. SuccessFactors' former CEO is now the head of cloud business at SAP.Unfortunately for Salesforce, the competition is not limited to Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, and SAP. There are many more companies competing with Salesforce on one or more products. These include NetSuite (NYSE:N) (cloud ERP and CRM provider); VMware (NYSE:VMW) (Owner of SocialCast, a social enterprise provider);Yammer (social enterprise provider); Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) (owner of Podio, a cloud-based business tools and social enterprise provider).Given the competitive landscape, if Salesforce is to maintain its top-line growth, it will have to keep or even increase spending on sales and marketing. This strategy will keep analysts happy for some time and will make a fortune for management, but I doubt it will translate into meaningful profitability for shareholders; not at current valuation anyways. On the other hand, if top-line growth shows the slightest sign of slowdown, the shares will tank in a hurry.Disclosure: I am short CRM."

Shareholders moved to the sidelines not only in Cisco itself, but across technology. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) was especially hard hit, falling 9% on Cisco's report.A weak market also took its toll on Salesforce shares, sending the high flyer down to a low of $132.11 ahead of its own earnings report last week. Interestingly, the stock slide filled the gap created when Salesforce announced results in February.Salesforce enjoyed double digit year-over-year growth in Europe.Quarterly sales from Europe rose 25% in dollars, and 33% in constant currency, to $118 million. And when adjusted for currency changes, it was the slowest growing region, Europe, that still grew faster ex-currency than Asia, which was up 32%.The Americas remain Salesforce's best market, with revenue growing 43% to $485 million. Asia sales came in at $92 million. And, all combined, sales rose 38% to $695 million. The growth was good enough to allow the company to boost its guidance to 32% sales growth this year.The company also executed in driving more sales to the bottom line. Operating cash flow rose 50% year-over-year to $210 million. Operating profit rose 45% as operating margins increased by 60bps - all while expanding headcount and investing in products designed to better manage and integrate the sales and customer service cycles.Salesforce has never been confused with a value stock.As a growth stock, the company delivered as promised. It surpassed Oracle for second in customer relationship management (""CRM"") market share as it leveraged its No. 1 share position in cloud CRM for enterprise growth. At quarter end, demand translated into deferred revenue and backlog of more than $4 billion, up $400 million from the prior quarter.The question facing Salesforce shareholders, particularly given the stock jumped nearly 9% following earnings, is whether they can continue to post gaudy numbers. While summer has always posed problems for technology stocks, the company's strong backlog and enterprises' insatiable appetite for compiling, controlling and leveraging exponential data growth, bodes well for the company into next year.Consider, last quarter Salesforce inked the biggest deal in its history. The unnamed insurer plans to use CRM's solutions to build out a social network connecting its employees to millions of customers. This early stage trend suggests future big enterprise deals as company's look to leverage social infrastructure put in place by firms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Linkedin (LNKD).Given the strong sales growth, guidance and recent drop, investors keenly interested in exposure to big data related stocks should feel good about Salesforce's future. For those worried the summer swoon will take its toll amid ongoing EU uncertainty, writing covered calls may offer some comfort.Disclosure: I am long CRM, LNKD, FB."
636871,24491,2012-06-05T00:03:56-04:00,,"Customer relationship software giant Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) announced a sizable acquisition Monday, as the company used cash and stock to acquire social media software maker Buddy Media. According to The Wall Street Journal, the deal could be worth as much as $745 million, with $467 million coming in the form of cash, and the rest of the deal paid in Salesforce.com's stock as well as additional options and milestone payments.Although Buddy Media isn't that well known, the firm does boast a lineup of clients that includes Ford (NYSE:F), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), and Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT). The company creates software that manages social media across all platforms and provides clients with actionable social media strategies. Since the actual returns on social media are unknown (and challenging to accurately measure), it's very difficult to value Buddy Media's business at this time. For instance, some of the company's measured returns on investment are higher post ""likings"" on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and follower growth on Twitter. Whether this actually is a valuable form of advertising is still unclear to us.Still, we think Buddy Media is likely a valuable product to add to Salesforce.com's product suite. Whether or not the returns on investments in social media software are adequate is somewhat irrelevant, in our view, because companies may continue to invest in social media efforts until a clear value presents itself. GM  may be the exception rather than the rule. It could be one, or five, or twenty years until companies realize the value of their social media investments. Further, since the field is still in the early stages of its evolution, we suspect Salesforce.com has acquired through the deal some meaningful talent that will help it adapt to a rapidly-changing atmosphere.Management thinks the acquisition will add around $20 to $25 million to the top line in the second half of 2012. At this time, we're viewing the deal as value-neutral to Salesforce.com's intrinsic value (click here for full report). And based on our valuation of the customer-relations software giant, we'd need to see a significant pullback in the shares before we'd consider adding it to the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Notice that this is a company with a core business focus on the relationship between suppliers and customers' through social media using a cloud system, which implies a great potential in terms of future for its core business. Nevertheless, sometimes a company with great potential in terms of their main activity can be expensive in terms of stock market price, and this is one of this cases.CRM's balance sheet presents a debt ratio of 60% reflecting the recent investments in the cloud system which were mostly financed by debt. This is clearly a strategy based on growth financed by creditors that produced the desirable consequence, an increase in revenues. Notice that CRM's residual value is $919 Million when the current market cap is $18942 Million, implying a potential loss of 95% in case of liquidation.Analyzing CRM's income statement we observe a negative operating income of $35 Million, which come mostly from marketing and sales consuming 55% of revenues.Assuming that CRM will be able to maintain sales but reducing its costs with marketing and sales to the same amount of 2011 (fiscal year) the operating income will raise $377 Million, summing this amount with the last net income (negative in $11 Million) would bring the 2013 net income to $366 Million. Even if this scenario verifies in the future, CRM's would be with a 52 PER (price to earnings ratio) which is still expensive for a long term investment.Given the last five years results I stabilized a price target of $17 ($2358 Million of Market Cap) which is 18% below the minimum stock price verified since 2007.

One is a consumer application, the other a business application, and while one is free the other charges, but structurally the two are very similar.That's how investors see them as well. How else do you explain a loss of almost $20 million, against a year-ago profit of less than a million, getting the headline ""Salesforce.com Profit Soars.""What excited the bulls enough to gap the stock up 10% was the company's forecast that it will have revenue next quarter of about $725 million, $12 million ahead of what was expected.If a company like HP (NYSE:HPQ) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) offered these kinds of bottom line results, we'd be shunning them. Fact is we anticipate that, over time, Salesforce.com will be able to keep growing 40% per year on the top line and bring more of that to the bottom line. (Sales on the current quarter were $695.47 million, compared with $504.36 million in the same period last year.)When there's a perceived boom in your area of business, decent results are spun as spectacular. That's what is going on with cloud applications. Salesforce.com is rising as much from the Facebook hype as anything else.But on the ground, CRM revenues are replacing the kind of enterprise systems HP and (especially) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) have been selling for years. Such systems are hosted locally, priced based on the number of servers you have, and have to be manned by trained people, programmers and operators. When you're buying it from the cloud, you're just paying for the service.In the end this means you're renting computing, not buying computing. The equity knowledge you gain from doing it yourself no longer exists - it may in fact be captured by the vendor. But that's an argument we'll have later.For now CRM's results are the best argument out there for the FB bulls. Personally I just know that all booms bust, so beware and evaluate what's beyond. And to anyone who thinks CRM's momentum is infinitely sustainable I have a one-word answer for you.SugarCRM.Disclosure: I am long MSFT."
594031,24706,2012-05-16T11:24:57-04:00,,"By Brendan GilmartinSalesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is scheduled to report 1Q 2013 earnings after the close of trading on Thursday, May 17, with a conference call to follow at 5:00 p.m. The actual results are typically released at 4:05 p.m. EST. Salesforce.com recently touched an all-time high of $164.75 (April 19) before a disappointing outlook from Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and concerns over the outlook for U.S. IT spending in the second half of the year sent the shares reeling ahead of the 1Q release.Outliers & StrategyKey measures:One of the major knocks against Salesforce.com is its lofty valuation at more than 65x forward earnings and 25x cash flow. These metrics are fairly rich, even with a 28% projected 5-year earnings growth rate and gross margins near 80%.Salesforce.com shares are coming off all-time highs ahead of Thursday's earnings release. The shares dropped $13.54 (-9.09%) to $135.44, a day after Cisco Systems warned it sees sluggish spending in IT, particularly in enterprise.Recent NewsTechnical ReviewSalesforce.com shares are off nearly 15% since the highs near $160 earlier this month. More recently, Salesforce.com tested and held a critical support level near $135 (high ahead of the 4Q report in February). Should earnings surprise to the upside and reverse the recent slide, look for resistance near $145, followed by the 20-Day SMA near $150. Below $135, support is at the 200-Day SMA near $130, followed by $125 and $120. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummarySalesforce.com shares are off ~15% over the past several weeks amid concerns over a slowdown in U.S. IT spending, management changes, restructuring efforts, and weakness in the enterprise division. Much of the focus will therefore center on the outlook for next quarter and the balance of the year. So long as guidance is at or above consensus views, the shares could recover a portion of the recent losses. Conversely, a tepid outlook could pull the shares below critical support near $135.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: By using this report, you acknowledge that  Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of  commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

580381,25120,2012-05-11T02:34:24-04:00,,"Shares of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) fell some 9% on Wall Street despite a modest recovery in the main equity indices during Thursday's regular session. Shares of the cloud-based enterprise solution provider fell after analysts and investors grew worried that the first quarter results, to be published next week, will come in as a disappointment.Ahead of the resultsThe disappointing results of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) announced Wednesday after the close caused some doubts among investors across the entire technology sector. Cisco's Chief Executive John Chambers warned that large companies and governments cut spending and delay decision making on technology investments.Analysts at William Blair warned that investors might have ""concerns about confusion in the sales channel"" after the company modified sales quotes for the Chicago region. Furthermore channel checks by Australian based bank Macquarie indicate that its analysts are ""mildly cautious"" for the first quarter results. The first quarter is traditionally a weaker quarter for the company.Expected ResultsSalesforce.com is expected to publish its first quarter results for its fiscal 2013 next week on the 17th of May. Analysts consensus is for the company to report earnings per share of $0.34, up 22% on the year. Revenues are expected to growth 34% to $678 million. Shares in the company, which trades at a premium valuation compared to its competitors, are typically volatile around its earnings announcements.ValuationSalesforce.com ended its fiscal year of 2012 with $778 million in cash and equivalents and operated with $496 million in short and long term debt for a net cash position of $280 million. The company also carries a large goodwill post on its balance sheet of $785 million.After Thursday's 9% drop shares are valued at roughly $18.5 billion, which values the firm at 8.2 times its fiscal 2012's annual revenues, a year during which the company lost $12 million.This compares to revenue multiples of more established competitors such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) which trades at 3.8 times annual revenues, SAP at 5.2 times and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 3.7 times.Investment ThesisDespite Thursday's setback, investors in Salesforce.com have seen a strong performance year to date with shares returning 33% since the beginning of January.Shares which peaked at $155 last summer, fell to levels around the $100 mark around the turn of the year on worries about slower revenue growth, but have rebounded to $135 at the moment. While shares trade virtually unchanged from a year ago, long term holders have seen their shares move from levels around $25 in the beginning of 2009 to $133 at the moment.Despite Thursday's modest correction, shares of Salesforce.com trade at a premium valuation compared to its established competitors as the company has a better growth profile. On the other hand, the company has comparatively few financial resources and is not profitable.I see enough room for a correction back to the $100 mark.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
599011,22762,2012-05-17T19:48:57-04:00,,"By Ingrid LundenThe ongoing interest and use of cloud-based services has brought a  generally good set of results to one of the leaders in the enterprise  software-as-a-service (SAAS) business. Salesforce.com released  Q1 earnings just now and in a quarter that is traditionally slower for  the company, it swung to a net loss of $19.5 million, compared to a net  profit of $530 million a year ago. Nevertheless, total revenues for the  quarter were $695 million and earnings per share of $0.37 — beating  estimates from analysts as polled by First Call, who expected adjusted  EPS of $0.34 and $678.21 million for revenue. The figures were also  better than Saleforce’s (NYSE:CRM) own guidance of $0.33-$0.34 for the EPS and  revenue of $673 million – $678 million.The sales were an increase of 38 percent on revenues for the same  period a year ago, and Marc Benioff, chairman and CEO, salesforce.com,  says that the company is on track for its first $3 billion year; last  year the company broke new ground with $2 billion in sales.Within salesforce’s revenues of $695 million, the company is making  the vast majority of its money on its core, cloud-based CRM software,  for which subscription and support revenues were $655 million.  Professional services accounted for a much smaller portion of sales at  just $40 million. Subscriptions are growing more: they were up by 38  percent compared to 30% for professional services.Deferred revenues — that is, revenues that Salesforce has yet to  collect from its customers — is up by quite a lot. Salesforce notes that  overall deferred revenue on the balance sheet was $1.33 billion, a rise  of 46 percent on last year. Meanwhile unbilled deferred revenue —  business that is contracted but unbilled and off the balance sheet — was  up to $2.7 billion from $2.2 billion a year ago. Rises in both might be  a reflection of Salesforce’s own growth, but could also be a sign of  customers delaying their payments, which Salesforce cites as a risk  factor in its business.Salesforce says that it generated cash of $213 million in Q1, up 53  percent over last year. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable  securities are at $1.7 billion.In addition to the bullish projections on $3 billion in revenues for  the full year, Salesforce.com says that it expects revenues for the next  quarter to be up on this quarter and in the range of $724 million and  $728 million, up 33 percent on last year’s Q2.Looks like tomorrow might be a good trading day for Salesforce.com. In a research note, Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis noted that the thinks that shares of Salesforce.com might  rise by as much as three-eight percent on Friday, due to “at least  temporary exhaustion of risk-off selling of high valuation growth  stocks,” and “a positive halo effect from a successful Facebook IPO.”Original post"
597901,21445,2012-05-17T13:49:06-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is expected to report Q1 earnings after the market close on Thursday, May 17, with a conference call scheduled for 5:00 pm ET. The consensus estimate is 34c for EPS and $678.21M for revenue, according to First Call. Though Salesforce's Q1 is considered a weaker period, the company should show solid billings growth after posting 47% billings growth in its FY12, says Brent Thill, an analyst for UBS. The billings number Thill is looking for is 30%+ -- they came off very strong Q4 bookings, he said. Thill is still very positive on the Salesforce.com story and thinks they are still taking market share from rivals including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Management guidance was for Q1 adjusted EPS 33c-34c on revenue of $673M-$678M. Canaccord Genuity technology analyst Richard Davis said he believes Salesforce.com shares ""could jump 3%-8%"" on Friday following what he expects will be a bullish print and improving investor sentiment about growth stocks due to 1) at least temporary exhaustion of risk-off selling of high valuation growth stocks, and 2) a positive halo effect from a successful Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) IPO. RBC Capital expects Q1 results to come in slightly ahead of consensus based on continued strong demand, broader solution sales that are leading to larger deal sizes and record pipelines following strong Q4 results. The firm expects the impressive big deal trends from last quarter to continue, which, combined with the strong demand environment, should enable deferred revenue and cash flow to slightly exceed RBC's $1.34B/$165.2M estimates. As always, bookings growth will be a closely watched metric. RBC is looking for bookings of $631.0M, which would be up 30.2% year-over-year. The firm also expects an announcement around typical year-end sales force realignment and anticipate a small restructuring with more inside sales focus on selling into the install base with expanding sales capacity going forward."
600091,22263,2012-05-18T09:35:38-04:00,,"If you are looking for 'awesome, terrific, fantastic' superlatives for the first quarter of Salesforce's 2013 fiscal year, you need go no further than the call transcript. No doubt the sell side brokers will echo Benioff's gusto today.I bring a different angle: the decline in momentum is evidenced by their cash flow. In the January 2012 quarter they booked a couple of huge deals. This is best seen by the jump in deferred revenue and the debtors for the period (462m and 365m respectively). In other words a few big deals boosted both numbers at the end of January, and this clearly impressed the market.However the cash flow for April tells a very different story.On a sequential basis, their version of cash flow fell from 240m in Jan to 213m in April; quite a reduction, of 12% in itself. They include shares issued to staff as part of operating cash flow. Being rather Buffetian in this regard I exclude it.So isolating shares issued and the related tax effect, the table below illustrates the sequential cash momentum.So on my operating cash flow, the sequential momentum was down 14%. However look closely where the large positive emanated from: a massive liquidation of debtors, generating 312m in cash.Now this shouldn't per se be problematic, as it may reflect effective working capital management. However, consider it with the change in deferred revenue: the overall balance actually shrank from January to April, which is a stark contrast to April 2011 (see below).I confirmed this source of cash for the quarter through their balance sheet: debtor days fell from 395 days in the Jan12 quarter to 195 days in April. A remarkable achievement yes, but it masks the underlying weakness in new business.This led my suspicions to the underlying billings rate, which is the revenue plus the change in the deferred revenue balance. On a year on year basis, Jan12 was impressive- the billings grew by 57%. Alas momentum fell precipitously in the just-disclosed April quarter: it fell to 34%! Yes still growing, but at an alarmingly lower rate!Conclusion: The company is clearly a very impressive one, leading the charge in cloud computing. But cash flow doesn't lie, and although they have masked the decline in momentum with excellent debtor collections, the wide-eyed optimism of bull investors will soon be revealed. This is one of the most overvalued hype-stocks on the market today.Disclosure: I am short CRM."
567791,21061,2012-05-08T00:32:41-04:00,,"Over the last few years, I've written articles about short ideas regarding Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Both were highly valued growth companies, and my articles elicited acerbic reactions from fans of each stock. I appreciate the mantras ""never short a rocket ship,"" or ""never short on valuation,"" but I tend to find my best short ideas begin from a valuation perspective. Mugatu's feelings (right) relate to the situation where obviously overvalued equities continue to trade higher. If you find a highly overvalued stock with many questions supporting its current valuation, I think you have a viable short candidate.Businesses are very different, and so too are the points of contention raised by supporters of the equity in question. With CROX, the strongest objections to my short thesis came from people who really enjoyed the comfort of these shoes, and apparently believed Crocs was reinventing the shoe market. Granted, this was in October of 2007, while the world was still viewed through rose-colored lenses. Valuation, of course, was never a point of contention.With Netflix, there were a wide range of objections. Some felt the short thesis overlooked international opportunities, the convenience of the service, and/or truly believed in Reed Hastings's ""virtuous cycle."" These objections consistently overlooked the fact that NFLX generated nearly no free cash flow, had enormous liabilities residing off its balance sheet, and cash generated went to purchase shares, primarily from selling executives.Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a stock I've very lightly followed over the last year. Articles I skimmed referenced 500+ P/E multiples -- something I assumed came from kitchen sink accounting wherein all the bad things are flushed through the income statement such that by the time you arrive at GAAP EPS, you are so far from the underlying economics of the business that P/E becomes irrelevant.As I have followed CRM more closely, I began to appreciate the short thesis. Bottom line, you have a company led by a CEO so focused on growth he sacrifices all principles of shareholder value creation. And make no mistake - this is not Amazon, another high growth company also sacrificing current shareholder value creation for future opportunities. Salesforce is a web-based CRM provider. As much as CEO Marc Benioff tries to redefine the company, it's a CRM software company.Proponents of the stock must defend an operating profit margin that has averaged 1% over the last decade. 1%, for a software company! Anyone hoping for operating leverage resulting from the revenue growth the company has achieved is bound for disappointment. As I will discuss below, Benioff's focus on growth by all means sacrifices the value created by hard working employees in CRM's core business.What type of company is CRM? In their 2005 annual report (effectively covering calendar year 2004), CRM describes the company as ""the leading provider, based on market share, of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand."" I think this concisely describes the common 2012 perception of the business.Most would describe CRM as a web-based provider of contact management software. For many years during CRM's rapid growth phase, the company referred to itself as a provider of ""on-demand"" software services. Not once in the company's 2005-2007 annual reports does the word ""cloud"" appear, even though cloud computing has been in modern vernacular since at least 2006. Then, mysteriously on page 2 of the company's 2008 annual report, comes the word cloud in one single instance:Not much changed in CRM's offering between 2007 and 2008. They've always offered web-based software. The change has been the way in which CEO Benioff sells his company to investors.This 2008 report still effectively describes CRM as an on-demand software provider, using the term ""on-demand"" 68 times throughout the 10K. Oddly, readers of 2009's annual report were introduced to a new company. ""On-demand"" became so passé that it was used to describe CRM's business only 7 times. CRM was now a sexy ""cloud"" computing company, a term now used 64 times in the report.By CRM's 2012 annual report, investors are led to believe CRM has now magically transformed itself into ""a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing and social enterprise solutions…dedicated to helping customers transform themselves into social enterprises."" In the 2012 report, ""cloud"" is used 113 times; ""on-demand,"" only 2. The chart below illustrates this dramatic shift in tone and marketing spin to describe CRM's business. (Click charts to enlarge.)  What led to this thorough re-branding? I believe Benioff's unquenchable thirst for growth collided with CRM's consistently decelerating revenue growth, driving the CEO to try to reinvent CRM and sell this new, sexy ""cloud-computing"" company to investors. The huge marketing makeover in 2009's annual report could not arrest CRM's decelerating annual revenue growth, which in FY2010 reached an all-time low of 21%. Unsuccessful on the softer re-branding effort, Benioff went into an aggressive acquisition spree. As the chart below shows, CRM responded to 2010's stagnating revenue growth with a surge in cash Capex (defined as gross capital expenditures plus cash paid for acquisitions) in FY2011 and FY2012. Throughout CRM's earlier, high growth history, the company's Capex consistently averaged approximately 5% of revenue. In 2011, this jumped to 48% of revenue, and was followed up in 2012 with a 28% clip!This aggressive Capex campaign helped stunt the decelerating annual revenue growth, which by 2012 had improved to 37%. However, the effects on operating profits and free cash flow have been devastating. As illustrated below, the efforts to revitalize growth have come at an enormous cost to shareholders.This isn't a new company, heavily investing in growth to generate robust future cash flows. Salesforce.com was founded in 1999. This is a company attempting every measure to produce revenue growth.Bulls will counter that operating cash flow growth trumps any talk of operating profit (with its restrictive GAAP requirements) or free cash flow. Cash flow is the lifeblood of any company, but using it as a valuation tool requires an understanding of the underlying components. In a perfect world, net income would equal operating cash flow. In the real world, however, numerous assumptions and non-cash issues create differences between these two measures of profitability. CRM's growth in operating cash flow in recent years has become heavily dependent on non-cash stock compensation and growth in deferred revenue - hardly two components of quality earnings. Let's look at each of these drivers of operating cash flow more closely.Non-cash stock option expense, while not cash by definition, is certainly an economic expense of the company. Although it technically contributes to operating cash flow, it needs to be accounted for in determining value. If one does not deduct this expense from operating cash in determining free cash flow, they must account for the ongoing dilution via growth in shares outstanding in future years. Further, if CRM's share price were to meaningfully decline, you must expect this non-cash expense to either become cash in nature (i.e. employees will no longer accept stock and demand more cash compensation) or dilution to accelerate as more shares are necessary to maintain compensation levels. To consider non-cash stock compensation as a worthwhile contributor to operating cash flow is myopic in regards to measuring long-term shareholder value.Growth in deferred revenue is also a dubious source of operating cash flow. Just as companies can boost cash flow in the short term by delaying payment to vendors, growing operating liabilities is a fickle and transitory source of cash flow. As CRM matures, these sources of cash will slow and potentially become a use of cash. In fact, CRM's recent accounting games - whereby they changed certain contract terms in order to book more deferred revenue - are a further example of Benioff's focus on growth, regardless of long-term implications to shareholder value. Seeking Alpha contributor Paulo Santos wrote a recent article  on this point, which is worthwhile to review.As the chart below illustrates, after years of decline in their contribution to operating cash flow, stock compensation and deferred revenue growth are reversing trend and growing as a percentage of operating cash flow.How does this compare to similar companies? The results are striking. Whether comparing to other high-growth companies or stodgy competitors, the quality of CRM's earnings are horrible.There are a number of other questionable practices concerning CRM's earnings quality. First, the company reduced its accounts receivable reserve at the end of FY2012, even though receivables increased by 60%. As the below chart illustrates, reducing their receivables reserve has become a habitual practice.Another concern regarding CRM's earnings relates to its prodigious securities investment portfolio. On-demand software companies probably should not manage corporate and mortgage bond portfolios. However, CRM dabbles in these instruments to such an extent one wonders if this is for GAAP net income management purposes. There is no strategic justification other than generating incremental investment income to drive EPS growth. Of the company's $1.2 billion in securities on its balance sheet at the end of FY2012, 51% were corporate bonds and CMOs. Such an expansive exposure to interest rate risk does not seem like a prudent use of corporate capital, and certainly does not represent a set of strategic investments.Returning to some of the charts above, CRM has never been a good business. Whether viewing CRM's historical net income as a percentage of operating cash flow or its operating margins, poor earnings quality and low profitability are persistent concerns.Benioff has a monomaniacal focus on growth. Growth, while typically a good thing, when pursued without regard for the implications on shareholder value can be highly detrimental. 1% operating margins do not create value, regardless of the rate at which revenue grows. In the company's last conference call, Benioff revealed his theories on growth:If Benioff truly wants to become a cloud-computing player, more power to him. However, he should review the financials of companies like Rackspace (NYSE:RAX), which are heavily capital intensive as a result of constant server build-outs and upgrades. These certainly aren't asset-light software companies.My final due diligence relates to the executive team, which can frequently offer valuable signals as to their true commitment to long-term shareholder value. Benioff has not sold shares since 2010, when he was on an aggressive selling campaign that certainly gave him enough cash to retire many times over. His fellow executives, however, have been persistent sellers of shares. As my diligence relates to Benioff himself, I'm wary of CEOs who claim inspiration from swimming amongst dolphins.To summarize, investors in CRM are exposing themselves to questionable earnings quality, unsustainable operating cash flow growth, and a CEO who does not understand what creates shareholder value. At best, I think this is a $50 stock.Disclosure: I am short CRM."
573981,24837,2012-05-09T13:19:10-04:00,,"It isn't often that a stock falls 50% in a single session, but Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (NASDAQ:GMCR) had the unfortunate distinction of doing just that on May 3rd after a worrisome earnings release.Though the extent of the move may be somewhat surprising, the short case was far from unknown. David Einhorn, a well-known hedge fund manager, presented a very thorough case as to why longs were doomed. Sam Antar, the self-described ""former criminal CFO of Crazy Eddie's"" turned fraud-investigator, has been talking about the imminent downfall of GMCR for quite some time. (He also tweeted a picture of a victory martini recently). But GMCR's decline has already been thoroughly covered, so a more important question may be: what stock will be the next GMCR, that sheds a significant portion of its value in the blink of an eye?Some of the high-fliers of the market have already fallen. Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), the online deal merchant, has dropped lost two thirds of its value in less than seven months since its IPO. This and all charts are courtesy of StockCharts.com.OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) is another high flier that has fallen significantly from its peak. Unlike Groupon, OPEN shares climbed for years after going public, but shares now trade at levels seen two years ago, with a lot of shareholder value destroyed (and created) in the process.However, there are still many seemingly-unstoppable star stocks, including Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). Might any of these companies collapse in GMCR-like fashion?Amazon.com is frequently pointed to as an the exemplification of the second technology bubble. While shares are certainly richly valued, currently trading at a triple-digit price to earnings ratio (as the company's profitability has declined in recent quarters), I do not believe that a decline in Amazon shares is imminent.Shares popped after the most recent earnings report, when Amazon did crush (lowered) expectations. Shares now trade within 10% of all-time highs made in late 2011. Though shares do appear overvalued based on most traditional valuation methods (i.e. price/earnings ratios), I believe that the company is in a better position than bears realize (or want to acknowledge).Amazon has transformed itself from an online retailer into a diversified, modern company. They now have many successful and industry-leading business lines; Amazon is now a major player in hardware (Kindle), software (custom Android build in the Kindle Fire), Cloud Computing (Amazon Web Services), and fulfillment. In fact, third-party sellers are now responsible for over one-third of sales on Amazon.com; Amazon simply collects various selling and/or fulfillment fees for providing services ranging from displaying the item on the website to storing and shipping the order. Amazon has many opportunities to expand its current offerings; for example, if Amazon chooses to, it extend its fulfillment tenticles further; right now, Amazon hires third-party delivery companies that presumably make a profit; in the future, Amazon could deliver packages itself to consumers (in high population density areas), and maybe even take market share from other delivery companies.Recent margin contraction has been a concern that bears stress, but I believe that it's a non-issue. Amazon has the ability to raise prices on its many different types of users whenever it chooses to. Third-party sellers become deeply dependent on Amazon (trust me, I'm one of them), allowing Amazon to exercise pricing power over the commission and fulfillment rates that are charged; the same goes for many of its other non-retail services. Additionally, many consumers (again, such as myself) that live in areas where traditional shopping is not particularly attractive (I'm in NYC, but the same may be true for a rural consumer) can afford to pay a few percent more for items from Amazon and still save time and money versus traditional shopping.Shares will swing up and down, and the stock is probably just about fully-valued, but I do not think that a collapse is imminent. Amazon is just doing too much right at the moment, and it has the ability to mitigate business weakness with strategies like price increases.Chipotle Mexican Grill is another wonder-stock that is on an incredible run. More so than other stocks that I've mentioned, CMG shares have relentlessly surged upwards without showing much weakness. Only over the past month have shares retreated slightly, and they are now hanging near the important 50-day moving average inflection point.Though I do not own shares and would not buy at this valuation, I believe that CMG may have more room to run before an eventual collapse. The Chipotle story is easy to understand and get behind: they sell affordable, trendy, and moderately-upscale food to relatively-affluent consumers. (Despite the plethora of lunch options in New York, Chipotles reliably have lines of people willing to pay a couple bucks more for a decent burrito than they'd pay for a good sandwich at a local deli.)Shares currently trade at a valuation of roughly 55 times trailing and 36 times forward earnings. The price to earnings growth ratio of 2 isn't exactly cheap, but not alarmingly expensive. If Chipotle can continue to build out stores successfully, shares may grow into their valuation. Other positive developments (i.e. if their Asian concept becomes successful) could provide additional support for the share price.However, the company will need to earn three times as much as it currently does in order to trade in line with McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), the best-in-class fast food enterprise. Therefore, any slipup by Chipotle will be rewarded with potentially-massive share price declines.Unlike Chipotle and Amazon.com, I think that Salesforce.com's reckoning day may be sooner rather than later. Shares have managed to maintain one of the more ridiculous valuations among high-flying stocks; with a $21 billion market cap, CRM trades at 9 times sales and 200 times EBITDA, while losing money on a GAAP basis (statistics from Yahoo! finance). While these metrics are nothing new for Salesforce.com, other darlings like Green Mountain Coffee and Open Table have suddenly fallen from favor (and lofty valuation) because of poor earnings reports. The same could easily happen to CRM.Additionally, technically, Salesforce.com looks like it may be weakening.After running up to all-time highs during 2012, shares have now dipped below the 50-day moving average, which is a basic (but important) technical indicator. Over the past three sessions (May 3, 4, and 7), shares have fallen over $10 from May 3's intraday high.Salesforce.com is to report earnings on May 16th, and this may be the pivotal report. Shares and expectations are at all-time highs, and recently, companies that disappoint seem to face harsher punishments from the Street than in quarters past. If Salesforce.com's report is not perfect, there may be potential to fill the gap in the 130s, or even the gap around 110. Even if shares fell by a third, they would still trade at a P/S of 6 and PEG of 2.3.I believe that Salesforce's situation is worth a bearish gamble. Shorting shares exposes oneself to large loss potential, so I have picked up some June $100 puts in anticipation of a weak earnings report. The chance of a massive payoff is admittedly very slim, but as GMCR has reminded the market, massive declines are not impossible.Disclosure: I am short CRM.Additional disclosure: Short CRM via $100 puts; may add additional put options (or close the postion) at any time."

In Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $125 per share, significantly lower than where it is currently trading.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. (Click to enlarge)If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Salesforce.com posts a VBI score of 7 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the company, its unattractive relative valuation versus peers, and neutral techinicals. Though imperfect, we use Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for our peer group analysis.Our Report on Salesforce.comInvestment Considerations(Click to enlarge)Investment HighlightsSalesforce.com earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 22% during the past three years.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. However, if the firm's share price fell below $86, we'd take a closer look and consider adding it to the market-beating portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter. In the spirit of transparency, we show the performance of our Best Ideas Newsletter below: (Click to enlarge)Salesforce.com has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 7.7% in coming years. Total debt-to- EBITDA was 2.3 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 25.6%.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 28.2% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years. (Click to enlarge)Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Salesforce.com's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 22%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.6%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)Cash Flow Analysis(Click to enlarge)Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Salesforce.com's free cash flow margin has averaged about 17.6% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Salesforce.com, cash flow from operations increased about 118% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 64% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Salesforce.com's shares are worth between $86 and $164 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's HIGH ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $125 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about -1460.5 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 69.4 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 26.2% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 28.2%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 15%, which is above Salesforce.com's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 12.7% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Salesforce.com, we use a 10.6% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $125 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Salesforce.com. We think the firm is attractive below $86 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $164 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Salesforce.com's fair value at this point in time to be about $125 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Salesforce.com's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $170 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $125 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.

547851,25047,2012-05-01T15:22:21-04:00,,"IBM (NYSE:IBM) decided to retire its old CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system. This system was on premises and provided by Siebel, a subsidiary of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). This system was the largest Siebel implementation in the world, so we are not talking peanuts here. This was a major event in the CRM world.To substitute this system, IBM is certain to have looked at proposals from Oracle, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), SAP and others. This was a major win for whoever took the business, and certainly no efforts were spared to try and get it. Now, we get the news that IBM has chosen its candidate. And which did IBM choose? Was it the so-called cloud CRM leader, Salesforce.com? No, it wasn't.IBM went with SugarCRM. IBM justified its decision with SugarCRM's open source nature and the ease of interfacing with many other IBM systems. But this is a true earthquake in the cloud CRM sector. What does one think will happen now, competitively, when SugarCRM is on the table as a competitor with Salesforce.com? Previously, you had this huge well-known cloud leader in one corner, Salesforce.com. In the other corner, the contender was this frail, unknown, open-source cheapo, SugarCRM. Not so any more. Now SugarCRM will present itself as the CRM that runs IBM, and the credibility gap is gone.The articles out there are painting this as the emergence of competition for Oracle, but the true rival here is Salesforce.com. The same Salesforce.com, whose margins were already under fire from cloud alternatives cropping from everywhere, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), now has to contend with a credible open-source competitor. This can't be good, especially when we remember that Salesforce already has a reputation for being expensive (something that's constantly being exploited by Microsoft, which is always proposing a cheaper cost per seat). This is no market for low margin high multiple companies. Like Salesforce, with a forward 2012 P/E of 96.ConclusionEach day that passes, it gets harder for Salesforce.com to grow its cloud CRM business or its margins given the emergence of new powerful competitors like SugarCRM. This is not what you want to see in a company trading at a forward P/E of 96, and thus makes Salesforce.com a sell. In the short term, Salesforce's drive into longer contracts might well paint a picture of accelerated growth, but such is misleading.Finally, even the 96 P/E is based on non-GAAP earnings that exclude costs like compensation paid in stock - something that clearly ought not to be excluded, as its absence would lead to Salesforce not having workers to carry out its business. So Salesforce's valuation is even higher than it seems.Disclosure: I am short CRM."

504361,23478,2012-04-17T15:16:15-04:00,,"By Jeff BaileyThank goodness we at YCharts write about stocks instead of shorting them. If we’d shorted shares of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) on February 7, when we wrote this unkind article, we’d have gotten creamed.CRM data by YChartsAnd yet, is there a more compelling tech stock to dislike? As one sees here, Salesforce.com’s market cap keeps rising, even as it becomes a money-losing company. Sort of like youth soccer – everyone gets a trophy.CRM Market Cap data by YChartsOne has to admire Marc Benioff, the founder and CEO of Salesforce.com – and a billionaire thanks to his 10 million or so shares in the cloud computing company. The market is rewarding him for revenue growth – about 37% in the fiscal year ended January 31 – and so that’s his mantra:“Salesforce.com's 38% revenue growth in the fourth quarter was a spectacular finish to our fiscal year, a year in which we delivered 37% revenue growth and added nearly 2,500 employees, including nearly 2,000 in the U.S.,” Benioff said in the fourth-quarter earnings release . He added, “we're excited to raise our guidance today, which puts us on pace to exceed the $3 billion revenue run rate during FY13.”CRM Earnings Per Share data by YChartsHey, that’s great, man. But how about net income?You just won’t find Benioff agonizing over profits in either the earnings release or the 10-K, recently filed. There’s no mea culpa about the losses. No promise to cut costs and get back into the black ASAP. No hiring of some nasty outsider to curb spending.And for anyone the least bit bummed out about the losses, simply turn to page 56 of the 10-K. There, some Non-GAAP results are displayed, a sort of dream land for tech company management. Out goes the burdensome expense associated with giving employees all that equity. Out goes the need to amortize hefty intangibles taken on in acquisitions. And voila: fiscal 2012 produces $193.6 million of Non-GAAP net income, instead of the $11.6 million net loss the uptight auditors insist upon. Wouldn’t it be nice?You’ll notice Benioff mentioned hiring – and indeed employment grew at Salesforce.com by 2,479 during the fiscal year, or by 47%, to 7,785. That’s faster than sales grew. Headcount in R&D, marketing and sales and even the general and administrative area all increased more than sales did last year. No economies of scale here.And, Salesforce.com informs us in the 10-K, no luck pushing through price increases on its main software offerings last year. There remains a huge slug of expense to recognize from prior equity awards. And as Salesforce.com sells to larger customers, the cost of selling may increase and pricing pressures may grow stronger. Benioff has his work cut out for him.But at least he’s hiring."
496621,24714,2012-04-13T13:23:01-04:00,,"Since I have learned fundamental analysis and value investing, Salesforce.com (CRM) has been my go-to answer to the question, ""Which stocks do you think are the most overvalued?"" Although there are other stocks which enter that conversation, like Groupon (GRPN), all of my other sell picks in the technology sector have dropped off big over the past few months. Salesforce.com, on the other hand, has had some very bullish activity over the past few weeks. For those who are short, I will attempt to give my best advice on whether to keep holding on or to cover and accept losses.At the close of trading on April 12, Salesforce.com traded at $158.30, nearing its 52-week high of $160.12. Every time I have attempted to value the company based on earnings analysis or FCF, I've never reached a valuation higher than $50. Using GAAP earnings, Salesforce.com actually finished its last fiscal year in the red after having three profitable years with GAAP earnings per share peaking at 63 cents. The company famously does include options compensation expense in its earnings announcements, so its results have sounded a little bit more realistic. However, Salesforce.com is a $60 stock at best even when using the non-GAAP numbers.So where is the value in Salesforce.com? Bulls say it comes from the high cash flow from the subscription nature of the company. It is true that the company has enough subscriptions to stay in business for the foreseeable future. The company had $420.21 million in free cash flow in fiscal year 2012, which has increased by an annualized 35.6 percent over the last three years. Do those numbers really justify a $21.5 billion valuation considering that Salesforce.com still has to deliver on all of those subscriptions? I think not.For many investors, the question is no longer if Salesforce.com shares are overvalued, but a matter of when they are going to come back down to Earth. This will happen once institutional owners back out of their positions. Salesforce's largest institutional owner is Fidelity, which owns 20.2 million shares or about 14.7 percent of the company. In terms of market value, it is Fidelity's 17th largest investment, right behind Starbucks (SBUX) and ahead of Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Oracle (ORCL). Of Fidelity's top 40 holdings, it is the 39th smallest company in terms of market cap, with Noble Energy being the lowest as Fidelity's 36th largest holding. As more new tech companies begin to IPO and securities in cloud computing and social networking become more abundant, CRM shares will finally stop an unearned bull run.I believe much of the hype surrounding Salesforce.com is from supply and demand, which is never a good reason to invest in a stock. From a valuation standpoint, I still believe it is very overvalued, even when playing the devil's advocate and giving it the benefit of the doubt everywhere I could. Right now, I believe the best way to short Salesforce.com is to buy long-term puts in the $90 to $130 range, depending on how bearish you are. This way, there will be a lot of time to wait for the downturn that is way overdue, but still may be a long way away.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
413811,24005,2012-03-06T07:54:48-05:00,,"In our view, Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) yo-yo ride from $160 to $96 and back to $144 is the sign of a bubble that just won't pop. The action in the stock has been truly nauseating for longs and shorts alike over the past year and I can't see how the rally will hold during the next Europe-crazed sell-off in the overall market.CRM shares have recovered some 44% YTD. This stock is a bucking bronco that surely cost traders both long and short this year with its incredible whipsaw trading action. Traders have faced their ripoff while getting their faces ripped off all in the span of two months ...CRM shares nearly hit the $160 mark last summer before trading below $100 briefly in January. Now, CRM bulls are once again in control of the rodeo, but we wonder if they are about to get knocked out of the saddle thanks to an overvalued market and CRM's own overvalued fundamentals.While the stock looks cheap to many investors at 70X 2014 projected earnings estimates and a reputation as the fastest growing name in technology investors seem to think CRM is a good buy right now. That said, many dyed in the wool value investors think that companies who aren't earning money should trade at or below book value or for a reasonable multiple on revenue and growth if they are expected to earn profits in future periods. Longs argue that on a discounted cash flow basis CRM is cheap given their growth rate expectations, but again they fail to consider any curve balls that influence that analysis.In CRM's case, the assets are virtual and while they do show impressive revenue growth, we wonder if they are truly immune to competition as the investment community believes. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), long considered a dinosaur on the Cloud Computing scene, has invested heavily in Cloud Computing. For investors looking to play in the cloud space I would invest in an Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) or Emerson (EMC). Waiting for an F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV) to trade at a reasonable multiple of earnings in our view is a much safer way to invest in this trend.As for the technicals, this is where I see a trade lining up for short sellers to make some decent money. CRM is up 50% in a very short period of time and has left an unfilled gap between $140 and $133. I would look to either sell a bear call spread on this stock or buy an in the money put option -- just look at the severely overbought RSI and MACD.(Click to enlarge)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
500561,26031,2012-04-16T13:54:46-04:00,,"With scores of large, enterprise customers, including Dell (DELL-OLD), HP (HPQ), VMware (VMW), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), and others, replacing their outdated Siebel platforms with Salesforce (CRM) platforms, and with thousands of SMBs adopting its various platforms to help manage their businesses, it seems that Salesforce is on target for another quarter (its 10th) of consecutive acceleration in transaction growth.I first considered investing in Salesforce back in 2008, when a good friend of mine was highly praising this new disruptive company that he was paying to manage his CRM needs. At the time, Salesforce was trading around $30 per share, after coming down from its then high of around $70 earlier that year. With the current recession just beginning, and with many uncertainties on how industry leaders SAP (SAP) and Oracle (ORCL) would respond to this new threat, I admit, I was bearish.Although shares of Salesforce since have only trended up, I was looking to see steady growth, and this was not the case. Throughout 2009, Salesforce demonstrated negative Quarter-on-Quarter (Q/Q) growth, and it wasn't until that trend shifted at the end of 2010 that I began to look more seriously into Salesforce again. Since that last quarter of 2010, Salesforce has done nothing but grow at an incredible pace, delivering quarter after quarter of exceptional growth, and has seen positive Q/Q growth in every quarter since. With over 92,000 customers, and almost $2.5 billion in revenue, Salesforce is looking really good.I believe that Salesforce is one of those companies that we will look back on years from now with awe, and I have no doubt that it will continue to disrupt Oracle, SAS, and other large competitors, which have been forced to spend huge sums in acquisition costs just to keep up. SAP recently shelled out an astonishing $3.4 billion (representing an incredible 52% premium) on purchasing human resources software maker SuccessFactors, and recently agreed to acquire mobile asset management and field service solutions provider Syclo for an undisclosed sum. Oracle has also been on a cloud-shopping spree, paying $1.5 billion for CRM provider RightNow, and $1.9 billion for talent management provider Taleo (NASDAQ:TLEO). If you were looking for validation of a thesis that cloud enterprise solutions will be dominant, look no further, as Oracle, SAP, and other giants have essentially validated Salesforce's model, and are now trying to play catch-up. However, Salesforce is proving to be a fast moving target.Salesforce has recently introduced its Social Marketing Cloud which leverages the Radian6 acquisition it made last year, as well as its powerful Chatter platform. Its human capital management platform SuccessForce, based on the recent acquisition of Rypple is additional confirmation that Salesforce means business. The SiteForce developer platform (re-branded as Site.com) based on Salesforce's Heroku (Ruby) and Apex platforms is quickly gaining momentum, and it looks like 2012 will be a pivotal year for the company. Salesforce has demonstrated an appetite for acquisitions, and has proven that it can compete in this space.Sure, Salesforce's questionable GAAP performance (when compared to non-GAAP results) is not as impressive as I would like to see, and the continuous dilution of shareholders raises questions surrounding long term goals. EBITDA multiples, both current and forward looking, are through the roof (somewhere in the 150 range), and one could easily turn bearish. Adoption of Apex has not been on par with predictions, and Salesforce's intention to allow integration of Oracle and SAP platforms could seem like a bit of a step backwards. Competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure platform and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also expected to be fierce.Even so, my thesis remains unchanged, and SAP and Oracle's aggressive entry into this space confirms that non-cloud platforms will soon be a thing of the past. Salesforce has proven itself to be a worthy competitor, and has demonstrated beyond any doubt that it is just as hungry and aggressive in this space as its larger rivals. Salesforce has much room to grow, and despite the high multiples, is a great opportunity for the long run.Disclosure: I am long CRM."
452281,27911,2012-03-22T15:16:43-04:00,,"The debate over whether or not the free market system is rational has been around probably since free markets themselves. Academics, unable to find time to invest because they have to think about academic stuff that's detached from reality, throw in the towel and try to prove that markets are completely irrational. Instead, they invest in well diversified funds that track the economy as a whole. On the other hand, investors such as Jim Cramer or Peter Lynch have consistently outperformed markets, disproving that market variations are unpredictable/irrational. Ironically, both may admit the markets are irrational.The focus of this article is the rationality of investing in very ""expensive"" stocks; specifically I'm interested in Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Obviously, ""expensive"" is relative when the stock valuations are 5-10X book value, 80X+ P/E, etc., yet the price keeps creeping up. Salesforce has brought a solid idea into the market, yet it's hype is very reminiscent of previous bubbles. The idea has been around as long as salesmen: try to spread word about your products to as many potential buyers as possible. Still, ask any CRM investor to explain exactly what CRM does, and it will probably take them a while to respond. On their website, you see the word ""cloud"" everywhere and click on the products tab and you see 15 ""different"" products that you can buy. Investors absolutely love fancy sounding services, just read Lynch's ""One up on Wall Street"". One issue that is unclear is what portion of CRM's subscribers come back and repeatedly use their services. With a hot new product, everyone will want to try something, but unless it actually increases their profit, it's doubtful they come back.The most shocking aspect of CRM's valuation is how rationally irrational it is. In the 90's tech boom, companies fudged earnings reports to attract more investors. Not so for CRM. They explicitly tell you that they lost $0.09 per share in 2011 and project to lose $0.51 to $0.55 per share in 2012 (source: CRM's last 10-K). The losses occur due to the heavy stock-based compensation somehow excluded from the cost of ordinary operations. Thus, if you're a CRM investor, your money is being used to pay the workers. There has been zero benefit for shareholders since 2009 when the company was last profitable. However, as this previous SA article mentioned, these opinions are all of little value as long as the herd of investors sees booming revenues. It is impossible to predict when CRM falls back to it's appropriate level. I suspect it may take a full year or two before enough companies have tried the service to realize that they're not actually generating that many new customers from it. At that point, the fall will be hard, but so it must be in irrational markets.Disclosure: I am short CRM."
440691,24550,2012-03-18T06:37:31-04:00,,"Last Fall at Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) annual customer conference Dreamforce, I witnessed a somewhat surprising announcement from Infor CEO Charles Phillips and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff of a partnership between the two companies. I say surprising because I don't think many people expected Infor, which is a rollup of several traditional 90's era software systems, to be on the list of main stage guest and certainly not a partner target for cloud apps leader (and the poster child for the cloud computing era) Salesforce.com. On the surface you might even say that the two companies are as different as the gasoline engine powered motorcar was from the horse and buggy. Infor though, has made some serious efforts to modernize its offerings and to harmonize the products on a modern UI. You might even have noticed that they've grown much more aggressive over the last few years, particularly under the leadership of ex-Oracle President Charles Phillips with new releases, new executive hires, acquisitions and a much higher profile marketing campaign.Many tech ""partnerships"" are high on hype and low on substance but this week's announcement of Inforce Everywhere signals true depth and real commitment by both companies to build something meaningful between them. The more I've thought about the partnership and the announcements the more I have started to see just what this might mean in the marketplace for customers, for competitors and for each company. Before we dive into the announcement it's probably useful to review the details of the partnership itself. There are three major components to the partnership agreement: 1. Salesforce.com took an equity stake in Infor, 2. Infor became one of only three Salesforce CRM resellers (Intuit and Dell are the other two) and 3. Infor became a Salesforce ISV partner.Salesforce using an equity stake approach to a partnership is not a new tactic for the company, it did the same thing in a partnership with Unit4 that co-funded the spin off company FinancialForce a few years ago. The arrangement is beneficial to both companies, Infor gets an infusion of needed capital (Infor is a private company, owned mostly by Golden Gate Capital) to continue its product modernization efforts, and Salesforce.com gets some royalties (like an appExchange partner, although this is maybe actually tied to the ISV portion of the agreement) and potentially some influence over future product direction (although as far as I know, that influence has not been exercised).As a Salesforce.com CRM reseller Infor gets a strong CRM product in its sales portfolio and of course Salesforce.com gets one more distribution channel. In addition Salesforce CRM becomes part of another complete business solution which increases its market reach and Infor, which really doesn't have a strong CRM offering, rounds out its solutions as well. Lastly Infor gains access to the Force cloud platform for developing native cloud solutions, which is the part of the agreement that is directly related to this week's announcement, and is important to Infor directly because of the potential new products as well as indirectly to Infor by providing cloud credibility to its product story.The announcement itself is the availability of the first of three products that Infor agreed to develop on the Force.com platform, Inforce Everywhere. Inforce Everywhere is the integration that enables Infor's back office solutions to share data and stay in sync with Salesforce CRM front end, and is the key to creating an end-to-end business solution offering from the two companies. Also because the product is built on Force it gains social capabilities through Salesforce Chatter and is mobile. The other two products, which are in development now, are 1. Inforce Ordering, which will provide the ability to create quotes and orders in Salesforce Sales cloud and pass them to Infor for synchronization and order fulfillment, and 2. Inforce Marketing, which uses the assets from Epiphany to provide an expanded set of B2B marketing capabilities that are complimentary to Salesforce's current limited marketing feature set.Based on the plans and the progress so far I'd say that the partnership offers both companies significant benefit and should provide value to both Salesforce.com's and Infor's customer base. In this case the devil's not in the details, which are well defined and clearly could benefit both companies, but instead in the execution, which involve a lot of moving parts and could prove challenging. In the end though this partnership may prove to be the most aggressive and productive move of all of Infor's moves under the new regimen."

We were thinking that Thursday as the San  Francisco-based company once again hosted an event in its hometown. But  the tone was markedly different from the event it put together here last  fall. Most notably, salesforce.com stopped throwing punches and started  throwing hugs to other enterprise software vendors.Rather than blasting Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) as a ‘false cloud’ provider or taking  swipes at SAP as a dinosaur, CEO Marc Benioff extended olive branches to  those rivals. In his keynote, he talked about ‘coexisting’ with those  companies, stressing the need for ‘deep integration’ between  salesforce.com’s products and the widely deployed software. (But Benioff  wouldn’t be Benioff if he didn’t put his own marketing spin on the  relationship: he positions salesforce.com as the ‘social front office’  for rival existing back-office systems, such as general ledger apps.)It was a rather dramatic change in tone, suggesting that  salesforce.com is staking its claim as a full-fledged member of the  fraternity of enterprise software vendors. The company certainly has the  numbers to back up that claim: in its previous quarter, salesforce.com  announced its first-ever nine-digit contract and is on track to generate  close to $3bn in revenue this year. (And don’t forget that  salesforce.com also sports a major-league market cap of $20.7bn.)For their part, Benioff and other people at the company say that  détente is in response to customers’ need for software vendors to work  together. That’s certainly understandable as most companies run a  mishmash of software from a variety of providers. But we might suggest  that the tone also reflects a new reality that has only emerged on a  grand scale since last fall: the division between the old-line license  model and the emerging on-demand model is not as irreconcilable as once  thought.Just since salesforce.com’s last event in San Francisco, SAP and  Oracle have done landmark acquisitions of high-profile SaaS vendors,  ones that were often mentioned in the same breath as salesforce.com.  (The spending spree cost the old-line companies more than $7bn.) So if  the old software guard – and even more importantly, their customers –  figure they can work with SaaS providers, maybe it’s not too farfetched  to imagine SAP and Oracle perhaps taking a run at salesforce.com in the  future."

We think that Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is too loved by the investing herd right now and could make solid short sale profits for investors. While high valuation is certainly not a reason to short a stock, astronomically high valuations are a red flag, and could mean that a given stock is poised to plummet when reality set in and investors head for the exits all at once. Salesforce.com is not only insanely expensive, it also has a few negative catalysts on the horizon that could hurt share prices in the near term. Over the longer term, I expect the numbers to do the talking.Salesforce.com is all the rage right now. Saying anything negative about the stock is tantamount to blasphemy. In fact, most of the investment community takes any type of bearishness regarding CRM personally. It's as though we bears, who are few and far between, have insulted a major religion or something!Look, I know I am taking a major risk by not only comparing the bubble in CRM to a religious phenomenon, but in the end any system of belief that is so passionate as to warrant any kind of beheading in retaliation to a simple insult risks being labeled ""inherently flawed."" Stock traders don't always get along, and as ""they"" say, ""that's what makes a market.""But let us not focus on rhetoric -- let's get down to brass tax: Here are the raw, hard facts about CRM that investors should watch:Growth: Gogrid.com says, ""cloud computing market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of more than 26 percent through 2015.""Those numbers are impressive and much of that growth will be from SAAS (geek speak for Software As A Service).As for growth at CRM specifically -- revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 38% during the last five fiscal years. (ycharts.com)That sounds fine and dandy, but investors have to watch out for how much they pay for that growth in the stock market.Valuation: CRM shares look heavily overvalued because rising revenue growth has actually translated to falling net income, and book value per share over the short term. Maybe CEO Marc Benioff will one day be able to translate all of this low-margin selling into huge profits, but for now it kind of looks more like the Napster model than the iTunes model, and that concerns us. CRM trades for a mind blowing 196X EV/EBITDA multiple.In conclusion, I will be looking to add to a small short position I have taken in CRM via selling the April $155 calls. Please don't behead me!Disclosure: I am short CRM."
426791,21305,2012-03-12T08:57:12-04:00,,"For a couple of years now many have predicted Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) would fall hard. I confess to having occasionally been one of those. Were I and all of the others wrong? The jury is still out. I have both made and lost money shorting CRM. I have tried to make my calls on it more judicious as I have studied it more thoroughly. CEO Marc Benioff is indeed a Pied Piper and a master salesman. However, he will likely meet his match this year.Let's review a few of the facts. Salesforce.com has been growing its PE for two years (a bad thing). After the latest quarter, Q4 2011, CRM is no longer profitable. It is predicting an even more unprofitable Q1 of -$0.18 to -$0.19 per share. Of course, the Benioff massaged non-GAAP EPS numbers are supposed to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.44 per share. Which do you believe? I believe the GAAP numbers because over the long term they are the only real measure of a company's profitability, and they have been bad for a long time for CRM. Essentially CRM has given many salary benefits in terms of stock and stock options. It has added engineering talent and products by buying companies instead of hiring and developing. It has continually written off charges associated with merging these companies into CRM as ""one time charges"", but it does this all of the time. If this is really the company's way of developing and adding talent, these should not all be viewed as ""one time"" charges. They should be viewed as the typical cost of doing business. There are many more examples, but these bother me the most.The above not only bother me from an accounting standpoint (questionably legitimate). They bother me from a strategic standpoint. If CRM does all of its development and some sales hiring by buying companies, it has no overriding strategic view. At best it has a very loose one. Over time this will lead to trouble. The same can be said for its product strategy. If it expands CRM offerings by buying other companies for the products they will add, it has no overall architecture scheme. This means those products cannot be easily maintained. It means they will all have to be changed considerably to eventually fit in a better homogeneous product suite. Eventually customers will demand a more consistent user interface. They will demand better interoperability. Admittedly most of these products were likely developed with object oriented languages. Some may have been developed with Design Patterns based interfaces. However, the idea that products from diverse companies will easily form a long term suite of products without a huge amount of work done on them is a pipe dream. I do not use Salesforce.com's products myself, but virtually all of the people I have talked to in the industry who use them have told me that they are getting more difficult to learn. They are getting harder and more cumbersome to use. This is what one would expect from products glommed together in this haphazard manner. It may be a way that CRM has used to convince customers that it is on the leading edge of technology, but it is also a way of building up a backlog of serious development engineering work.To understand the point I am making, all you have to do is think of the Microsoft Suite of programs. They have a relatively consistent user interface, and Microsoft has done a lot of work to make them interoperable. Yet one does not immediately know how to use all of the programs just by opening them up. They take time to learn. Almost everyone knows how to use Microsoft Word. However, that does not immediately make you expert in PowerPoint, or Excel, or the many others. Yet these programs have been designed to have similar user interfaces and to work together. CRM's programs have not been. When CRM was the lone big competitor in the space, people had to accept what it gave them. Plus when CRM started out, its offerings were fewer and less complex. With Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), SAP (NYSE:SAP) [with EMC (EMC) & VMware (NYSE:VMW)] , and others putting more emphasis on the cloud customer resource management market, the standard is being raised. The above are huge companies that will produce products with consistent user interfaces. The products will make a lot more sense overall to users than do CRM's hodgepodge. CRM will have more trouble getting and keeping its customers. It will have to spend huge amounts to try to make its hodgepodge more homogeneous. CRM will not be able to simply buy new companies to accomplish this. It will have to hire in the standard way. This will cut into even its ""adjusted"" earnings figures. Sales expenses will go up. The churn rate will go up. The profit margins will go down. I again point out that CRM is not currently profitable. Keep in mind too that CRM has often added products for free to keep revenue growth up. The continuing maintenance and development of these products does not come for free. The programs themselves were often acquired through acquisitions of other companies. These were not free either, although CRM's accounting methods do everything they can to make you think they were.Now that many can see that both engineering development and sales and marketing expenses must go up over the long haul, it is time to look at the particular problems this year presents. These are mostly economic. We are currently experiencing a worldwide economic slowdown. The Chinese recently revised their FY2012 GDP estimate from 8.0% to 7.5%. Not long ago it was 10%+. Brazil reported FY2011 GDP growth of just 2.7%. This was down from 7.5% in FY2010. The EU GDP shrank quarter over quarter by -0.3% in Q4 2011, and it is looking weaker all of the time. The ECB president is now saying that he expects a weak recession in 2012 in the EU. This could easily deteriorate into a much deeper recession. The EU recession is posited to have an approximate -1% growth effect on the U.S. GDP in 2012, which was only 3% in Q4 2011, and that was the high point of the year. Each $10/barrel increase in the price of oil is thought to decrease the U.S. GDP by -0.5%. Oil has been going up, and it is generally agreed to be in a long term bull market for the next several years, although a new recession might curb this growth temporarily. Japan is still in a recession. There is terrible flooding in Australia. That should hurt them, and they were already hurting from the China slow down. David Zion of Credit Suisse says S&P500 companies will have an approximate $783B in pension funding shortfalls in FY2012. This is up roughly $300B from FY2011, and the shortfall in FY2013 is supposed to be even bigger. As an example, Ford recently announced that they were going to put $3.9B into their pension funds this year. If S&P500 companies are putting substantially more of their profits into pension funds in FY2012, they will have a hard time growing profits year over year. They will cut CAPEX spending. This will hurt their future productivity and other companies profitability in FY2012. This means CRM's revenue growth may slow. On top of this the U.S. Trade Deficit number for Jan. 2012 was -$52.6. This was higher than expected. It means the U.S. produced less, and instead it bought more from foreign countries in January. This means GDP growth will be lower than expected in Q1 2012. ECRI has even called for a recession in the U.S. in 2012. Some argue with this, but more are starting to worry that a recession is coming.David Darst of Morgan Stanley said on CNBC on Friday that Morgan Stanley is looking for a U.S. GDP growth of roughly 1% in Q1 2012. He said the current market S&P500 estimates reflect 8% EPS growth for Q1. MS feels instead that a 3% EPS growth figure is more correct. The market should start to react to the Trade Deficit (and the other negative economic news) soon. It should start to lower earnings estimates for Q1. The market should fall as this happens. It could be this does not happen. The market could continue upward on the recent good Non-Farm Payrolls data. However, that will just mean the market will crash on earnings. Since David Darst is very well connected among the ""Big Boys"", it makes a lot of sense that his thinking is correct. The estimates will start to go down. This market has been technically over bought since December 2011. With this market over due for a pullback, it seems even more likely that David Darst is correct about the near term behavior of the market. He sees U.S. GDP growth as fluctuating in the 1% to 2% range for the entire year. This means there will be no great growth in stocks this year. When the major brokerages say things like this, it makes it harder for the momentum pumpers to continue to push the market upward against fundamentals.CRM does most of its business in North America and Europe. Europe will be in a recession in 2012. It will probably be announced as soon as the Q1 GDP results are final. U.S. growth is weakening, and it may go into recession later in the year, although it is unlikely one could be declared before sometime in Q4. This alone should mean a slowing of revenue growth for CRM. CRM has been billing itself as a fast grower. The market has generally accepted this. Because of this CRM has been forgiven for many of its failings (such as not actually making money in the last year). When revenue growth starts to slow noticeably, as it should in 2012, CRM's price should fall dramatically. It will no longer be forgiven its failings. It will start to be evaluated for its realities. These will bring it down to earth. This in turn will exacerbate its problems. The developers and salespeople who previously stayed at CRM for the stock option benefits will find that the options are valueless in a down trending stock. Many will exit the company. This will add huge training costs to CRM's expenses. These costs will not be able to be written off as ""one time charges"".CRM is a $20.16B market cap company, It is no longer a new growth story. It is at the point of being viewed as the large cap company it is. When the market starts looking at it this way instead of through Benioff's rose colored glasses, it will fall dramatically.If you own this stock, it is time to take profits. If you have the stomach to possibly endure short squeezes from momentum and HFT traders, you can likely short it this year for a good profit. It has 13.4% short interest, so any short squeezes could be painful. However, this high short interest also indicates a belief by many that the stock is troubled. In Q4 2011 gross profit rose 35.9% year over year. However, operating expenses rose 37.5% year over year. Research and development expenses rose 40.1% year over year. Sales and marketing expenses rose 40.4% year over year. This is a losing scenario, and I think I have pointed out reasons above that it is likely to get much worse in the near future. There is a lot of talk of rising deferred earnings with CRM, and there is some validity to that (subscriptions, etc.). However, I have tried to make the case for deferred expenses too. You judge whether I have or not.The two year chart of CRM lends some technical direction to the trade.(Click to enlarge)In the sub charts both the slow stochastic and the relative strength indices show that CRM is over bought. The main chart shows that it hit a closing high last summer at $159.32. It is still below that high. Its 50-day SMA is still below its 200-day SMA. This is technically very weak when the overall market has been rising for many months. If David Darst and many others are correct, the overall market is due for a significant pullback. CRM's overall sideways (at best) stock behavior since Dec. of 2010 strengthens the argument that employees may leave, especially if tech's overall health has improved in the last year. Their stock options will not have gained much value. Some will want more pay. Increased attrition will mean more training costs for replacement employees. It will mean less chance of profitability in the near future even without the huge competition that seems to continually increase. To me this stock is a short. In the near term it should move back down to the approximately $120 support level on a pullback of the overall market. Longer term a much lower stock price seems in the cards. However, you may want to play the various legs in this one. The HFT and momentum traders in this stock are vicious. It helps to have the market working in your favor.Good Luck Trading.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours."
399901,26851,2012-02-29T02:44:00-05:00,,"When was the last time you chatted about ""Excess tax benefits from employee stock plans"" in a discussion about ""the cloud?"" Well, that obscure item contributed nearly half of CRM's cash flow growth in FY2012. Whenever I read Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) financial statements, I wonder why I aced accounting in school. They do so many things in such strange ways that it is nearly impossible to go through them all. One thing that bears often growl about is the stock-comp expense, which cost CRM $229M on the income statement of the just reported FY. But, of course, growth investors long ago capitulated in not considering this a ""real"" expense. For this and other reasons, CRM's Income Statement is almost meaningless without a variety of asterisks, so we head to the Cash Flow Statement.On the Cash Flow Statement, stock-comp expense is added back in the ""Operations"" section. The line item is called ""Expenses related to stock-based awards."" Adding it back to ""Cash Flow"" makes sense. CRM didn't actually hand out cash, after all. But, I'm not here to talk about ""Expenses related to stock-based awards."" I'm here to talk about its niece, ""Excess tax benefits from employee stock plans,"" which is the next line item.I'll discuss the origin of ""Excess tax benefits from employee stock plans"" in a future piece. I'll also discuss how this item was rearranged by Statement 123(R) 6 or 7 years ago in a future piece. Today, we'll look at how important this relatively obscure line item has been to CRM's cash flow and, more specifically, to FY2012's ""operating cash flow growth"" (aka ""CFFO""). Why is CFFO important? Many investors focus on CFFO growth when thinking about the ""right"" PE for CRM. In fact, right near the top of its press release, CRM trumpeted ""Full Year Operating Cash Flow of $592 Million, up 29% Year-Over-Year.""CRM is a ""growth"" company. But what exactly is growing and by how much? Revenues grew 38% last quarter. Organic revenue grew 30% to 35%. Total Deferred Revenues grew 48%. CFFO (our interest) grew 45% & it grew 29% last FY. But what made CFFO grow?It turns out that one of the most improved items in CRM's CFFO from FY2011 to FY2012 was ""Expenses related to stock-based awards."" The first table shows that while ""Expenses related to stock-based awards"" nearly doubled from FY11 to FY12, the offsetting ""Excess tax benefits"" item actually cost less CFFO in FY12 than in FY11. In FY11 it lowered CRM's CFFO by $36M but in FY12 it lowered it by only $6M. This item has gone from being a 71% offset in FY09 to being only a 3% offset in FY12. CRM would have to explain why this occurred. What is key here is that CFFO, the single most critical line item in all of CRM's financial statements for many investors, has been growing due to shrinkage of an item that is far from ""operating.""To show the impact on CRM's reported Y/Y CFFO growth, the next three tables calculate the ""excess tax benefits"" item using the previous year's percentage. So, for FY12, instead of ""excess tax benefits"" being -3% of ""Expenses related to stock-based awards,"" we set it to -30%, which is the reported number for FY11. Similarly, the second table sets FY2011's ""excess tax benefits"" being -58%, which is the reported number for FY11. We then do likewise for FY10 vs FY09.There is the most important result. CRM reported FY2012 CFFO growth of 29%, but it would have reported only 15% growth if it had not been able to lower the ""Excess tax benefits from employee stock plans"" to only -3% of the total expense from -30% in FY2011.We see that FY2011 CFFO growth would have been 57% instead of the 69% reported if the ""Excess tax benefits"" had remained at -58% instead of falling to -30%. The impact is not as large as in FY2012 partly because falling from -30% to -3% is a bigger percentage plunge than is falling from -58% to -30%.Again, FY2010 CFFO growth would have been 13% instead of the 18% reported if the ""Excess tax benefits"" had remained at -71% instead of falling to -58%.Aside from the unexpected origin of so much CFFO growth, the actionable concern about this is that, at -3%, the ""Excess tax benefits"" cannot fall much further. I am not sure what strategy CRM has used to effect this change. Do they give options to different people? Do they give options using different fine print? Whatever it is, there is almost no more CFFO gain to be had. In fact, there is only $6M more gain to be had in FY2013 since this line item cost $6M of CFFO in FY2012.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The consensus estimate is 40c for EPS and $624.03M for revenue, according to First Call. The company's quarterly results have come in above estimates for the last three quarters, with double-digit year-over-year percentage revenue growth for the past four quarters. For Q4, Salesforce.com previously indicated it expects to report EPS of 39c-40c on $620M-$624M in revenue. Guidance for FY12: EPS of $1.32-$1.33 on revenue of $2.255B-$2.259B, and FY13 revenue of $2.88B-$2.92B. Nomura believes Salesforce will likely exceed current Q4 consensus revenue estimates, as well as implicit billings guidance of $918M-$922M. Recall that Salesforce’s stock dropped 20% in the 29 trading days following Q3's billings miss -- the company blamed it on shorter billings periods and not a lack of business activity in the quarter. Salesforce typically gives color on the company's off balance sheet deferred revenue on the Q4 call. This commentary is usually an approximate figure, and Nomura expects Salesforce to state that the on balance sheet plus off balance sheet deferred revenue at the end of FY12 was greater than $2B."
389731,20488,2012-02-24T00:25:16-05:00,,"Here's what I would have asked if I could get on the Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) earnings call. It is a pretty simple question, really, and the convoluted answer that  would follow would enlighten a ton of people to the absurd valuation of  this stock:“Great job on the most recent quarter gentlemen, the first cloud company with > $2B  in revenue is a real accomplishment. My question is, when and how are  you going to actually make money? Especially enough to even remotely  justify the company’s current valuation?”Pretty simple, right? Now Bennioff & Co will instantly spout off  their “non GAAP” earnings or “earnings when we exclude costs we don’t  want to count” like stock based comp expense etc and their revenues  growth. The problem is, that really doesn’t matter. I was asking about  GAAP earnings, gentlemen, you know, the ones that are cratering?Seems like a simple question but it really isn’t. Why?1- We have to expect revenue growth to slow. It has, too -- law of large numbers. Growing revenues at a $300M company 30%  means $90M a year. Doing it on a $3B company means $900M…more than a little difference. So, if revenues are going to slow, the “growing our way to profitability” meme starts to fade.2- If/when revenue growth slows, then CRM will have to raise price to make money. Except, that will be easier said than done because with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), etc making a strong push into the space, there will be decided pricing  pressure. More entrants into a business does not = higher prices.3- Costs. CRM has said repeatedly their excessive SG&A expense has been due to  the hiring and training of sales staff. It is clear that those activities  are only generating more sales, not profits. So, when growth slows,  should we expect layoffs?4- CRM  will say profits will come from cross selling different  platforms/services within their products. Well, have we seem any  evidence this is true to date? Salesforce has made a flurry of deals the last few years and we have seen just the opposite in every category from margins to profits.Let’s pretend we go back to the glory years of the FY Ending 1/31/10 and say CRM matches that year in FY ending 1/31/2013. Than means NI of $80M  on 135M shares for a whopping $.59/share 220 PE).  I got news for  people: a company that in its best year earned $80M is in NO WAY worth  the $17B CRM  is currently valued at. Oh yeah, the EPS for the last twelve months  (not counting the Q released  today) was $.02/share; …that's “two  cents” or $2.7M. That PE =6500….If I wanted to sell you my company and told you that you would make $2.7M on the investment a year but it cost $17B to buy it, would anyone in their right mind out there do it?Growing revenues while losing $$ isn’t really that impressive. If I  stood on the corner and sold $5 bills for $4, I’m pretty sure I would  sell more and more each day, grow my “revenues” while I lost more and  more money. The real trick is selling that $5 for $5.50 and making  money.Bottom line? All the deals and fast talk of revenue growth at all  costs has only caused the bottom line to materially deteriorate.Disclosure: See disclaimer."

It would simply require shorter-term leases until the new facilities were constructed.So basically what we know about this decision is that something else prompted it - not the ""unexpected"" growth, but something else altogether. Indeed, as I had written already (""Salesforce.com's Q4 Deferred Revenue Growth Not What It Seems,"" ""Salesforce.com's Big-Figure Deals Are Misleading""), several of the most hyped aspects of CRM's latest earnings report were actually artificially goosed up and didn't really represent any acceleration in growth.ConclusionEither Salesforce.com is conserving cash for other purposes, like further acquisitions, or Salesforce.com is not really comfortable with its own future and profitability.

Stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI) tend to be defended or attacked not only on their business merits, but on the premises that they HAVE TO fail or succeed. Amazon trades at a high P/E, therefore the business must fail. Sirius XM is misunderstood by the market. Netflix will be bankrupt. And Apple will fall without Steve Jobs. These are just some of the emotionally charged statements we have seen on Seeking Alpha. And Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), the subject of this article, has seen its fair share of charged statements. And the company released its fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 earnings after the markets closed on February 23. Below we provide a summary of Salesforce's financial results, as taken from the company's financial statements and press release. For the record, we hold a position in Salesforce through a mutual fund that assigns it a weighting of 2.69%. We have no direct position in the company and no plans to initiate one.Before we address the obvious issue in these results, the glaring discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings, we must address several other operational metrics, as well as guidance, for that is what will be driving the stock in post-earnings trades.As we write this article, Salesforce is up almost 10% in after hours trading. And while it is not certain where the stock will close on Friday, it is clear that the market, at least for now, liked what Salesforce delivered. Non-GAAP EPS of 43 cents beat the consensus estimate of 40 cents. Revenues beat as well, with Salesforce posting revenues of $6310.913 million, ahead of consensus estimates of $624 million. Furthermore, the company posted accelerated billings growth, a key metric. Billings are the amount the company invoices to its customers, and serve as a gauge of future sales. For the fourth quarter, Salesforce reported billings growth of 57%, an increase from the 29% growth rate in the fourth quarter.Salesforce also provided guidance for the 2013 fiscal year, as well as the first quarter. Here, the company fell short.(Click to enlarge)While revenue guidance of $673 to $678 million was ahead of expectations for $663 million, the company's EPS guidance of 33 to 34 cents a share for the first quarter was below expectations of 40 cents a share. Investors may assume that for a company as richly valued as Salesforce is, any weakness in guidance would serve as a catalyst for a steep sell-off, But that is not the case. With such companies, earnings are often not the most important result that investors focus on, and that phenomenon is at play here. On the conference call, Salesforce stated that during the quarter, it won 100 7-figure deals, and 9 8-figure deals in the quarter. The 100 7-figure deals represented growth of 300% over a year ago. These two figures lend support to Salesforce's efforts to deploy its products on an enterprise-wide level, something that the company has long considered central to its future success. As such, it appears investors are willing to overlook soft guidance.Now that we have addressed why Salesforce is rallying despite soft guidance, we can look deeper into what the guidance consists of. As always, stock-based expense is the biggest factor at play here. Technology companies as a whole tend to be much more liberal with stock-based compensation than non-tech companies. Salesforce, however, takes the practice to a whole new level. For fiscal 2013, the company expects to earn $1.58 to $1.62 per share. But it expects to pay out $2.47 per share in stock. That expense overwhelms any GAAP earnings the company has, and it forms a core thesis of the short argument for Salesforce. So how can a company post such sustained GAAP losses quarter after quarter and still trade at over $130 per share? That is something we explore below.The Folly of Being RightSalesforce shorts are entirely correct in their assumption that Salesforce should trade lower than where it is. Even when using non-GAAP EPS, the company trades at a P/E ratio of over 82 times 2013 earnings. When GAAP earnings are used, there isn't even a P/E ratio to calculate, since there is no E. Shorts seize on this point, arguing that the stock MUST fall, because it is simply too expensive to be at this level. The shorts are correct that in a rational market, Salesforce should not trade this high. But that is where the shorts make their mistake. They assume that the markets are rational, when in fact, they are anything but. Irrational markets have made investors untold billions in profits, just as they have caused untold billions in losses to others. Irrationality is how Netflix can trade at $300 in July and fall to $70 and below a few months later. (Netflix is being used here as an example, and this is not intended to be a front in the debate about Netflix). It is not enough for the shorts to be right. Part of what makes critics of Salesofrce so passionate is their deeply held belief that because they are right, Salesforce MUST fall, all while ignoring several other crucial factors, which we will be addressing shortly.It is not enough to be right in your convictions. To profit from them, others must be convinced. And that is where the issue with shorting Salesforce arises. For all the volatility in the stock (it currently has a beta of 1.41), Salesforce shares have gone almost nowhere in the past year.(Click to enlarge)With Salesforce forecasting a huge rise in GAAP loses, from a 9 cent loss in fiscal 2012 to a 53 cent loss in fiscal 2013 (using the midpoint of guidance), shouldn't the stock be in freefall? Rational logic suggests that it should. And yet, rational logic also says that for the foreseeable future, such a frefall will not occur. The reason why is deceptively simple. Salesforce will not crash from where it presently trades because the market and the media do not care about what the shorts and critics are saying.In researching this article, we did not come across a single news story or analyst quote that made any deep analysis of the company's GAAP losses, or its valuation. Bloomberg's story on Salesforce's earnings made mention of its net loss of 3 cents per share, but spoke of ""higher marketing and research spending"" as being the culprit. No mention of the company's creative accounting or enormous stock-based compensation expense was made. Nor was its valuation called into question. The very fact that analyst estimates for this quarter used non-GAAP figures highlights the fallacy of arguing to short Salesforce at this point in time. No one seems to care about using GAAP earnings figures when it comes to valuing Salesforce. Nor does anyone seem to care that its P/E ratio, as per Google Finance, currently sits at over 6,300. The fact that the market is choosing to ignore the GAAP losses at Salesforce is but one of the problems with shorting this stock.Insider Sales: An InevitabilityMost, if not all of the bearish articles discussing Salesforce on Seeking Alpha have touched on the massive insider sales that occur at this company on a regular basis. Executives sell stock and cash in options like clockwork.Many investors have an aversion to seeing insider sales, haunted by the memories of Enron executives cashing out by the millions as the company was on its march to bankruptcy. Investors and short sellers equate insider sales with there being something amiss at the company. Yet this is not necessarily true. Netlfix provides for a great case study. For years, company executives from Reed Hastings on down sold stock like clockwork. They sold no matter what the stock did. If it was going up, they sold. If it was going down, they sold. Critics of the company seized on this, arguing that something was amiss. Then came the price increase in the summer of 2011. It is important to note that Netflix shares initially rallied sharply on news of the price hike. The price hike, on its own, did not upend Netflix. The subsequent PR blunders and terrible communications the company had with its customers are what was most responsible. Netflix began their freefall when the company issued downbeat guidance, realizing too late that the price hike, and later Qwikster, was a PR disaster that was costing it customers. Bears seize on this point, arguing that greedy management cashed out ahead of ordinary shareholders. But how could Netflix management have known their moves would be received this way? However poorly Netflix executed in 2011, it is doubtful that the company's executives knew that things would play out the way they did. We may be long shares of Netflix, but we do not bring up Netflix here to defend what happened in 2011. Nor are we recommending shares of Netflix one way or another. Rather, we highlight Netflix to show that insider sales are not always indicative of a ticking time bomb in a company.Frankly speaking, it is much more worrisome to see a company with no history of large insider sells begin to report large sales of stock by company executives. That is much more indicative of trouble than consistent insider sells. Furthermore, if one is to believe that insider sales at Salesforce are due to a lack of faith in the company or ""skeletons in the closet,"" then this most recent earnings report disproves that. If company executives knew throughout the fourth quarter that it was going to be a great one, wouldn't they have waited until the earnings were released, the trading halts lifted, and then cash out at a much higher price? A rational person would wait to cash out at the highest possible share price. However, the Salesforce culture proves that constant insider sales are INEVITABLE.Salesforce issues stock like candy. Stock-based expense is a huge component of Salesforce's expenses, and it is what overwhelms the company's non-GAAP income. Critics of the company equate the constant insider sales as management having a lack of faith in the company, or with there being something wrong. But, it is crucial to remember that the executives of this company are human. They respond to incentives. And when you know that you will be issued more stock next month, next quarter, and next year, why would you ever bother holding your stock options until the very last minute? Salesfoce.com executives are not selling stock on such a consistent basis because they do not believe in the company. They are selling because they are human. Ask yourself this. If you were given stock options in Salesforce, and knew that you would be given more stock options regularly for the entire duration of your employment, would you choose to hold on to them, or cash them in as fast as possible? The desire to receive money as fast as possible is very powerful. The insider selling at Salesforce is not due to a lack of belief in the company. It is due to a flaw in the company's culture. Apple, for example, treats every stock option like it is sacred, and executives are barred from cashing in for years. Tim Cook, for example, must wait 10 years before he can realize the full value of the shares granted to him upon becoming CEO. Furthermore, insider sales are usually seen as a sign that management is not confident in the ability to create long-term value for shareholders. Insider sales have been going on at Salesforce for years, yet no one can argue that the company has not created shareholder value since its IPO in 2004. Interestingly enough, founder Marc Benioff has not sold stock since the end of 2010. If insider sales are due to some sort of skeleton in the Salesforce, the founder does not see it. (Click to enlarge)Since its IPO, Salesforce has dramatically outperformed the S&P 500, rising over 730%, as the S&P 500 rose just over 20%. This occurred even as insiders sold millions in stock. It is important to remember that at this company, insider sales are an inevitable result of the corporate culture. That is a flaw that the market has chosen to ignore, and just like with the company's consistent GAAP losses, it is something that must be recognized by a much wider audience before Salesforce can fall.Pump and Dump: A Look at Who Owns the CompanyAnother charge that we have seen surrounding Salesforce is the accusation that this stock is part of a wide-ranging pump and dump scheme where analysts and hedge funds tout the stock, all while they dump their shares on unsuspecting retail investors. Yet, a look at the shareholder base of the company reveals that such a scheme is unlikely.Fidelity is the single largest investor in Salesforce, owning over 20 million shares, or almost 15% of the company. Founder Marc Benioff owns 10 million shares, and unlike his subordinates, he has not sold stock since the end of 2010. Those 10 million shares are equal to a stake of around 7.35%. Other large shareholders include Vanguard, with a 3.81% stake, Sands Capital Management with a 6.84% stake, and Jennison Associates, with a stake of 6.08%. Both Sands and Jennison manage institutional investments for mutual funds, corporations, public funds, and endowments. They are not hedge funds who trade in and out of the stock. Together, these firms, along with founder Marc Benioff control nearly 40% of Salesforce stock. Furthermore, the rest of the other major investors in Salesforce are almost all mutual fund companies such as T.Rowe Price or BlackRock. The only investment bank on the list is Morgan Stanley, which holds a 2.8% stake in Salesforce. Frankly, we think it is a stretch to assume that these mutual fund and asset management investors are engaged in a pump and dump scheme. They are long-term holders, and unlikely to be constantly trading in and out of the stock at the expense of ordinary investors.ConclusionsWhatever accounting and valuation issues may be present at Salesforce, it is difficult to deny that the company is executing well at the operational level. Billings are growing, and revenue is as well. The cloud computing landscape may be competitive, but at least for now, Salesforce is holding its own against a variety of competitors in the market it helped create.If you are a bullish on Salesforce, this earnings report confirmed the bullish story. Billings were strong, revenue guidance was good, and the company's goal of having its products adopted and used at an enterprise-wide level is gaining traction. And if you are bearish, this earnings report has done nothing to alleviate the concerns outlined above. Salesforce is still posting GAAP losses. Insiders are still selling stock. The valuation is astronomical (or non-existent for 2013 on a GAAP basis) and the company's accounting practices are still very aggressive. However, all of these factors must be reconciled with one crucial element, and that is the point of this article. Very few people in the broad investing world care about the issues brought up time and time again on Seeking Alpha. The valuation is ignored. GAAP earnings are ignored. Insider selling is ignored. And the massive stock-based compensation is ignored. Simply put, we think it is unwise to tie up capital in shorting Salesforce until these issues are addressed in a much wider setting and gain broader acceptance. There are many more compelling investments out there, from both a short and long perspective than being short Salesforce. This article is not meant to argue for a long position in the stock. Rather, it is meant to serve as a cautionary tale to those who insist that Salesforce must fall, simply because they are correct in their assessment that the stock is overvalued. It does not matter if these critics of the company are correct. The market has shown time and time again that when it comes to Salesforce, it simply does not care about these issues. Markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent. Will Salesforce stock succumb to these factors someday? It is difficult to predict that here. We believe that rather than hoping the market will recognize the issues surrounding this company, it is simply better to move on to other trades and investments. Salesforce.com has changed the world of technology in many dramatic and permanent ways, and it has made itself indispensable to many companies by involving itself in their daily operations However, we think that at this time, this stock is one that investors need not involve themselves in.Disclosure: I am long CRM, AAPL, NFLX, AMZN. We are long shares of CRM and AMZN via a mutual fund that assigns them a weighting of 2.69% and 0.99% respectively."
391761,25047,2012-02-24T17:39:13-05:00,,"Having written an article on how Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) deferred revenues were misleading, I found that another thing is being used to promote the long side of this story. These are the 7 and 8 figure deals (as well as a singular 9-figure deal).Again, using Seeking Alpha's transcript of the call, we see these comments by CEO Marc Benioff:Now, while on deferred revenue an explanation was offered that dispelled the entire acceleration of the measure, here nobody did such a thing.It so happens, however, that he same thing that inflated deferred revenue was present here as well. Let me explain. If you go from billing on a 6 month basis, say $500k, $250k per quarter, to billing on a yearly basis, you end up billing the same $1 million to that customer, but suddenly it becomes a 7 figure transaction, even though there was nothing new about it. And obviously, some of the 7 figure transactions become 8 figures. Hence the amazing growth in the number of big figure deals.Indeed, if these deals really had something new about them, growth in revenues and deferred revenues would have to be much higher.ConclusionThis continual use of policy changes, added to the over-reliance on non-GAAP measures and the general pumping nature of the business in light of questionable GAAP performance and ongoing dilution of the shareholders constitute rather large red flags regarding Salesforce.com. Add to this an EV/EBITDA running at 150+ and it's really truly amazing that this stock continues to float in the clouds.Disclosure: I am short CRM."
320527,24324,2012-01-19T07:20:56-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is a truly innovative company, with rapid sales growth, nonetheless the valuation and recent price declines makes it a tempting short (as many are currently doing given the level of short interest in the stock) and I wrote this article expecting to justify a short position, but to date there are no concrete signs of a revenue slowdown. The main concern is that acquisitions are becoming the key source of growth and eating into cash flow. I conclude that Salesforce appears relatively fairly valued and it is hard to make the case for either investing in or shorting the company at this point. There may be better upside elsewhere, but I see no catalyst for a short position.ValuationSalesforce's valuation requires high growth expectations:Of course, a high valuation is not bad per se. It just requires high growth to sustain it. Given that Salesforce's earnings are negative, using cash flow-capex as a proxy for earnings gives 37x or 6.1x sales.Companies at similar price/earnings ratios:Therefore, at the current valuation, Salesforce requires in the region of 12-17% annual growth to justify its multiple. For comparison the equivalent 5 year revenue growth rate for CRM is 40%, which is encouraging and the most recent quarter was 37%, so to date the growth has been maintained. If anything Salesforce looks cheap relative to peers on this basis.Acquisitions are eating free cashflowSalesforce is making an increasing number of acquisitions - nothing major in 2009, then Jigsaw, Heroku and DimDim in 2010 and Manymoon, Radian6 and Assistly in 2011. If free cash flow is $376M on an annual basis, then these acquisitions are at best cancelling that out and neither growth rate nor margins are increasing as a result. This is a concern.Generous stock compensationSalesforce pays significant stock compensation and this has caused shares outstanding to grow 2-6% each year, diluting equity investors.Potentially worrying signsConclusionThere are concerns with Salesforce such as the lack of operational leverage and acquisitions canceling out free cash flow for the past 2 years, but the business continues to show strong revenue growth and innovation. Until that changes I see no reason to short Salesforce, which if anything appears cheap relative to similar stocks given its very high growth rate, there are some potential clouds on the horizon, but without tangible signs of a revenue slowdown, a short position cannot be justified, especially given the relatively high short interest making it one of the most expensive stocks to short. Equally, with various companies showing meaningful upside e.g I recently made the case for buying Dell (NYSE:DELL), I would not rush to own Salesforce at this point. The moment of truth will be Q4 reporting in late February (exact date not announced).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Despite the recent strength, Salesforce.com shares failed to push through the October/November highs and are struggling to hold a key technical level near the 200-Day Moving Average at $128.Outliers and Strategy Key measures covered by Selerity:Given Salesforce.com's valuation and recent advance in the share price, a weak number or below consensus results on any of the aforementioned metrics may be seen as a disappointment.One of the major knocks against Salesforce.com is its lofty valuation at more than 80x forward earnings and 34x cash flow. These metrics are fairly rich, even with a 27% projected five-year earnings growth rate and gross margins near 80%.Recent News2/16: Goldman Sachs reiterated a Buy rating and a $150 price target on Salesforce.com ahead of the company's 4Q earnings release, according to a post on StreetInsider.com. The firm also sees Non-GAAP EPS and revenues at the high end of the range.02/14: Jefferies raised its price target on Salesforce.com from $144 to $152 ahead of its 4Q earnings release, according to a post on StreetInsider.com. The firm cited strong deal activity and an increase in enterprise customers.01/19: According to Benzinga.com, Morgan Stanley reiterated an Overweight on Salesforce.com following a meeting with CFO Graham Smith.

The firm noted that growth is slowing for Salesforce.com, which is becoming more dependent on acquisitions to expand.Technical ReviewSalesforce.com shares are up more than 25% YTD, recently re-taking the 200-day SMA for the first time since mid-November. The upward sloping 20-Day SMA and extended MACD are testament to the positive momentum over the past two months.

390551,25047,2012-02-24T10:13:35-05:00,,"There are a few hidden details in Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) Q4 earnings release that should give pause to the general happiness that the stock displayed on the after hours session and is displaying today.After Salesforce.com 's Q3 earnings release, the stock was punished because of the deceleration deferred revenue slowed, growing at 32% year-over-year.So naturally, yesterday when Salesforce.com reported a sizzling 48% growth in deferred revenues, the stock could do nothing but punish the short sellers. This is the paragraph that matters the most:This seems like a nice acceleration, the kind of thing you want to see on your high-multiple growth stock. Until, that is, you dig a little.Deferred revenue results from CRM invoicing and billing for periods of service that exceed the quarter in which it recognizes the revenue in its P&L. So if for instance CRM bills $100 million for two quarters of service, it would then recognize $50 million in revenues, and stick the other $50 million into the balance sheet as deferred revenue. What this means, is that if CRM decides to bill for longer periods of service, it can then increase deferred revenue faster even if the business really isn't growing faster.For instance, if that $100 million customer used to get two invoices per year (for $200 million) and now gets just one invoice per year (for $200 million), CRM would then recognize the same $50 million in revenues for the quarter, but it would book $150 million in deferred revenue on its balance sheet, even though the business really hadn't changed much.And that was precisely what happened. CRM already gives a hint in the earnings report, but it becomes a whole lot more clear thanks to Seeking Alpha's very useful conference call transcript, where Graham V. Smith discussed this matter (emphasis is mine):So all the acceleration in deferred revenue came from longer invoicing and a large multi-year invoice, and in truth, it actually decelerated. And worse still, the large multi-year invoice came at the end of the quarter and was significant enough to push DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) to 100 from 86.ConclusionUpon realizing what I just wrote, I went short CRM in pre-market trading. CRM's valuation challenges are well-known, and it seems to me that the one thing pushing the stock up was the outstanding deferred revenue growth, which as we can now see, was mostly artificial and meaningless.Disclosure: I am short CRM."
345631,24714,2012-02-07T04:15:25-05:00,,"People have speculated that Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has been a bubble for some time now. With the stock dropping below $100 in December, many thought that the end of Salesforce.com's joy ride was near. However, the stock has rebounded over the past month and closed at $123.23 on February 6th. With earnings coming up at the end of the month, I will show how Salesforce.com may be ready for its bubble to burst very soon.Salesforce.com's expected earnings can in no way justify its stock price. Its earnings in the next year are expected to be an adjusted $1.63 per share and probably around $0.50 per share after executive compensation, which Salesforce.com does not include in its earnings reports. With so many competitors trying to encroach on the cloud space including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS), I don't believe that Salesforce.com will ever have the earnings to justify a price over $120.Salesforce.com has been able to maintain such a high price off of high institutional ownership (96%) and a shortage of stocks that are fully invested in the cloud. The top six institutional shareholders (FMR, Sands Capital Management, Jennison Associates, Vanguard, State Street, and Baillie Gifford) own about 37% of outstanding shares and the CEO, Mark Beinoff, has owned as much as 10 million shares, and tends to sell off shares in mass quantities. The market has had relatively little access to the stock, and this has been keeping prices artificially high.Click to enlarge:The last point that I want to make is how Saleforce.com's recent performance has mirrored the stages of a bubble over the past 5 years. In late 2008, the stock took a dip with the rest of the market, signifying the ""First Sell Off"". Its spike to ""New Paradigm"" occurred from early 2009 to July of 2011 when the stock eclipsed $150. Its ""Denial"" stage happened after its last earnings report dropped the stock below $100 and its bullish activity over the last month signifies its ""Return to Normal"". What's next according to the chart is the big drop. With earnings coming at the end of the month, it may be smart to short Salesforce.com as a bad earnings report may be what triggers its fall to around $50. Just be sure to cover before it rebounds again.Disclosure: I am long IBM."
370071,25174,2012-02-15T18:57:33-05:00,,"Saleforce (NYSE:CRM) reports earnings on Thursday, February 23, 2012, after the market close. In one of my previous articles I presented 5 ways to play Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) earnings. I closed the trade for 15% gain. Some of the readers did even better, making 25-30% on the trade. This article will describe similar strategies for Saleforce, with the stock currently trading around 131.60. I will be using the weekly options which start trading on Thursday.Trade #1: Buying a straddle and selling after the announcementThe following table summarizes the return of the ATM straddle purchased at the close of the earnings date (before the announcement) and sold at the close of the day following the earnings report.For those less familiar with options, a straddle is buying the At-The-Money (ATM) call and the ATM put with the same expiration.As we can see, this trade would return on average 30.72% gain, but the results are impacted by two large moves in November and August 2010 cycles. Remove those two cycles - and the return goes down to 9% loss.I performed a similar analysis for few other stocks. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) one day straddle produced an average loss of 28%. Playing Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) the same way would produce an average loss of 17.99%. Baidu would produce an average loss of 14.36%. Seems like Apple, Baidu and Amazon options are overpriced (on average) before earnings. I believe that this is the case for most stocks. Options simply tend to overestimate the potential risk.Of course there are always exceptions. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) straddles would actually produce very impressive gains on average, but in some cycles they would still lose 50-60%. (You can see the full analysis here and here.) For CRM, it still seems like a risky trade. The stock post-earnings performance is not consistent. If you think that the stock will move more than 7-8% this time, this might be a good choice.Trade #2: Buying a Reverse Iron Condor and selling after the announcementA Reverse Iron Condor involves buying an Out-of-The-Money (OTM) strangle and selling a further OTM strangle. With the stock trading around $132.60, you can execute the following trade:The maximum gain is realized if the stock closes below $125 or above $140 the day after the announcement. That's 5.5% move. Since the stock moved less than 5.5% few times, this seems like a very risky trade. It might be a good idea to tighten the strikes (essentially turning the trade into a butterfly), but the trade will still require about 4% move.The next three trades are volatility plays. The idea is to take advantage of the rising IV (Implied Volatility) of the options before the earnings. I described the general concept here. The trade would be purchased a few days before earnings and sold just before earnings are announced (or as soon as the trade produces a sufficient profit).Trade #3: Buying a strangle and selling before the announcementThis is very aggressive and risky play. The negative theta will be high and it will accelerate as we get closer to expiration. We need a big jump in IV and/or a big stock movement to offset the theta. If it doesn't happen, the trade could easily lose 25-30%. However, if the stock makes a decent move, the gains can be substantial. This trade is about high risk and high reward.Trade #4: Buying a straddle and selling before the announcementOr:Since the stock is between the strikes now, you might want to wait till it moves close to one of the strikes in order to be delta neutral. The negative theta will also be fairly large. This trade is slightly less aggressive than the previous one, but we still need a big jump in IV and/or a big stock movement to offset the theta.Trade #5: Buying a Reverse Iron Condor and selling before the announcementThis is actually my favorite trade, and the one I will be placing for my personal account. It will still benefit from IV increase and/or the stock movement, but the risk is lower due to smaller negative theta. Since the earnings are very close to expiration, I'm planning to place the trade just few days before the earnings date to reduce the theta exposure.The main and only risk of those trades is the negative theta (time decay). The expectation is that an increase in IV will offset the theta, but it doesn't always happen. If the stock moves, it will help. In any case, you can control your loss since theta damage is gradual. In general, it is very unusual to lose more than 10-15% on those trades, except for the most aggressive ones.Good luck. The prices might be different when you place the trade, so adjust the strikes accordingly. If you decide to place those trades, please make sure you understand what you are doing.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned.

320166,23762,2012-01-18T02:33:15-05:00,,"I want to take a moment to revisit the short case for previous Cramer favorite Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) that I published in November. The stock is down some 10% since that article, going smartly against a market that has risen since then. I believe the tailwinds for this stock have increased and 2012 will be the year it goes the way of previous Cramer favorites like OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (NASDAQ:GMCR) and ends up being cut in half from its highs this summer by the time 2012 is over.Negative Events since November for Salesforce:1. Sanford Bernstein put an ""Underperform"" on Salesforce citing slowing growth and company's increasing reliance on acquisitions for increasing sales instead of organic growth.2. The stock's chart is broken and CRM is trading substantially below its 200 day moving average (See Chart).3. Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) last quarterly report provided evidence of a significant slowdown on IT spending by corporations. In addition, Marc Faber used this spending slowdown to advocate shorting both IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Salesforce in the latest Barron's Roundtable edition.Key value observations on CRM:Disclosure: I am long MSFT, ORCL.Additional disclosure: Also short CRM through option strategy."
311949,20488,2011-12-05T17:02:24-05:00,,"The SAP deal for SuccessFactors (NYSE:SFSF) for $3.4B has sparked a frenzy in “cloud” shares today with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) up 6%. Let’s put aside CRM has a $17B market cap and is losing money this year and will again next year. Let’s also ignore that a host of competitors are now entering the market full bore Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP, AT&T (NYSE:T) will depress margins and add costs for CRM futher dampening profit potential. If you do not believe me, CRM admits this is its last 10Q (read it here).Let’s instead look at what happens in someone makes a bid for CRM:So, what does it all mean? Essentially all outstanding stock awards vest immediately and become payable in either cash OR an equal dollar amount of the acquirer's stock. Either way, it is an additional cost. Let’s take a stab at figuring what that would be.This as of Oct 31st - (click to enlarge):We have ~13.5M options/RSU’s outstanding and another 20M just waiting to get thrown out there. Only those already issued (or announced to be issued) would vest.That means an acquirer would see an additional $1.7B in cost added to the transaction assuming they purchased CRM for today’s price. If it paid a 20% premium for the company, that costs rises to $2.1B.We would also have to add the 575K shares the company announced for execs for 2012 recently adding another $88M to the tally.Now, all this excludes cash bonuses that would have to be paid out ($3.5M just to the folks listed in the above linked 8k.Now we have to ask who? ORCL? Why would they when it spent millions developing its own version and has already made acquisitions in the field? SAP? I think the above deal tells us where it is at. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)? If it is going after Yahoo (YHOO) one has to discount it as a contender. I just don’t see a scenario in which one of the few contenders ponies up ~$22B (figure 20% premium to today’s price) for a company with negative operating earnings. Think about it. MSFT is being lambasted in the media for toying with making an offer for YHOO. This is a YHOO that will at least have ~$750M in operating income TTM. For that $750M in operating it is rumored to be paying ~$25B. Is it really then going to turn around and pay another ~$22B or so for a company that is losing money?Again, just because it doesn’t make sense doesn’t mean it won’t happen. I jot this down simply to take a closer look at the possibility. Paying $3.4B for a SuccessFactors is a hell of a lot different from paying $22B for CRM. That price tag dramatically shrinks the possible field and has to beg the question, “why would those who could buy it want to buy it?” Especially at that price. Everyone of the possible candidates has spent or is spending millions developing its own cloud products. Now, shrink that price tag 50% and you may have suitors lining up, but until then, I doubt it."
311311,20488,2011-12-01T13:54:06-05:00,,"I’m not going to rehash much of what I have already said regarding deferred commissions and amortized software expense accounting. In my opinion it is overly aggressive and hides the true current financials of the company. Nor will I talk about the $500M .75% convertible bond deal that will have the company eventually paying loan shark like rates upon conversion (barring a collapse to $85 in the stock price). Do a search on the blog for CRM and those posts will come up.Let’s get right to the stock based comp. Here is the applicable section from the last four 10Qs filed.November 2010:April 10Q pg 18July 10Q pg 17Current 10Q pg 18:Notice the trend?? In every 10Q the company’s estimates of future stock expense is rising over the previous 10Q’s estimate for 2012/13/14. It isn’t due to additional restricted shares vesting as the company now is well aware of the vesting schedule for the next several years. What could possibly have happened that the company, in estimating FY 2013 stock expense (FY ends 1/31) that their initial $64M projection in Nov 2010 ballooned to a now $208M and sure to go higher? It has nothing to do with the share price as CRM’s stock today is priced virtually where is was in Nov. 2010.It is the number of share being exercised. We have seen this the last few days as insider are rushing to cash out options 3 and 4 years ahead of expiration. Actually, insiders have been selling non stop for years but it has accelerated this year. Normally this is done through 10b5-1 trading plans (pre planned sales) so as to avoid “insider trading” charges (selling/buying before bad/good news etc.). In fact, if you look at may of the $CRM insider sales, they are done through these plans. But, these plans can be altered by participants during certain periods. While the details of these insider plans are not public, I think we can assume that the massive underestimation of stock expense just a year ago can be traced to the current wave of insider selling.If a company knows the insiders 10b5-1 plans today for 2013 they can estimate the stock expense for the next year. If, during one of the eligible periods to alter the plans insiders decide to accelerate both the exercising of their options and the selling of those shares, the earlier estimates will be way off. Now, there is nothing illegal or immoral about any of this. I think it goes more to illustrate what even insiders at the company are thinking about the stock price next year or the year after. Why would they cash in today an option that does not expire for 3 years if you think the stock will be higher in 3 years? Unless you think it wont…..Now, again, if this is one insider doing it, that is something to ignore (maybe they are buying a home etc.) but when they all are and are consistently …….it is time to take notice.Here is another thing. Why does CRM hold ~$130M of CMOs and mortgage backed securities? Are they a hedge fund or a software company? Are they chasing yield to make up for operating losses?Now, there is no detail on what these are other than to say that 27% of them are current being held with “unrealized losses” of $770k and that the company believes they are temporary.For the full quarter, the company saw loses of almost $5M on its marketable securities holdings:Now, again, noting illegal or wrong with any of this. I’m just not sure if I was a shareholder in a company hell bent on growth I’d want them playing hedge fund in the CMO market. A bad move there (some people have been rumored to make them in the mortgage market the past few years) might disrupt those growth plans.Also:Yesterday the CFO was downplaying the “deferred revenue” metric analysts have been using the gauge the company’s future growth. From the 10Q pg. 36:Seems reasonable, right? The only problem comes into play when you look at the following chart (10Q pg 36):The problem with focusing on Q4 and saying that it is seasonably the best quarter ignores what just happened in Q3. Q3 was the first quarter since FY 2010 that both accounts receivable and deferred revenue decrease sequentially. In fact it was the decrease in AR for me that was the most stunning as CRM went from quarterly 10%-20% sequential quarterly jumps in AR to a near 10% decline. That is a cause for alarm and is especially so when you combine that with the first sequential quarterly decline in deferred revenues since October 2009 (at least in that quarter AR rose 14%). If you are a company focusing people’s attention on your revenue growth, not a silly little thing like profits, when two growth metrics slow, people absolutely must be alarmed."
314874,20488,2011-12-19T17:49:14-05:00,,"This is a follow up to last week's post on Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) very aggressive year-end pricing.It appears that not only is the pricing very dramatic on a year-end level, but that those prices cuts will continue into the future. This has some rather large implications. Not only is CRM saying that it is offering customers up to 40% discounts to sign up “before year end” (CRM’s FYI 1/31/12) but it is also guaranteeing those low rates on future renewals and for additional users.Here is the e-mail (click image to enlarge):This leads to a couple of implications:Typically your “new buyer” discounts are one-off events. The discount is for the number of users you have for a defined time period, and then your pricing reverts to regular rates (or it is supposed to, and some middle ground is agreed to upon renewal). What CRM is doing here is not only guaranteeing that lower rate now, but into the future and for additional users. It is a bit like your local auto dealer leasing you a car, then telling you when the lease expires you can have the exact same lease on another one and if anyone else in you family ever wants to lease they are guaranteed the same rate also. It would never happen.If you are going to lower your rates up to 40% and keep those rates lower into the future, then isn’t that just a de facto permanent price reduction of your product? What is the next step? Current customers, seeing the large pricing discrepancy between what they are paying and what you are offering new people, start calling and demanding that pricing.While you may resist at first, they will remind you they are now taking calls from sales folk from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) all of which now have competing products. If they do not get the price reduction they want, more likely than not they will receive some other value (free support, etc). Either scenario means lower revenue per account and/or higher costs associated with a stagnant per-user revenue stream.One thing is for sure, I think it is safe to say price increases are not in the future for CRM users."
314096,20488,2011-12-15T10:43:07-05:00,,"For me, it was a foregone conclusion, but this email from the Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) sales staff seems like a group that's a bit desperate to get any business, any way to make a number.Here is the email with names/numbers redacted (click to enlarge):“Aggressive incentives”. Now, we already know that CRM is not profitable. Even on a pure operational basis they aren’t. Notice the word usage, “driving for what we hope will be a record breaking year”. Now guidance given by the company for Q4 and FY’12 is in fact record breaking (in terms of sales, in terms of profits, it is dismal). So offering “aggressive incentives” to reach that goal means things are slowing way down for them. My guess can be the Europe business is falling off the table in Q4 as one would expect.Think about it. The auto industry is seeing strong demand and the value of incentives to customers is falling because it isn’t needed, the business is there. The only time to get really aggressive with incentives (really called “price cutting”) is when you aren’t making your numbers and need to do anything to get some business in the door. The other scenario is that the cloud competition, now including little boutique shops you may have heard of like ORCL, MSFT and IBM, is also being aggressive with pricing and are taking business. The real problem for CRM here is that the other three have other businesses that will easily support a “cloud price war” to gain market share, CRM does not. In this respect, a price war in the space will seriously negatively affect CRM business results.Now, will it work? I don’t know and they still have 6 weeks to go before the end of the quarter but I think this email shows some panic is starting to set in with the sales staff. Whether they make sales goals or not, it seems as though margins are going to take a hit, which means larger losses."
314254,22762,2011-12-15T19:33:07-05:00,,"By Leena RaoSalesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has just announced the acquisition of social performance platform Rypple. Financial terms of the deal, which is expected to close early next year, were not disclosed.Rypple, which has raised $13 million in funding, is a web-based  social performance management platform that helps managers and employees  improve performance. Essentially, Rypple replaces the traditional  performance review with a more social and collaborative approach. The  software has been compared to a “Zynga for the enterprise,” and allows  managers to track projects, guide their team and give kudos to deserving  staff for others to see within its online application.The software employs various game mechanics, like badges, which can  be custom-built to reflect a company’s own values. And employees can  rack up “skills earned,” in a method reminiscent of building up a  character in a virtual world or MMORPG, for example.Rypple also recently launched  a new mobile application that allows managers to give real-time  feedback to staff, provide coaching, track goals and publicly recognize  colleagues. Founded in 2008, Rypple counts Facebook, Gilt Groupe and  Spotify as users.Salesforce says the acquisition represents its entry into  the ‘human capital management’ market for the social enterprise.  Salesforce.com plans to re-launch Rypple as “Successforce” and create a  new human capital management business unit. The new HCM business unit,  including Successforce, will be led by John Wookey, Salesforce.com’s  executive vice president of advanced applications and a former SAP (NYSE:SAP) and  Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) alum.Salesforce will also add Rypple to its existing products as well. For  example, people will be able to thank colleagues, win badges and  provide recognition from within Salesforce Chatter.While human capital management is not necessarily a natural product  extension of a CRM business, it’s not a surprising move for Salesforce,  which has been aggressively pursuing a social enterprise strategy of  late. Human capital management is a huge market for many of the large  companies that Salesforce already counts as customers, so from a product  and revenue standpoint, “Successforce” could be a hit.Original post"
308973,23762,2011-11-18T14:26:44-05:00,,"I recently ran an article that detailed some of the successful shorts I have had in the last six months with some of Cramer’s favorite stocks. One of my few “Cramer” shorts that has not panned out as of yet is Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). However, it finally reported a quarter that even its charismatic CEO Marc Benioff could not even put his magical spin on. It is down almost 10% today after earnings. One thing I have noticed about my successful shorts is that there is usually one big down day on disappointing news before for the bottom falls out of the stock over the next few months. Is this “that day” for Salesforce?Let’s take a look at the charts of previous “Cramer” shorts of Open Table (NASDAQ:OPEN), Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (NASDAQ:GMCR) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).(Click charts to expand)OPEN first took its initial large drop in early May as its CEO stepped down. It has been all downhill from there (See Chart above).Green Mountain Coffee Roasters first had a hard leg down in late September as David Einhorn and others started to question some of its aggressive accounting practices and huge valuation. Even with a recent bounce, it is down more than 50% from its recent highs. (See Chart above).Netflix fell out of bed with a self-inflicted wound in early September with its pricing changes and proposed split of its streaming and DVD services. It has been crushed since then as the last earnings reports show substantial defections among its customers (See Chart above).So is the poor reaction to Salesforce’s recent earnings report the start of a similar large sell-off?Salesforce – Salesforce.com, inc. provides customer and collaboration relationship management “CRM” services to various businesses and industries worldwide.

308993,24046,2011-11-18T15:26:26-05:00,,"Going into Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) earnings I didn't really understand what was going through the heads of most sell-side analysts. We have a crisis in Europe, bank stocks falling apart again, China slowing down, all kinds of ridiculously embarrassing sell side blow ups like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Youku (NYSE:YOKU), Renren (NYSE:RENN), Green Mountain (NASDAQ:GMCR), Rambus (NASDAQ:RMBS), MF Global (OTC:MFGLQ), OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN), and Sino Forest (OTC:SNOFF) over the past several months still fresh in investors' minds, and yet its full steam ahead. ""Iceberg captain ... should we slow down?""In the three days before earnings, we got three very bullish notes out Citi, Piper, and Jeffries. The analysts were excited about the service cloud, chatter, customer surveys, and signs of large deal activity. All this translated into buy ratings and price target increases for a company trading at 100x non-gaap earnings. And not just any non-gaap earnings, the non-gaap earnings of maybe the most prolific stock based compensation printing press the equity markets have ever seen. This made no sense to me. Why bother getting more bullish when all you have to say is that CRM has a cool product that people like and are using more. Do I need 10 research reports to understand that CRM is now a beast in CRM? What I expect out of these analysts is an explanation of why they think this company will become immensely profitable enough, and I mean IMMENSELY, to justify the risk of buying shares at this valuation. Of course, that doesn't seem to be in the job description these days. Truth be told, I actually really thought about writing a CRM piece ahead of earnings. Once I started reading all the NFLX and GMCR comparisons being made online I was inclined to chime in, but I decided to pass even though I didn't really agree with what I was reading from the short side. To me CRM is no OpenTable, NFLX or GMCR. The company is not facing some sort of major business model challenge in the months ahead, and I don't think its position in its industry is under immediate threat. On the contrary, the model is working and the company is growing its customer base. However, that's no longer what I look at when I analyze this stock. My problem with CRM is the model is not designed to make much money or to be more precise the type of money that would make it a rewarding investment at these levels. Beinoff continues to offer investors very little while he offers his customers and employees a lot. Why would I invest my money in the stock of a company whose CEO really doesn't seem to care too much about me? It's a very imbalanced relationship, and one that is not long-term sustainable. Yet when he appeared on CNBC yesterday, for a total of 9 minutes, Jim Cramer couldn't ask him one single question about when the stock issuances and marketing spending would slow. Or even better, what cost structure does he think is manageable for Salesforce to target over the next five years. (is it not time for some answers or is a job at CRM now the holy grail in corporate America) Instead, he asked him about the sequential slowdown in deferred revenue(which btw I think is just absolutely humiliating news for anyone who upgraded this in the days ahead as this was the one thing you needed to be certain of as a cockeyed bull screaming buy two days before earnings) which Beinoff skirted with an amazing just focus on our guidance and everything will be fine response. Really, just blindly trust the greatest promoter/salesman CEO in history, that's what we are supposed to do? Beinoff is such an amazing promoter that I can assure you that he believes everything he says, and when the time to cut guidance arrives he will be even more shocked then the sell-side and thus entirely unaccountable, but that won't stop his stock sales. Trust you Marc, isn't that what Reed Hastings was saying six months ago? But I guess Marc Beinoff's word is enough for the analysts. Even after this report, Deutsche Bank maintained a Buy rating and raised its target to $205 from $200. Yep, you basically have about 100% upside from here according to DB if you buy CRM. That means in their world this company is fairly valued at 170x NON-GAAP earnings. As a reminder, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) once traded at 150x GAAP earnings and it still lost 80% of its market value despite growing earnings at close to 20% per annum for a decade. What about that Iceberg? Who cares captain, if we hit one we are all dead.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
314432,22762,2011-12-16T15:42:58-05:00,,"By Leena RaoYesterday, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) announced the acquisition of social performance platform Rypple,  and revealed that it will be entering the human capital management  (a.k.a. employee and talent management software) market with the launch  of a new product Successforce. For Salesforce, the announcement of a new  product vertical and the entry into a new market is a big deal. And  when you consider SAP’s recent $3.4 billion acquisition of talent management software giant SuccessFactors, things start to get interesting. We sat down with Salesforce EVP John Wookey, who will be leading Successforce and is a former SAP and Oracle alum; as well as Daniel Debow, co-CEO and co-founder of Rypple; to discuss what the acquisition means for Salesforce. For background, Rypple is a social performance management platform  that helps managers and employees improve performance. Essentially,  Rypple replaces the traditional performance review with a more social  and collaborative approach. The software has been compared with a “Zynga  (ZYNG) for the enterprise,” and allows managers to track projects, guide their  team and give kudos to deserving staff for others to see within its  online application. Rypple also employs various game mechanics, like badges, which can be  custom-built to reflect a company’s own values. And employees can rack  up “skills earned,” in a method reminiscent of building up a character  in a virtual world or MMORPG, for example. The company’s software is  used by Facebook, Spotify, Gilt Groupe and others. Wookey explains that the entry in the human capital management software market, which he says is a $6 billion  yearly market opportunity, fits in with Salesforce’s overall goal of  making the enterprise more social “There’s been a focus on the social  enterprise but this also needs to work within the organization  internally, and this has to has to begin with a company’s people and  talent,” he explains. “It’s not just about human capital management,  it’s about how to use concept of social enterprise to effectively manage  people. This is the next step in enabling the social enterprise.” As we explained above, Rypple has been pushing the envelope when it  comes to bringing social actions into the talent management space. Debow  tells us that the world of work has changed but the process used to  manage people has not changed at all, and dismisses SuccessFactors as  being part of the old guard of talent software that basically automates  forms of business but not behaviors. “Rypple amplifies behaviors that drive real performance,” Debow says.  When it comes to coaching, goal setting, evaluations, and more, we are  helping drive performance by actually replicating many of the social  actions people take in their lives.” He uses an example of working with  Spotify recently to help with goal setting. With a new ‘social goals  2.0,’ product, Rypple helped Spotify work with employees to evaluate how  to use objectives and results to drive the business forward. Users  could create objectives and goals for Spotify, invite people to comment,  and commit to an objective, Debow explains. “The fact is that we built the product with some of the more social organizations on the planet, including Facebook,” he says. Wookey says that as Salesforce was evaluating its entry into human  capital management, the company did look at the potential competitors  and saw that there is a lot of software that people aren’t happy with,  and decided that the social approach is going to grow the market.  “There’s a natural synergy between social actions and how you  effectively align awards, learning systems, help employee career paths  and support individual talent,” he adds. While Salesforce still needs to launch Successforce and integrate  Rypple fully, the company already has plans for integrations into  existing Salesforce products like Chatter, the Sales Cloud and more.  Debow says that integrations will include the ability to work with  Chatter, CRM and other products to track completion rates or work and  record this into Successforce. Salesforce probably didn’t drop as much cash as it did with Radian6′s $326 million acquisition,  but that doesn’t mean it’s not putting massive amounts of resources  into making the acquisition a new business for the CRM giant. After  talking to both Wookey and Debow, it’s clear that Salesforce has major  ambitions for social human capital management as a new product and  revenue line (Wookey is optimistic on the revenue front). But if Wookey’s estimates of a $6 billion human capital management  market are right, this could end up being a significant new source of  growth for Salesforce.

309338,24802,2011-11-21T13:37:55-05:00,,"Often the stock market presents investors with stocks that are difficult to figure out. Not all companies can be as straightforward as P&G (NYSE:PG) or UPS (NYSE:UPS). Often, it takes a good deal of research to figure out what a stock is worth, and where it is going.On November 3, we profiled Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), and reccommended that readers simply avoid the stock altogether. But now that Salesforce has reported its fiscal 2012 third quarter results, we felt it was appropriate to follow up on the stock and determine what to do with it from here on out.On November 17, the company posted a GAAP loss of 3 cents/share, and a non-GAAP profit of 34 cents/share. CEO Marc Benioff stated that the company expects to reach a $3 billion revenue run rate in 2013, becoming the first enterprise cloud computing company to do so. The company beat on EPS by 3 cents, and beat on revenue by $13 million, yet the stock was slammed, falling by over 10% on the back of deferred revenues that declined 2% from the prior quarter.Lowered deferred revenues seem to stand in contrast with the record deals the company signed this quarter. On the conference call, CEO Marc Benioff noted that ""for the Sales Cloud, we signed Maersk (OTCPK:AMKAF), one of the world's largest shipping companies in the world based in Europe. And they swapped out Oracle and selected Salesforce to their entire global sales team. We also won deals against Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) with Bayer (OTCPK:BAYZF), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Telstra (OTCPK:TLSYY), Fuji Xerox (NYSE:XRX), Japan Post, Unisys (NYSE:UIS), PTC Parametric (PMTC) and Diebold Securities (OTCPK:DBD), all strong wins against Oracle. But in Q3, we also won against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), closing major deals with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), AXA (OTCQX:AXAHF), CenturyLink (CTL), American Teleconferencing Services, Gates Corp., Banca Civica, Orion, Vbimps [ph] M&G and Tripwire. Other newer add-on transactions for the Sales Cloud from the third quarter included Adobe, Avaya, Sompo and Kaspersky Labs."" Growth was strong across all geographic regions. Revenues in the U.S. grew by 36%, 36% in Europe, and 39% in Asia. Japan also showed a strong recovery. So where did the weakness in the stock come from?Simply put, the numbers did not appear to impress enough investors. New subscription billings growth increased only 12% over the prior year, and the company's deferred revenues appeared to be soft. This was brought up many times on the conference call, especially by John DiFucci of JPMorgan. He brought up a number of valid points, noting that even though off balance sheet revenue grew faster than deferred revenue, accounts receivable actually declined, which are a good indicator of deals signed at the end of the quarter. Furthermore, he pointedly asked whether or not these weak numbers indicated a problem with end-market demand, which Salesforce has long been immune from. Do these numbers mean the economy is finally starting to affect the company?We do not think so. Salesforce.com's end businesses are as strong as ever, and the shortfall in deferred revenues can be explained. CFO Graham Smith explained that the company does not recognize revenue upfront from Heroku and Radian6, since they bill on a monthly basis. The company decreases days sales outstanding from 55 days to 49 and worked to deliver strong operating cash flow. CEO Marc Benioff also chimed in, stating that ""we don't traditionally manage metrics associated with deferred revenue like invoice timing or invoice duration. Those are not things that we are in there trying to dial up with customers ... we broke through more than 100,000 core customers in the last quarter, what we really saw was we continue to see very, very strong revenue growth, and we are doing a good job of predicting how our business is performing, and we're going to be able to continue to do that. But we have to be a little bit cautious regards to -- this concept of quarter end deferred is still absolutely -- it's a function of invoicing, and it's also influenced by other factors that Graham has mentioned, including things like invoice timing, invoice duration, new business linearity within the quarter, annual seasonality, these acquisitions, compounding effects of renewals. And those are things that we as a -- certainly, I could speak in terms of the sales organization. We're focused on beating the competition and signing deals. And in terms of those specific metrics, that's not where our eyes are. And so you can see variations in deferred revenue over time, which is why at Dreamforce, Graham called that out in the Analyst Day, and he basically said to be aware of those types of fluctuations in the future."" To us, the deferred revenue trends seen here are quarterly fluctuations that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals of the business. It is interesting to not that in his post-earnings review of the company, John DiFucci placed a $115 price target on the company, which is actually above the current market price. If the bearish DiFucci values Salesforce higher than the market, where do bullish analysts see the stock going?The analyst bulls on Salesforce did not change their views on the company after the earnings release and conference call. Jefferies placed a $156 target on the stock and kept its buy rating, noting that ""CRM disappointed by missing F3Q12 Street billings expectations for the first time in 10 quarters. Management said that they exceeded their own new business expectations in the Q and implied F4Q12 billings would re-accelerate. Also, FY13 rev growth was above prior Street ests (adj. for assumed Model Metrics contribution)"" Management said that growth would re-accelerrate in the fourth quarter back to a range of 32-33%. Goldman Sachs also remained bullish, keeping a buy rating at $150 price target on the stock. In its report, the firm noted that cash flow of $129 million easily beat the consensus estimate of $109 million. Putting a damper on things, S&P and Credit Suisse both lowered the price targets from $145 an $140 respectively, to $135. S&P is concerned that revenue growth is slowing, and Credit Suisse is concerned about the impact of continued investment on margins, but the firm is impressed with the continued traction of the company's products as well as its cash flows. However, Deutsche Bank counters with a bullish stance. The firm is very impressed, saying that ""In our opinion, despite the optics of billings, business momentum continued and actual bookings grew faster than revenue's 36%. As a result, we are reiterating our Buy rating and raising PT for $205.” The firm agrees with management that the lapse in deferred revenue does not reflect fundamental weakness at the company and is confident in Salesforce's future prospects. Overall, analysts are bullish, and their blended price targets leave a fair amount of upside to the stock. Of these 5 firms, the average price target is $156.02, representing upside of over 37%. The Reuters average price target is just below that, at $154.06. But is the analyst community correct here? And perhaps more importantly, can Salesforce overcome the accounting issues we highlighted in our previous article?We are changing our view on Salesforce after this quarter, but only to a limited extent. Previously, we recommended all investors stay away from the stock. Now, we are slightly more comfortable, and are willing to recommend it to investors with a high tolerance for risk. The stock has come down by a fair amount, and the balance sheet is improving. We do not wish to have this article turn into a Netflix-style debate over accounting issues, and as such we recommend this stock ONLY to investors comfortable with the company's continued use of creative accounting practices. Investors who wish to short the stock due to accounting and overvaluation are welcome to continue doing so. But for investors looking to get long the stock, now is a good time to do so, but ONLY if they are fully aware of the company's accounting practices and valuation. A quick recap of these practices is as follows.The company increased cash on hand from $449.794 million to $502.987 million, and marketable securities rose from $127.582 million to $142.861 million. Days sales outstanding declined to 49 days, and operating cash flow improved.These metrics make Salesforce.com seem more compelling to some investors, while others are just as skeptical of the company as ever. And that is perfectly understandable. Not every stock can be free of controversy. Salesforce.com certainly isn't, and that makes it all the more compelling to examine.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
313549,23800,2011-12-13T11:41:19-05:00,,"While a great deal of commentary regarding the over-valuation of Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) stock price has pointed to accounting gimmickry that has arguably kept CRM's shares in nosebleed territory, very little has been said about a fundamental reality that poses a far greater risk, not only to the company's market cap, but more importantly, to its much hyped top line.For several years now investors and institutions have been in awe of the remarkable revenue growth Salesforce.com has been able to achieve. Quarter after quarter and year after year, revenue has grown at a remarkable clip. That continued to be the case even as customer billings came in lower than expected in the company's most recent quarter. That miss knocked shares down, but since then share prices have stabilized, albeit at a lower level.While some concerned analysts and commentators continue to focus on cash flow and profitability which they rightly should, little is being said about an inevitable slowdown in revenue growth, even as the company continues to add to its highly compensated sales team during an overall downturn in the economies of most developed countries. What is not being considered is just how vulnerable the company is to aggressive competition from companies that are late to the party, but which both collectively and separately have significantly greater financial wherewithal to mount aggressive sales campaigns that will sooner or later force CRM to rethink its strategy.Consider the following scenario. Salesforce.com stockholders along with many analysts believe that at some point in the future the company will have attained such a commanding lead in market share that the company will be able to scale back marketing expenses along with many other growth related expenses with the result that along with economies of scale will cause massive margin expansion along with impressive gains in cash flow and earnings. This they expect to continue for the foreseeable future once these changes are instituted, thus justifying the company's current share price.Now consider the following. In general, various companies sales strategies look at a variety of different ways to achieve sales and profitability goals. One such strategy is to compensate the sales force by providing pricing that makes the company's product the most attractively priced in its peer group. Salesmen generally are expected to produce higher levels of sales volume due to the fact that the company is providing them with a product that on its own merits can be shown to be the superior value. Per unit compensation is generally lower because the salesperson is being handed a product that sells itself.At the other end of the spectrum another type of sales force consists of a group of highly skilled professionals who are able to generate high margin sales via exceptional selling skills to a more select group of prospects. Salesmen in this group are expected to favorably differentiate the company's products even though they may be equivalent to lower priced competitor products. In this situation, successful salesmen will be much more highly compensated than those in a company that provides a product at a price point that attracts prospective customers to the product and where salesmen are considered by the competition to be order takers.The middle ground is made up of a sales force that balances pricing with value. It is neither the cheapest nor is it the most expensive alternative for prospective customers. Here the sales force is reasonably compensated. They must compete both against lower priced competitors as well as against a more skilled and highly compensated sales force at the other end of the spectrum.Do CRM competitors need to overpay their sales forces to compete with Saleforce.com? The answer is likely no. Competition will go after Salesforce.com on price. Offering lower priced alternatives will cost CRM competitors far less in sales expense relative to what Salesforce.com has to pay. The advantage goes to the competition.Historically, Salesforce.com has lavished exceptionally generous compensation packages on its sales force. Initially such compensation was justified due to the fact that the product being sold was a novel one that required a great deal of customer education and persuasion along with a great deal of product knowledge. It was selling a new product that was not well understood and which required faith on the customers' part to complete the sale. As the company progressed and its product began gathering greater acceptance, sales exploded. The company's sales force was pushing into virgin territory and facing virtually no niche competition. Management understandably perceived an opportunity to corner a market before any real competition entered its space. Initially large software vendors didn't pay much attention to the company as they saw little if any impact on their bottom lines. As the years passed, Salesforce.com's revenue numbers continued to climb at a rapid pace and the company continued to reward its sales force with attractive compensation plans to keep momentum on track.Fast forward to the present. The cloud is no longer a vague concept understood by few. Behemoths such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and SAP (NYSE:SAP) have had to not only acknowledge the viability of cloud products, they have had to accept the fact that if they don't enter the cloud in a meaningful way, they risk becoming irrelevant in a very important and rapidly growing segment of the market. Perhaps a bit late to the party, they nonetheless are now offering products that compete with Salesforce.com's offerings, albeit in some cases with truncated or application specific versions. The land rush to acquire companies that can add to the appeal of a particular company's offerings is apparent to all that follow the goings on in the cloud space. Competition is heating up and beefing up.Here is where things begin to go wrong with the Saleforce.com model. The company continues to add to its sales force at a rapid clip. The company also continues to richly compensate successful sales efforts. To-date, this strategy has given the company a commanding lead in its space. As competition becomes more meaningful, sales compensation becomes more of an issue. On the one hand Salesforce.com (CRM) continues to award lavish compensation to its sales force. On the other, competition will soon turn its model upside down. Many believe that Salesforce.com software is overpriced and that this provides an opportunity to competitors to offer a product that will meet the needs of many CRM customers at a much lower price. For example, how profitable must a competitive offering from MSFT be to make MSFT a viable competitor in the space. One possible answer is ""not very,"" and this is precisely where the competition will likely hit CRM. MSFT can subsidize its push into the space with its massive stockpile of cash not to mention the enormous cash flow its existing products generate. To varying degrees, the same is true of other entrants into this space. This will likely pressure CRM margins going forward.How will Salesforce respond? They can cut prices, but given the company's current margins, doing this alone will likely push the company into a money losing position and cripple its cash flow and thus its opportunity to respond to burgeoning competition. They can cut their sales force and/or lower incentive compensation, but this will hit the top line at a time when the competition is adding to its product offerings and likely will cause a marked slowdown in sales growth. They can do both and look for a balance that will allow them to be profitable and grow at the same time. While the middle way appears to be Salesforce.com's best course of action, it will undoubtedly cause the market to revalue the company based on a more fundamental analytic model. More conventional metrics will be applied to stock analysis of CRM.Should the market recognize the perceived lack of sustainability in Saleforce.com's current strategy (as may currently be the case), the company's stock will likely see substantial erosion in share price. Should CRM attempt to rebalance and reduce sales and related costs, revenue will suffer while margins improve, but competition will likely continue to pressure both the top and bottom lines and in the light of this radical but more practical approach, the market will likely more realistically project future growth and punish share prices accordingly. Either way, Salesforce.com is no longer operating in a vacuum. Competitive pressure is beginning to build and the company must respond. The most reasonable course of action is to right size growth and cut expenses to position the company to be able to respond to these new competitive threats. Either way, CRM's share price appears poised for a fall.Disclosure: I am short CRM."
310114,25158,2011-11-24T08:52:56-05:00,,"Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has been quite the topic of conversation by both the bulls and bears as of late. The bears consistently point out that the company does not make any money and the accounting tricks management utilizes to disillusion the public when it reports earnings may prove to be a troubling sign. On the flip side, the bulls argue that the bottom line should not be the focus. There are plenty of publicly traded companies that have yet to report a net profit. Instead, top line revenues and customer growth should be the dictating factors for potential investors. I must say that when it comes to companies that trade at astronomical P/E ratios like Salesforce, I look to the technical data as opposed to core fundamentals. I am privy to charts and believe a secret might have been exposed while looking at the trading of the week leading to its quarterly earnings report. Below is a spreadsheet I made that tracks the trade on the week CRM reports earnings for the past five quarters. Prior to this past week, I made the exact same spreadsheet (minus the most recent data) and made a striking observation. The second trading day consistently gave us a hint as to what would happen later in the week (CRM traditionally reports on Thursday after market close). The highest high or lowest low for the week always occurred on the second trading day and if it were a positive day for the stock, the best route would be to take a bearish position in the form of shorts and/or puts. If it were a negative trading day, the best strategy was a bullish one, buying calls. This inverse relationship proved true each quarter and if you acted on it, it made you substantial returns. For instance, the past two quarters saw the stock drop an average of $26.95 from the high on Tuesday to the low on Friday (the day after it reported). That roughly 20% decline netted incredible returns for those who purchased the weekly puts heading into the report. Even more interesting is the fact that the bearish investor did not even have to risk the potential for a positive report. The average decline from the high on Tuesday to the low on Thursday (before it reported) was $19.42, a 14% decline! The story rings true for the quarters prior to, but on the call side (see chart).There may be several reasons why this trend has held true on a consistent basis. One reason is the simple rule of supply and demand. If there's less people buying the product, its price is negotiated lower. As you can see in the chart, the volume on the second trading day has always been much lighter than that of the last trading day (Friday of earnings week always has the greatest volume for the quarter) - 80% lighter! Option traders know that volatility drives pricing and the more volatile trading is, the more expensive options get and vice versa. While volume and volatility are two different metrics, they move in a positive relationship for a multitude of reasons. As a result, volume is a very good indicator as to the appropriate timing to buy an option. If volume is low, it's time to start buying. If it's high, it's a good time to sell. While this explains the Tuesday to Thursday trade, it doesn't necessarily explain why Tuesday's high indicated a negative earnings report or why Tuesday's low indicated a positive one. However, the charts clearly show that the weekly option trader got his best deal on the second trading day. In life, history tends to repeat itself and stocks are no different. So for you bargain hunters, keep the second trading day in mind next time you want to make a weekly trade heading into CRM's earnings.  Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
309393,24594,2011-11-21T15:50:53-05:00,,"Back in October I posted a piece on Seeking Alpha looking at three potential short candidates, one of which was Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). And, indeed a brutal three-day stretch to close last week -- in which the stock fell 17% from Tuesday's close to finish Friday at $113.43 -- has seemed to vindicate some of my skepticism on the stock.The catalyst, of course, was the company's third quarter earnings release on Thursday afternoon. Ironically, CRM beat estimates on the headline numbers: sales of $584 million and adjusted profit of 34 cents per share were both ahead of Wall Street consensus. But the big number analysts noted was the company's billings, which rose only 29 percent in the quarter year-over-year, below the 33 to 35 percent expected by many analysts. Because the company sells subscriptions to its software over extended periods (normally 12 to 24 months), the company cannot book the entire value of a contract immediately; it must spread the revenue derived over the length of the service provided. Therefore, deferred revenue in particular is seen as a forward indicator of sales, since the entire balance (some $918 million as of October 31) will be booked as sales over the next few quarters. The Street quite clearly is concerned that the astronomical valuation placed on the stock relative to earnings and cash flow may be jeopardized by any slowdown in growth. What I found more troubling than the slowdown in billings was the company's reaction to this miss. On a variety of levels, management seemed intent on downplaying the slowdown, using some questionable tactics along the way. CFO Graham Smith went first, during the company's presentation for the third quarter conference call, clearly aware that analysts would be disappointed in the deferred revenue figures:Smith's response sounds like a bit of a smokescreen: long-winded and unclear. But investors should be even more skeptical about the CFO's explanation. Why? From the Salesforce.com release announcing the Heroku acquisition:And from the press release announcing the purchase of Radian6:How then, does the billing cycle at Heroku and Radian6 affect deferred revenue growth on a relative basis, if the additional growth from the acquisitions represents no more than 3% of the company's total sales? At most, Heroku and Radian6 can cause less than a point decrease in billings growth, year-over-year. They hardly explain the notable slowdown (which was seen last quarter, as well) that so concerns Wall Street.CEO Benioff then took up the argument on the Q&A portion, responding to a follow-up question about the billings miss:Benioff, like Smith, failed to satisfactorily -- or directly -- answer an analyst question about the decrease in billings growth. Even worse, note the arrogance of the CEO's response: investors should trust in the future growth at salesforce.com. Why? Because they tell us so. Don't worry yourself with your silly little models or your questions about backlog or billing. Just have faith.The question remains, however: how much faith should we have in the guidance? CFO Smith should have inadvertently given investors pause with his answer to the following, unrelated question:How is the company so certain in its revenue projections for the next fifteen months? Well, it just is. Granted, it's not exactly sure what SG&A will be budgeted at, how big its sales force will be or of the size of its marketing spend. But, as Benioff repeatedly pointed out, in the earnings release, the conference call, and a post-earnings Q&A with CNBC's Jim Cramer, the company will reach a ""$3 billion annual revenue run rate"" in fiscal year 2013. Benioff seems awfully confident in his prediction, despite the fact that the company has not yet completed its own internal models. Granted, the company's subscription model gives it far more confidence in forward revenue projections than most other companies. But the deferred revenue figure of $918 million still represents less than one-third of guided FY2013 sales, meaning some $2 billion of new revenue must be generated. The question about billings is a critical one; investors paying nearly 7 times forward sales for a stock have reason to be concerned about revenue growth. Time and time again, high-flying stocks have been cut down by what at first seem to be relatively small misses on sales and earnings numbers. CRM's insistence that its own projections are the ""best indicator"" seems dismissive of those valid concerns. Benioff's repeated reliance on that awkward turn of phrase -- ""a $3 billion annual revenue run rate"" -- shouldn't sit well, either. A $3 billion run rate simply means that the company projects that fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2013 will be at least $750 million. As it is, the midpoint of the company's guidance is for $2.9 billion in sales in fiscal 2013, which is impressive enough in its own right. Why the need for the round number? It seems somehow undignified. It smacks of a CEO who is as concerned -- or more concerned -- with the numbers than with the company. The difference between $2.9 billion and Benioff's touted $3 billion figure is 3.6%. That's it. There seems no need to focus so intently -- and repeatedly -- on the round number.Benioff, of course, has been criticized in the past for his focus on numbers. Of late, CRM bears have been pointing out the company's earnings -- or more accurately, the company's former earnings. CRM managed a breakeven performance for fiscal year 2008, then posted GAAP earnings for each of the next four years. However, FY2012 will result in a GAAP loss of 11 to 12 cents per share, as the company has ramped up hiring (head count was up 46% year-over-year in the recent quarter) and investment to gain market share and expand its business. The company, however, seems loath to discuss this. In the earnings release and conference call, it prefers a non-GAAP measure, which excludes stock-based compensation, amortization, and other charges. (Senior VP of Investor Relations noted upfront in the conference call that ""our commentary will be primarily in non-GAAP terms."") By this accounting, the company will actually earn $1.32 per share in the current fiscal year. But this method of accounting, for fiscal year 2012, will simply ignore over $200 million in stock-based compensation, for which CRM investors will pay, through share dilution. (The chart here shows the steady rise in shares outstanding; a $575 million convertible debt offering means another 6.7 million shares can potentially be added, given that the stock trades well above the conversion price of $85.36.) It is one thing for a company to ignore one-time charges for acquisitions or non-cash goodwill impairment; yet the company's repeated dismissal of substantial, material and dilutive employee compensation programs as they relate to earnings is troubling. The company's disinterest in the GAAP figures is shown by the fact that at no point in the earnings release or the conference call did any company representative (or analyst, for that matter) broach the fact that a formerly profitable company was now losing money, at least according to traditional accounting standards. In Benioff's defense, he is likely not hiding the loss -- he simply doesn't care, at least not right now. From his interview with Jim Cramer:This attitude meshes with his answers on the conference call. Note in his earlier answer that Benioff said the ""best indicator"" of the company's performance was ""the revenue."" Not the earnings -- the sales. And, in fairness, Benioff's strategy may be wise. Fellow high-flyer Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is following a similar strategy, investing now at a cost of present earnings with the hopes of boosting market share and cash flow down the line. CRM is spending money to build as much market share as it can before offerings from larger, more well-financed competitors -- including Oracle (ORCL), SAP, and Microsoft (MSFT) -- are able to challenge their dominance. And indeed, even Benioff's critics often point out that he is a solid salesman and an excellent spokesman for CRM stock. While reading the Q&A, Benioff's enthusiasm comes through, as he talks about reaching $10 billion in revenue (an impressive goal, though there's another of those ""round numbers""), or jabs at Oracle and SAP, dismissing their offerings as inferior. The man clearly believes in Salesforce.com, and its stock.The question, however, is how good a manager is he? Let me be clear that I do not think for a second that anything criminal -- or even unethical -- is going on at Salesforce.com. It's not Enron; nor, for that matter, do I believe CRM will go the way of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), where its very business model will be called into question. But Benioff's cheerleading tone, the company's reliance on non-GAAP figures, the evasive answers on deferred revenue: these should be red flags for investors. The irony is that the CRM story is strong enough to stand on its own. While I share the value investor's natural bias against high-multiple growth stocks, Salesforce.com remains an interesting and potentially profitable investment. The company is generating cash and showing impressive top-line growth. If Benioff's strategy of swapping margins for market share in the short term is correct, the company can see significant earnings leverage down the line.Of course, the question is: what kind of earnings? No matter how strong the story, the company's seeming emphasis on embellishment -- non-GAAP earnings, revenue ""run rates,"" PR battles with Oracle -- should concern investors. A good CEO can be good for a stock; but it is absolutely essential for a company. Is Benioff that CEO? Will his focus on long-term investments pay off?In the meantime, CRM stock looks to be approaching a key inflection point (click to enlarge):chart courtesy finviz.comThe stock is on the tail end of a classic bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, and at the same time heading toward a repeated level of support around $110 per share. One can easily see a small bounce during light trading this week, but there seems little doubt that $110 will remain a key level. Should the stock break that level, the short-sale bandwagon will fill up quickly. Wall Street -- and the business world -- seem to always find a way to punish hubris. Yes, Marc Benioff has done a great job for his shareholders -- so far. Yet his focus on round numbers, his insistence on taking jabs at the competition, and his endlessly positive cheerleading for CRM stock should make investors wary. It's not that the business model is a failure, or the company's current numbers a sham. But growing companies hit bumps in the road, and need a good driver. Benioff's relentless optimism should cause investors to wonder whether he is the right man for the job.

310803,20488,2011-11-29T15:13:57-05:00,,"This is amazing. The insider dumping at Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM)  did not stop just because it was the Thanksgiving holiday. From 11/22 to 11/25  more insiders cashed out. What is even more surprising is that they were  dumping options 3 and 4 years before they expired. This is a trend we  have been seeing lately I would think it goes to the mindset of their  expectations of stock prices going forward. When you see 1 or 2 insiders  doing it, it can be ignored as an anomaly (maybe they are selling for a  specific reason unrelated to the business) but when it seems that they all  are, one has to take notice.Here is the laundry list:This continues the unabated selling of shares we have seen forever at CRM.CFO Smith sold another $197K worth. 1/2 was 1-2 years before expiration. He only owns 15K sharesOfficer Van Veenendall sold another $42K worth all 1-2 years before expiration. He only owns 7.9K sharesHow can the CFO only hold 15K shares directly? He has cashed in more than that this year and bought none on the open market.VP Harris sold another $42K shares 1-2 yrs. early.COO HU sold another 1-2 years early. He holds 2,779 share directlyVP Koplow sold $91K 1-2 years early; he at least directly owns 24k shares, dismal but better than his bosses.Execs are using this company as an ATM."
307912,20488,2011-11-15T06:57:35-05:00,,"Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (NASDAQ:GMCR) got some “valuation religion” in a fast way recently. I am going short Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) for the same reason. Now, my distaste for the company is nothing new, I have written about it in the past. With earnings coming out this week even a good quarter can’t save the rest of 2011 for them.Previous posts on the company can be found here and here. Nothing has changed for the company since then other than a deal for Assistly ($50M). The company is still losing money on a GAAP basis, insiders are still selling shares as fast as they get them and the company has still made the switch from reporting GAAP EPS to reporting “non GAAP” because, well, that’s the only way they can show a profit. The stock still trades at over $120/share.Regarding stock comp:3.2 million additional shares comes to $400M of more stock comp expense in addition to what it issued from here on out, which, according to the company: “These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees.” (Q2 10Q pg 35)But wait, there’s more:This is more hiding the true employee compensation costs. A customer signs a 24 month contract. CRM pays the employee's commission in full, yet they account for that payment over the full 24 months of the contract. In other words, in a 24 month contract, in each quarter CRM will account for 1/8 of the full bonus it already paid. So, how much is this amounting to? As of July 31st, $131M is recognized as “accrued compensation” (10Q pg. 22). This is sneaky because it takes an expense paid, and moves it from the income statement to the balance sheet. CRM is amortizing only $24M of that a quarter (up from $19M last year) as an actual expense despite the fact they have already paid it out (slide 3 below). Why does that matter? If they expensed the whole $130M this year (like they should) we would have to add $.97 to this year's GAAP losses ($131M/135M shares) meaning the $.09 to $.11 loss guidance would be revised to $1.06 to $1.08 loss. More than a little difference and not standard procedure in the industry. You have to read the 10Q to find it as you’ll see the balance sheet they provide below conveniently lumps all liabilities into 1 line (slide 2)But wait, there is still more:So, when CRM develops software, rather than expensing the cost when it is incurred as is the industry norm, they, again, move the expense to the balance sheet and amortize it drip by drip to improve near term results (10Q pg 21). As of July 31, CRM had $198M of “capitalized costs” on the balance sheet that are in reality current expenses and took a total of…drumroll….$20.9M of actual expenses in Q2. Again, $198M in unrecognized expenses comes to $1.46 more in costs the company is putting off into the future.And still more:What does it mean? CRM, currently could be forced to convert the $575M note to 6.7M more shares of stock AND, since the conversion parameters have been tripped, $40/share more on those shares ($575M/$85/share conversion). That will add an additional $270M in cash drain OR stock dilution depending on how they pay it above the $575M (at today’s price). Think about that, in 2010 they issued the note paying .75% interest but will end up paying back and additional >50% of the amount borrowed. Shit, Vinny the loan shark doesn’t charge that kind of vig.This too is classified as a liability on the balance sheet that will become a very real expense.What is even worse? Rather than pay the cash and have to expense it all at once, CRM will pay it in shares and add them as “stock comp expense” or “capitalized interest cost” it and then omit that very real expense from their “non GAAP” results they will report to investors if stock comp or recognize it in drips if they capitalize it. Shady at best.*Note: CRM has not said this is what they will do but given past and current actions, anything other than this would be shocking.The company is also losing efficiency. Gross profit YTD is 79% (slide 1). This is the first time is has dipped below 80% since the Q1 and Q2 2009 just post Lehman. That looks like it will continue to fall. While revenues are up dramatically in FY 2012 for the 1st 6 months, expenses are outstripping that rise causing a $63M operating profit to become a $19M loss. Basically CRM is selling dollar bills for $.90, losing money on each transaction and standing up and yelling “Look how many dollars I am selling!!”Remember, while the reported loss here does include stock based comp, is does NOT include the games they are playing with commission expense and “capitalized software” expense. If those expenses were accounted for as the rest of the software industry does, the losses above would be over $100M.Slide 1Slide 2Slide 3So, why do all this then? Easy, IBGYBG (I’ll be gone you’ll be gone). Eventually, the CRM revenue rise has to slow. ORCL is getting into the game in a much larger way with its recent purchase of Right Now and MSFT is making a push. They will both put pressure on sales and margins. The law of large numbers says CRM’s growth has to slow. The problem for them is that they are adding costs to those future periods through very aggressive accounting. So while we will see a slowing of sales or sales at lower price points compressing margins, there is still a steady stream of costs that will continue to hit the bottom line also.For a company that is not profitable now, that is a very bad mixture.But what do current execs care? They are all cashing in stock as soon as they get it, so doing anything and pressing accounting rules to prop up the stock price now for them makes sense. They cash in 10′s of millions of dollars worth and walk away when the music stops. Not sure if that holds water? CEO Benioff made $900k cash last year and $20M after cashing in stock, CFO Smith made $480K cash and $4.8M after stock, Pres van Veenendaal $394K cash and $4.7M after stock. Pick an officer and the story remains the same. I get the whole “when officers hold shares they do what is best for the stock price” argument. But, when the shares are doled out like Halloween candy and sold the second the options vest, this argument falls flat (there are 10.5M ($1.3B worth) shares still outstanding in option grants, 10Q pg 26 and 3M shares of restricted stock ($434M worth)). These aren’t long term holders but folks who want the price to hold up now so they can cash in. They’ll worry about it later much later and by then they’ll have plenty of cash so later won’t matter. They certainly aren’t spending a dime of their money buying shares; but shareholders are for them.Now would be a good time to point out that the company has reserved, in addition to the $13.8M shares already doled out, another 21.2M shares for future options and grant to insiders. Think about that, with 135M shares currently outstanding, the additional 35M shares that could be issued would dilute shareholders by 26% (note: this includes possible (almost guaranteed) dilution from the convertible notes issued and discussed above).In short, here the incentive is reversed. Jack up that stock price now any way possible. In my opinion that explains the very aggressive accounting detailed above and the sudden switch from GAAP to “non GAAP” EPS reporting as GAAP results have cratered. When does the music stop? I can’t say for sure but it seems like we are hitting an inflection point. When the day comes, considering this is a company with no GAAP EPS that trades at $125/share, it will be swift and dramatic. Just ask shareholders of GMCR who found out that eventually questionable accounting catches up with you and NFLX shareholders who realized that yeah, valuation really does matter.Now, I know there are other shorts out there who are short simply on a valuation basis. For me, an insane valuation is not enough just to short. We have seen insane valuations get more insane and more insane over time. There needs to be a reason for for people to stop, take a look and realize that something is amiss. For NFLX, it was the realization that due to competition and increased content costs the company’s growth and fundamentals were going to slow dramatically. For GMCR it was Einhorn’s lifting the veil on accounting “issues” that, as more people looked at them, they seemed to make sense. In both cases the stocks were overvalued the whole way up but became even more overvalued until something happened to make the music stop.What will it then be for CRM?Larger accounts will lengthen the sales process and lower margins as the costs involved with developing larger accounts dwarfs that of smaller ones. One also has to assume that ORCL is going to be targeting these accounts which will add to the pressure on CRM. This goes to what we see in CRM’s cash position. At the end of Q2 it has fallen from $1.8B to $1.2B (YOY). Now the bulls will point to the $400M of cash deals the company did last year as a reason for the drain. We would point out that the company also issued $550M of convertible notes (above) so the net/net for the company ought to have been a $100M addition if the sold reason for the drain was the acquisitions. The fact that the cash drain after Q2 was $600M should be concerning especially considering this drain is accelerating as it was $400M after Q1.From the 10KNow remember, the 48% is an artificially low number due to the way CRM accounts for commissions to its sales people. Deferred commissions stand at $133M as of Q2 v $77M last year.What if the doubters are wrong? What if CRM’s strategy works? What would be a fair multiple? 50X earnings? Let's say none of the options or grants outstanding are exercised so we’ll keep the shares outstanding at $135M. What does the company need to earn for that 50X earnings multiple at current prices ($125)? Using those numbers we get to $2.50/share or $337M in net income. That sounds reasonable until you consider that the best year the company ever had was net income (NI) of $84M in FY’10. So, to reach a 50X multiple, which is extreme, we need the company to triple its best year for NI at a time when NI, far from growing at a rate that would cause it to triple sometime this decade, is collapsing into losses for this year and most likely next. Remember, all that assumes zero dilution from options/grants. If we add those shares in we’ll need the company to achieve NI of $357M. Doubtful.So, what would be fair? Well, computer software companies like MSFT, ORCL, CA and SAP that are profitable all trade at 20X earnings or under. So let's apply that to CRM. Let’s assume CRM blows it out next year and has a record year for NI and earns $143M (would have to use fully diluted shares then). That gives us a cool $1/share in EPS and at a 20X multiple, a $20 stock. Even if we go to 50X earnings we have a share price 60% lower than today and remember, that also assumes the company beats its best ever year for NI by 75%.For the bullish “recent acquisitions will boost earnings” camp to bear out, one has to believe $400M in deals are going to have a material effect on a $18B company. Deals of that size help in the margins, they don’t reverse course from a company losing money to having record results.When does reality hit? If not when Q3 results are reported this week (preliminary FY2013 guidance is expected to be given then), then I would think when Q4 results are reported. Citigroup (NYSE:C) raised CRM to a buy from neutral yesterday. The cynic in me says it is the last gasp to jack up the price this week so folks can squeeze some more profit out of it before earnings come out."
307873,24888,2011-11-15T03:35:17-05:00,,"As may be apparent from my previous article, I am not a big fan of this company. Salesforce.com (CRM)  is scheduled to release earnings this coming Thursday after the market  close. Let us try to make a prediction on whether those earnings will be  received with disappointment or jubilation. Thus far  Salesforce.com has impressed with revenue growth. It has disappointed  with profit growth, which is actually a profit decline. So the question  is really what drives investors more. Revenue or profits?In order to determine what we can expect, it is first prudent to look at the last earnings report, more in particular the guidance for this quarter.Looking  at the reporting history of Salesforce.com, it is rather safe to assume  that the company  will exceed the revenue target for this quarter. I  would not be surprised if revenue will be close to 600 million. After  all, CEO Marc Benioff has said that he sees a  ""strong business  environment"" and does not expect America to go into another recession,  which by the way I don't think he can judge based on his own experience  only.  It goes without saying that any figure equal or below the  guidance of 570 million will be seen as a revenue miss.Revenue  was higher than guided in the previous quarter. Guidance was 528  million, actual revenue came in at 546 million. Thus, we can expect this  quarter revenue will also be higher than guided. After all, Benioff is  not likely to give a guidance target that he cannot meet.  Now  how about profits? Will that revenue growth translate to higher  profits? In this regard, Salesforce.com has a less impressive track  record, to put it mildly. Last quarter the company swung from break-even  to a GAAP net loss of 3 cents, which caused the P/E to jump from 300 to  over 600. And as we can see from the last guidance there is no quick  improvement in sight.  For this quarter the company expects to report a GAAP net loss per share of approximately $0.06  to $0.05, which amounts to a loss that is twice as big as in the  previous quarter. As a matter of fact, the actual loss should be bigger  still, as since this last guidance, the company acquired tiny service  company Assistly. Hidden in the press release, I could find this statement:I  cannot interpret this as anything other than a profit warning. An  underpublished profit warning, but nevertheless, a profit warning. It is  therefore safe to assume that the actual GAAP net loss for this quarter  will be at least 8 cents. Mind you, we are talking about a stock that  has a price/sales ratio of 8. This means that investors are paying 8  dollars for each dollar revenue. With such a valuation, you would expect  that the company is at least making a profit on that 1 dollar revenue,  but no, it makes losses that are projected to increase, with no tangible  promise of improvement for the foreseeable future. As  an investor I have always learned that the value of a company is  ultimately determined by its earnings; in other words, its capacity to  make money for its shareholders. But this wisdom does not seem to apply  anymore for Salesforce.com. Maybe things have changed? Maybe I am  overlooking something? Maybe I just don't understand that in the coming  years the revenue growth at the cost of bleeding profits will translate  in huge earnings per share? It certainly looks like that, because when I look at the forward P/E listed on the financial websites like Yahoo Finance,  it appears to take away any worries.   At 70 it is much less than the  trailing P/E of 600, implying that profits will increase hugely over the  next 12 months. But will they really?Well, the  decisive answer to that is: No, they will not! We just saw that the loss  per share will increase for the current quarter and the company has  projected the loss for the full year as follows: A  GAAP net loss of at least 9 cents per share? Then how the heck can the  forward P/E be around 70? Well, the answer is it is not. That  forward P/E is based on the NON GAAP results that Salesforce.com is  promoting and are apparently adopted by the financial websites. However,  when the actual P/E is calculated in the future, the P/E is not based  on NON GAAP results, but on GAAP results. Those GAAP results are losses.  Actually, I say that this forecast of the P/E based on NON GAAP  results is nothing short of deceit. But I can't be the only one to see that, can I? Marc Benioff and his CFO Graham Smith know this too, don't they? You bet they do, which is probably the reason that Smith and his collegues have been selling for millions of shares over the last few months. The truth of the matter is there is no P/E at all in 12 months. Not one of 600, not one of 12000, and certainly not one of 70. You can't have a Price/Earnings ratio if there are no GAAP earnings, because the actual P/E is always calculated from GAAP earnings. If those GAAP earnings are negative, the P/E is listed as N/A (Not Applicable). That is what it will be in 12 months, and most likely already after next earnings report.  You see,  the P/E is based on the last 4 quarters. With a GAAP EPS loss of  3 cents in the previous quarter, and a projected loss of at least 6 cents this quarter, the total earnings over last 4 quarters is already negative. Where analysts are currently expressing concern over the high multiple, they will soon have no multiple to discuss at all. They will have to discuss the losses and speculate about when profits will return. They will have to speculate because Benioff and his management are not giving any timeframe.Am I really a one-eye in the land of the blind? I am afraid so, because anyone will see soon that what I have been pointing out here is going to be proven true.Therefore, I am expecting that Salesforce.com is going to follow the path of other momentum bubble stocks that could not live up to expectations, breaking down more than 50%. Examples include Opentable (OPEN) , Netflix (NFLX), Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) and Travelzoo (TZOO). From a valuation point of view, these stocks were all less overvalued than Salesforce.com, even at their peaks. You only have to look at the charts to see what downside is possible.

305291,25047,2011-11-04T15:03:31-04:00,,"First of all, I should say I am short Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) because of the extreme overvaluation, the lack of earnings growth and the non-GAAP shenanigans that allow it to claim a profit while posting GAAP losses, due to the way it ignores compensation costs paid in stock.However, it is critically important to understand what the bull thesis is, lest it be right and overwhelm any kind of overvaluation or lack of growth.The bull thesis in CRM rests mainly upon 2 vectors: The cash flow CRM generatesBecause of its nature as a subscription-based service, CRM gets to collect cash from customers well before it renders its services and recognizes revenues from rendering those services. This allows CRM to post a large operating cash flow even though, given that the revenues are not all recognized upfront, the earnings lag.One can check the latest 10-K or the most recent 10-Q to observe this in action. CRM posted $459 million in operating cash flow during 2010, and $222 million during the first 6 months of FY 2012.Obviously, the cash flow numbers being much larger than earnings makes for an opportunity to calculate valuation multiples for CRM that are a lot less outlandish than Price-to-Earnings, even if non-GAAP based.A P/CF multiple using $459 million in operating cash flow, 141 million shares and $133 per share comes in at 41.5. Not cheap by any measure, but not 10-40 times higher than the market, either, as would be the case when using P/E. Also, contrary to EPS (GAAP or non-GAAP), one can argue that operating cash flow is still growing as long as revenues continue to grow.My problem with this argument? Well, a large part of the operating cash flow, 18% in 2010 (CY), but trending towards 50% in 2011 (CY) is coming from paying employees with stock, hardly a high-quality source of cash, if it can even be called “operating cash flow”. This means that any cash flow based multiples should probably be corrects upwards by a factor of 2, and then they become as supportive of CRM’s share price as the P/E.My position regarding cash flow being generated from paying employees with stock can be understood if one imagines a company selling something for $10 (net) and paying $20 to its employees in stock to sell it. Such a company would show non-GAAP earnings like CRM and cash flow like CRM yet would obviously not be worth much. The subscription modelPerhaps even more salient than the cash flow, the main point in the bull’s thesis is that if and when CRM stops growing so fast, it will be a huge money-maker, even earnings-wise.Central to this theory is the notion that most of the costs to get a customer are up-front, and there’s not much in costs for CRM to keep and service such customers. This is borne out by the fact that CRM is now spending at much as 53.7% of their revenues in “Marketing and sales”, and much of that theoretically needs not be spent to service or keep existing customers after year 1.Part of this theory is certainly right, it IS much cheaper to keep a customer than acquire one. So, earnings from existing customers should be much higher than those from newly acquired ones.What is my problem with this? First, it is very hard to know how much of the marketing and sales is needed to service present customers. Then, a part of the costs to service clients, including long term commissions, is capitalized or exists even if the customer is not new. Also, and most important, a large percentage of CRM’s customers, 70% or more, are already beyond the first year of their contracts, have already renewed, and the huge profitability kick-in has not been observed. It is hard to believe that revenue growth at just 30% per year can have costs so high that they are able to eat up all that increased profitability that was sure to arrive but never did, and keeps getting pushed back, to the point where CRM has shown no increased profits, even in non-GAAP terms, for almost 2 years (7 quarters).Finally, if keeping the existing customers is so costless, then a much increased marketing spend should produce much faster growth – because most of it would go to capture new customers. Such is not observed; the absolute growth from 2008 FY to 2009 FY, 2009 FY to 2010 FY or 2010 FY to 2011 FY is in the same ballpark ($250 - $350 million in absolute increase in revenues) even though marketing spend in 2011 FY was more than twice what it was during 2008 FY. Either finding new customers is getting a lot harder, or there really is a large component of marketing and sales that goes to service existing customers, going directly against this thesis.ConclusionIt helps investors and traders to know what the other side is thinking. In fundamental terms, the above 2 theories are what the other side is thinking in CRM. Obviously there are also a few other components regarding momentum, the “cloud” story and, I believe, a huge stock promotion, in play.As I believe I have shown above, these arguments can have some validity, but are far from being clear cut. At some point, even if one believes the model the company follows has delayed profitability, profitability HAS to make an appearance, which it hasn’t.Add to this the questionable nature of a company that switches from GAAP to non-GAAP clearly to paint a better picture and you have what looks to be an obvious stock promotion far departed from reality.Disclosure: I am short CRM."
308944,24443,2011-11-18T12:53:11-05:00,,"On Thursday, November 17, Internet cloud software maker Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) posted a $3.8 million third quarter net loss. The company added that higher expenses drove the loss, including increased compensation costs. The company also added that its fourth quarter earnings might be below expectations.The third quarter loss works out to 3 cents per share, compared to a profit of $21.1 million, or 15 cents per share. Salesforce also reported that its employees received $57 million in stock-based compensation during the quarter. If this stock-based compensation element were not included, the company would have earned 34 cents per share. Over the last six months, insiders have sold 1,193,180 shares of Salesforce.Revenue was $584.3 million, a 36% increase from the same quarter last year, and above the consensus expectations. Salesforce also stated that it anticipates fourth quarter revenue to be between $620 and $624 million, and that it expects pegged adjusted earnings between 39 and 40 cents per share, or slightly below expectations. Salesforce has been a highly successful cloud option for businesses, competing with more established database technology companies like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP). Competition from these companies will likely be fierce going forward. Additionally, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) offer compelling cloud-based products and services, which will likely also compete more directly with Salesforce as time goes on. Competition from these technology giants - each many times larger than Salesforce, more profitable and with cash to spend - could be considerable.Salesforce shares fell over $8 per share, or 6%, in after-hours trading on Thursday night, taking the stock to around $118. The stock had closed at $126.09, after falling $5.67, or 4.3%, during a broadly negative regular session. On Friday morning, shares fell to as low as about $113.Salesforce currently trades for about 70 times next year’s projected earnings and over 600 times trailing earnings. Though the company ‘s shares are down about 4.5% so far in 2011, the shares are up 14.5% over the last 12 months and 90.6% over the last two years.Disclaimer: This article is intended to be informative and should not be construed as personalized advice, as it does not take into account your specific situation or objectives.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
308434,25047,2011-11-16T14:45:40-05:00,,"In my article “Understanding The Bull Case For Salesforce.com,“ I have already approached the problem that a lot of Salesforce.com’s (NYSE:CRM) operating cash flow comes from paying compensation in stock (trending toward 40%-50% in 2011). This is far from being unique to Salesforce.com, but seems to confuse a lot of people – analysts included – who easily handle such cash flow the same way as any other cash flow.Some go as far as saying that the dilution from such a practice is already stated in the P&L statement, so if one was to exclude the cash or consider the costs, one should not consider the dilution because that would be double-counting.In this article I will show that such a cash flow really isn’t the same as regular cash flow from operating activities.I will do this by showing what would happen to a company that generated cash over a 50-year period, and distributed it equally to the shareholders at the end of that period, under various scenarios.Company A generates cash flow from operations while paying its employees in cashWe will consider this company to accrete $500 in cash per year, and the company will start with 100 shares and not dilute them.What we see here, is that at the end of the period, the company accumulates $25000 in cash and distributes $250 cash per share. Company B generates cash flow from operations while paying part of the employees’ compensation in share-based compensationWe will consider this company to accrete $500 in cash per year, but $250 of the $500 will come from compensating employees using share-based compensation, leading to 2% share dilution per year. What do we observe? That at the end of the period, the company has accumulated the same amount of cash as company A, $25000, however, because of the dilution each share is entitled to just $92.88 cash per share. Company C generates half the cash flow from operations while paying employees in cashWe will consider this company to accrete just $250 in cash per year, and the company will start with 100 shares and not dilute them. So this company will be producing cash at HALF the rate of company A or B.What happens after 50 years? The company has accumulated $12500 in cash, and will distribute $125 per share. This is actually incredible; the company distributes MORE cash per share, and is thus more valuable, than company B! ConclusionCash from operations that is a result from share-based compensation is worse than cash that isn’t generated at all. I usually say we should ignore such cash and remove it from operating cash flow, but what we can see here is that given the implied dilution from generating cash this way, this is actually more grievous than not generating it at all, and not having the dilution.So, when people go around calculating Salesforce.com’s or other techs’ earnings and cash flow INCLUDING the part that comes from using share-based compensation, they would do well to ignore the component of cash flow that arises from that practice, if they plan to use the present number of diluted shares in any calculation. And they should also bear in mind that even doing so is not conservative at all, because this cash carries with it a value of less than zero for present shareholders, given the dilution it implies over the long term. Another conclusionThe value of a company is extraordinarily tied to the dilution it undergoes. If we had run the experiment above with 5% dilution per year, the cash per share distributed at the end of the period would have been $21.8, a full 11.4 times less than the scenario without dilution, and 5.7 times less than the company with half the cash flow. The value of a company that dilutes trends rapidly toward zero with the increase in dilution.Disclosure: I am short CRM."

On a valuation basis, it appears as  an even better  short today than it was then, but in reality, the stock is starting to gets its ""mojo"" back and its recent trend should throw up some caution flags for shorts.Bullish implications: (1) The shares are have rallied over 16% in the last two sessions alone, and are still about 14% away from their  median one year analyst price target of $160  (2) bearish sentiment is too high (3) Short interest grew another 3.3% from 10.95 million shares to 11.32 million shares (4) the overall market has turned extremely bullish (the trend is your friend) (5) third quarter earnings estimates of a 33% rise in sales to $571 million  and earnings of 31 cents (a penny drop) reflect  low expectations that should be easy to surpass.Bearish implications still intact: Don’t get me wrong, CRM is still near  several landmines that could implode it, but at this juncture, a better shorting opportunity appears closer to the $160 area than today’s price, here are some potential landmines (1) The stock’s forward multiple of 107 times its pro forma 2012 earnings estimates of $1.30, are situated in nose bleed levels (2) The cloud space is getting more crowded as Oracle’s (NYSE:ORCL) acquisition of RightNow and SAP's (NYSE:SAP) cloud division pose additional competitive threats   (3) Insiders continue to exit the shares at an alarming rates (selling 1.2 million in six months appears reminiscent of a classic ""pump and dump"" scenario) (4) Jim Cramer (contrarian indicator?) continues his love affair with the company (didn’t he just adore NFLX at $250?)

We hear stories about Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) often, and hear little about Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Yet some companies are controversial not for their business practices, but for their financial data. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is just such a company. For all their success in cloud computing, the stock is not one we would suggest to readers, for their valuation, balance sheet, and accounting takes the term ""creativity"" to a whole new level.It is undeniable that Salesforce.com has been wildly profitable for its investors, with a gain of over 720% since its IPO back in 2004. That has trounced the S&P 500's gain of just over 9% over the same period.Salesforce has transformed the world of technology and customer relationship management -- hence its ticker symbol, CRM. Allianz, NBC, Dell (NYSE:DELL), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Siemens (NYSE:SI), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are just some of the company's customers. The company has many things working in its favor:Given all these positives, why is Salesforce not a buy? 3 reasons. The valuation, balance sheet, and accounting.Salesforce trades at a P/E of over 644 for the trailing 12 months. Even granting it a forward P/E of 43 still makes it a very expensive stock. We are not shy about paying for growth stocks. Some of our best performers have been high-multiple stocks such as Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). But there is a limit to how much investors can pay for growth. A P/E of over 600 is absurd. To top it off, Salesforce itself states in its 2011 Annual Report that ""we expect diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2012 to be significantly lower than diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011. True, this is mostly due to massive investments in the business, but at this P/E, that means little. Even Amazon seems cheap by comparison.Secondly, we would like to address the company's balance sheet. Most companies in the tech sector have impeccable balance sheets. Apple's is the envy of the entire corporate world with over $80 billion in cash, and no debt. Salesforce.com, on the other hand, has a balance sheet with debt nearly exceeding its cash, and assets inflated by over $600 million in goodwill, which can vanish just as easily as it is created.Salesforce.com's book value is supported by a weak balance sheet, and we think that investors should be cautious of this. There are many much safer investments in the tech sector, and while they may not be as rewarding, the decrease in risk should be enough compensation. But, the most important reason Salesforce is not a buy, due to its accounting.Accounting is inherently a vague enterprise, and each company is different. GAAP accounting standardizes accounting practices across industries and sectors. Yet it can be interpreted in many ways. Take the media sector, for instance. Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) and Viacom (NASDAQ:VIA) report results in compliance with GAAP, and it is easy to compare them, since both companies are largely similar, with the key variations being in their brands and content.Yet Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which also reports GAAP results, uses those standards in a different way. Is Netflix playing fast and loose with GAAP? We do not think so. (For the record, we do not intend this article to be another front in the bull vs. bear debate over Netflix. We are highlighting the company to point out how differences in accounting interpretation may alter investors' view of a company.) Salesforce, on the other hand, has some very unique accounting practices that are, while perfectly legal, do raise significant questions.Salesforce, unlike most companies, does not treat sales commissions as expenses, as is the norm with most companies. Rather, it books them as an asset and depreciates them over time. Why? Salesforce argues that it is not a traditional company. Since it does not sell software as a packaged product, but rather as a service, it recognizes revenues for that contract over its lifetime, not upfront. Therefore, the expenses associated with that contract should be spread out as well, the company argues. If the company had expensed these costs up-front, when they are truly paid, profit would have been 42% lower than reported. And although the FASB is discussing changes to the standards on this issue, we feel that this artificially inflates the company's profits.Furthermore, new standards about recognizing consulting revenue will allow the company to accelerate revenue recognition in that division, boosting revenues in fiscal 2012 by $20 million. In addition, Salesforce takes far more risk with its cash than any other major company. It is the only company to hold mortgage debt, in the form of collateralized mortgage obligations. As Bernstein's Mark Moedler points out, had Salesforce generated the same yield on cash in FY 2011 as in 2012, he notes, both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS would have been 14 cents a share lower. But what is perhaps even more concerning is Salesforce's compensation structure.Salesforce's stock-based compensation is huge. While not unusual for a tech company, Salesforce's insistence on ignoring it is. The company actively touts its non-GAAP EPS, which excludes this, while burying the accompanying GAAP results in its press releases. Salesforce's stock option expenses in the last quarter were $0.41 per share, which is more than its non-GAAP EPS for that quarter of $0.30.In effect, the company paid out more in stock options than the income of the entire business. We think that this is a significant issue for the company. These options will be cashed in sooner or later, putting pressure on the share price. Salesforce's P/E ratio, already extremely high, would shoot even higher if GAAP EPS was used. And 2012 will most likely be an unprofitable year for the company, based on GAAP standards. While we understand that the company is investing aggressively in its business, there are limits. Even Amazon makes money, despite its massive investments in the Kindle and its retail centers.Salesforce is growing at an incredible pace as a business, and the company has had great success. It has helped thousands of customers improve their businesses and productivity. Yet data rarely lies. And the data here is very concerning. An extreme P/E, weak balance sheet, and a myriad of accounting issues are simply too much. Individually, any one of these issues can be justified, even the stock option expenses. But put together, these issues raise significant alarm bells.We would not invest in Salesforce. But is it a short? That is difficult to say. The company is well-admired on Wall Street, and has a deep and loyal shareholder base. We will avoid the issue altogether and buy Oracle instead, a company with far stronger fundamentals. Salesforce.com has been able to sell its customers billions in software. But it has not been able to sell us on its stock.Disclosure: I am long ORCL, RNOW.

304166,25047,2011-11-01T16:29:42-04:00,,"Many investors are probably not aware of the nature of Salesforce.com’s earnings. Sometimes they might even be surprised by the incredible discrepancies reported on the media regarding those same earnings, with an article talking about how Salesforce.com trades at 100 times earnings, while the following one reports 600 times.What happened here is that Salesforce.com, as it saw its GAAP earnings peaking, decided to start highlighting a new, non-GAAP, measure (as can be seen below). Now, non-GAAP exists because sometimes one-off events, non-cash charges, goodwill write-offs and other non-recurring situations distort the earnings being reported according to GAAP rules. So, as a way of making life easier for investors, companies sometimes go the extra length and report earnings without those effects, hence, non-GAAP.However, such is a fertile ground for malfeasance, and some other companies, seeing that they could ignore a few costs and present a better picture to the investors, leading to higher valuations, have started abusing the practice. Salesforce.com is one of them.Salesforce.com's Change of HeartFiscal Q4 2010“Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.16, up 41% Year-Over-Year”Fiscal Q1 2011 starts non-GAAP as GAAP peaks“GAAP EPS of $0.13, down 13% Year-Over-Year;Non-GAAP EPS of $0.30 rises 7% Year-Over-Year”Imagine for a second that Salesforce.com was not selling/renting CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software, and was instead running a lemonade stand, which by virtue of chance had its shares quoted in the stock market.Now, this lemonade stand sells lemonade at $1 a cup, and is doing brisk business because it sells it in a new kind of cup, but also because it keeps a small army of strongly incentivized salesmen. That army of salesmen, though, doesn’t come cheap, and between the costs of the product itself, and the compensation paid to them, each cup costs $2 to make.So, here is CRM selling lemonade at $1 a shot, and having costs of $2 each time it makes a sale. How much profit are they making per each cup sold?And if CRM, seeing the financial image problem the answer carries, suddenly decides to pay the salesmen in stock, so that $1.20 of each cup’s $2 cost is paid in stock, how much is CRM now making in profit?According to CRM’s “cloud accounting,” it's now making $0.20 per cup! This might seem strange, but is a true description of CRM’s non-GAAP earnings. For instance, in the last reported quarter (July 2011, fiscal Q2 2012), CRM reported $0.31 EPS per share. Of these, how much came from ignoring stock-based compensation? $0.38 ($55 million on 143 million diluted shares).Also, investors should take notice that for a company trading at an extraordinary valuation, CRM’s “cloud earnings” have actually been the same since fiscal Q4 2010 (that’s 7 quarters ago). It is stuck at $0.28 - $0.32 a share since - and remember, these are the fake earnings, the GAAP number has already turned negative (though GAAP paints too much of a negative picture here, as some goodwill charges really should be ignored). Anyway, here is a company having basically no earnings growth for 2 years, and still trading at a PE of 600 (based on GAAP earnings).Disclosure: I am short CRM."
303743,24888,2011-10-31T13:08:10-04:00,,"This weekend fellow Seeking Alpha author Mark Krieger sent me a note on Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM):My answer is below: Strange as it may sound, I believe the rise is driven by fear rather than confidence or faith.I believe it is a classic short squeeze. CRM is more and more recognized as an insanely overvalued stock. It is actually the most overvalued large cap stock on Wall Street. There is simply no other stock with a market cap above $10 Billion that is valued at 8 to 9 times the sales. Then I am not even mentioning that no profits are made on those sales. Earnings per share have declined from profits to losses this year and are forecasted (by the company itself) to get worse further. Management does not even say at which point in the future they expect to return to profitability. When a stock is overvalued like CRM,  it attracts an enormous amount of short sellers. For the layman: these are people that bet on a decline of the stock price, selling shares they (or actually their brokers)  borrow from others. They plan to buy them back at a lower price and give them back to the owner.Furthermore the movements of a hyped stock are mainly driven by overall market sentiment, plus comments of media people and market analysts, who have an influence on sentiment and public opinion. Rather than by fundamentals or true performance of the company. Whitney Tilson, Marc Benioff and Jim Cramer are such people that influence sentiment.So when  Whitney Tilson makes a negative comment on CRM, emphasizing the insane valuation, saying that he is heavily short and expects the stock to crash sooner or later by some 75%, two things happen:First, a lot of retail investors sell the shares they own because they fear that Tilson might be right, and second a lot of retail  investors add to the downward effect by going short, selling shares they don't own. Ofcourse this makes the stock price fall, but the thing is, this fall is driven by weak hands:  1) Fearful stockholders (usually not insiders and major institutional holders) and 2) short sellers looking to make a quick buck on the way down. When the stock does not fall further and starts to move again in the opposite direction, two things happen again: First retail and momentum investors, explaining this as a sign of technical strength, helped by the euphoria about the Europe ""debt deal"", start adding again. But secondly,  the (weak) shorts that had just come in and now see their profit vaporize,  are panicking more and more. Some of them don't even have another choice than to cover (=buy back) at a loss, since they sold on margin. So they are forced to cover by their broker. That is what is called a short squeeze. The more the price rises the more shorts are tempted (or forced) to cover. Greed  is now turning into fear (for a further rise and thus loss). This drives the price up further still.You ask: Was there news? And why is Cramer so in love with the stock? First of all I do not believe for a second that Cramer is in love with the stock, or even likes it. There is no experienced investor that can't see this is an extremely risky stock to own at these levels. And I don't think Cramer is dumb. Secondly Cramer IS the news! It's a media man with influence, whether you agree or disagree to his opinions. In these environments it is not so much what is said, but by whom it is said. You see, take Bernanke, he is usually wrong if you check his track record, there is hardly anything he said that proved to be right, but still when he says something, people react to  it. When he says the economy looks bad, the market tanks. When he says there will not be a double dip, the markets cheer. The majority of investors are mainly gamblers acting on the advice of others.  Uncertain people that can't analyze and decide for themselves, need a golden calf. One-eye is the king in the land of the blind.Cramer is a self proclaimed friend of Marc Benioff.  Who doesn't want to help a friend, promoting his company? And who knows Cramer has no other interests than meets the eye? Anyway, when Cramer pumps something, people react to it, mostly the weaker hands. Just as with Bernanke. It beats me too why people forget so quickly what they said in the past. For example Cramer said in september when CRM was at its last peak of 135: I want you to buy it on monday, this one will roar right back! But 2 weeks later when a caller asked him about CRM, and the stock had fallen back to  115,  he told his viewers ""avoid the MOMO stocks"", they are dangerous now!""   My take is that Cramer is a prime example of ""dumbing down America by the media"".  Maybe that's why his program is called Mad Money. Anyone with a few braincells left would recognize that you might as well have a Chimpansee in a clown suit recommend your stock picks. But Americans seem to have lost their ability to analyze and thus appreciate both as much.Tilson on the other hand, said noting that was wrong or inaccurate. No sensible person can argue that the stock is not insanely overvalued, let alone ""cheap"".  There is of course no rational argument to pay 10 dollars for each dollar revenue, that is not even turning a profit.  In fact there would not be a rational argument to pay 2 dollars for that, unless there would be a promise that the one dollar revenue would grow to 8 dollars revenue in a matter of years, with sizable profits accompanying it.  But with a growth rate of 20% that promise is just not there, neither is there any clarity from management as to when the company is going to turn the current losses into those sizable profits.  I think it's also logical that this clarity cannot be given because Salesforce.com has already razor thin profit margins, and because they offer the most expensive product in a market that is becoming increasingly competitive.Hence, there is nothing strange about Tilson's opinion that the stock could fall back to 25% of its current value. The proof has already been in the pudding with other (even less overblown) MOMO stocks like Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  and Opentable (NASDAQ:OPEN). There is nothing strange about that from a rational point of view. But so far the markets are not behaving rational for Salesforce.com. And this could even go on for a while. Look at Opentable and Netflix. They had bubble valuations at half of their 52 week high, but still they doubled, before collapsing. So if you want to short here, go prepared with deep pockets. You might look against losses before the stock falls back to earth. If you can't take that heat, stay out of the kitchen. As they say, the markets can stay insane longer than you can stay solvent.  Let me put it another way. In just 4 weeks the stock rose from 110 to 139. Based on what? Was there news? Was there a sizable new contract? Was there an earnings report? Did the company change in any way? No, there was nothing! With that rise of 29 dollars (which was the valuation of the whole company 2 years ago) the stock added $3 Billion to its market cap. That is 1.5 times its entire yearly revenue! While there are profitable companies with the same growth, valued at half their revenue! Salesforce.com is now valued at 10 times its (unprofitable) revenue! Is it insane? ... Of course it is insane! There is also nothing inaccurate about Tilson's view that Marc Benioff is a very good salesman for his company, especially towards the investor community. I would even go a step further saying that it looks like a con job. You see, I have noticed that investors are hardly aware of the real GAAP Earnings of Salesforce.com. And Benioff does nothing to lift the veil. However, in almost every analysis of Salesforce.com , the high PE is still mentioned as a reason for concern. Currently the PE sits above 600. Which essentially means that  it would take 600 years to earn your investment back if profits  remain the same. But immediately the forward PE (which is the PE forecasted for 12 months from now)  is used a counter argument because it doesn't look nearly as bad. I believe that most analysts use this argument unwittingly, not knowing that they mix apples with oranges. But I cannot stress enough how false this argument is. Because the forward PE is based on NON GAAP EPS, not on true GAAP EPS, as the current PE is. And nobody gets this!  Except Benioff  and some others that don't want to make you wiser. So the forward PE will eventually turn into a current PE,  when it will no longer be based on NON GAAP estimates, but on the actual GAAP earnings that the SEC requires. It  will prove to be  much higher than the current PE of 600. It is in fact more than 10 fold of that.  I estimate it to be at least 10000 in the quarters to come. This would mean it would take 10000 years for an investor to make your investment back if profits would remain the same. In a year from now there will not be a PE left at all, since the company has forecasted a GAAP net loss for the full fiscal year. So there are no Earnings to calculate a Price/Earnings ratio from.   The source of this assurance is not me, but the company itself. The only difference between them and me is that they don't want to publish it widely, while I think that is bordering to deceit, that should be declared illegal. Let me explain again:The forward PE of Salesforce.com is NOT 74, it is 10,000 or N/A.That forward PE of 74 is based on NON GAAP earnings. The trailing PE is based on GAAP. Nobody gets this. So the bad news will come for sure, unless you don't think a PE of 10000 and negative EPS (=loss) this quarter is bad news.Investors don't like high PE's? Then the real plunge of Salesforce.com will come with earnings in november. The PE will jump to 10000 then (now 600). Let me illustrate again with a previous post: The current PE of 600 is calculated on the last 4 quarters. 15 + 8 + 0 -3 = 20 cents. The company has forecasted a 11 cents loss for the full year, of which two quarters have passed now. These two quarters totalled a 3 cents loss, so let's assume the remainder of 8 cents loss will be spread equally over next two quarters, 4 cents loss each. The new 4 quarters will then be: 80-3-4= 1 cents EPS. So after next quarter, if the stock price remains the same, the PE will be: 12,000. Twenty times the current PE of 600, as the EPS is twenty times less, than the 20 cents of the previous 4 quarters. Whether investors can still tolerate that, after already paying 9 times projected sales, we'll have to wait and see ...Maybe this funny clip pictures it better than my thousand words.Disclosure: I am short CRM."
301879,24123,2011-10-25T11:04:13-04:00,,"We've written extensively about how Salesforce.com is able to beat its own revenue guidance every single quarter. To recap, the company collects the most/all of its license fees up front. Then, it recognizes the fees into revenue ratable over the life of its licensing contracts. There's nothing inherently wrong with this accounting, but it does serve to make revenue very predictable, and it artificially inflates cash flow so long as the business is growing. Since CRM can predict its revenues with a high degree of confidence in the future, it lowballs its guidance, manufactures a ""beat,"" and claims that this is evidence of a robust business performing better than anyone imagined.Last week, this story got more interesting.  Salesforce.com salespeople have been sending out emails offering discounted pricing for customers who sign up between now and the end of the quarter. Now, for the long term health of the business, it's crazy to discount a service just to sell it before the end of a quarter. It shouldn't make any difference whether you sell your service before or after the end of the quarter, especially if you have to offer substantial discounts to make the sale before. However, as we've said time and time again, the long term health of the business isn't CRM management's concern. Rather, they're focused on keeping the reported figures one step ahead of increasingly lofty expectations.We're cautious about reading too much into these promotional emails, but the fact that Salesforce hasn't sent out offers like this in recent quarters could be telling. Perhaps the company's new business has been weak this quarter, and it's doing whatever it can to engineer another ""amazing"" (CEO Benioff's favorite word) earnings report next month.It can't be emphasized enough that this discounting policy is not in the long term interest of shareholders. It's better for the company to sell something at full price in a few weeks than at a discounted price today. Either CRM is trying to pull sales forward from the future, or competition is intensifying. Perhaps both factors are at work. However, there is no way to construe this sales tactic as being advantageous for shareholders.This is yet another on a long list of reasons why Salesforce.com is our highest conviction short.Disclosure: I am short CRM."

After all, software is available for Engineers, Architects, Scientists, etc. to perform their jobs, so why not software for Salespersons and Marketers? Developing customer relationship marketing software in-house is very expensive and resource consuming. Salesforce.com's products enable companies to use their resources more effectively for efforts directly related to their business operations and less toward the tangential, but very import, business areas related to sales and marketing.Salesforce.com has been on an acquisition spree with recent acquisitions of Jigsaw, Heroku and Radian6. The company has also been on a growth spurt by adding 6300 new net customers last quarter for a total of 104,000 current customers. Salesforce.com grew revenue 38% over last year and just recently added U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Moderate Level of authority, which means the company can do more business with the U.S. government. As a matter of fact, one of salesforce.com's larger 8-digit deals was with the GSA for 12,000 users.Salesforce.com is delivering on the cloud by providing software and applications which are easy and fast to implement and support industry open standards.The company has also been winning a lot of deals when going head-to-head with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). In its most recent quarterly earnings conference call, the company indicated it's Chatter product is the largest, most actively used social network in the world. Chatter enables companies to set up their own personal social network for company related efforts. I'm sure Facebook would have something to say about this, but it sounds like Chatter is getting a lot of traction.In the conference call, the company indicted it has not seen any indications of another recession, as observed prior to the recession in 2008 and 2009. The company also indicated that it is not implementing a hiring freeze, as has been rumored.With a backward looking P/E of 550 and a forward looking P/E of 60, the company's stock is very expensive right now. As can be seen by the company's stock chart shown below, the next support level is around $100, so if any negative news occurs related to the company, the stock price could drop to $100 very quickly.For those of you wanting to invest in salesforce.com, but are a little wary of the stock's rich premium, you might consider entering a collar for the stock. A collar is entered by selling a call option against a purchased or existing stock and using some of the proceeds from selling the call option to purchase a put option for protection or insurance against a large drop in the price of the stock.For example, using our stock option search engine, a collar position for CRM is available with a potential return of 2.2% with a maximum loss of 7.1% with the time frame for realizing the profit is only 19 days. The details for the position include a selling a 2011 October 110 call option and purchasing a 2011 October 100 put option. The profit/loss graph for the collar position is shown below:Additionally, the CRM collar will realize the 2.2% return as long as the price of CRM is greater than $110 at expiration in October. This means CRM can drop in price $3.73 from its current price and the collar will return 2.2% at expiration. And, if the price of CRM drops below $107, the position is protected by the put option and the larget possible loss is 7.1%.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
301844,22263,2011-10-25T09:23:52-04:00,,"In Dec 2010 I wrote an article, Exasperation with the Salesforce Bears. The theme of the article remains very much intact; in fact, the argument is all the more pertinent in light of subsequent events.The gravity-defying valuation of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) continues to baffle me. And cost me money through my short. The gist of my argument is as follows:Yes, all you rational Salesforce bears, I am so with you on the ludicrous valuation, all the more glaring in today's bear market...BUT: The bullish broker analysts (i.e., all of them - weird, isn't it?) will tell you the future revenue space is potentially the entire current revenue of SAP (SAP) and Oracle (ORCL), who have really lagged in providing an on-line SAAS hosted service in the 'cloud'.The bullish brokers will also tell you that these legacy players who have huge vested interests in the existing software paradigm (true) will not adapt it to provide a SAAS offering (false; they have, albeit with huge delays and disappointments). But as of two weeks ago, Oracle has a legitimate and competitive offering (and now own RightNow (NASDAQ:RNOW) and SAP's conferences imply theirs is very imminent. So the bull says, CRM will grow its revenue into its market cap. (PS, I totally disagree; it's very reminiscent of the dotcom argument where Amazon (AMZN) would one day sell 30% of the world's books, CDs, sofas etc).But the cloud picture gets murkier. Salesforce.com is effectively just that: a customer relationship management tool. Yes, with lots of bells and whistles, but still a CRM package. The partial success it has had with large enterprises (i.e. with ERP systems like SAP or Oracle is when CRM's software sits on top of the integrated ERP (mostly on top of an Oracle database and middleware, with perhaps VMware (NYSE:VMW)), discrete and as an added tool to the front line staff. It’s perfect for people/sales orientated companies (like insurance brokers or real estate agents) and yes, they have had some success. However, any company with a manufacturing or complex business process (i.e. Fortune 500) would be far better off adding the CRM module from SAP or Oracle to its existing software. Granted, both incumbents have dragged their feet at entering the cloud, but this in itself points to the complexity of transferring a custom-built ERP system to the cloud paradigm, and (finally!) these are now available for both the software giants. So what's Salesforce.com's future growth rate? Have the bulls factored in the gigantic marketing budget and determination Oracle has, as evidenced in its recent OpenWorld Conference (Oct 2011), to penetrate the SAAS CRM space? Larry Ellison isn't kidding - he never is.So when investors muse about CRM, they are wrong to brand it as a springboard into the enterprise for cloud computing; it’s more an isolated appendage sitting on top of the enterprise’s main nervous system, the ERP. More importantly: This stock has defied/exceeded even the most absurd dotcom-like comparisons for at least a year. Nothing stops its ascent: massive and direct insider selling (in the last six months, 239 sales versus zero purchases - wow!), dilutive acquisitions, Microsoft (MSFT) offering a cheaper CRM, a negative GAAP earnings forecast, and my favourite, the CEO saying he swims with dolphins weekly.It has cost me a ton, and I remain resolute. Stop loss does not exist in my vocabulary. I believe in rational markets, and this is the most absurd valuation in my career. But through sheer pain and bewilderment, I will confidently say there is something going on with CRM trading that will decimate any bear. Over the last two years it has outperformed the S&P by 87% and continues its gravity-defying ascent this year (up relative 19% to market) to lob another $2.7Bn onto its capitalisation. And it will not fall.Many bulls have highlighted the 600+ P/E on GAAP earnings being a delusion. However, in my book, stock compensation to employees is as legitimate a cost as any, even if we are floating in a cloud. And the current price/sales ratio of 9 stands out like a sore thumb in the software space (the acquisition of RNOW by ORCL with the premium on 23 Oct was done at a P/S of 5.9 and it has a GAAP P/E of 55; this is all the more galling because after all costs none of Salesforce.com's sales filter down to the net profit line on a GAAP basis).One day all will be revealed. My conjecture: two hedge funds trading it back and forth, huge volumes, in bed with Benioff who officially still owns a ton, but used to sell 10,000 a day; or maybe a QE3 derivative funded by the Fed and transacted via the investment banks as the last desperate hope of the American renaissance dream - a la Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - which will restore America's dominance over a shrinking mercantilist empire).But until then, this will rip off any and every bear's trousers.To repeat the valuation metrics of Oracle's bid for RightNow, after the bid premium:  RNOW P/S 5.9, GAAP P/E 55. CRM: P/S 8.91 GAAP PE +600It’s nigh time for rain from Salesforce.com's cloud. Investors, beware the deluge.Disclosure: I am short CRM."
292367,22148,2011-09-08T07:53:56-04:00,,"When reading through the recent Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) Dreamforce Analyst Session presentation (obtain from the upper right hand corner box), a reader should be constantly struck by the desire to grow at all costs. Both Sales & Marketing and Research & Development costs soared beyond the rate of revenue growth. Another striking point is slide 55 that shows how the FY12 Guidance Midpoint for revenue has increased by $185M or roughly 9% while the Non-GAAP EPS has dropped. Now the earnings drop is mostly associated with the purchase of Radian6, but it further highlights how CRM is buying revenue.The company claims that the payoff better positions them for future growth. Growth at a cost, no doubt. With the company reporting $2.1B in annualized revenue, now might be the time to strop growing at the sake of profits. The expectation is that it'll increase the bottom line as it reaches maturity. One has to wonder if the cloud space breaks down the barriers to competition. Will a customer using a cloud service be that loyal when they aren't tied into expensive computer systems and software as in the past? Won't it be easier to switch from a cloud system than an operating system such as Windows from MSFT or SAP when those companies hit major growth scenarios?Defining Period For Dominant Software Leaders Slide 16 highlights the aspirations of the company based on past software leaders like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and SAP (NYSE:SAP). Apparently the sweet spot of growth is from $2B to $8B in revenue. My guess though is that the other companies were making cash hand over fist as they entered the dominant phase. Not to mention, due to inflation that sweet spot has surely increased dramatically, maybe even doubling.CRM is interestingly following the Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) model of huge spending to fuel fast growth. Ultimately, even the low margins lead to nice profits. Investors appear happy with the plan as the company trades at a lofty forward P/E of 67. What happens though if the sector turns them into the Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) of cloud computing? AKAM remains a dominate play in CDN though margins have come under great pressure as competitors line up to chip away at customers, and hence, profitability.Why not strive to be like all the other companies it lists or even the dominant tech company of the day in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)? AAPL proves that superior products and services should not only command a premium price, but sell themselves without massive outsized expenses.Growth At All Cost When reviewing the Q2 earnings report, one should be struck by the highlights seen below:Did you catch the number that doesn't fit in that section? Seems like playing a kids game of finding the number that doesn't fit in the sequence. For a company with 38% revenue growth that dominates the cloud CRM space, it sure seems poor for operating cash flow to only grow 9%. Oh, and where is the mention of earnings per share?Marketing & Sales expenses are a whopping 52% of sales. Though of the opinion that CRM has built a better system, my thought process comes into question when realizing that it takes more sales reps to keep revenue growth a float. The software apparently doesn't sell itself no matter how appealing.Controversial Accounting Recently an analyst from Bernstein Research, Mark Moerdler, asserted that CRM has substantially increased its reported results with the use of aggressive accounting practices. By far the biggest claim is that CRM capitalizes sales commissions instead of expensing them as incurred. While not illegal, the analyst claims the typical software company follows the more conservative model of immediate expensing.While understanding the analyst's point of view, generally, even as a CPA I don't understand the accounting view that expensing commissions immediately and recognizing revenue over the period of the contract is valid. Sure, the expense is already spent, but it doesn't match the revenue with the expense. Ultimately though, with cash going out for the commission and cash coming in for the service, the cash flow statement might be a better view of this company.The other issues are rather tame and I don't see them as a limiting factor for investing in this stock.Conclusion CRM can only be played as a momentum stock. When the song ends and the legs of growth are gone, the multiple will compress faster than a competitor will develop a better software system.Slide 27 should scare any investor out of holding this stock. The chart shows how revenue growth has gone from 20% to 35%+ while S&M headcount growth has swollen from 10% to 50%+. Those aren't the trends a dominate software player should have after surpassing a $2B run rate.Oddly, the market rewarded them for surpassing revenue growth targets and gave them a pass on earnings. This will not last.Disclosure: I am long MSFT."
300083,22300,2011-10-17T15:01:17-04:00,,"To put it bluntly, I find Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) to be one of the most overhyped, overvalued companies of all-time. I'm not a fan of short selling in an environment characterized by inflationary monetary policy, though for those suspecting a collapse in equities is in the works, Salesforce remains one of my favorite potential shorts. Here's why:1. A P/E ratio of 650+ is a bit comical, and reminds me of Bubble 1.0 days. Defenders of such outlandish P/E ratios suggest that such a high ratio reflects market expectations of growth. I've never been entirely comfortable with this argument, but even if we do accept it, I do not find Salesforce to be much of a growth opportunity. While enterprise-based cloud computing has huge growth potential, Salesforce's approach of delivering software as a service (SaaS) solutions is not the way this opportunity is actualized. Rather, open source solutions, such as SugarCRM, are far better positioned to meet the customizability needs as well as data security concerns of enterprise customers -- both of which are likely to grow as cloud computing continues its disruption of enterprise computing.2. The company's current liabilities have grown for each of the past four quarters; the same cannot be said for its current assets, which suggests the current ratio is declining. This is not favorable in regards to the macroeconomic trends; as the global debt crisis grows, the most appealing companies will be those with no debt or little debt that is declining, as well as those that issue dividends. Salesforce meets neither criteria, and thus is out of sync with the macroeconomy in many ways.3. Technically, we may find some low risk opportunities in shorting here. Resistance at 140 provides us with some ideas as to where to put a stop-loss; the highs recently reached above 160 suggest buying demand may be exhausted, and a more pronounced bear sets in.Salesforce reminds me very much of the Bubble 1.0 heyday, in which Pets.com, TheGlobe.com, CDNow, and other companies received preposterous valuations and P/E ratios based on the notion that the technology sector could grow much, much more. This belief is true, but the way companies like Salesforce are pursuing this opportunity is not the correct path. Look for companies rooted in open source software development targeting the enterprise to capture the earnings that Salesforce is targeting. In due time, such companies may capture investment dollars from the market that previously went to Salesforce as well.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
295944,22996,2011-09-26T12:45:43-04:00,,"I get up every morning feeling pretty spry. It doesn’t hurt to get out of bed, and I’ve got lots of energy. I should. I’m only 38 -- I’m getting up there, but I’m still pretty young.And while I’m relatively young, especially in investing terms, I remember well the valuations that were assigned to technology and internet stocks in the late '90s. Even with the financial panic of 2008 in the interim, the tech bubble is still very clear in my memory.Because my memory of the tech bubble and the brutal aftermath for investors in internet stocks is so clear, I have to wonder, just how young are the investors willing to hold shares of Salesforce.com today? Because they can’t seem to remember that holdings stocks at nosebleed multiples ends badly.I’ve got no problem with Salesforce.com as a company; I think it is doing fine. But the company can’t control how ridiculous or pessimistic the valuation Mr. Market assigns might be. It is the responsibility of investors to recognize when Mr. Market has lost touch with the true value of a business. And I think in the case of Salesforce.com, Mr. Market is forgetting that valuation eventually matters.My primary method of valuing a business is by looking at its free cash flow yield. Here is what Salesforce.com looks like for 2011:With a share count of 136 million fully diluted shares and a share price of $125, Saleforce.com has a market capitalization of about $17 billion. Deduct the $1.3 billion in cash and marketable securities and the Salesforce.com enterprise value is $15.7 billion.That means a free cash yield of: $369 million / $15.7 billion = 2.3%. Invert that and you are looking at a free cash flow multiple of 100/2.3 = 43 times. That looks about as appetizing to me as the yield on Treasuries these days.It is quite possible that Salesforce.com can keep growing for the next five years and justify the current share price. The question I have, though, is what can the company possibly due to expand the multiple the market is assigning? This is a company priced for perfection.A rule of thumb for high-growth companies is that the P/E multiple should roughly equal the rate of growth. Over time, simply due to the laws of large numbers, growth has to slow. Companies can’t grow at 30% per year indefinitely.   When growth does eventually slow, the multiple of any fast-growing company is likely to contract.   Consider Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Dell (NYSE:DELL) and every other tech company that is sitting with the same share price it had over 10 years ago.And what if Salesforce.com stumbles for a year and growth halts? How far can the company stock price fall? A long way, I’d say. A no growth company might typically trade a multiple of 10x; if Saleforce.com were to trade at 10X free cash flow it would be a $4 billion company. That isn’t much more than 25% of the current share price, which values the business at roughly $16 billion.To have investment success holding or buying a company at the kind of multiple that Salesforce.com is trading,  the company needs have years and years of very high growth. That is hard to do, especially as competitors are attracted to the high growth and make life more difficult.This is not the kind of investment that interests me. Operating perfection required for any hope of making money at the current share price. Huge downside if the company starts to struggle.What Are Insiders Doing?Apparently insiders are in my camp when it comes to holding Salesforce.com at current valuation multiples.A quick look at the last six months of activity from insiders shows zero insider buys totaling zero shares, and    239 insider sells totaling 1,193,000 shares.This is a good company doing good things. But valuation matters. Old timers like me learned that by watching the great tech bubble companies valuations collapse. I think Salesforce.com investors are forgetting that experience.You want to make your bet on good companies like this when the market is pricing them as being average. Not when the market is pricing them for perfection. You can be excited about the company and its product, but at the same time be apprehensive about the valuation the stock market is assigning. And I think that is what is required here.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
295442,22829,2011-09-22T18:29:53-04:00,,"By Brenon DalyJust several months after putting money into Assistly in its second  round of funding, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) decided Wednesday to pick up the whole  startup for $50 million. The purchase should help the SaaS giant extend its  customer service offering, Service Cloud, to small businesses. Founded  in 2009, Assistly had drawn in more than 1,000 customers, although not  all of those are paying. (Salesforce.com declined to give a breakdown on  paying vs. nonpaying customers, but indicated revenue at the startup  was a tiny amount.)The acquisition marks the third time Salesforce.com has stepped into  the M&A market to bolster its customer service product. Three years  ago, it reached for InstraNet,  a startup that was led by Alex Dayton, who continues in an executive  role for the customer service offering at Salesforce.com. A year ago, Salesforce.com quietly added Activa Live.  (Although terms weren’t disclosed, we suspect the bill for that  purchase probably only ran in the single digits of millions of dollars.)  The net result of those acquisitions – along with healthy organic  growth – is that Service Cloud is now the largest single product outside Salesforce.com’s core sales force automation product.Additionally, Salesforce.com says Assistly will be part of its  upcoming launch of a ""small business cloud"" product. In that, Assistly  will be joining the collaboration offering that Salesforce.com picked up  with its acquisition of SMB-focused startup Manymoon in February. The  reason for the new downmarket products is pretty clear when you remember  that Salesforce.com gets roughly one-third of its overall revenue from  small businesses."
294445,21727,2011-09-19T09:44:30-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is in the glamorous field of cloud computing and as far as Wall Street is concerned, the company seems to be immune from encroaching competition when considering the outlandish valuation Mr. Market seems to be stuck on. The fact is, much of CRM’s valuation is attributable to short covering and momentum players piling on, rather than stellar fundamentals, making the case for a bubble pop even more compelling.Rich multiple: Even though the shares are down 12% from their all time highs, the stock is still too expensive, at a steep 104 multiple of 2012 earnings estimates of $1.31. If you factor in a 39% earnings hike (no easy task) in 2013 to $1.82, the multiple is more reasonable at 75, but still high. The company’s liquidity is strong, containing enough cash to offset its long term debt, but its price to book multiple is no bargain at about 13 times.Insider’s penchant to selling: insiders have sold 1.2 million shares within the last six months and have made no open market purchases. CFO Graham Smith has initiated five separate sale transactions in the last three weeks alone, dumping a total of 16,952 shares, for a cool $2.2 million. This type of selling creates uncertainty and the impression of a “pump and dump” activity occurring. As a consequence, longs should have protective stops in place to minimize their risk.Bottom line: The analyst one year mean price target of $155 implies current appreciation potential of 13%, which is poor in relation to the amount of risk exposure the equity carries (about 30% downside). On the other hand, the stock seems to be a crowd favorite with plenty of momentum (along with Cramer’s blessing), so shorts should have “buy stops” in place to minimize their risk.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
294016,24279,2011-09-15T19:38:46-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is an über-equity. Not only has it been a meal ticket for investors since it went public in 2004, but it also has the goods with its spoil of riches to make it the leader in the technology counter-revolution against companies of yesteryear in what is being dubbed as the turf battle for Cloud 2.0. The company has upped the ante by making many acquisitions in the past three years to bolster its offerings in the social media space for the enterprise. Jigsaw Data, Heroku, Dimdim, Manymoon and, Radian6 are all recent newcomers to the expanding Salesforce.com family.Conference calls are a lot like performance art, and Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff is quite the orator with a fountain of information. In the May 19th, 2011, Q1 Conference Call, and, the August 18th, 2011, Q2 Conference Call, he gives his no-holds-barred opinion of the direction the company is taking. I got a real education in some of its new initiatives in Cloud 2.0. He also takes potshots at the competition, specifically companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and, SAP (NYSE:SAP). Really spices up the presentations. For the majority of this posting, I will quote liberally from the two most recent earnings transcripts.First of all, we need to set the record straight as to what exactly Cloud 2.0 is. Cloud 2.0 is Salesforce.com's strategic decision to bring social, mobile and open cloud technologies to the enterprise. They do this with a new service called Chatter. Chatter channels its inner Facebook and Twitter and brings them to corporations. As the ""mad scientist"" of the cloud, Benioff explains: ""I'm thrilled to tell you more than 100,000 companies are now actively using Chatter, making it our most successful product introduction ever. We believe that Chatter is the largest, most actively used social network in the world. These aren't 100,000 trials, these are 100,000 active social networks.""Chatter was released in June of 2010, and, ramped up very quickly because of Salesforce.com's base of over 100,000 clients that utilize their existing product portfolio of business software. The company has lofty horizons, too, because of their dominant position in enterprise software-as-a-service: ""Of course, we're going to be the biggest cloud player, but we want to be one of the top five software companies in the world. That's our next goal. You've seen us pass $2 billion, you're going to see us pass $3 billion,"" ays Benioff, who is the co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer. He wears a lot of hats, and he's not shy about throwing them in the ring.Benioff talks more about Chatter as a selling tool to obtain his elevated ambition: ""There is no sexier demo and no more exciting place to enter a company than with Chatter. We did not have a product that CEOs were using before. And when you see those CEOs using that product on their iPads, that is the kind of positioning we want that we want to be able to go into the C-suite with a strong clear message of, ""How do increase your productivity, get your company going faster and get greater alignment and collaboration?"" That's what Chatter is all about. But in terms of building a social enterprise, well, it's much more than just Chatter, it's about the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud and Force.com, Heroku, Radian6 and all the other technology that we have.""Chatter appears to be an incredible product, but has some limitations because it's an intra-organizational social media tool. However, the newly acquired Radian6 expands the Salesforce.com tentacles by not only amalgamating with Chatter, but, by increasing its functionality because it's an extra-organizational social media platform. Benioff articulates: ""We completed our purchase of Radian6, the leading platform for monitoring, engaging the millions of conversations happening every day on Facebook, on Twitter, on social communities, on websites. Soon, customers will be able to monitor and join in these public conversations from within our products, including Chatter.""Later in the Q1 Q&A session, he goes on to say: ""I think that Radian6 is a super-exciting product. I think we are extremely fortunate to be able to acquire this company. It's on a revenue tear, as you know. It's probably the fastest-growing of all the cloud computing companies that I've ever seen."" Fast-forward to the Q2 Q&A session, Benioff continues his praise for the newly absorbed company: ""Radian6 is the first company we've bought where we really feel like it's transforming the company. But what Radian6 did was it opened our eyes to the opportunities in the social enterprise.""In the conference calls for both Q1 and Q2, the CEO had choice words for his competitors. As an example, here is his assessment of Microsoft: ""Our flagship, Sales Cloud, continued to crush the competition in the quarter. Microsoft's desperate strategy of underfunding, pricing with undifferentiated and highly proprietary products basically has had the same impact on our business as the Windows tablet and Zune did against the iPad and iPod. We call Microsoft's strategy, ""the Zune strategy"" ... Customers continue to want visionary products that give them a competitive advantage, not the me-too Zune-type products locking them into these old, proprietary, desktop-driven platforms that are dying off."" Benioff expresses similar sentiment toward technology elder statesmen Oracle and SAP. Essentially, he's saying ""put that in your pipe and smoke it.""I originally covered Salesforce.com on February 17th, 2011 in an article titled Valuations Sky High For Cloud Leader. And as the title suggests, I thought that investors would have to pay a price premium for the stock. I did not recommend buying it. At the time of the writing, the stock was selling at $140/share. It currently trades at $126, 9.6% below what it was going for in February. It did get as high as $160 this summer, but has since sold off along with the overall market. I prefer to own stocks for a number of years, not a number of days, so the month to month gyrations of the market aren't as critical to me as a short-term investor.Looking at its current consensus earnings estimates on Yahoo Finance, we get $1.31/share, which gives it a P/E Ratio of 97. With an estimated five-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 28%, we get a PEG ratio of 3.5. That's very pricey, but we're heading into 2012, so let's look at the estimates for next year's numbers. For 2012, earnings are projected to be $1.83/share, which breaks down to a P/E Ratio of 69 and a PEG Ratio of 2.5. I still think that's too expensive, even for a quality company like Salesforce.com.As far as analyst opinions on Yahoo Finance are concerned, 27 give it a buy or a strong buy, 11 say to hold the stock (which is not an endorsement), and three go out on the limb and say to sell it. Cloud software stocks are hot right now, so you may want to play this sector. However, if you are more value oriented, and still want to take advantage of a nascent industry, look to the infrastructure plays. Both NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV) are selling at very reasonable valuations these days.

292455,24276,2011-09-08T11:50:27-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) CEO Marc Benioff (right) made headlines this week railing against VMWare (NYSE:VMW) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) for selling what he termed a ""false cloud.""It's true a fog of war has enveloped the cloud space as companies like Salesforce, as well as VMWare, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Rackspace (NYSE:RAX) and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) try to defend their eye-popping PE ratios from the enterprise computing pack.There are three main cloud plays investors need to understand:Everyone in the enterprise computing space is now spouting a strategy based on some combination of the above. What Benioff calls “false cloud” is the idea that current enterprise stacks – hardware with an operating system, databases at the center, applications built on the databases – can be quickly evolved into anything like what he's selling, and what investors should be buying.The big money investors are throwing at cloud companies represents faith that he's right, that the current enterprise stack is a dinosaur, and that the economics of a cloud that can turn the might of a fully-distributed system onto problems on a dime, with virtual operating systems, and hosting that drives out all extraneous costs, is the wave of the future.Why should this be true? Because social networks like Facebook, Groupon and LinkedIn (LNKD) are simply open source applications, built by small teams and run on clouds. All of them were able to scale infinitely with demand, at minimal cost, generating traffic and revenue in the time it would take an enterprise company to describe what it wanted to do.The cloud boom is built on social networking's success.That kind of speed-to-market, on a cost structure even a start-up could love, was unheard of until just a few years ago. Facebook could not have been built on the Internet of 1998. It would have taken many years, hundreds of employees, tens of millions of dollars. But today it can reach a valuation in the tens of billions in just a few years, based on its mastery of cloud computing.Which brings us back to Benioff and cloud profits. What he's arguing is that he has the full Facebook, Software as a Service – not just infrastructure, not just a platform – that lets his customers gain the economic advantages of the cloud, and justify investors' faith.Meanwhile HP (NYSE:HPQ), Dell (NYSE:DELL), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and every other enterprise player is building out their own public-private cloud, committing to some stack of cloud software, and telling customers to be patient.This threatens Type 1 and Type 2 clouds, the hosts and the software companies. What Benioff is saying is it doesn't threaten him, that his “real cloud” is way ahead of the pack, because it can do now what those parts companies are only promising to do later.What investors need to decide is whether business customers move as fast as Benioff believes, whether entrepreneurs might replace those customers, using systems like Salesforce, before the big boys can move, and thus whether CRM's sky-high valuation is worth it.I say no. Clouds are an innovation, but clouds are coming to Earth. In the end the fog of computing war will prevail. Sell the cloud revolution, but buy cloud evolution.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
291937,22829,2011-09-06T18:11:56-04:00,,"By Brenon DalyAt the rate Marc Benioff is going, we have to wonder how long it will  be until he renames the company he founded. Or at the very least,  shouldn’t Benioff, who founded salesforce.com in 1999 and continues to  serve as the company’s CEO, be thinking about swapping the company’s  current ticker (NYSE:CRM) for something that captures the broad,  all-encompassing vision for the ’social enterprise’ that he laid out at  last week’s Dreamforce?After all, the company’s core sales force automation (SFA) product  barely merited a mention at the conference. Instead, most of the  attention was directed toward upgrades and expansions to the Chatter and  Radian6 offerings, as well as moves to broaden its two main platform  plays, Heroku and Force.com. As such, Dreamforce dramatically  underscored just how much of salesforce.com’s future has been staked on  its M&A program.Of course, virtually all tech vendors use acquisitions to change the  trajectory of their business, whether it’s a slight nudge in some new  direction through a tactical purchase (Informatica comes to mind) or  roll-the-dice-and-bet-the-company transformational transactions (Dell  and, more painfully right now, Hewlett-Packard.) But hardly any other  tech company (with the possible exception of VMware) has used M&A so  consistently to expand beyond its original offering while still  managing to preserve an acrophobia-inducing valuation.Just consider the role that acquired companies played in announcements around salesforce.com’s conference:Altogether, salesforce.com noted that non-SFA offerings – in other  words, products and technology that got significant boosts through  acquired IP or engineers – accounted for a full 20% of second-quarter  revenue. (That was the first time the company has broken out revenue for  its new products.) Given that salesforce.com booked nearly $550m in Q2  revenue, that would imply non-SFA sales of about $110m. To be clear,  very little of that amount has come directly from the acquired  companies, all of which were still in their early days. Instead, it’s  the net result of the ‘buy and build’ approach at salesforce.com."

Stock market bulls focus on the secular growth potential as well as their solid growth.  Bears focus on the pricey valuations.  The stock trades at a trailing P/E of 302.2, a forward P/E of 75.9 and a price/sales of 11.5 despite skimpy profit margins of 3.89%.Despite these concerns of bulls and bears, there is one factor that they can both agree on.  Salesforce.com's directors and executives have large stock ownership that should ensure their interests are aligned with those of shareholders.IMPRESSIVE MANAGEMENT STOCK OWNERSHIPAs of December 31, 2010, current directors and executive officers beneficially owned 9.5% of the company's total common shares.  Shareholder ownership is one of the most important ways to ensure that management interests are aligned with those of shareholders.  But it is insufficient to say that management owns shares.  The actual size of the management stock ownership is also important because it allows investors to understand management's relative incentive structure.  If a manager owns $1,000,000 of stock, but earns $10,000,000 in salary, the manager's stock ownership is meaningful in absolute terms, but relative to the salary, the manager is more motivated to keep its job rather than increase stock price.  While job security and stock price performance are positively related, it is an imperfect relationship.  As such, the 9.5% ownership stake among directors and officers is a great catalyst.STRONG INCENTIVE TO SUCCEEDSalesforce.com's upper level managers have a strong incentive to succeed because of their large potential change of control payments.  These terms are vital because they inspire management to aggressively grow the company and possibly attract the attention of other industry players.  While this may already seem implicit to their jobs, it's an important incentive to properly align managerial interests with those of shareholders.  Without meaningful change of control payments, management may consciously or subconsciously hinder sales.SUMMARYThere are a lot of different factors that go into determining whether a stock is a good value, but lost in the debate over Salesforce.com's prospects is the fact that CRM's management is motivated to benefit shareholders.  While this incentive is not enough to ensure strong corporate prospects, it is a catalyst that investors should consider.  Management's shareholder friendly incentives are a good thing and represent a positive potential catalyst that bulls and bears can agree about.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

We expect it to have a 21% share of the global CRM market by the end of the forecast period.Salesforce.com also revised its guidance for FY2012 to $2.22 billion –  $2.23 billion in revenues, which is slightly slightly higher than our  expectations.(Chart created using Trefis' app)Rising Expenses Remain a WorryWhile the revenue growth has been encouraging, Salesforce.com’s operating expenses have been increasing at an even faster rate. Its operating expenses as a percentage of revenue have ballooned to more than 80% this quarter compared to around 72% last year. Salesforce.com has been unable to control its sales & marketing expenses, which remains a cause for concern investors.We believe that investor concerns on rising costs are primarily what led to the slump in shares following its earnings release.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

285799,24318,2011-08-08T20:09:41-04:00,,"Anyone who’s used multiple CRM programs before switching to Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) can usually attest to the quality and efficiency that Salesforce provides. Of course, the firm is much more than a CRM provider, but that is where it really built its name, breaking away from the traditional enterprise software model of sending out software on CDs. Today, the firm stands tall as an industry innovator on multiple fronts ranging from software distribution to subscription revenue modeling. It’s been deemed a headache “solver” for small-to-medium-sized businesses by helping reduce the need for specialized IT personnel. It’s easy to conclude that Salesforce.com has done everything right and the company looks like a great company going forward.  But we don’t take that view.Salesforce has definitely done plenty of things correctly, but looking ahead, much uncertainty remains. New and lucrative areas like cloud computing are as appealing as they are dangerous. And large players like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (NYSE:SAP)  , and   Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) loom in the background, always looking to replicate Salesforce’s successes. Easier said than done, of course, but hungry sharks are still hungry sharks. In our view, Salesforce is a great company but a horrible stock to own, given its valuation metrics, need for continued substantial growth to sustain the stock price and volatile profit margins.  1. Paying an Arm and a Leg No matter how you slice or dice the major price-multiple valuations, investors are paying an arm and a leg – even though the firm has achieved spectacular top-line growth over the short- and long-term.  All these current price-multiple valuations are also higher the 5-year averages for these respective numbers. The numbers speak pretty clearly about how overvalued the firm is from a price-multiple perspective - whether it’s compared to the industry average or index averages. In our view with these price-multiple valuations Salesforce has no room to fall short of market expectations. 2. Extreme Growth Needed to Sustain Stock Price The biggest issue facing the price of Salesforce.com’s stock is the company’s growth numbers. One way or another, investors are paying dearly for strong and sustained top line growth. We’re concerned about how long Salesforce can sustain this pace given its current product portfolio. Although the firm is expanding into other areas such as cloud computing, that could be anybody’s game. Salesforce’s previous innovations don’t it will continually out-school entrenched competitors like SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft. These companies didn’t get to their size by sitting at the top of the mountain. Instead, they looked around for someone else’s mountain to take so they could expand. These strong competitors see Salesforce as prime target in cloud computing. If Salesforce fails to respond, the stock will likely drop like a rock.3. Yo-Yo Profitability Salesforce profit margins are yo-yo-like. They’re up, they’re down, they’re sideways. They go in about every direction you can imagine.  Given the firm’s maturity it’s surprising that almost half (46%) of the revenue is still eaten up by marketing expenses. That’s a huge issue. Salesforce must find a more scalable business approach that allows it to increase profit margins. That might not do much about margin volatility but at least the firm would be working off a higher point.  Margin volatility primarily revolves around locking up large deals, which reduce the firm’s acquisition cost per subscriber and effectively scale. Even then, we remain somewhat concerned since the firm’s attrition rate bounces around in the mid-teens. Thus, even Salesforce can start landing large deals, there would still be a whole other can of worms relative to attrition and the reliance on a smaller base of large deals than a larger base of smaller deals. Conclusion: Salesforce is a great company that offers a great service. But, as a stock, it isn’t worth the premium. The firm has some real concerns - ranging from profit-margin volatility to substantial competition . To become more bullish on the firm, we want to see it develop a clear plan to improve profitability and dominate the cloud-computing space.

Results exceeded the  company’s guided range of $480.0 million to $482.0 million and the  Zacks Consensus Estimate of $483.0 million. Salesforce witnessed robust  demand for its products, along with broad-based revenue strength across  all regions.Geographically, on a year-over-year basis, revenues in the Americas  improved 31.1% to $340.0 million and contributed 67.4% to total revenue,  Europe shot up 41.3% to $94.4 million (contributed 18.7%) and the  Asia-Pacific grew 38.0% to $70.0 million, (contributed 13.9%).The company generated cash from operating activities of $139.5 million  compared with $165.8 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditure  decreased $3.3 billion from the previous quarter to $27.3 million.Free cash flow increased $58.9 million from the prior quarter to $112.2  million. The company’s cash, equivalents and short-term marketable  securities balance was $763.8 million, up from $497.0 million in the  prior quarter.Salesforce.com has provided guidance for the second quarter and fiscal  2012. For the second quarter of 2012, total revenue is expected in the  range of $526.0 million to $528.0 million. GAAP loss per share is  expected at between 1 cent and break-even; while non-GAAP diluted  earnings per share (NYSEARCA:EPS) is expected in the range of 29 cents to 30  cents.For full-year 2012, Salesforce.com raised its revenue outlook to  $2.15–$2.17 billion from $2.03–$2.05 billion. Diluted GAAP EPS is  expected in the band of negative 3 cents to negative 1 cent (previously 8  cents to 11 cents), while diluted non-GAAP EPS is projected in the  range of $1.30 to $1.32 (previous expectation was $1.35 to $1.38).Agreement of AnalystsOver the last 30 days, 7 of the 13 analysts covering the stock have  raised their estimates for the second quarter, while 6 analysts made  downward revisions.For fiscal 2012, 11 of the 15 analysts lowered their estimates while  two moved in the opposite direction. For fiscal 2013, 7 out of the 14  analysts have moved their estimates upward in the last thirty days,  while 6 have reduced their estimates during the same period.Some analysts were encouraged by CRM’s eighth consecutive quarter of  billings acceleration, especially considering the disaster in Japan.  They have pointed to the accelerated adoption of its products across all  geographies. Going forward, based on strong business trends and an  improving economic backdrop, management increased its full-year  guidance.The analysts believe that the tragic earthquake in Japan failed to  impact CRM’s business considerably, as its business-unit performed well  and nearly achieved the company’s original targets. Additionally, one of  the largest quarterly transactions was from Japan. Looking forward, CRM  highlighted that it has factored in some softness for this region for  the remainder of the year.Moreover, some analysts also believe that the companyrecently  introduced the Salesforce Chatter platform, which is the enterprise  social collaboration application platform following its Salesforce 2  platform. We believe that free add-on offerings like Chatter will enable  Salesforce to differentiate its core offerings and make them more  attractive for customers. This is expected to generate additional  business volume.The Chatter platform is testimony of Salesforce’s increasing  opportunities in the ever-growing cloud computing segment. This new  business model adopted by Salesforce.com has been facilitated by the  acquisition of Radian6 for approximately $326.0 million.MagnitudeThe second quarter Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate remained flat at 4  cents, over the last 30 days. For fiscal 2012, the Zacks Consensus EPS  Estimate is 24 cents, down 7 cents estimated 30 days ago. For fiscal  year 2013, the estimate has moved down to 70 cents from 75 cents over  the last 30 days.Our RecommendationSalesforce.com reported decent first quarter 2012 results. It also  provided an encouraging guidance for the second quarter and full-year  2012 based on strong demand for its business software and customer  additions. However, it faces   strong competition in the application and  cloud-computing areas from companies like Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT)  for securing government contracts at local, state and federal levels to  use their online e-mail and other applications. We reiterate our  Neutral rating on Salesforce.com shares.The company has a Zacks Rank of #3 (short-term Hold recommendation)."
271747,24005,2011-05-25T11:39:12-04:00,,"Many investors believe that it's safe to say that no institution carries more conflicts of interest than the big investment banks. They argue that fundamentals are useless as the big boys like to squeeze people, push bubbles to more excessive heights, and generally manipulate the equity and debt markets at their will. The big banks trade trillions in currencies and other assets on a daily basis and many believe that with this buying power they can basically decide where a stock or asset will trade in the short and medium term. While ""life isn't fair"", I also realize that if this is true, what the banks are doing is probably not legal and certainly not moral. Although it's impossible to prove, which is why Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act after the Depression.When an investment bank wants to underwrite stock, they do have a huge incentive to upgrade all of the sketchy names that are in the same industry as their investment banking client or to pump up an issue by talking about an overvalued business in the same industry as being a good investment and upgrading their target share price. The incentive to ""fib"" about names in an industry group (i.e. think Henry Blodgett here, who surely was a patsy) to pump up valuations for future IPO's. At first glance I found this trend to be clearly evident in today's Morgan Stanley upgrade of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). However, after further research I am not quite as sure of my initial reaction to the upgrade; Salesforce.com missed earnings, in fact it didn't even have any earnings, yet the stock gets the upgrade from Morgan Stanley. Salesforce.com is the beacon of high PE names with huge future growth potential. One possible and more cynical explanation of the upgrade was that MS wants the whole social networking group to trade higher, and therefore the banking giant needs Salesforce.com stock to trade higher to boost relative valuations. Morgan Stanley has an incentive for Facebook, Groupon, and Twitter to fetch the same ""outrageous"" (quoting Cramer here) valuations that LinkedIn (LNKD) received in last week's IPO horror reel.What was the real goal of the Salesforce.com upgrade? Many will argue that it was to pump up Salesforce.com's stock beyond the $151.26 resistance that the company has not been able to break since 2010.In any event, just because Henry is now on Tech Ticker and no longer with Merrill Lynch, does not mean that Wall Street is now suddenly filled with warmth and kindness. Getting tech stock advice from investment banks that are underwriting IPO's in the tech space is like asking a convicted thief to house-sit for you over the weekend. We will see if MS can pull it off (pushing Salesforce.com over $151.26), but frankly given that Salesforce.com is now a money-losing company, I am doubtful!Disclosure: I am short CRM."

271139,20488,2011-05-20T16:46:30-04:00,,"What Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM)  is doing here ought to be illegal. They are reporting GAAP EPS but  headlining  ""non-GAAP"" eps that excludes ""stock based compensation."" I  know others do it also but it should be illegal for them to do it also.  What they are telling us is that free shares, given to employees that  dilute shareholders actually have no cost. Note: they do this  with convertible bonds also but we'll save that for another time. This  is wrong and a travesty.Here is what is happening, by increasing the stock based comp each  year and not reporting that in their ""non-GAAP"" numbers, they can show  increasing profits there. In reality, that added expense, yes, it is an  expense is causing GAAP earnings to crater to the point the company now  expects a loss for 2012.Stock based comp in FY 2010-11-12 has progressed from $90M to $117M to $238M  (164% growth). Meanwhile GAAP EPS has  cratered from $.63 to $.47 to  the expected loss in FY 2012 of ($.03) to ($.01). But because of the  shift from dollar comp to stock comp, CRM is able to show ""non-GAAP"" or as we'll call it ""pretend earnings"" growth of $1.22 in 2011 to estimates of $1.35-$1.38Here is the only line you need to know from CRM's  earnings release today ""For the full fiscal year 2012, the company  expects to report a GAAP net loss per share of approximately ($0.03) to  ($0.01)."" What did they report for FY 2011? For the full fiscal year 2011, GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 25% year-over-year to $0.47.The company knows what is going on also. Notice in Feb. 2010 how they tout GAAP EPS because it grew YOY but this years release ... geez.. it suddenly isn't worth headlining.  Now all they want to talk about is ""non-GAAP"" (pretend) earnings. In  fact, in the Feb 2010 earnings release, ""non-GAAP"" earnings are not even  mentioned in conjunction with 2010 results because the company grew EPS  YOY. That is until we talk about expectations for 2011 (they knew REAL  eps would fall). But now that GAAP is falling, we gotta talk ""non-GAAP.  It is a shell game (bait and switch)  folks ... plain and simple.From Barron's  ""Q1 revenue came in at $504 million, yielding EPS of 28 cents. Analysts  had been modeling $483 million in revenue and 27 cents in EPS."" But,  what did CRM really do in Q1? Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share were breakeven. Shame on Barron's for reporting these numbers and not calling out what is going on. Shame on them ...From the Filing:Let's flash back to last year and see what they predicted for what just ended:Now, we have to also interject here for the full fiscal year 2010,  GAAP diluted earnings per share rose 82% year-over-year to $0.63,And, the year beforeBottom line? CRM  seems to be intent on ratcheting stock comp up to offset a precipitous  deterioration in GAAP earnings. Here are the stock based comp numbers  from FY 2009-12. $77M, $90M, $117M, $238M  or growth of 16%, 30%, 100%. You see? As the financial condition  deteriorates, they offset that by shifting comp to stock based and that  enables them to report increasing ""non-GAAP"" numbers. But when they  expense that comp in GAAP earnings, results crater.Yes, CRM  is steadily increasing customers and increasing revenues. All that is  great. But, increasingly less and less of that is making it to the  bottom line and now we have a situation where a company with $2B in revenues is no longer profitable ... unless you believe ""pretend"" I mean ""non-GAAP"" earnings ...Oh yea ... let's pretend they manage to make a penny vs the loss they  expect this year. That would put the PE ratio at  14,700?  We all know  what happens to these high PE stocks ..."

Non-GAAP gross margin was 82.1%, compared with 82.3% in the year-ago quarter. The gross margin deterioration was attributed to higher investments in its U.S. data centers and costs required to build out the Japan data center.Operating expenses rose 48.5% and 44.8% year over year, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively. The growth rate was much higher than that of the quarter’s revenue, which resulted in an operating loss.Operating loss, on a GAAP basis, was $2.8 million, compared to operating income of $33.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating income on a non-GAAP basis was $55.1 million, down from $62.0 million in the year-ago quarter.GAAP operating margin was (0.6%) versus 8.8% in the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 10.9%, compared with 16.5% in the year-ago quarter. The decline in the operating margin was due to increased R&D investments to maintain the company’s technology leadership. Increased headcount also added to costs.GAAP net income in the quarter was $0.5 million compared with $17.7 million in the comparable quarter last year. On a per share basis, the company just broke even compared with earnings of 13 cents a year ago.Excluding special items, net income on a non-GAAP basis was $39.9 million or 28 cents per share, compared with $39.9 million or 30 cents in the year-earlier quarter. However, non-GAAP net income including stock-based compensation expense was $9.0 million or 6 cents per share, compared with $22.8 million or 17 cents.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowSalesforce.com ended the quarter with cash, equivalents and short-term marketable securities of $763.8 million, up from $497.0 million in the prior quarter. Accounts receivable decreased $156.1 million from the prior quarter to $270.8 million. Salesforce.com has no long-term debt. Total deferred revenue in the quarter was $915.1 million, down from $934.9 million in the previous quarter.Cash from operating activities in the quarter was $139.5 million, compared with $165.8 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditure decreased $3.3 billion from the previous quarter to $27.3 million. Free cash flow surged $58.9 million from the prior quarter to $112.2 million.GuidanceSalesforce.com has provided guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2012. For the second quarter of 2012, total revenue is expected in the range of $526.0 million to $528.0 million. GAAP loss per share is expected at between 1 cent and break-even, while non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) is expected to be in the range of 29 cents to 30 cents.For full-year 2012, Salesforce.com raised its revenue outlook to $2.15–$2.17 billion from $2.03–$2.05 billion. Diluted GAAP EPS is expected in the range of negative 3 cents to negative 1 cent (previously 8 cents to 11 cents), while diluted non-GAAP EPS is projected in the range of $1.30 to $1.32 (previous expectation was $1.35 to $1.38).For both the second quarter and fiscal year, Salesforce.com assumes an average diluted share count of 145 million.The non-GAAP EPS guidance for the second quarter and fiscal 2012 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimates of 3 cents and 30 cents, respectively.Our TakeSalesforce.com reported decent first quarter 2012 results. It also provided an encouraging guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2012 based on strong demand for its business software and customer additions.We, however, caution investors about strong competition in the CRM application and cloud-computing areas. Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) are worthy of special mention, since they have been fighting to win government clients at local, state and federal levels to use their online e-mail and other applications that fit into the cloud-computing space.Currently, Salesforce.com has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold recommendation."
271799,20488,2011-05-25T11:57:33-04:00,,"The more I look into Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM)…..the more irritated I become….this is a follow up to last week's post.Here is the thing. I started reading the annual reports and proxy statements and I keep getting stuck on the removal of “stock compensation” from GAAP earnings so the company can report positive EPS under “non-GAAP” earnings. This was removed in FY 2011 as GAAP EPS fell 25%, the change enabled them to say “non-GAAP” EPS fell only 7%. In FY 2012 they will lose money under GAAP earnings. This means EPS has actually fallen from $.63 to $.47 to ($.02) since FY 2010. Meanwhile, “non-gaap” or “earnings without all the expenses in them” will still fall, but they will at least show a “pretend” profit.The argument comes down to whether or not stock comp is actually an expense. It is. Do not let anyone tell you different. Because of the stock comp, shares outstanding have risen from 128M to 145M in FY 2012. That is a 17M or 13% increase in shares outstanding at a time when EPS has cratered. That means existing shareholder have been diluted 13% over the past two years due to stock given to execs/employees.To wit, the company says (10k pg.39):So, they know it is an expense, it is just when they want to report earnings, they want to pretend it isn’t.Now, what have the folks done with these shares? Are they holding them? Are they increasing their holdings in a bet on the future of the company? No, they are dumping them as fast as they get them. How does it affect you?Lets say there are 1M shares out there and the company earns $1M in 2012 (it won’t, it’ll lose money but play along w/me). That means their EPS is $1….slap a 50X earnings on that (insane multiple but again, play along) and you get a stock price of $50. Now same earnings but add in the 13% dilution from the stock grants insiders are dumping onto the market. Now we have 1.13M shares and $1M in earnings for an EPS of $88 a share. Same 50X insane multiple and you get a share price of $44 …… get it now? Note: CRM will have a PE when FY 2012 is done of NM or “not measurable.” That is because there will be no “E” to divide into the “P.”So, now that we have the effect, lets look under some rocks at CRM.Here is some data on the cash bonuses doled out to execs (click to enlarge):This is from the 2010 Proxy statement regarding exec. comp:Here is the applicable wording:Now let's flash forward just a year to the recently filed Proxy?The applicable wording here is (emphasis mine):Geez, I wonder why we switched from GAAP operating income to “non-GAAP” from 2010 to 2011?Oh…..I see, the reason must be because operating income DROPPED from 2010′s $115M to $97M in 2011…according to the recent 10K. Under the old bonus system, there would have been NO BONUS for that portion of the determination.We also would be remiss if we did not note here that not only did we change the metric used to determine the granting of the bonus or not, but we also increases to amount of the bonus by 50% (from 100% of salary to 150%). Given CEO Benioff’s salary for FY 2012, that means he is eligible for a cool 66% increase in his cash bonus for the year.Anyone here wish they had a job where they could change their bonus metrics around to make them a slam dunk no matter what the business conditions? Yeah, yeah I know the CEO does not set the plan but do not kid yourself folks…he is the Chairman of the Board that selects the comp committee.We should also talk about the Convertible notes the company issued. Why? Well in 2015 shareholders will get another 6.7million shares dumped on them as these bonds convert to shares:Now, lets look at how they account for the transaction (10K pg 75):All perfectly legit under GAAP rules. But wait, lets look back at the above bonus calculation.See it? They issue convertible debt that will dilute shareholders by another 6.7m shares (minus the net effect of hedging) and account for it properly according to GGAP. But when we account for it for their bonus, we strip the annual cost of the debt out of the determination so they can walk away with their money. So in essence shareholders are paying twice, once for the dilution and twice for cash bonuses they should not be paying. Pretty slick if you ask me.Let’s get back to the stock options. Just how much is out there? According to the 10K, 33M shares (note it can be increased at anytime by the Board as it has in the past):That means shareholders still have a roughly 22% dilution coming from upcoming options (assuming no more increases which will not happen, there will be more and offset by any forfeitures). If we go back to our example from the beginning we find that our 1.13M shares have now grown to 1.36M shares and our EPS is now $.73 or 27% lower and our share price drops to $36.50 from the original $50. If we look at it another way, the company has to increase earnings 27% just to break even on an EPS level due to the dilution.Do I begrudge CRM ‘s execs for making money? Hell no. What I begrudge is the way they are doing it. It doesn’t pass the smell test. When you decide to report and highlight “non-gaap” earnings rather than “gaap” because the stock grants/options you have been heaping on people the past few years are coming due, and it is cratering your actual EPS, it doesn’t pass the smell test. When you in conjunction with that decide to alter the exec bonus structure to make sure that the fact EPS that is falling off a cliff does not interfere with their bonus, it doesn’t pass the smell test. When you then go on TV and do a victory lap while patting yourself on the back for a “great year” while EPS fell 25% and 2012 looks worse, were I a shareholder, I would wonder what Benioff was looking at.Hanging your hat on being the “first to $2B in revenue” while operating earnings tank is a bit delusional. Think about it, $2B in revenue for $97M in operating income?That means $.05 of every dollar they bring in drops to operating earnings (that is before interest, taxes etc.). If that isn’t bad enough, $.07 of every dollar still manages to find its way to stock comp, but it doesn’t really cost anything, does it?Disclaimer: The information in this blog post represents my own opinions and does not contain a recommendation for any particular security or investment.

271090,24123,2011-05-20T13:08:34-04:00,,"After yesterday's close, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported fiscal 2012 first quarter earnings.  As usual, CRM bulls' knee-jerk reaction was to push the stock higher on the heels of another top-line beat.  The company reported $504M in revenue, its highest -ever quarterly figure.  This was up 34% YOY over fiscal 2011's first quarter.  In light of this report, the following might be shocking to those who do not understand the company's accounting:  Salesforce.com's business is no longer growing.How can this be?  How can a company report 34% YOY revenue growth without actually growing its business?  If you read our commentary on the company's Q4 earnings report, you'll recall our analysis of the divergence between the company's earnings and operating cash flow, and you'll recall our prediction that stagnation in operating cash flow would signal the end of the game for one of the world's most aggressively self-promotional companies.For those who didn’t read our Q4 analysis, we'll provide a brief recap of the company's revenue and cash flow accounting.  Salesforce sells software licenses.  It collects a large portion/all of its licensing fees upfront.  These cash collections are reflected immediately in operating cash flow, but revenue recognition is deferred over the term of the given software license.  Let's say the company signs up customers to annual licenses for $10 per month.  Let's say it collects the entire fee upfront.  Let's also assume it signs up one new additional customer on the first day of each month for the first year.  On day one, it collects $120, the annual fee for one customer.  This amount is immediately reflected as an increase in its operating cash flow.  However, CRM would only recognize $10 in revenue per month from this contract.  On the first day of the next month, it collects another $120 from a new customer, and it recognizes $20 that month in revenue ($10 each from two customers).  As you can see, operating cash flow is $120 per month in this scenario, and revenue grows by $10 per month for the first year (the term of each license) until it reaches $120 per month in the twelfth month.What happens when the company's true rate of growth slows?  Operating cash flow will stop growing first.  Revenue will follow a year later, because the effects of slowing growth are deferred one year by the company's revenue recognition practices.As we said before, CRM reported 34% top-line growth this quarter.  And what of operating cash flow?  It declined 3% YOY.  As the preceding example shows, this means the company's growth is slowing dramatically.  Unless CRM can regain its sales momentum (or it resorts to more aggressive accounting tactics), its sales growth will slow sharply in the coming quarters.  (Obviously, the company's expenses make the actual accounting more complicated than our example, but this does not change our conclusion.)In past missives about Salesforce, we've focused on the company's weak bottom-line performance, but we no longer think that that's the most compelling aspect of the short thesis on CRM (though the company isn't profitable on a GAAP basis).  Frankly, investors who marvel at the company's ability to beat its own top-line projections are way off base.  Since the company's fee collections are up front and its revenue is deferred, Salesforce knows with a very high degree of certainty what its sales will be months ahead of time.  Obviously, the company guides the investment community too low because it knows it can report sales above its own estimates.  There's nothing impressive about these manufactured top-line beats.  The only thing impressive is that CRM's management has been able to deceive the investment community for so long.  That said, today's cash flow numbers indicate that growth is rapidly slowing.  It seems unlikely that CRM can continue to play this game for much longer.Disclosure: I am short CRM."

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting the company to report a profit of $0.27 per share on revenue of $483 million.  CRM just favors a reversal trend between the bells following its after-hours earnings reports, narrowing or reversing 15 times and widening 11 times in next-day trading following its last 26 extended-hours earnings reports. The near-term trend is mixed, with two widening moves and two reversal trades over the last four quarters.  Looking deeper into the performance data, CRM has recorded an earnings-driven after-hours decline in 15 of the 26 quarters we have tracked, reversing direction in next-day trade in 10 of those events, or nearly 67% of the time.  On the plus-side, the stock favors widening between the sessions when it records earnings-driven after-hours gains, which it has done in 11 of the 26 quarters we've followed. Of those 11, the stock has widened six times and reversed direction five times.

270282,24495,2011-05-17T05:42:38-04:00,,"A lot has been said about in-the-cloud valuation multiples of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and how overvalued the stock is. Even using the non-GAAP earnings (which are much higher than the GAAP earnings), one can see that this is one of the most overvalued stocks in the US market. However, to see the true extent of over-valuation, one has to use the GAAP numbers. As I show in this article, non-GAAP numbers don’t paint the true picture and can be misleading.Using non-GAAP numbers is misleadingThe non-GAAP income numbers of CRM exclude the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangibles related to acquisitions and noncash interest expense related to the convertible senior notes. Out of these, stock-based compensation expense is the most important factor in the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers of CRM.Expensing stock-based compensationExpensing stock-based compensation is a well-debated topic in general. Some argue that non-cash expenses should be excluded while calculating earnings numbers. Not true. Any compensation paid to an employee, whether in the form of cash, options or restricted stock is a genuine expense. When a company issues stocks or warrants in the market, the cash proceeds received don’t count towards its income or profits. Similarly, when a company issues the options or restricted stock in lieu of cash compensation, the cash savings should not count towards the income.Some argue that the stock-based compensation is already accounted for if one uses diluted number of shares for calculating per-share numbers. Hence, expensing the stock-based compensation may lead to ‘double counting’. Not true. Dilution happens because a company spends in the form of shares instead of cash (thus diluting the ownership of the shareholders), while the principle behind expensing is that all spending (whether in the form of cash, stocks, discount vouchers, anything else) must be expensed. These are two separate things.Leaving accounting matters aside, and purely from a stock valuation perspective, it makes sense as well to use the GAAP earnings for future projections:(a) While projecting future earnings (and expenses) of the company over say the next 10-20 years, you can simplistically assume that future expenses (including compensation) will be met fully in cash (and no further stocks or options will be issued for compensation). In this case, you will need to take GAAP EPS as your base guide to project future earnings.(b) On the other hand, you can assume that the company will always issue stocks or options to partly meet its expenses. In this case, you can use non-GAAP income numbers as your guide to project the company’s income in future years. This will lead to a much higher valuation for the entire company. But, in this case, the number of shares (used to divide the valuation of the company to arrive at the valuation of individual stock) should also be much higher. This is due to all the future potential dilution that is going to happen over the years due to the stock or option issuance.(Measuring such future potential dilution in the case of options is more complicated than in the case of stocks. In the case of options, one has to assign risk-neutral probabilities for options expiring in-the-money which can lead to much complicated calculations). Using these higher number of shares (calculated using such probability-weighted dilution), one should ultimately arrive at a similar result as the former approach of simply using GAAP income numbers.Non-cash interest expense related to the convertible senior notesOne other factor typically excluded while calculating the non-GAAP income numbers is the noncash interest expense related to the convertible senior notes. CRM issued 575 mio of 0.75% convertible notes due in January 2015 (Source: AR FY10 (.pdf)). The cost savings due to the difference between 0.75% and the true borrowing cost of the company can be viewed as the compensation paid by the note holders to the company for the embedded call option. Such savings are not true cost savings but a compensation for the future potential dilution due to the conversion of the notes. Hence, a company needs to expense it back via noncash interest expense. (For those who want to delve in details, CRM also entered into OTC note hedge transactions that partially reverse the effect of this potential dilution. However, the cost of these hedge transactions wasn’t recorded as an expense. So there was no ‘double counting’ here.)Using GAAP numbers is the correct approachIn a nutshell, GAAP income numbers incorporate such factors as stock-based compensation expense and non-cash interest expense. Hence, they paint a truer picture of the expenses (and net income) of a company. Hence, the true approach to valuing CRM should be using GAAP numbers.Boy, it’s a screaming SELLCRM earned GAAP net income of 18.36 mio, 43.43 mio, 80.72 mio and 64.48 mio in FY 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively (Source: Financials). For FY 2012, the company’s net income is likely to be below 16 mio (using the company’s projection of a GAAP EPS of 0.08-0.11 and diluted stock base of 145 mio shares as given in the press release of Q4 FY11 results). What value will you assign to this company? 18 bio? You gotta be kidding me.In a market where AAPL and GOOG are trading at multiples of 15-20, it is an understatement to say CRM is overvalued. No matter how optimistic a growth rate you assign to the CRM application market, and no matter how well the acquisitions (costly acquisitions? See here) work out, it doesn’t justify this kind of valuation.Not to mention there are strong headwinds. Competition from the Godzillas like MSFT and ORCL and other players is going to eat into the market share and the margins. (For example, see here and here).Such sky-high valuation is probably the key reason why insiders have been selling the stock and the company itself sold warrants on 6.7 mio of its shares in Jan-2010 (Ouch - did I hear ‘dilution’ again?).It's a question of when and not if the stock will crash.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours."

Investor expectations are high for these products.Stifel feels sustained momentum and currency tailwinds should help offset expected seasonal slowdown in Q1. They are expecting modest upside to their revenue estimate of $482M. Stifel doesn't expect much of that top-line upside to trickle through to earnings leverage, but it remains comfortable with its non-GAAP EPS estimate of 27c. While the sales engine appears in the U.S. appears to be in full swing, Stifel says investors should be prepared for a seasonal slowdown that is exacerbated by tougher comps and the slowdown in Japan. Stifel's model calls for $420M in bookings, representing year-over-year growth of 25%. Concerns regarding Japan exposure overblown, in Stifel’s view: The company as about 14% of revenue coming from the Asia-Pacific region, about 10% from Japan. Some street estimate are calling for an impact as high as a $40M-$50M headwind on the quarter. Company guidance for FY1 is $1.35-$1.38 on $2.03B-$2.05B in revenue. FY12 consensus is $1.27/$2.11B."

[1]  Chatter is an application that provides social networking and real-time  connection features for enterprises. We believe Salesforce.com could  use Chatter to expand its enterprise customer base and up-sell its more  valuable cloud-based products like its customer relationship management  (CRM) software and Force.com. Salesforce.com competes with SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) in the CRM software market.Below we will take a look at some of the  comments made by the management on Chatter during the earnings  conference call. We maintain a $116 price estimate for Salesforce.com stock, which is about 6% lower than market price.Management bullish about Chatter and its prospectsAccording to management, the Chatter application has gained faster  adoption with 80,000 of its 92,300 paying customers deploying Chatter  since its release in June.Management states:(Chart created by using Trefis' app)Chatter helping enterprises with productivity gainsThe advantage that Chatter has over other social networking sites like Facebook and Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) Buzz is that it provides additional security and privacy  features. Having an enterprise related social network on the same  platform as Salesforce.com’s other tools will improve productivity and  communication.According to the management:DimDim acquisition to enhance Chatter capabilitiesWe discussed about how DimDim acquisition will enhance Chatter capabilities in our earlier note titled Chatter Network Can Help Salesforce.com Up-Sell Other Cloud-Based Products.

261148,22829,2011-03-31T10:54:11-04:00,,"By Brenon DalySalesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) just keeps taking bigger bites. The company announced  Wednesday that it will hand over $326m ($276m in cash and $50m in stock)  for social-media monitoring company Radian6. Not only is it  salesforce.com’s highest-priced acquisition, it also likely brings more  revenue than any other deal the company has done, at least based on our  estimates for previous transactions and the company’s guidance for  Radian6. Salesforce.com indicated that the Canadian startup would  contribute about $50m in sales during the current fiscal year, which is  about two months old.The purchase, which is expected to close by July, also puts an  exclamation point on the changes in dealmaking at salesforce.com. The  11-year-old SaaS pioneer stayed out of the M&A market for the first  half of its corporate life. And even when it started doing deals in  2006, the first half-dozen or so acquisitions were all small, valued in  the low tens of millions of dollars. Salesforce.com only started  announcing major purchases last year, with its $142m reach for Jigsaw  Data followed by its $249m takeout of Heroku.As sizeable as the deal is inside saleforce.com, it also looms pretty  large inside the burgeoning social CRM market. Consider this: at  roughly one-third of a billion dollars, salesforce.com’s pickup of  Radian6 is more than 50 times larger than the acquisition of another  social CRM startup just last week. Privately held Meltwater Group paid  just $6m for JitterJam to bolster its social CRM offering, which the  company hopes to be a $100m business within three years."
266569,21305,2011-04-29T08:43:14-04:00,,"The high PE/FPE stocks have been flying into the stratosphere, using QE2 and the second big stimulus package as fuel. With QE2 almost over, part of that fuel is disappearing, and the rest will disappear by the end of the year. Many will now flee the weaker or more outrageously-priced momentum stocks in favor of solid fundamental values. I have prepared a list of reasons investors might think Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is one of these.CRM’s PE is 293.30 and its FPE is 74.51.A recent massive Sony (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation Security breach has marred the cloud’s reputation for the near term. A recent Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) massive cloud outage has further marred the cloud’s reputation for the near term.CRM’s products have become more numerous and more complex. They require more training for the sales people and for customers’ staffs. This translates directly into more expense for both, and hurts both margins and sales. One of CRM’s original selling points was its relative simplicity or “ease of use” for customers (less training). With that disappearing, so is one of the main selling features.The Yahoo Finance EPS results for the last four quarters (adjusted) total $1.22. The estimate for all of the current fiscal year ending in Jan. 2012 is only $1.27. This is not fast growth or accelerating EPS, and is not the behavior needed to justify a PE of nearly 300 in a growth stock.The adjusted EPS figure is not even close to the GAAP EPS figure. The TTM PE would be $137.85/$1.22 = 122 (not 293) if you used the adjusted figures. This means the GAAP EPS were actually 137.85/293.30 = $0.47 -- a huge difference. If you are making this kind of “one time charges adjustments” every quarter, they are no longer “one time charges."" In short, the adjusted EPS that CRM management has been touting are merely so much hand-waving.Not surprisingly, insiders have sold about $100M in CRM stock in the last 12 months. They know what is going on. It sure doesn’t sound like they think the stock will be going up a lot in the near future. It sounds more like they are afraid it will be going down.The analysts’ EPS estimates for the coming year have been lowered significantly in the last 90 days. The FY2012 (through Jan. 2012) earnings have specifically been lower $0.10 within the last 90 days. Momentum stocks are supposed to have upward revisions, not downward revisions.Cramer has recently cited Accelerated Revenue Growth as a reason to keep buying this stock. However, the TTM Revenue Growth Rate is 29.47%. Revenue was approximately $1.66B for FY2011, which ended in Jan. The FY2012 estimated Revenue is $2.11B, and the FY2013 estimate is $2.59B. These translate into Revenue Growth Rates of ($2.11B- $1.66B)/$1.66B = 27% growth for FY2012 and ($2.59B - $2.11B)/$2.11B = 23% growth for FY2013. This is decelerating, not accelerating, revenue growth.The Price/Cash Flow = 130.94 -- extremely poor. The Price/Book is 14.48. CRM won’t maintain its price based on book value. However, high Price/Book values are not unusual for software companies.Short interest is 8.93% of the float. This is actually less than the prior month. However, that may just mean it will be harder for those HFT short squeezers to push the stock upward. Still, it does indicate that a large number of people think CRM is over valued.All the above add up to one conclusion: CRM is a good short. It may beat on revenues in the coming Q1 report on May 18. It may even beat on adjusted EPS. It has for several quarters in a row. This may even be easier since EPS estimates have decreased in the last 60 days from $0.31 to $0.27. However, I hope I have made it clear that GAAP EPS have been a different story. I hope I have made it clear that there is a huge amount of hand waving going on. At some point, investors will start to see the hand-waving for what it is. The nearing of the end of QE2 is likely to be an apt time for that to happen.I am not saying that CRM is a bad company or that it will not continue to grow. However, it does not have accelerating revenue growth or increasing analysts’ EPS estimates, as Cramer claims. Instead, it seems to be in a fierce battle with bigger competitors for customers. This battle appears to be making the acquisition of those customers more expensive. This may be a good long term strategy, but it is likely to have a negative effect on the bottom line over the near term. Plus there is no guarantee that the negative margin effects will reverse themselves within a year or two.CRM quite simply does not deserve to trade at a multiple of nearly 300. At the rate it is going, it could take quite some time to bring that down to a respectable 20-50. The predicted next five years' EPS growth per annum is only 24.50%. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), by comparison, has a next five years' growth per annum of 15.18%. That is only 10% lower than CRM‘s, yet it trades at a PE of only 23.39. That’s more than a factor of 10 less than CRM’s. You could say ORCL is big and unwieldy. However, CRM, after growing to a $2B company, now is increasingly big and unwieldy itself. Shorting CRM at this point should prove to be profitable.The two-year chart of CRM below echoes my thought on the slowing growth prospects.[Click to enlarge] These graphs are momentum indicators. It seemed appropriate since CRM has been termed a ""momentum"" stock. Both indicators seem to be in a downtrend.To repeat yet again, I think this stock can be shorted right now. If you are prepared to be patient, you should be rewarded. If you do not feel comfortable shorting now, you could wait until after earnings to reassure yourself that the new CRM salespersons have not suddenly accelerated earnings. If you wish to short through earnings, but you do not want to take too big a risk, you could use a put spread to capture some of the down movement with less risk and less expense.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in CRM over the next 72 hours."

269443,20568,2011-05-11T19:48:12-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is scheduled to announce its fiscal first quarter 2012 results on May 19, 2011. The modest revision in estimates reflects some key changes in the company’s future business prospects.Fourth Quarter RecapThe company reported encouraging fourth quarter 2011 results, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 12 cents, on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Fourth quarter earnings surpassed last year's result.Salesforce.com reported revenues of $456.9 million, up 29.0% from $354.0 million in the year-ago quarter. It also surpassed the company’s guided range of $447.0 million to $449.0 million, aided by robust demand for its products coupled with broad-based revenue strength across all geographic regions.Subscription and support revenues of $428.5 million escalated 30.9% from the year-ago quarter. Professional services and ""other"" revenues increased 6.0% to $28.3 million.The company also added approximately 5,100 new customers during the quarter. The number of net paying customers at the end of the fourth quarter was 92,300. During fiscal 2011, Salesforce.com added 19,800 net paying customers compared with 19,300 in the prior year.Gross profit on a GAAP basis was $364.6 million, up 27.5% year-over-year, while non-GAAP gross profit came in at $373.8 million, up 28.2% from the year-ago quarter.Agreement of Analysts Out of the 13 analysts providing estimates for the first quarter, none revised their estimates in the last 30 days. Out of the 16 analysts providing estimates for fiscal 2012, two analysts have revised their estimates downward in the last thirty days while no one moved in the opposite direction. For fiscal 2013, only one analyst made a downward revision while nobody moved in the opposite direction over the last 30 days.Some analysts believe that customer relationship management has evolved as a worldwide social phenomenon given the easy access to social media like Twitter and Facebook. Moreover, the advancement in technology in this space enables monitoring of conversations or topics occurring across different social media sites, as well as communication with customers and other constituents via social channels. The company seeks to capitalize on this emerging domain through its newly launched Chatter product, thereby facilitating enhanced communication for end users and driving profitability going forward.This new business model adopted by Salesforce.com has been facilitated by the acquisition of Radian6 for approximately $326 million. The deal enables Salesforce.com users to manage customer relationships via social channels.Some analysts note that the company’s sales cloud is doing well. Analysts also believe that large publicly traded technology, networking and storage companies are gradually replacing Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) customer relationship management software, Siebel, with solutions provided by Salesforce.com.On the flipside, switching from customized on-premise software to an on-demand solution can be difficult for the company, as it involves huge expenses that in turn will likely deter new customers. Furthermore, being the market leader, it is more difficult for Salesforce.com to gain market share, because new entrants are more likely to resort to aggressive pricing in an effort to take away share. Moreover, the competition in the cloud computing space has reached a stage where players may get involved in pricing wars, leading to margin contraction.Magnitude of Estimate Revisions Since the fourth quarter earnings release, the magnitude of revisions has been substantial. Overall, estimates for the upcoming quarter have declined from 19 cents to 5 cents, over a period of 90 days. However, estimates remained unchanged over the past 30 days.For fiscal 2012, estimates have plunged from 87 cents to 31 cents over the last 90 days. However, estimates have dipped by a penny in the last 30 days. For 2013, estimates have plummeted from $1.30 to 75 cents over the last 90 days, while inching down a penny in the last 30 days.Recommendation Salesforce.com is witnessing growth in the social and business networking segment.We, however, remain cautious regarding strong competition in the CRM application and cloud-computing areas. The company faces stiff competition from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as they are also vying for government contracts at local, state and federal levels.Currently, Salesforce.com has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold recommendation."
264643,22936,2011-04-21T03:08:09-04:00,,"Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) share price popped 9% on Wednesday.   This price move pushed me over the edge, and I have joined the large group of investors who are short this stock.  My rationale is below:The often stated reason for shorting CRM is valuation.   Per Yahoo Finance on Wednesday,  CRM'sCan you say  “dot.com” bubble?Of course, CRM's P/E has been elevated  for a long time.  Many people have highlighted this stratospheric evaluation, and shorted the stock.  It is one of the most shorted stocks in the market.   Most of these shorts have probably lost money.  So on the surface the stock seems to be a perfect example of the old axiom about shorting that “stocks can stay irrational longer than an investor can stay liquid”.   However, these high valuations suggest the stock needs to pull back at some point.1. All clouds are not the same. It appears the main driver for the bullish view of CRM yesterday was positive  results from companies  like VMware (NYSE:VMW), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), etc.   These companies are key providers of cloud computing components. CRM uses the cloud to deliver great application functionality, cost effectively.The growth cloud computing component companies are reporting is related to the build out and operation of the cloud.  Demand for these components comes from many diverse sources. It  almost seems insatiable, and is driving large revenue growth in these stock.  CRM's growth is driven by an increase in people subscribing to their applications. That growth curve is also strong, but not the same thing.  It is probably more cyclical, more one-dimensional, and has a lower barrier to entry than the growth seen by a cloud component provider.Further, the business/cost models between cloud  component companies and CRM are very different.  The cloud component companies costs are front loaded driven by R&D investments and production costs.  Since these costs are largely sunk, the risk of cost management issues are front loaded and excess revenue can drop right to the bottom line.   CRM's business model is the reverse.  Largely the costs to operate the application, and service the costumers come after the sale. CRM's deferred revenue recognition polices should align revenue and costs.  However,  costs increase as more users access the system and any cost management risk will not have appeared yet.Zachery Scheidt  provides a much more detailed review of the potential implications of this situation  in this article.So in summary, all clouds are not the same.  The cloud computing component companies are the cloud,  while CRM is floating in the cloud. It does not seem appropriate for the market to simply assume positive results from component companies will apply to CRM.  CRM's earnings announcement on May 18 would be the time for these differences to come clearly to light, and it may be desirable to get short before that event2. Panic equals opportunity. As mentioned above, CRM is highly shorted. Yesterday's positive cloud news probably means many of those holding a short position are scrambling to cover.  This has likely created a classic short squeeze.   Short squeezes usually only last for as long as it take to exhaust the panic of the short sellers.  Today's 9% pop in the stock could represent the capitulation of the panicked short seller.  Hopefully, a reversal will be coming, and now is the time to take advantage of the panic.3. Technical analysis. Many of the current owners of this stock likely own the stock because of the momentum illustrated via charts, and not the fundamentals described above.   Using  approximate numbers, the stock peaked at $151 in q4 and $146 in Q1.   CRM can rise to $146 without setting a “higher high”, and a simple trend line through these peaks implies the stock might loose momentum around $141.  This very basic technical analysis indicates that if CRM stalls at current levels owners may see momentum waning and be more likely to sell.  This could drive both the demand for shares and price down.Often options can offer a cost effect, lower risk way to represent short sentiment  in a stock.  However, with such a large gap up in yesterday's trading, and the relatively high implied volatility in CRM's options, it seems more appropriate to simply shorted the stock anywhere over $140.   Hopefully, the stock will reverse, and  fill at least a portion the gap on today's chart today relatively soon.  If that does happen,  it might be possible to take modest profits, and replace the short position with a short put spread to reduce the risk of the trade.  The 200 dma is just over $122.  If the stock does start to pull back, this level could be a possible trigger to exit the trade.If  the stock continues to soar, being short will be painful.  However,  many portfolios are usually net long. Hopefully if CRM continues to go up, the rest of the market and especially other tech stocks, will continue to rise as well.  So this trade can be rationalized as a hedge against other technology stock  positions.Disclosure: I am short CRM.Disclaimer: This posting is for informational, educational and entertainment purposes only and should not be considered investment advice."
267219,22762,2011-05-03T10:03:09-04:00,,"By Leena RaoA little over a month after announcing the $326 million acquisition of social media monitoring company Radian6, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has closed the deal. The purchase of Radian6 is Salesforce’s largest acquisition to date.Radian6 helps clients like Dell (NYSE:DELL), GE, Kodak (EK) and UPS monitor, analyze and engage in ‘hundreds of millions’ of social media conversations. Salesforce will be using Radian6′s technology to enhance all of its products, including Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Chatter and Force.com.Specifically, Salesforce says the combination will create a “bridge between public conversations and Chatter” and “enhance the Salesforce Sales and Service Cloud products with social intelligence that customers can act on. Developers building on the Force.com platform also will be able to tap into the power of Radian6, putting the social web into everything they build.”We’ve argued that Salesforce overpaid for Radian6,  considering Salesforce paid nearly ten times Radian6′s revenues. Salesforce CEO and founder Marc Benioff told reporters shortly after the deal was announced that the company needed to move quickly to acquire technology (as opposed to building it in-house) as more competitors move into the world of social enterprise. Salesforce CMO Kendall Collins told us it would have taken at least three years for Salesforce to build the technology in-house.Now that Radian6 is finally part of the Salesforce family, it should be interesting to see how quickly the CRM giant can incorporate Radian6′s technology into its products.Original post"
258267,24265,2011-03-15T08:55:38-04:00,,"Salesforce.com’s (NYSE:CRM) high valuation has been upheld for years by the company’s first-mover advantage and ability to increase its marketshare in the corporate migration to cloud-based information management software. This has enabled Salesforce to avoid cash expenses, by using their stock as a substitute.On February 24, 2011, Salesforce.com released 4Q FY 2009 earnings and its 8-K [pdf] updating guidance for next year to GAAP earnings of $0.08 to $0.11 and non-GAAP earnings of $1.35 to $1.38. This is seemingly a large enough difference to warrant questioning during the earnings conference call. Below is a word cloud from the questions and answers portion of the earnings call transcript.Figure 1 - February 24, 2011 CRM Earnings Call Q&A WordCloudThere was not one question regarding GAAP or non-GAAP earnings over the next year. The words GAAP, earnings, dilution, or margins were not even uttered in the Q&A portion of the call.Most investors seem willing to ignore dilutive stock policies during this “early land-grab phase” for business-cloud market share. They believe once the market matures, Salesforce can fire all its staff, maintain market share, and cash in on 80% gross margins. I do not see that golden scenario playing out, but even if it does I am confident Salesforce will dilute away the benefits to current shareholders.Issuing stock to raise cash for expenses has become engrained into Salesforce’s business model. Salesforce expects to accrue $1.57 per share in stock-based compensation expenses during this fiscal year. Built into Salesforce’s share price is the expectation of strong revenue growth for a number of years. Salesforce needs its sales team, consulting team, R&D team and their stock-incentives to acheive this growth. Below, is a chart of shares outstanding since 2005.Figure 2 - CRM Historical Shares OutstandingThe window through which current shareholders benefit from the golden scenario unfolding is quickly closing shut. Based on the stock’s performance post-earnings, some investors have read the 8-K and found the writing on the wall. After closing at $134.32 on February 24th, CRM jumped after hours and opened the next day near its highs for the day at $146 before selling off to close at $138.83. Since failing at this resistance level, CRM has struggled to find significant support.CRM projects the weighted average diluted shares outstanding to equal 145 Million over the next year. That means about 150 million shares outstanding by Jan 31, 2012. I think CRM will underperform the market until CRM shows a decreasing rate of shareholder dilution and an increasing trend in GAAP earnings and net margins.

255489,21016,2011-02-28T17:01:44-05:00,,"Interesting past two days for juggernaut Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). After reporting Thursday evening, the stock scorched short sellers with a huge gap up open at $147ish... then has proceeded to sell off continuously since; both Friday and Monday morning.

When the stock did this in January, it simply turned on a dime and made a mad dash, ignoring the technical damage. What is interesting here is there is a yawning gap that asks to be filled from November, which is almost the exact price level of the 200 day moving average. But very few have the strength, or patience to try to short this puppy for any period of time since valuation means nothing.I won't recreate the wheel on the earnings - the Wall Street Journal shows some of the issues with the company which despite very nice revenue growth, struggles to post increasing profits - especially of the GAAP variety.Of course on Wall Street we IGNORE generally accepted accounting principles in favor of NON GAAP where we can ignore so many costs and wink at each other how ""cheap"" stocks are as long as don't count things as massive option handouts....----------------------This gentlemen at Seeking Alpha also does a very good job at sniffing out other issues; but again - with stocks like this, it does not matter until it matters.No position"
256169,22762,2011-03-03T09:23:08-05:00,,"By Leena RaoIt’s no secret that Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is aggressively pushing its social agenda with product developments. Chatter, the company’s “Facebook for the Enterprise,” was recently updated with Facebook and Twitter-like features, including likes, @replies, trending topics and more. And today, Salesforce is injecting social into the new version of Service Cloud 3, the company’s customer service SaaS application.As we’ve written in the past, the Service Cloud aims to capture crowdsourced pools of knowledge floating across the internet, combine this data with CRM functionality and provide a platform for commercial customer service, potentially replacing traditional on-premise contact center technologies which are disconnected from knowledge (i.e. social) that can be found in the cloud. To date, more than 15,000 customers have deployed the Service Cloud to power and deliver customer service.While the previous version allowed agents to answer questions on a company’s Facebook page, Service Cloud 3 provides a deeper integration with the social network. Companies will now be able to convert Facebook wall posts and comments into cases within Service Cloud 3. Salesforce has also added the same functionality for Twitter and allows agents to create cases and share knowledge from Tweets and conversations. And a new Radian6 AppExchange app will let agents work entirely within Service Cloud 3 but still engage with customers via Twitter, Facebook and other social channels including blogs, video and photo sharing sites.Service Cloud 3 will give companies the ability to implement live chat between agents and customers (courtesy of the company’s Activa Live acquisition last Fall). Companies can embed the Social Agent into their web site for chat functionality between representatives and customers.Analytics have also been added to the new Service Cloud, with the ability to generate reports on social channel interactions, customer conversation analyses, and social dashboards to help identify trends. And teams can also collaborate in Chatter around how to answer questions and to get feedback on published knowledge articles for increased accuracy. Readers can access an article’s history, contribute comments, and see input from internal experts.The Service cloud console now allows agents to follow important cases in Chatter, to receive realtime updates on status and to collaborate around how to solve the customer service issue. resolve issues faster.Put simply, Salesforce made the Service Cloud a whole lot more social in this release. While this is unsurprising considering the company’s recent emphasis on Chatter and its social agenda, it does make me wonder if this trend is a sign of things to come. I’m curious if we’ll see the Chatterification of Salesforce’s database offering and other products.Original post"
257841,23479,2011-03-11T15:02:56-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is a fast growing player in the cloud computing market that offers products such as cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software, Force.com, AppExchange and Database.com. The cloud-computing market is a fast growth area in which Salesforce.com competes with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Below we take a look at Salesforce.com’s historical spend on research and development (R&D), and consider how the outlook for this number could swing our $128 price estimate for Salesforce.com stock. Our price estimate is in-line with market price.Salesforce.com Continues to InnovateIn addition to cloud-based CRM software, Salesforce.com has introduced quite a few innovative cloud-based products to the market in the last few years:These innovative products are a result of heightened R&D levels from Salesforce.com over the past few years. R&D spend as a percentage of gross profits has increased from around 9% in 2006 to roughly 11% in 2010.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)What Shape Could the R&D Spend Take?Going forward, we expect Salesforce.com’s R&D spend, relative to gross profits, to slow down a little. This is because, unlike traditional on-premise software where the vendor needs to maintain different software versions at many client sites, cloud-based products require only a single version to be maintained. This means that cloud players like Salesforce.com need to upgrade a single software release for all customers at the same time. This actually benefits Salesforce.com as the R&D cost incurred on maintaining different versions is mitigated. This factor will likely be the overwhelming driver that reduces R&D spend as a percentage of gross profits, an effect magnified by Salesforce.com’s continued expansion of its customer base.However, if R&D spend relative to gross profits continues to follow its historical growth trend, reaching about 15% by the end of our forecast period, it would imply 15% downside to our $128 price estimate for Salesforce.com stock.Disclosure: No positions"

The company acquired Heroku, the Ruby application platform-as-a-service for $212 million in December and DimDim, a web conferencing service for $31 million, in January — on top of the addition of GroupSwim, a SaaS cloud enterprise service, back in December 2009.While sales grew 29 percent in Q4, Salesforce’s total operating  expenses tipped past 40 percent to $365 million, resulting in a $391,000  loss in operations. The company also made a measly $97 million at the  operating income level, compared to its $1.55 billion in sales.Yet, in spite of these lackluster numbers, back at DEMO, Hu’s  expectations remain positive, largely thanks to Salesforce’s enterprise  social messaging application, Chatter. Though you may only know Chatter from unpopular Super Bowl ads, Hu said that their team has “cracked the distribution code”,  as 80,000 of Salesforce’s 92,000 customers are currently using Chatter.  He remained unfazed over competition from other enterprise social  networks like Yammer, which boasts over 100,000 businesses (including TechCrunch).“Today, we are seeing a confluence of cloud, social and mobile,  and the best sales person in today’s world is not properly armed unless  they’re combining those three key features,” Hu said. He continued  on to say that the market in social enterprise, for those who can  combine these three components successfully, remains a green field. This  is why the company continues to build their human sales force, which  the Salesforce (ha) executive said remains a high priority for the  company going forward.Hu’s conclusion, seen in the big picture, shows that 2011 may well be  the year of the expanding sales force. Two weeks ago, I attended an  “Online Local” panel at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet  Conference in San Francisco, where representatives from Foursquare,  Yodle, Living Social, and Angie’s List said that they are in the process of drastically expanding their own sales staffs  in 2011 due to their impression that local merchants lack the  technology prowess to buy through self service models. Living Social,  for example, has a sales staff of over 450.In business-to-business decisions, where there are multiple  stakeholders, and huge strategic decisions are on the line, Hu said, it  takes a real person — those customer-facing sales employees — to explain  the details of how the service works, to work through obstacles, and  help the customer see the bigger picture.In light of Salesforce’s flurry of M&A activity and rapid growth,  Hu said that what is keeping him up at nights is the education of this  massive sales force. As the company has grown from a single application  (Salesforce Automation) to a CRM platform, collaboration through social  enterprise, and Data-as-a-Service, it has become increasingly difficult  to train each new employee to manage their products.Going forward, Hu said, he would like to see Salesforce become less  reliant on their Website or app and become, instead, an invisible and  pervasive service. He referred to David Kirkpatrick’s conception of the  future of Facebook, in which the social networking giant will look  nothing like its current form, but instead its social graph will be  inherent to the very plumbing of the Web.Though Hu’s lofty visions of the future may hold weight, you can  check out a more dour financial perspective in the WSJ’s coverage of the  Salesforce stock run up here.Original post"
255132,24123,2011-02-25T15:39:55-05:00,,"Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) Q4 and full-year 2011 report showed continued revenue growth and earnings stagnation. The company reported $1.657B of revenue, up 27% over its fiscal 2010 sales. CRM also reported net income of $64.5M, down 20% over the previous year. This amounts to a 3.9% profit margin, hardly the stuff of transformational, groundbreaking companies. Salesforce's operating cash flow figure was far more impressive at $459M for fiscal 2011, but the wide and growing gap between earnings and cash flow demands explanation. Finally, CRM's 2012 guidance really jumped out at us. Management predicts 23% revenue growth and approximately breakeven GAAP EPS of 8-11 cents per share. The stock is trading at about 1,300x the high-end of this guidance. When will Salesforce start to earn enough to justify its stratospheric valuation? Will it ever?The NumbersSalesforce.com's earnings are 3.9% of its sales. Its operating cash flow is 27.7% of sales. What's the real profit margin? We believe the normalized profit margin for CRM is around 6-7%. To explain this, we offer the following example. Keep in mind that we're using CRM's accounting policies -- the only thing that we've changed is the numbers.Salesforce typically signs customers to 12-24 month licenses. The company invoices its customers either quarterly or annually. Let's imagine a scenario in which CRM has 24 customers, each of whom pay $1,000,000 up front for identical 2-year licenses. On the day it signs up a customer to one of these hypothetical licenses, CRM receives $1,000,000 and pays out a commission to its own salespeople who executed the deal. Its commissions tend to range between 45 and 50%, so the company pays out $450,000 on day 1. Therefore, it immediately recognizes a net increase of $550,000 in operating cash flow.How does this transaction reflect on the net income statement? On day 1, it doesn't appear at all. Though CRM receives cash and pays its commissions up front, it recognizes the revenue and expense ratably over the life of the deal. That is, the company will recognize $41,667 in revenue and $18,750 in marketing & sales expense each month for the next 24 months.Though there is nothing inherently wrong or dishonest with this accounting, investors who hang their hats on the company's strong reported operating cash flow miss a key point. Though the cash flow statement recognizes revenue and sales commission expense immediately, it does not include any of the other expenses the company will face over the rest of this 2 year contract. The company has costs of sales, R&D spending, and general and administrative spending. Combined, these costs amounted to 46.6% and 44.8% of revenues in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. CRM's cash flow statement recognizes roughly half of the company's expenses up front, but it recognizes a much larger chunk of the revenue on day 1. Clearly, operating cash flow tells us little about the company's true profitability.Back to our 24 customer example. If the expirations of the 24 licenses are spread evenly over a 2-year period, the company will recognize $1M in revenue, $450,000 in commission expense, and about $450,000 in cost of sales, R&D, and G&A expense per month. These figures are consistent with the company's reported results over the past few years, and they give us an operating margin of 10%. After taxes and other minor items, the profit margin will be 6-7%. Also, since in this example the company isn't adding new customers or losing existing ones, operating cash flow will be equal to net income plus depreciation, amortization of intangibles, and stock-based compensation.Stock-based compensation may not be a cash expense, but it's certainly an economic expense. If we're trying to figure out how much this company is actually earning, this is not a valid add-back (unless, of course, one thinks the shares are worth considerably less than their trading value). Also, since the company must keep its assets (servers, offices, etc) in good working condition, depreciation isn't a valid add-back either -- the company's capital expenditures are roughly the same as its depreciation. Though adding back some amortization of intangibles to earnings is valid for our purposes, these figures have been quite small and will continue to be so. Plainly, if Salesforce.com's customer growth flat-lines, its operating cash flow will quickly converge on its net income.This example should make it clear that the company doesn't have the ability to improve its operating margins. It cannot dramatically cut back on its R&D spending, or its offerings will suffer (and because competition is increasing). It will not cut back on its G&A expense because it needs to support its growth. It cannot cut back on its cost of sales much since it must keep its infrastructure in good condition to accommodate its customers. Most importantly, it cannot reduce its commissions, for this would lead to a disgruntled and unmotivated sales force at Salesforce.com.If CRM is to run a 6-7% profit margin forever, what does this imply about its valuation? The company's current market cap is $18.6B. Though this simple truth seems lost on the sell-side analysts covering the stock, the value of any company is the sum of its future earnings discounted back to the present at some appropriate rate. So with a 7% profit margin, the company would have to sell $266 billion of licenses in the future to justify its current price, even before discounting. With discounting, this figure is much, much higher.Though CRM's sales growth has been impressive (the company is likely to break the $2B revenue threshold this year), it is impossible for it ever to justify its current valuation. Salesforce.com management hypes the company as profoundly transformational and groundbreaking. However, its profit margins reveal that it is little more than an ordinary business whose results are met with an extraordinary level of irrational behavior.Disclosure: I am short CRM."
256405,22263,2011-03-04T06:52:55-05:00,,"George Hu, the VP of marketing for CRM, is probably the number two at CRM in promoting the new ‘cloud’ paradigm. He comes after the CEO, Benioff, PR extraordinaire. This is his recent option activity, disclosed on March 2. George Hu had a tranche of his options mature, making them eligible for sale (each year employee options mature, about 25% per year of a remuneration package).For Hu, 4,585 shares were vested in the company, and guess what? He sold the entire lot (sold at $128, granted at average price of $45) immediately, making a sweet profit of $380K. That is perfectly acceptable, but I believe this is far more galling:His remuneration package in calendar 2010 amounted to $6.0 million. Of the total remuneration, his salary (ie, cash wages) was 670K. In other words, 90% of his total remuneration was (shares via options) received and sold.This leads to the crux of the problem:In the non-GAAP earnings-per-share that CRM chooses to focus exclusively upon, they only account for wages, not options. Thus, the non-GAAP earnings-per-share excluded 90% of the VP’s remuneration.In this (possibly extreme case), 90% of his total staff cost was not reflected in the wages' cost line, and personnel costs must be the biggest line item in the company’s P&L account. This is the main factor causing an enormous difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP earnings-per-share. Case in point for the next fiscal year to Jan 2012 is the relevant extract from their recent 10K filing.The following is a per share reconciliation of GAAP diluted EPS to non-GAAP diluted EPS Guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year:As seen above, stock based expenses are by far the biggest variance between the two - net of tax, they represent 71% of the variance.As for the controversy, whether options are a legitimate expense or not when calculating a company’s profit, no one has expressed it better than Warren Buffett in 1992:One could extend the logic employed above further. Let’s leave out 90% of the rent and utility bills too. After all, we are in the clouds. Disclosure: I am short CRM."
256642,23469,2011-03-06T08:04:02-05:00,,"Over the past two years, in the wake of successful customer relationship and cloud services, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has improved its share price drastically. The company has seen significant growth in its sales and customer base in the past two years; sales are up 74% on the growth of cloud computing and its popular Cloud and Chatter products.Like many expanding companies with significant potential, Salesforce (CRM) has seen catastrophic rises in its share price. However, we believe that Salesforce's share price does not justify its potential. While we do believe that the company has a positive product, we also believe that, even with significant growth in operating income to $600M by 2015, this stock is no more than a $50 - $60 stock. The problem with Salesforce is that the company has not shown the ability to grow earnings along with revenue, and valuation significantly outgrows earning potential.The company currently operates an operating margin near 8%, which is drastically lower than its gross margin at 80%. The problem with Salesforce lies in this issue. The company is producing lots of revenue, but they are not turning the top-line into earnings. The company has significant SG&A costs every year. Between acquisitions, administrative pay, and expansion costs, the company has seen significant amounts of revenue not go to earnings. In the past three years, the company has seen 61%, 64%, and 66% of sales going to SG&A.Going through the numbers, we do expect that the company’s sales will grow, and we also expect that SG&A as a percentage of sales will decrease as the company reduces expansion costs and raises its bottom line. We estimate that the company can expand sales to $4B in the next five years. Currently, if the company would have an operating margin of 8%, that would translate only into $320M in operating income and net income of around $225M - in other words, EPS near 1.70 for the year, which would still give the company a P/E ratio of around 73 at current prices.We see this as a best-case scenario for the company. Therefore, what this means for CRM, according to fundamental analysis, is that the company will have maintain current growth rates or exceed them and increase their operating margins significantly in order to justify current share prices. We do not believe that the company can exceed more than 25% growth in revenue each year for the next four years, or that it can increase its operating margins more than 15%, given what we have seen from the company.Another issue that compounds this overvaluation is that Salesforce.com has significant shares outstanding at 132M. The company has hinted that they may dilute shares up to 145M with a lot of shares going to the company. That dilution causes the equity value of the company to be less and less. Further, share dilution will cause the company to require even more earnings and a higher operating income to justify the share price. Not only does management continue to reward themselves with shares - they have also continuously sold these shares, making heavy profits on the company at these higher levels.We think that Salesforce.com has a great product, but a great product does not always mean a great value investment. One factor that also needs to be considered with Salesforce is that it is going to see rising competition in cloud computing. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have stressed their desire to move into cloud computing.  SAP (NYSE:SAP), which already has significant business relationships, threatens Salesforce as well. As more players move into the industry, the pie will grow smaller for Salesforce, and while it may not threaten growth, it will likely threaten operating margins – the very thing that CRM needs to improve.Financially, we have touched on some of the general issues for Salesforce. One positive for the company is that it has a very solid FCF margin. The company has over 15% FCF/sales, which is a very good ratio. Solid free cash flow is very important for an expanding company; however, what is peculiar is that the company has strong free cash flow but has seen even more significant operating expenses. Additionally, free cash flow typically allows a company to avoid debt, but the company has seen long-term debt increase as part of its liabilities from 0% to 17%. While this is not all bad because it can show company confidence in expanding, the company has seen its current ratio decline from 1.88 in 2010 to 1.20 in the TTM.Additionally, profitability is going in the wrong direction. In 2010, ROE and ROIC were moving up, but in the TTM the ROE has dropped from 9.4% to 7.2%. ROIC has dropped from 7.3% to 5.7%. These movements are not positive for the company, and dropping ROE and ROIC is not a positive for any company.Bottom line: While we do see potential in Salesforce and believe the company’s growth abilities are tremendous, the has overpriced this stock with a P/E of over 250. With this overvaluation, the stock is not a buy. Rather, it appears that over time the stock will not be able to justify its current price. We believe that the price should decline significantly from these levels as the P/E ratio moves back to normal range.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Big enterprise agreements and a platform  play are the means to getting to that lofty sales figure.How exactly will Salesforce.com get there? Big enterprise deals and  establishing the company as a cloud computing platform. Most analysts  buy the Salesforce argument and vision -- but others are a bit reticent.Here’s a look at the two biggest items on Salesforce’s drive to $3 billion in revenue.Can Salesforce become a big enterprise player? Sure,  Salesforce does plenty of big enterprise deals, but the company has  92,300 customers and 3 million users. Cowen (NASDAQ:COWN) analyst Peter Goldmacher  does the math and finds that Salesforce’s average customer has less than  35 seats and average selling prices under $20,000.“Although management remains effusive about its enterprise class  platform offerings, we continue to believe that Salesforce.com is  primarily an SMB play,” said Goldmacher.Goldmacher makes an interesting point. The divergence comes when you  project ahead. Most analysts see Salesforce as a future big enterprise  player. But to get there, Salesforce needs a sales army to go against  SAP and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).For his part, Benioff is undeterred. He explained on the company’s  earnings conference call Thursday that smaller deals lead to bigger  ones. Here’s the master plan via Benioff:Bottom line: The road to $3 billion in revenue for Salesforce is lined with enterprise license agreements.Can Salesforce.com be a platform? The answer to this  question will emerge in the next year. Benioff said fiscal 2012 is the  year of the platform. Salesforce has its own programming language called  Apex, but acquisitions and partnerships will put the company on the map  as a cloud platform. More than 1 billion lines of Apex code have been  written, but Salesforce, which has 340,000 Force.com Apex developers,  hasn’t garnered the developer buzz enjoyed by other programming  languages.Benioff said the Heroku acquisition gives Salesforce access to Ruby  on Rails developers, but other languages are planned as well. To his credit,  Benioff is letting Heroku run:The big idea here is to make Salesforce an enterprise platform. “We  see momentum building in the platform and service category as companies  demand more social, mobile and open applications to serve their  employees and customers. We have the only platform for building Cloud 2  applications that is a trusted proven solution for the enterprise. And  with our strategic moves toward an open multi-language, multi-device  strategy in the last 90 days, we believe Force.com is positioned to be  the long term leader in the platform as a service category,” said  Benioff.Why is the platform so important? Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Ross MacMillan  estimates that the CRM market is roughly a $10 billion opportunity. If  Salesforce can become a leading platform-as-a-service player, its total  addressable market is more than $40 billion.What’s unclear here is whether Salesforce can go toe-to-toe with  Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure platform, Red Hat’s (NYSE:RHT) Cloud Foundation and Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) App  Engine. Salesforce.com’s plan is to offer viral services like  Chatter.com and garner more customers.In a survey of 50 large Salesforce customers, about half of them saw  the company as an important platform for third party and custom apps,  according to MacMillan. “We think adoption of Salesforce as a custom  development platform is set to accelerate, driving an expansion in the  addressable market and the potential for higher sustained growth rates.  Competition for the platform is extensive, but Salesforce looks very  well positioned today,” said MacMillan.Bottom line: The Salesforce as a platform story will be told over the  next year. Can Salesforce ride the Java and Ruby developer wave to  dominance?"

According to Gartner, the cloud computing market is estimated to have increased from $59 billion in 2009 to around $68 billion in 2010, and could grow to around $149 billion by 2014.

253769,24279,2011-02-18T12:05:16-05:00,,"It seems like everything I do is done with cloud computing these days. I use the Internet to pay my bills, send letters, do my banking, trade stocks, file taxes and buy books. My local cineplex doesn't even publish movie times in the newspaper anymore. You have to go online to see what's playing and when the show starts.If you've heard the term cloud computing bandied about and are not sure what it means, it's a very simple concept. Any computer programs you use that require a browser and online access as opposed to residing on your computer's hard drive are considered part of the cloud. It's been around a long time, but for investors, the sector has caught fire the past two years. This is especially true with software for the corporation and rightfully so because this is where a lot of growth is.According to market research firm IDC, global revenues associated with applications deliverable under a software-as-a-service (cloud computing) model are projected to increase from an estimated $8.1 billion in 2009 to $20.6 billion in 2014. That's a compound annual growth rate of just over 20% for five years.One such company that is benefiting from this surge in the adaptation of on-demand software is Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), with its shares rising from $62 to just over $140 in the past year. Make no mistake about it, Salesforce.com is in the sweet spot for growth, being a leading provider of sales, marketing and customer service enterprise software. The company also recently acquired Heroku, the leading cloud application platform for next generation social and mobile applications, and, Dimdim, a maker of real time communications technologies. The company has positioned itself well for ""Cloud 2,"" which is the evolutionary progression of software-as-a-service, and should be a formidable company for a long time.The question is, do you want to buy the stock? The majority of analysts covering Salesforce.com think you should, according to Yahoo Finance. Out of the 41 analysts that follow it, 24 have either a buy or strong buy recommendation, while the remaining have a hold rating except for two that give it a sell. After crunching the numbers, I joined the very small minority and also say to take your profits if you own it. Although it's growing by leaps and bounds, its valuations are sky high.I like to use ValueLine for analysis because I've found them to be fairly accurate throughout the years and will do so for this presentation along with consensus analysts estimates at Yahoo Finance. According to ValueLine, at $140/share, Salesforce.com has a trailing P/E Ratio of 291 based on earnings of 48 cents/share for 2010. For 2011, the projected earnings are 75 cents for ValueLine and $1.17 based on the average analyst estimate on Yahoo Finance. This gives it a P/E ratio on the conservative side of 186 and for the median analyst estimate a P/E of 120. That's way too lofty for my blood, but this is a growth stock and you should always take the PEG Ratio (price/earnings/growth) into consideration when evaluating high fliers.Yahoo Finance has 17.9% growth projected for next year and ValueLine has a compounded annual earnings growth rate for the next 3-5 years at 28%. Let's just call it a 30% growth rate for the sake of simplicity and do the math. At a P/E of 186, the PEG Ratio is 6.2. At a P/E Ratio of 120, the PEG Ratio decreases to 4. That's double or triple what it should be for you to hang on to your shares when using a PEG Ratio of 2 as a sensible point at which to take a profit. I got that PEG Ratio of 2 from Jim Cramer in his book, Jim Cramer's Mad Money: Watch TV, Get Rich, when he was doling out valuation tips. If only he would take his own advice.On Tuesday, February 8th, Cramer gave Salesforce.com a two thumbs up, strong buy on the lightning round segment of his show. I know he's got a lot of stocks to cover, but he's got this one wrong. Standard & Poor's stock report gives Salesforce.com a beta of 1.48 and if this market corrects, the stock will go down in value.

More risk tolerant longs may want to tweak the entry closer to 144 to 145 as it's likely the stock starts the day closer to this area and perhaps sees an early pop to the higher 140s.In Thursday's after-hours trade CRM jumped to an early after-hours high of 147.33 before dropping back to about 140.50. It steadied in a higher range between 142.35 and 145.87 through the rest of the session. A pre-bell open Friday may have potential near 142 to 145.

Full fiscal year revenue reached $1.66 billion, growing 27% year-to-year (see recent earnings results here and earnings call transcript here). Salesforce.com is staying ahead through investments in both employees and acquisitions that provide new features to products, and investments that enhance its ecosystem through attracting developers and customers.Salesforce.com increased its headcount by 1,337 year-to-year, especially in the functions of S&M and R&D, to enable the company to sustain growth. Customer growth increased 28.2% year-to-year, reaching 92,300. As a result of $935 million in deferred revenue, an increase of 33% year-to-year, Salesforce.com increased its full year expectations for FY12 to a range of $2.03 - $2.05 billion. This marks Salesforce.com crossing the $2 billion threshold, doubling in revenue compared to FY09. In that time period, Salesforce.com doubled its customer and subscriber base. Delivery of Chatter and second generation core applications for CRM and HR are driving adoption.Sustaining a healthy ecosystem perpetuates growth among partners, developers, and customers Salesforce.com recognized the importance of applications and supporting key development languages to enhance its ecosystem. Salesforce.com’s ability to maintain double-digit growth of 30% year-to-year (in a subscription model business) centers on its ability to create a virtuous cycle around partners, developers, and customers. The more users, the greater the value for everyone in the ecosystem because partners and developers are drawn to growth opportunities, and users are drawn to an abundance of custom applications. As a result, Salesforce.com spent most of 2H10 expanding its app development services and opening its doors to out-of-house developers. Salesforce.com had a record turnout at its Dreamforce event in December of 30,000 customers, developers, and partners.New application development services, coupled with the acquisition of Heroku will help alleviate some of the difficulties associated with application development. Heroku provides a developer base and a Ruby-based application Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). These capabilities will help Salesforce.com extend its PaaS capabilities while opening new opportunities for developers by supporting Ruby, a language used to develop collaborative applications. As a more diverse variety of applications are created, Salesforce.com will increase its footprints among customers, who will drive growth among partners and developers.Acquisitions provide Salesforce.com with the capabilities to differentiate offerings Salesforce.com will maintain and extend its installed base by continually delighting and satisfying customer needs through product enhancements. Small acquisitions that can be incorporated into new and existing product lines will reduce customer attrition and encourage adoption.As vendors realized the value of delivering products via the internet like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Cloud 2 is vendors creating value by behaving more like Facebook, and combining collaborate, open, and interactive features to help the enterprise run better. Salesforce.com’s vision of Cloud 2 is a socially driven platform with users gaining real-time information through collaborating in an environment that resembles Facebook. As Salesforce.com moves its strategy into a social cloud, it will re-energize the cloud market to increase its footprint within large and small enterprises. Chatter, launched in June 2010, was Salesforce.com’s initial step in creating a collaborative cloud-based forum for users to communicate and share information with employees internally.The acquisitions of Manymoon and Dimdim will ultimately enhance Chatter capabilities by bringing new features to the platform. We believe ManyMoon will continue to exist as a free productivity tool, but that the technology will be used to enhance Chatter. Dimdim brings cloud collaboration and conferencing services to Salesforce.com, as a well as a team of experienced developers. We believe that both acquisitions will not only improve Chatter’s capabilities, but also play an important role in expanding Salesforce.com’s developer community to maintain a healthy ecosystem of partners, developers, and customers.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Cloud-based CRM is  considered better than on-premise because of speed and ease of  implementation, low total cost of ownership and cost-effective benefits  for customers, and ease of integration with existing applications.Since Salesforce specializes in on-demand CRM, this has given a good  push to its CRM share – from 6.9% in 2006 to 14.2% in 2010, with the  majority of the share increase coming at the expense of SAP which has  been slow in introducing a comprehensive cloud-based solution.… But Security Remains A ConcernSince data in cloud-based software resides over the internet,  companies may be reluctant to use cloud services over data security  concerns.

251176,24242,2011-02-07T08:21:45-05:00,,"I invested through the internet boom and bust. I have seen, and unfortunately invested in, companies with astronomical valuations before. Many companies during that time never made a profit. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reminds me of the internet glory days. The difference is that Salesforce.com does make money.  Salesforce.com provides customer relationship management software to businesses worldwide. The company offers unique solutions that can be customized to fit businesses needs. Salesforce.com provides many of its software applications through the ""cloud"". The cloud refers to groups of servers from which software is hosted. Businesses can access their applications through these servers instead of installing software directly to their own network. This allows businesses to essentially outsource much of their information technology. Salesforce.com has turned this into a highly profitable business.  The stock is widely regarded as being extremely overvalued. It is easy to see why when you look closely at the numbers. Shares of the company have been the target of short-sellers for some time now. The shorts continue to get burned, as shares have continued to soar. Over the past twelve months the stock has risen 120%. Bulls argue that the short-sellers don't understand the business and the growth prospects for the company. Bulls will point you to the 13.88x sales for which shares trade. Salesforce.com trades at a forward P/E of 118. The price to cash flow is even higher at 142x. Even though the company has an $18.1 billion market cap, it only generated $271 million in operating cash flow in fiscal 2010.  Here is a detailed look at the numbers for Salesforce.comData provided by Charles Schwab & Co. *Data provided by I-Metrix  Salesforce.com has a stellar five year revenue growth trend and cash flow growth trend. The problem is this is coming off of relatively small numbers for a company that the market has valued so richly. Salesforce.com by almost all metrics is extremely overvalued.  With 9.88 million shares short, Salesforce.com has 10% of its float short. I personally do not short stocks. As the old market adage proclaims, ""the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent"". Shares of Salesforce.com can stay irrational too. Although I don't short stocks, I do occasionally buy put options on stocks that I feel the market has overvalued. By using put options, I can define the amount of risk I am willing to take. This is the only way that I would recommend attempting to capitalize on Salesforce.com's rich multiple.  Salesforce.com is probably a great company. They have figured out a way to be very profitable in a competitive space. They may be the most promising company in the hot cloud computing space, but even stocks that survived the internet bubble saw their share of pain. I have a feeling investors that hold on too long in this stock will see their share of pain as well.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Although our valuation  estimate is below the current market price, below we highlight two  long-term developments that could present upside to our estimates and  justify the market price.1)  +$16 if Salesforce CRM Market Share Rises to 30% CRM software like that offered by Salesforce helps companies better   manage customer data and information, which helps those companies to   better serve their customers and increase sales.  We estimate that  Salesforce’s core CRM software business accounts for 63% of the Trefis  price estimate for Salesforce’s stock.We estimate that Salesforce has increased its CRM software market  share from around 7% in 2006 to nearly 13% in 2009, and we expect it to  continue to increase to around 25% by the end of Trefis forecast  period.  Salesforce has benefited in recent years from the shift in  demand from on-premise CRM software to on-demand (cloud-based) CRM  software. We expect the CRM software market to continue to shift towards cloud-based software which will benefit Salesforce and help it capture additional market share.  However, Salesforce’s primary competitors (SAP, Oracle and Microsoft) are expected to  increase their presence in the cloud-based CRM  market over time and this can ultimately slow down the rate at which Salesforce gains share.By modifying the forecast shown above, you can see how there could be about $16 (13%) of upside to the Trefis price estimate if Salesforce were to reach 30% market share in the CRM software market by the end of our forecast period instead of the 25% that we currently forecast.  On the other hand, there would be downside of about $28 (22%) to our estimate if Salesforce’s CRM market share were to remain flat over the forecast period.2)  +$9 if Salesforce’s Share in Cloud Computing Market Reaches 1%  In recent years, Salesforce has been branching out from delivering only CRM software through the cloud to delivering other cloud-based software services.  The broader cloud computing market presents a long-term opportunity for Salesforce as IT departments leverage cloud-based software instead of investing in additional hardware and on-premise software.The cloud computing market consists of Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).  Salesforce offers Force.com, a development platform and infrastructure  for corporate IT departments and independent developers to build  business applications. It provides an environment to develop custom  applications beyond CRM applications.Furthermore, the company recently launched Database.com as a separate database on-demand offering.  The database software market is dominated by Oracle with about 50% market share of the roughly $7 billion of new database software licenses sold annually.We estimate that the cloud-computing market (excluding cloud-based CRM software) stands at about $65 billion and that this could grow to more than $300 billion by the end of our forecast period.  We believe that Salesforce will have a small but growing share in this very large market as it continues to launch new cloud-based software services.  By modifying the forecast below, you can see how there could be a $9 (7%) upside to the Trefis price estimate if Salesforce were to capture 1% share in the broader cloud-computing market (excluding CRM) by the end of our forecast period.These two scenarios combined would lead to a Trefis price of about $151, just slightly above the current market price.

The Lowell, Massachusetts-based target provided a cloud-based open source Web-conferencing service for businesses, and with this deal salesforce.com now claims 60,000 Chatter users, though with its ""freemium"" model we suspect that only a fraction of these are paying customers.Salesforce.com paid $31 million in cash for Dimdim, which had raised a total of $8.4 million from venture investors Draper Richards, Index Ventures and Nexus Venture Partners. Per salesforce.com’s conference call, Dimdim has 75 employees spread throughout its offices in Lowell and Hyderabad, India. Although the target’s annual revenue wasn’t disclosed, we estimate that it closed 2010 with about $2 million in revenue.Like salesforce.com’s previous collaboration pickup – GroupSwim, in December 2009 – Dimdim’s services will be shut down, and its capabilities will be rolled into Chatter, salesforce.com’s social collaboration software service that first launched in 2009.As my colleague Kathleen Reidy notes (click here to see her full report on the acquisition), as evidenced by the almost immediate shutdown of the Dimdim service, salesforce.com isn’t interested in the pure Web-conferencing market. Salesforce.com will honor contracts with Dimdim’s existing customers, though these will not be eligible for renewal, and it has terminated Dimdim’s free service.Dimdim also had an open source distribution and while this is still available, it won’t see any further updates.

246900,21727,2011-01-17T09:07:11-05:00,,"To say that Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has been on a tear lately is an understatement. With its stock more than doubling in less than a year, it has reached “superstar” status in just about everybody’s book. Its dizzying run has made a lot of investors rich while decimating those  who dared to short it.With a market cap of over $19 billion, Wall Street seems to be pricing this one like they just found the cure for cancer. Selling at  125 times 2011 earnings estimates of $1.17 sounds feasible, if the company was destined for huge earnings gains, but analysts have forecast a rather tepid 18% growth in 2012 from $1.17 to $1.38.If you put CRM’s valuation in perspective and calculate its return on investment, you will be shocked. You would have to invest  $146 to get back $1.38; that equates to a minuscule return of less than 1% - you can do better than that in a risk free CD.To make matters worse, the company has only about $200 million cash (when offsetting its debt) and sells at 15 times book.Why is the valuation so high? To put CRM’s nose bleed valuation in context, its market cap is roughly the equivalent to the three of the largest US supermarket chains (Kroger (NYSE:KR), SuperValu (NYSE:SVU) and Safeway (NYSE:SWY)) combined. Yet these three companies together produce revenues of $164 billion and earnings of over $2 billion. KR’s cash dividends alone - of $267 million - are more than CRM’s expected 2012 earnings of $180 million on sales of $2 billion.The trio of supermarket operators  together generate revenues 80 times higher than CRM and ten times its earnings, yet CRM is by itself worth just about the same market cap as all three combined - where is the logic here? There is no logic, except that CRM is a momentum casino play that is attracting the pure gambler type. The greater fool theory seems to be in full effect on this one. Eventually, the bar will be set too high and CRM will miss expectations, prompting the  bottom to fall out. When the stock finally does come back to earth, it will happen in a “blink of the eye”, as  stocks typically fall at twice the rate as they climb, since fear has a more powerful effect on the markets than elation.Bottom line: CRM seems to be doing everything right and is no doubt a great company. The problem is, it has become too expensive – perfection and then some has already been built into the share price. The stock is way overbought (it has gone up too far in too short of a timeframe) and needs  a  bout of  profit taking  to correct and   take the excesses out. The insiders seem to already be in a profit taking mode, as they have rung the cash register on nearly  $250 million in shares during the last six months. Shouldn’t you be on their side?Disclosure: I am short CRM."
247254,23724,2011-01-19T05:26:02-05:00,,"In the wake of AAPL and IBM’s beats Tuesday afternoon (see Apple's earnings call transcript here, and IBM's earnings call transcript here), I thought I’d take a look at four of the key stocks in the tech sector. Admittedly, I’m no expert on tech, and I prefer more value oriented names that are easier to project. However, I continue to be confounded by the dynamics inside the sector. On the one hand, you have proven titans like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple, and IBM trading for cheap to reasonable valuations. All three companies have great ROIC and ROEs, fortress balance sheets (both AAPL and MSFT have huge net cash positions, and IBM could easily pay off all of their debt with about 1 year's worth of FCF), a history of extremely profitable growth, and huge potential growth opportunities. Despite this, all three companies trade for reasonable valuations (IBM and MSFT at below market P/Es, and AAPL at around a market P/E after factoring in their net cash position). Plus, IBM and AAPL beat estimates in their quarterly reports, proving the street continues to underestimate these best of breed companies. In the case of IBM, they even break out their long term earnings estimate (EPS = at least $20 per share in 2015, driven by a huge growth in software), giving a road map to what they think the company will look like (and earn) in 2015. Very few companies have the vision and confidence to even project earnings two years out, much less five, which makes it all the more impressive that IBM can. On the other hand, you have a company like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). While its recent growth history has been impressive, it trades at nose bleed valuations (over 260x trailing earnings, 100x forward earnings, and 106x EV/EBITDA) and both its ROE and ROIC metrics aren’t very impressive. While some of this comes from the company expensing its huge R+D costs, the fact is that it must continue to invest in those R+D costs or fall behind, and its larger rivals do the exact same thing and still report great ROE numbers. That’s the advantage of being an established big cap: it gives them the economy of scale to make huge R+D investments and still be profitable. Here’s another fun fact: both MSFT and IBM have huge share buyback programs and constantly reduce share count outstanding while continuing to invest in R+D and growing the business. CRM, in contrast, is a huge share issuer, raising huge amounts of equity over the past few years in order to fund continued growth. In addition, insiders have continued to unload on CRM shares. Clearly, investors are paying a huge premium for CRM growth (though it looks like CRM insiders would rather have the cash than pay the premium). So, just for fun, let’s try to look out to 2015 and project what these companies are going to look like. CRM increased revenues 4.21x and op income 5.73x, MSFT 1.41 and 1.46x, IBM 1.05 and 1.81, and AAPL 3.37x and 7.49x. While CRM and AAPL’s growth will likely slow in the coming years (if Apple grew at the same rate for the next five years, its operating income would be 10x bigger than the average S+P 500 company and about the same size as Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)), even this aggressive projection will highlight just how high CRM’s valuation is. If AAPL grows at the same rate, it would have 2015 operating income of 138 billion dollars, and would trade at a current EV / 2015 EBIT of 2.1x. If MSFT grows at its historical rate, it would earn just over 35B and would trade for just less than 6x EV / 2015 EBIT. (Note: if you assume Apple will slow down to say, IBM’s rate, for the next five years, it would trade at 8.8x EV / 2015 EBIT.) IBM would earn just under 31B and trade for 6.5x EV / 2015 EBIT. CRM, if it grew at the same rate for the next five years and increased earnings 570%+, would earn $661mm in 2015 and trade at an EV / 2015 EBIT of 28.75x. In other words, if the company grew at the same torrid pace they have for the past five years, they would still trade at a huge premium to the tech bellwethers. As a matter of fact, if CRM grows at the same torrid pace for the next seven years, its current EV / 7 years out EBIT would be the same as Apple’s EV / EBIT today. It would take 8 years of growth to trade for around IBM’s current multiple, and 9 years of growth to trade for about MSFT’s multiple. That’s a lot of growth projection, and the company would still have to keep growing at a torrid pace then to justify its valuation.In sum, even with the rosiest of projections, I don’t see how an investment in CRM at today’s prices works out well for a long term investor. Maybe a strategic buyer gets crazy and pays a 3Par like multiple for the company, but it looks like even that type of craziness has already been baked into the stock price. While the market can do anything short term, longer term investors would be wise to look to the tech bellwethers, which offer growth at a still reasonable price, and follow CRM’s insiders' lead: avoid the stock until the market prices in a less rosy forecast.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
241177,22130,2010-12-10T13:13:20-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is a controversial stock, nosebleed high, heavily shorted, and bouncing around in the area of a 52 week high. After a discussion with a reader, I became interested in the situation as a potential short: I have since taken up a position, and this article discusses the thinking and strategy utilized.Price to Sales CRM is presently trading at a P/S of 12.5 - extremely high. Ken Fisher's first book, ""Super Stocks,"" contains an extended discussion of price to sales as an analytical tool. His research and thought processes underlie much of my thinking on this situation, and for readers who haven't read the book, it is a classic.Briefly, the larger a company's market cap, the more difficult it is to justify a high P/S ratio, and the more likely the situation is to end in shattering nosedive. At a market cap of 19 billion, CRM is in a size class where it is very difficult for it to grow fast enough and long enough to eventually achieve a more conventional P/S ratio without going through a reduction in share price. A P/S greater than 10 is cause for considerable analytical concern.The above table lists CRM and four very large competitors. The final item is a projection of what CRM might look like in five years, assuming the share price doubles. In order to justify current multiples, the shares would have to double: otherwise, why take the risk? The assumed P/E of 23 is consistent with double digit growth, and the P/S of 4 is consistent with its big league competitors. Net Income as a % of Revenue reflects the logical relationship between P/S and P/E.How do we get there from here? 39 billion market cap divide by P/S of 4 implies revenue of 9.75 billion. To reach 9.75 from the current 1.55, annual growth in revenue would be 44.5%. Margin would have to increase 2.5% per year. Growth generally declines as size increases. CRM is growing at a rate of 30%, and margins are decreasing.I find it difficult to believe CRM can get there from here.Deferred CommissionCRM's business model is subscription based - typically customers sign 12- to 24-month non-cancelable agreements. The salesman's commission is paid up front, but is posted to an asset account and amortized over the life of the underlying agreement. That is the proper accounting for the situation, since expenses are matched with the corresponding revenue. A vast majority of contracts are signed during the 4th quarter, which ends January 31.The balance sheets have two separate deferred commission items, a current and a non-current. The trend for the past 3 years has been that these two asset items increase an average of 34% in the 4th quarter over the 3rd quarter. That has in turn reflected itself in regular increases in quarterly revenue, approximately 30% per year. In fiscal 2010 (ending 1/31/2010) the 4th quarter deferred compensation was up 39.5%, impressive and not too far from the rate of growth required to support the current share price.This line of analysis is clearer if one studies a table with the necessary information: (Click to enlarge)As noted previously, it is unlikely that CRM can grow at a 44.5% annualized rate, which this analysis suggests is necessary to support the current price level. Given the predictive power contained in the deferred compensation item, investors who have any doubts can resolve them by consulting the balance sheet contained in the press release announcing 4Q 2011 earnings and observing the quarter over quarter increase of deferred commission. That will be the moment of truth.Strategic and Tactical ThinkingMost value investors, the author included, have learned by hard experience that it is not always a good idea to short stocks based on valuation. It ought to work, but it doesn't, or not fast enough. The market can stay insane longer than you can stay solvent.The purchase of puts reduces the risk, by limiting the investor's losses to the premiums paid, but has the disadvantage of being expensive if a long time goes by without a major move downward. To reduce the time cost of maintaining an options position, some type of spread would be helpful, since the time value of the short leg partially offsets the time cost of the long leg.In this case, I went with the following trade, as a research project. I've had good results using diagonal call spreads for bullish positions, and would like to try my hand using the same principles on puts to reflect a bearish opinion.Buy to open 1 CRM May 21 2011 170.0 put @ 32.95Sell to open 1 CRM Feb 19 2011 140.0 put @ 8.30The premium received for the 140 put offsets the time value on the 170 put, so time is on the investor's side. The short put expires February 19th, while the 4th quarter earnings press release came out on February 24th this year. Very possibly the short put will be out of the way at the moment of truth.Disclosure: I am short CRM.Additional disclosure: I am net short CRM as described in the article.

248413,24028,2011-01-25T09:56:14-05:00,,"Numerous articles have criticized Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), claiming that it is overvalued and represents clear evidence of a tech bubble. Most recently, an article entitled “Shades of the Dot-Com Bubble” appeared in Barron’s on January 22. With a stratospheric P/E of 234, how can it not be overvalued? Customer lifetime value (LTV), not P/E, is the key to understanding Salesforce. Let’s look at what it would take to justify a $200 share price today and then ask if it’s reasonable. The bottom line is that if sales growth averages 26.1%, SG&A growth averages about 9% and a terminal value P/E of 20, the company is worth $128.50 per share today. One key factor that many analysts miss is that the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business model creates an annuity revenue stream, since customers pay an annual subscription to access the service. Implementing the software takes time and switching to another provider is expensive. The switching costs increase over time, as each client accumulates historical data and processes become entrenched in the organization. Salesforce, on the other hand, incurs high upfront customer acquisition costs but low ongoing expenses. A solid product combined with high switching costs yields excellent customer retention. Since each new customer is expected to remain for many years -- and even grow as they add new seat licenses and expand services -- customer LTV is very high. While Salesforce does not disclose retention rates, you can be sure it knows its LTV. If we assume that, for every dollar Saleforce invests in customer acquisition, it expects years of revenue, it makes sense that it should be plowing all of its profits back into customer acquisition. With a gross margin of about 81%, new revenue falls to the bottom line, so it’s a great return on investment. Looking at it another way, Salesforce strategy is to focus on growth at the expense of earnings. The chart below slows the annual change in gross profit compare to the annual change in SG&A.[Click all to enlarge] Source: i-Metrix.com /Hassett Advisors AnalysisGross profits are being used to ramp sales efforts. Unlike many other businesses, since we assume that each new customer generates revenue for many years without additional sales effort, if Salesforce were to cut its sales expense, revenues might plateau with very deep cuts -- but would not fall. Sales costs are really an investment and not a cost. Unfortunately, the result of this strategy is that net income and EPS remain low, so the P/E looks ridiculously high. If customer LTV is a multiple of acquisition cost, then this strategy makes sense since it drives long-term value. But even if the strategy is sound, it does not mean the company is not overvalued. For that we need to look at the financials.Absent a good basis for projecting long-term revenue growth, an alternative approach is to reverse engineer to the stock price to see what it would take to support today’s valuation, then explore the reasonableness of those assumption. To do this, I focused on three key drivers: Revenue growth, SG&A expense and exit multiple. I projected 2011, the current year which ends on January 31, and used it as a basis for projections to see what it would take to justify today’s price of $127.50 per share. The bottom line is that if sales growth averages 26.1%, SG&A growth averages about 9% and a terminal value P/E of 20, the company is worth $128.50 per share today. Obviously, the value is very sensitive to these variables. If revenue grows at only 25%, then the price falls to $107, but if revenue grows at 31% the value jumps to $200 per share. If we extend the projections for another five years, a revenue growth rate of 23% hits $200 per share. Revenue growth will be about 27% for the current year, which ends in about a week. That’s up from 21% in 2010 (calendar 2009) after growing 44% in 2009 and never less than 50% before that. Certainly strong performance is required to justify today’s stock price, but it seems far from clear that this expectation is unreasonable. While Salesforce has shown exceptional growth and is a cash machine in the waiting, it is not clear whether it can sustain this high level of growth while keeping customer acquisition costs in check. The question of overvaluation is not driven by today’s P/E. The key questions that investors should be asking are related to driving and sustaining growth: 
What are the customer acquisition costs? How are they trending?
What is customer lifetime value? How is it trending?
What is customer retention? How is it trending?
What are revenues per customer? How is it trending?
 These are some of the key questions that need to be answered in order to determine if Salesforce can grow into its share price. Without answers or at least a solid point of view, you really can’t make the case the company is over- or undervalued, and thus would hardly seem to be evidence of a tech bubble.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
234052,24123,2010-11-02T10:01:29-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) bulls point to the company's huge pile of cash and investments as a source of flexibility and strength for the future.  In articulating my short thesis on the shares, I have argued that there are limited potential productive uses for this cash.  If yesterday's deal to purchase land for the company's new corporate headquarters is any indication, I am correct in believing 1) that there aren't many good uses for this cash and 2) that management cares little about shareholders' interests.For those who missed the news, CRM announced yesterday that it has acquired 14 acres of land in San Francisco on which it will build its new headquarters.  The sticker price?  $278 million.  Consider that figure for a moment.  This is a huge number, and it does not begin to include the construction costs to develop the site.  I do not profess to have any idea what it might cost to build the new buildings, but if this deal is any indication, Salesforce management feels totally free to spend shareholder dollars indiscriminately.  I do not claim to have specific knowledge about the land that CRM purchased, but I do know that it purchased it from professional real estate investors.  Say what you will about the competency of CRM management, but the team is not filled with real estate gurus.  It's hard to imagine that the company got the best deal it could.  Last time I checked, there is lots of high quality office space available in the Bay Area that does not require a $278 million outlay for undeveloped land.I would like to preempt some of the criticism that is sure to come from the bulls.  I anticipate that they will argue that the new corporate campus built on this land will give the company an advantage in attracting new talent (the company makes this point in yesterday's press release).  As I've pointed out in earlier musings, CRM already pays its salespeople well, and it will continue to attract high quality talent so long as it does so.  I think that the building is a secondary or tertiary concern for prospective employees, far less important than the level of pay.  I am sure that bulls will also point out that members of management are shareholders, so they have little incentive to spend the company's cash imprudently.  Those who argue this are ignoring the fact that several members of the management team have been aggressively selling stock for quite some time.  That's not the vote of confidence I would want to see if I owned these shares.  There are plenty of other counterarguments that the bulls will hurl in my direction, and I am happy to address them as they come.I will conclude by asking one key question.  Does anyone genuinely believe that the company will reap at least $278 million of benefits from this acquisition?  Keep in mind that CRM has said it has no plans to develop this property, so the new corporate campus will only come into existence well in the future and after considerable additional spending.  It's difficult to imagine that shareholders will realize commensurate benefits from this deal even on an undiscounted basis.  When we model out the incremental profits that CRM will have to earn far in the future to justify this spending today, the justification goes from questionable to highly dubious.True, Salesforce.com's pool of liquidity can be an asset for shareholders, but management does not seem to have any interest in making it such.  Rather, it seems focused on turning the liquidity into a high-price playground for itself.Disclosure: Author is short CRM"

237805,24123,2010-11-19T11:59:59-05:00,,"Yesterday, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) released its third quarter fiscal 2011 earnings and issued guidance for its fiscal 2012 results. The stock traded up significantly during the day, and the market celebrated its earnings by driving the shares much higher in after-hours trading. The company's report reaffirms our thesis on CRM and gives us added confidence in our short position in the shares.As expected, Salesforce.com's revenues continue to grow rapidly, and management projects this trend into the future. The company issued guidance for fiscal 2012, forecasting $1.97-$2B in revenues. These numbers seem reasonable to us, and, in keeping with CRM's history, they might prove to be a little on the light side.Though the market and the sell-side analyst community seem to be entirely oblivious to this point, this quarter shows that Salesforce is still unable to drive top line growth down to the bottom line. Once again, the company's operating and net income figures stagnated. In the first 9 months of fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, CRM's revenue was up about $250M, yet income from operations increased $8M, and net income declined slightly. Why is this? Where are all the top line dollars going?The answer, in short, is that the bulk of the top line expansion is going, ironically, to Salesforce's salesforce. The marketing and sales line item increased $122M YOY in the first 9 months of 2011. Management talked at length on the call about aggressively increasing their headcount to prepare for growth and said that the rate of hiring would be greater in Q4 than it was in Q3. As we've pointed out before, CRM has a scalability problem. They pay so much in commissions to their salespeople that they cannot translate impressive top line growth into robust earnings. This problem will continue to plague the company's earnings into the foreseeable future.On the conference call, management also spent a great deal of time talking about Chatter. True, this is an extremely exciting product. But, like much of the rest of the hype surrounding this company, Chatter is far more useful for its customers than it is for its shareholders. Management said that they are activating Chatter for free for existing customers. Even when they start charging for a standalone Chatter product, it isn't likely to be a big revenue generator for them by itself. This is a classic case of a company preparing itself for/responding to competition. CRM has to constantly update and improve its product to retain customers, and it is unable to pass through price increases for many of its upgrades.Clearly, the market is pricing these shares on top line growth and product hype. Our fund has a cost basis for our short position of around $116, and we think it likely that the shares trade well above this figure in the near future, perhaps giving us room to add to our position. We have total confidence in our short thesis because we know that, at the end of the day, the value of any enterprise is the sum of the earnings it generates in the future, discounted at an appropriate rate. CRM's earnings are EXTREMELY low given its market cap, and they are barely growing. Eventually, this reality will hit the shares. That might happen tomorrow, next week, next month, or several years from now. We do not know when the earnings picture will matter, but, when it does, we will stand at the ready.Salesforce.com does have robust sales growth. However, its profits are unimpressive. It is issuing stock like crazy to its employees. It recently spent $278M on land for a corporate campus with no development plans. Most alarmingly, its CEO, who used the word ""amazing"" repeatedly on the earnings call and who hypes the company's future with every breath, has been a regular and sizeable seller of its shares. On which side do you want to be, the side of his mouth, or the side of his wallet? We choose to follow his wallet.Disclosure: Author short CRM"

Out of which, 2010 SaaS CRM revenue should be around 26% of total CRM revenue, which is $2.86 Bio.Extrapolating Salesforce YTD sales, I see Salesforce 2010 revenue to be around $1.65 Bio. That works out to a 57.69% market share of the SaaS CRM Market. Salesforce has increased its market share in the SaaS-CRM market.SaaS CRM market has grown from $1.83 Bio in 2008 to $2.86 Bio in 2010. That is around 28% year growth on a non-compounded basis.Assuming the same growth rate, 2011 SaaS CRM market revenue should be around $3.66 Bio. For Salesforce to make $2Bio revenue, it needs a market share of 55%. Though this looks feasible considering their current market share of over 57%, maintaining such a high market share for a sustainable period is going to be extremely difficult.

Though the model differs from Salesforce, this was the traditional model attributed for most of the revenue pre-2000, when Siebel experienced explosive growth and then matured.

Salesforce is leveraging on the same technology that it uses to power its own applications, and is now making this a stand-alone service for developers to create their independent applications. As Salesforce’s primary database in the cloud, the company touts Database.com as one of the largest enterprise databases, containing more than 20 billion records and delivering more than 25 billion transactions per quarter at an average response time of less than 300 milliseconds.As Salesforce CEO and founder Marc Benioff says: “We see cloud databases as a massive market opportunity that will power the shift to real-time enterprise applications that are natively cloud, mobile and social.”Built to power cloud-based applications, Database.com will offer an infrastructure for enterprise apps to deliver updates and information in real-time. Developers can write their applications in Java, C#, Ruby, PHP or more and can run their apps anywhere – on Force.com, VMforce, Amazon EC2, Google AppEngine, Microsoft Azure or Heroku.Apps can also run natively on any device, like an iPad, an iPhone, Android or Blackberry. Salesforce says that these apps can all call the Database.com APIs whether it be for a small application or for an app that supports hundreds of thousands of users.For example, Android developers can write Java Apps that connect to Database.com; or iPhone app developers can write apps in Objective C using Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) tools that connect to Database.com over the web. And web developers can build apps on Amazon EC2 using Python, PHP or Ruby that run against Databse.com.Features include user management, row-level security, triggers, stored procedures, authentication and APIs, all in an easily scalable cloud infrastructure. The product’s relational data capabilities include tables, relationships, support for a variety of field types, triggers and stored procedures, a query language and enterprise search. All types of filed, including documents, video and images, are supported for storage.Database.com includes standard web services APIs and a pre-built social data models and APIs for feeds, user profiles, status updates, and a following model for all database records. For example, developers can request data feeds to display real-time data updates.The infrastructure promises automatic tuning, upgrades, backups and replication to remote data centers, and automatic creation of sandboxes for development, test and training. Database.com offers enterprise search services, allowing developers to access a full-text search engine that respects enterprise security rulesIn terms of pricing, Database.com access will be free for 3 users, and up to 100,000 records and 50,000 transactions per month. The platform will $10 per month for each set of 100,000 records beyond that and another $10 per month for each set of 150,000 transactions beyond that benchmark. The enterprise-level services will be an additional $10 per user per month and will include user identity, authentication and row-level security access controls.Analysts estimate that the database systems marketplace represents a $21.2 billion market so it’s no surprise that Salesforce is looking to take a piece of the pie.

Salesforce.com is constantly innovating and is now bringing many of the lessons learned from Facebook and social media into the business of customer management. Their services provide business customers with a more effective and lower cost method of managing clients, sales, leads and much more.A more effective and lower cost method is a powerful argument indeed and the customer base is growing rapidly, leading to surging revenues and profits. Revenues have nearly doubled in two years (from 749 million to 1.3 billion) and profits are up about 4 fold in two years (from 18 million to 80 million).So the growth is there and the future is extremely bright for CRM but is all that growth and future glory already priced into the stock? CRM is trading at 208 times trailing earnings (that's not a typo) and at 76 times 2011 estimated earnings. It will take a lot of growth to justify the current stock price, let alone drive further stock price appreciation. At some point, as the company matures, we can expect that high PE multiple to contract to a more reasonable level and that could spell trouble for CRM shareholders.In the past there has been plenty of takeover speculation, with the common rumors suggesting Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) targeting Salesforce.com, but those rumors are fading as Salesforce.com grows.

IT spending is showing signs of revival and the company has slowly started reaping its benefits.Consequently, the stock currently carries a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold recommendation.Disclosure: None"
227526,22829,2010-09-29T01:06:57-04:00,,"By Brenon DalyFor some time, we’ve been expecting Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) to make a second purchase in the service automation space. It’s a market the SaaS CRM and development platform player took a major step into back in early 2009 following its $31.5m purchase of French knowledge base provider InStranet in August 2008. It now appears as though salesforce.com has indeed made another foray with the acquisition of enterprise live chat player Activa Live, a move the companies aren’t commenting on but have confirmed to several third parties.Based in St. Clair Shores, Michigan, Activa Live’s customers include American Apparel (APP), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Dun & Bradstreet (NYSE:DNB), Endeca, LexisNexis and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). The startup already had tight integration with Salesforce CRM. Its rivals include other chat specialists such as Bold Software, LivePerson and Velaro as well as a host of service automation software players that provide live chat modules such as eGain Communications, Kana, Moxie Software (formerly known as nGenera), Parature and RightNow Technologies.Salesforce.com has been steadily building out Service Cloud and has found turning on-premises InStranet SaaSy a time-consuming experience. It’s keen to substantially grow the business, and owning more service automation components should further that goal.Activa Live is another of salesforce.com’s under-the-radar purchases, deals that it barely refers to in public or doesn’t acknowledge at all. Such transactions already include the acquisitions of Welsh business orchestration firm Informavores, semantic analysis player GroupSwim, and reportedly Canadian SaaS website building, managing and optimizing tools provider Sitemasher.Salesforce.com is still sitting on a boatload of cash after raising $575m in a private placement at the start of the year, and has only inked one substantial deal in its history – the surprise $142m acquisition of data-as-a-service (DaaS) provider Jigsaw Data in April. We continue to puzzle over what larger transactions Salesforce.com might set its cap at, and would now add business information provider Zoom Information to the list as being potentially complementary to the vendor’s Jigsaw buy. DaaS is another arena where Salesforce.com hopes to make big bucks."

He is always good for at least a few “delighteds,” one or two “amazings,” and assorted other over the top terms like “revolutionary.” On Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) latest call he didn’t disappoint. To be fair, he has some decent things to talk about.1.       25% year over year revenue growth2.       The launch of Chatter3.       Raising full year EPS guidance to $1.17 from $1.15Stock ReactionI will give Benioff this: he is a master showman. It takes a true master to get a 17% one-day lift for raising your guidance by less than 2% on a stock that was already selling at over 80 times earnings and that is non-GAAP.  If you look at GAAP earnings for the year, you would be over 200 times earnings for this fiscal year. I would imagine the CEO is even amazed at his ability to charm the masses. He definitely left tens of millions of dollars on the table by selling large chunks of his shares in the sixties and seventies, but not to worry: he still has millions of shares to unload which he is doing systematically. I think last night’s hypefest on Mad Money will mark the top of stock’s rocket ride for the year and it will start to crater like other stocks in Cramer’s CANDIES (Ex, Intuitive Surgical)Red FlagsWhere do we even start? It feels like this stock belongs to another era; specifically late in 1999 during the Internet Boom. Consider:1.       Revenue is growing at approximately 25% a year, yet the stock is selling at over 150 times trailing earnings, 90 times this year’s earnings, and over 55 times 2013 earnings2.       GAAP earnings(without adjustments) are going to be less than 50 cents this year3.       Attrition continues to be in the teens4.       Insiders continue to sell like crazy, unloaded another 6.5m last week and again made the top 20 insider selling firms in Barron’s5.       Operating margins declined for the quarterConclusionWe were obviously early recommending shorting this stock. We shorted some more at the close yesterday to bring our average cost to $103.78.

232221,24123,2010-10-26T04:20:13-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is trying to position itself to benefit from the cloud computing movement, and the market has rewarded its efforts thus far. However, it is now difficult to justify the valuation on CRM's shares, even if one makes exceedingly optimistic assumptions about the company's future.There are two key flaws in the bull case on CRM. The first is that there is little scalability in CRM's operating model. The second is that the company operates in a competitive industry that will only get more so. To justify a valuation like the one presently on CRM shares, a company needs rapidly increasing sales, an operating model to push sales growth through to the bottom line, and some competitive advantage to allow the company to capitalize on its strengths free of major threats.CRM certainly has rapidly increasing sales. In the first half of its fiscal 2011 (the company's fiscal year ends on January 31), its sales increased 24.2%. Extrapolating this growth out to all of fiscal '11, CRM should do about $1.6B+ in sales. However, during this period, the company's operating income increased a comparatively paltry 5%, to $62.7M from $59.6M. The lack of scalability comes from how CRM must compensate its staff to drive its growth. Much of the pay to Salesforce.com's sales force is commission-based. Thus, the company's marketing and sales line item must increase at least as rapidly as its sales (in proportion thereto). Add to the scalability problem the fact that some of the tech big boys will likely enter CRM's space, and the growth story becomes much cloudier than most presently think it to be.The short case for CRM becomes much more compelling when we take the issues outlined above in concert with the valuation on the shares. Let's assume for a moment that the company doesn't face any scalability problems/competitive headwinds. Let's also assume that the company doubles its sales (to $3.2B) in the next few years and drives significant expansion in its operating margin (from around 8% to around 18%) during the same period. Assuming a 35% tax rate, this gives us about $400M in net income (up from $80.7M in 2010 and $32.5M in the first half of 2011).  If we discount these earnings at 5% (aka use a 20 P/E), we find that this earnings stream is worth $8B. Add $2B to that to adjust for the cash and securities on the company's balance sheet and for the next few years' earnings to get a present valuation for CRM of about $10B. This is about $74.63 per share, significantly below the level at which the shares currently trade. I'd argue that the assumptions that go into this valuation ignore the main business problems that CRM faces. If we took into account the scalability and competition issues, our valuation would be much lower.CRM is a good business in an exciting industry, but its shares have risen far too much. Selling the stock at these levels is the wise thing to do (I shorted it at $104 and plan to add to the position if it rises more). But don't take it from me. Take it from company management, some members of which have been selling stock steadily for quite some time.Disclosure: Short CRM"

227872,21392,2010-09-30T17:52:22-04:00,,"One of the hottest topics of discussion in the  Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) market and broader Cloud Computing arena is  the role of the channel in selling and delivering these web-based  services and solutions. What few people have discussed is the  opportunity for SaaS companies, as well as Cloud vendors, to become  important channels to market themselves.The most intriguing scenario in this SaaS-as-a-Channel (SaaC)  possibility revolves around the Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) idea. The most  recent illustration of this scenario is today’s announcement by  Host Analytics of a new Decision Hub service which pulls industry data  from a variety of third-party information service providers, such as  Edgar Online and Data.Gov, into Host Analytics’ SaaS-based corporate  performance management (CPM) solution.The Decision Hub enables corporate decision-makers to examine their  company performance in relation to a broader set of industry benchmark  data or key performance indicators (KPIs).This isn’t a new idea, but today’s leading SaaS vendors have the  opportunity to aggregate this information from a variety of data sources  more quickly and economically because of an assortment of application  program interfaces (APIs) and generally accepted web services.Another case in point is Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) which has had a longstanding relationship with Reuters and acquired Jigsaw earlier  this year to pump valuable data through its customer relationship  management (CRM) and salesforce automation (SFA) solutions to help its  users achieve their business objectives.So, as these data aggregation capabilities become more prevalent, it  changes the nature of the SaaS company. Rather than simply being an  application provider, it is now providing a higher level business  service powered by a mixture of third-party data sources.In essence, SaaS companies are now becoming information distributors  in addition to application providers. In other words, they are now  becoming an increasingly important channel to market for information  service providers.It will be interesting to watch other types of vendors attempt  to employ SaaS companies and Cloud service providers as new channel  partners as well. Of course, as they do, they will encounter a new set  of challenges regarding how to properly package, price and promote these  new relationships."
224870,21305,2010-09-13T09:04:33-04:00,,"Many complain about HFT, but it can create opportunities for both the “Big Boys” and for you. HFT traders love to short squeeze highly shorted stocks, especially ones that are high growth stocks. The more highly shorted they are, the more easily they can be pushed up, especially in a rising market. Many times the valuations make no sense. Yet people keep buying based on momentum or emotion. The HFT traders love this because they can keep squeezing the shorts with the help of these momentum and emotion traders. The trick is to figure out when the HFT traders are going to let the stocks fall.People have been saying CRM is too highly valued for some time now. EPS growth was -30.40% year over year in the most recent quarter (Yahoo Finance). Yet CRM has gone up 20+% in the last month. The EPS estimates have remained virtually unchanged for the past 3 months (Yahoo Finance). The growth is projected to be a healthy 87.80% in 2010, but a more restrained 28.80% in 2011. On top of that there has been a large amount of insider selling. Virtually all insider transactions have been sales for the last month or more. The Chairman/CEO Marc Benioff has been selling approx. 10,000 shares every day since at least the beginning of August (I didn’t bother to look further back). This amounts to in excess of $25M in CRM stock.Other company officers have been selling too. Virtually none have been buying. Does this mean they lack faith in their company? I am not sure. I am fairly certain it means that they believe that the company is over valued. I mean “a lot over valued“, not just a little. This company currently sports a P/E of 210 and an FPE of 77. If this stock performs as expected (and the price doesn’t rise a cent), it will be highly valued for a 28.8% grower at a P/E of 77 at the end of 2011. Plus there is no huge growth move predicted for the future. The 5yr avg. growth estimate from here forward is 28.07%/yr vs. the previous 5yr avg. growth rate of 43.99%/yr . That’s quite a slow down. A few more statistics are below (from Tdameritrade):Price/Sales (TTM) = 10.38Price/Book (MRQ) = 12.18PCF (TTM) = 105.11Short Interest = 9.70% of Float (as of Aug. 31 -- Yahoo Finance).Return on Equity = 7.24% vs. an industry avg. of 37.33% (definitely over valued)No dividendTotal Cash/share = $5.73Quarterly Earnings Growth (YoY) = -34.39% (MRQ)Quarterly Revenue Growth (YoY) = 24.78% (MRQ)Beta = 1.7The recent chart indicates some weakness, but it is not as yet demonstrable. This means this is likely a good longer term short, but it could see some up blips in a strongly rising market. Thus far the futures are up for Monday. Many think the retail sales numbers will be at least decent on Tuesday. The Initial Claims number for Thursday is unclear. Volume has been extremely light lately. HFT traders could push the market up in the absence of any other impetus. They tend to control the market when volume is light. The big overhead resistance is at about $113 on the SPY. The SPY closed at $111.48 on Friday. If you want to be safer, you might want to wait until the SPY reaches this level. You could continually evaluate the market’s position.I waver here only because CRM is highly shorted. It is over 90% held by institutions. It is highly traded. This makes it perfect for HFT traders to short squeeze in an up market. In opposition to this several analysts (I was one, plus MarketWatch, TheStreet.com, etc.) suggested last week that holders of CRM sell their shares. It could continue to go down near term, even before the market does. I cannot time it that exactly for you. However, if you sell CRM short near its current price, it likely will move down a considerable amount at some point during this fall. The analysts have started to notice the lesser growth. The insiders have too. It only remains for the stock hypers to stop hyping it quite as much. As a comparison FFIV, another hot stock, sells at a PE of 58 and an FPE of 31. It has a next 5yr growth rate of 21.25%. This is a little lower than CRM's 28.07% estimate. However, it is not 4 times lower (based on P/E comparison), nor is it 2+ times lower (based on FPR comparison). CRM is a stock waiting to fall. The Chairman/CEO's behavior confirms this.Disclosure: I have a small short position in CRM."

It also offers a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications. Its CRM services enable customers and subscribers to systematically record, store, analyze, share, and act upon business data, and to enable businesses to manage customer accounts, track sales leads, evaluate marketing campaigns, and provide post-sales service.The company markets sales force automation features of its application services under the Sales Cloud brand name; and customer service and support automation features under the Service Cloud brand name.How does your choice reflect your investment approach? We run a boutique long/short hedge fund based in Miami. We employ a top-down contrarian strategy. Our longs consist primarily of stocks selling at the low end of their historical valuation based on their five-year average of Price/Earnings, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow; have strong management and some visible catalysts; and that occupy sectors that have underperformed the market in the previous six to 12 months.Our shorts consists of stocks that come from sectors that have been market leaders for the past six to 12 months, appear vastly overvalued when compared to their historical valuation metrics, and have heavy insider selling and/or seem driven by their “story” rather than their true business prospects. Our goal as a fund is to provide superior returns in flat, choppy, or bear markets while reducing overall portfolio volatility. We employ option strategies to capture additional premiums and/or hedge positions.Can you talk about the sector? How much is your selection based on the company's industry, as opposed to a pure bottom-up pick? The information technology sector is in a good position in our view, as it operates in a space that is primarily driven by the corporate sector. Corporate balance sheets currently have one of their strongest cash positions in history, and companies are focusing on productivity growth given the uncertainty of sustained economic growth, an increasing amount of new regulation, and unknowns around the future course of taxes and labor costs. That being said, we still believe from a bottom-up perspective CRM is vastly overvalued for a variety of reasons.How is Salesforce.com positioned with regard to competitors?The company is the undisputed market leader in the customer relationship management software space. However, given the growth of cloud computing and the 80% gross margins available in this space, it can count on deep-pocketed competitors - Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP), etc. - offering compelling alternatives at some point in the future.I am also not impressed with the product itself. I spent eight years as a technical director of software development at a Fortune 100 company. None of my contacts from my previous career that have deployed the main CRM software are impressed with its ease of use, technical architecture or overall performance. The most common feedback I have received on the software is that it is adequate, but a somewhat “clunky” tool. How does CRM's valuation compare to its competitors?Probably the closest comparison in cloud computing is VMware (NYSE:VMW), which I think is very overvalued itself but looks like an absolute steal when stacked up against CRM:(from Yahoo Finance)How does your view differ from the consensus sentiment?The sentiment on CRM could not be more positive. The stock has more than doubled in the past year and more than quadrupled since its recent low in late 2008. It is the S in Jim Cramer’s CANDIES, which he hypes on a weekly basis. Every week there is another big story or a hundred on the wondrous growth of “cloud computing.” Salesforce.com's CEO is being profiled in Fortune and other magazines on a regular basis. Sentiment has not been this positive on a tech stock since the Internet Boom of the late '90s. So sentiment is positive - short interest is 10% of float, and with lighter volume it seems short ratio is moving up around 5.0; how would you rate worries about being squeezed on a position like this? Personally I think a squeeze probably would not happen at these valuations, percentage short, or market cap. The stock is certainly not being driven by valuation and sentiment would be hard pressed to be any more positive… I am short CRM, but I have a hedge position, so, not concerned over the short term.And speaking of the CEO, does the company's management play a role in your selection?Yes, management does play an important part of our evaluation. First, they are selling stock incessantly. CRM is consistently on Barron’s weekly top 20 companies with heavy insider selling. They also lost a key executive to Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) recently.Finally, the CEO is famously prone to hyperbole in interviews and events. One recent interview spent quite a bit of time talking about his Zen-like management philosophy, swimming with dolphins and how he works one week a month out of his house in Hawaii. Personally, I like the CEOs for my long picks to be from the old school: nondescript, blunt and totally focused on running the business.What catalysts, near-term or long-term, could move the stock significantly? 1) Any quarterly earnings or revenue number that just meets or misses estimates would seriously crater the stock immediately.2) Tepid guidance during an earnings conference call.3) Any market pullback will result in a significant sell-off of high-beta stocks like CRM.4) The pending increase in the capital gains tax rate in 2011 could facilitate selling towards the later part of the year, given the large run-up in the stock over the past 18 months.5) The “cloud computing” story will stop driving the stock incessantly upward as investors focus on several red flags, including:What could go wrong with this position? As Keynes famously once said, “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.” Momentum stocks almost always run up much farther than they should. Given that, I am going to protect the short position initiated at close of day Friday, at a price of $99.77, with one Jan. 11 125 call for $3 for every 100 shares shorted.Thanks, Bret, for sharing your choice with us.Disclosure: Simplified Asset Management is short CRM.Read more Just One Stock articles »If you are a fund manager and interested in doing an interview with us on just one stock or ETF position you'd hold, please email Rebecca Barnett."

Analyst ViewsBroadpoint's research suggests Salesforce.com had a solid close to the quarter, highlighted by improved execution with larger enterprise transactions and strong momentum with Service Cloud. The firms billings estimate of $325M, or up 25% year-over-year, is higher than the consensus billings estimate of $319M. Broadpoint's subscription revenue estimate of $340.5M, up 16.3% Y/Y, is in-line with consensus. The firm anticipates solid FCF/share of 66c, which is above the consensus estimate of 63c. Broadpoint's EPS/revenue estimates for Q1 are: 32c/$367.4M. Looking forward: Although, Broadpoint anticipates a slight upward bias to FY11 estimates, they believe upside will be muted by the following factors: depreciation and ongoing uncertainly of the Euro, and Salesforce.com plans to invest aggressively in the integration/expansion of the recently acquired Jigsaw and the EPS dilution does not appear fully modeled in FY11 consensus estimates. Broadpoint expects management will maintain their previous FY11 non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.17-$1.21 as the company accelerates growth investments. The also believe forex headwinds may prohibit meaningful increases to the company's previous FY11 revenue guidance of $1.531B-$1.550B. Broadpoints FY11 estimates are: $1.24 on $1.56B in revenue. Broadpoint continues to view Salesforce.com as the best pure play cloud computing investment opportunity and would be buyers on any weakness following the Q1 earnings call. :"

Average analyst estimates for the SaaS provider are $.30/share in EPS and $367.86 million in Revenue. Thirty-two analysts track the stock with three upward EPS revisions in the last 30 days and no downward EPS revisions in the last 30 days. Last quarter, Salesforce.com beat average analyst expectations by.01/share, .16/share vs. .15/share.Now let’s look at the sentiment for Salesforce.com to see if we can learn anything ahead of its earnings release.  We will use sentiment captured by piqqem to determine Salesforce.com’s outlook for this quarter’s earnings. Piqqem uses a -100 to 100 scale and leverages the wisdom of crowds and its own proprietary algorithms to capture and calculate sentiment. Last quarter, sentiment for Salesforce.com predicted a good quarter and the company delivered. This quarter, the company's sentiment has drifted downward and indicates some cause for concern.Any sentiment rating above 25 is considered positive, below 0 is considered negative, while 0-25 is considered neutral. Changes in sentiment are also crucial in understanding and interpreting a companies’ sentiment ahead of an event like earnings.  Finally, market forces need to be considered to make sure overall market sentiment changes are not overly influencing a stock’s individual sentiment.Salesforce.com is also part of the Piqqem Technology Sentiment Index which tracks sentiment for 28 technology stocks in the Hardware & Networking, Software & Gaming, Internet & Mobile, and Semiconductor Sectors. Users can simulate historical and forward looking trades of Salesforce.com using different sentiment triggers in Piqqem’s Portfolio offering.Sentiment for Salesforce.com (Click to enlarge) Source PiqqemThe above chart shows Salesforce.com’s sentiment decreasing by 9 pts from the beginning of the quarter thru today. As a comparison, sentiment for the NASDAQ index dropped 1 pts in the same period, which means Salesforce.com’s drop in sentiment was not strongly influenced by market forces. On the Piqqem scale, Salesforce.com’s sentiment rating of 21.20 is considered neutral and its absolute sentiment indicates a moderate quality stock. Only Salesforce.com knows its actual results, but current sentiment points to the SaaS provider delivering lackluster results on Thursday.Disclosure: No positions"

After all, they are in the best position to assess its current sales momentum, with access to data before it hits the public domain.  Although there is an underlying assumption that these officers are a good judge of the company’s valuation (which may not always hold true), aggressive buying or selling of a company’s share by ‘insiders’ should not be ignored.Although I have been bewildered by CRM’s valuation when it was 50% lower, I am now very reassured that my cynicism of its valuation is shared.Insiders are abandoning ship like the Titanic.Taking the data from Yahoo’s finance site, the overall figure of sales in the last 6 months says sell activity amounted to about 10% of current holdings: not too alarming.However this is heavily skewed by one holder, the CEO, Benioff, who founded the company and still holds 12.4 million shares.  Yes he has been selling 10,000 shares a day, each and every day for the recent past, but this is dwarfed by his massive holding.  Result: he disposed of 7.5% of his holding (proceeds about $65m) in the last 6 months.The startling point is this. It jumps out (like a hole in the head) when you examine the residual.  In the last 6 months, the other officers & directors have dumped 32.5% of their entire holdings.  See table below, data from Yahoo finance.And I don’t blame them - the share valuation borders on the ludicrous.So the conclusion: The other officers, apart from the CEO Benioff, have sold almost one third of their entire holdings. Some have liquidated their entire positions. Ignore such a stampede at your peril.Disclosure: You guessed right, short CRM"
200552,22829,2010-04-23T16:18:37-04:00,,"Just three months after Salesforce.com raised $575m in a convertible note offering, the CRM vendor is dipping into its treasury for the largest deal in its history. The $142m purchase price for Jigsaw Data is more money than Salesforce.com spent, collectively, on its previous seven acquisitions. (Add to that, there’s a potential $14m earnout that Jigsaw could pocket.) Yet, even after it pays for this pickup, Salesforce.com will still have more than $1bn in cash on hand. The transaction is expected to close this quarter.We understand that Jigsaw finished up last year with about $18m in revenue, and Salesforce.com indicated that it was expecting $17-22m in non-GAAP revenue from Jigsaw for the three quarters that the company will be on the books this fiscal year. According to our calculations, Salesforce.com is valuing Jigsaw at roughly the same level that the target is currently valued by public investors, at least on one basis metric. Salesforce.com is paying about 7.9 times trailing sales for Jigsaw while its own market cap is about 8.3 times trailing sales. (Of course, shares of the on-demand CRM vendor are currently changing hands at their highest-ever level, having more than doubled over the past year.)For Jigsaw, the sale to its longtime partner also represents a solid return for its backers, who wrote the checks that funded the company’s growth to 1.2 million members and more than 21 million contact records. Jigsaw’s three investors (El Dorado Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners and Austin Ventures) put in a total of $18m over the past six years. Strictly in terms of money in/money out, that means Jigsaw is returning almost eight times its investment. Not many startups have been able to deliver those kinds of returns recently because they’ve typically been overfunded and exit multiples have increasingly been under pressure."

As a result of Jigsaw, for the 9 months to Jan 2011, GAAP EPS for CRM goes down from 47 cents to 35 cents, or a fall of 25%.  Pause.  A $10 billion company acquires a database for $142m (1.4% in market value) and earnings for the period decline by 25%.Alarm bells start ringing.I have very little doubt that this little piece in CRM’s jigsaw is being used to fudge earnings, simply by the sheer quantum of the earnings decline.  Salesforce has been on a herculean sales drive promoting its anchor status in the cloud. This no doubt has cost a fair buck. And all that promotion has yet to deliver on sales.You have to give credit where it’s due. The company is a prodigy at marketing itself. They’ve used Jigsaw to lower the earnings bar significantly. And yes, there must have been a tiny improvement in sales with the recent advertising binge. No doubt at the next earnings disclosure, a slight raising of the bar will be trumpeted for all to hear.Wait, say the CRM fans. You refer to the GAAP numbers, whereas the fall in non-GAAP figures is much smaller. Sure it is, the main difference in the two being stock based compensation. And as an investor, issuing shares to employees is a very real cost to my shareholding - it dilutes me each time and every time. Make no mistake, GAAP earnings is what counts to the investor.On a GAAP basis the P/E to Jan 2011 on the revised EPS now stands at 177 ($84 divided by 48 cents).  Admittedly, you are in the cloud CRM, but your valuation is way beyond the cumulus and far out into the stratosphere.Digression: Jigsaw on a stand alone basis, at $142m, is worth $35 per company on their database. ($35 per company, that’s probably listed in an infinite number of places for free already. Wow.)Disclosure: Short CRM, at my expense for now."
191014,22829,2010-02-28T01:44:08-05:00,,"By Brenon DalyCould this be a case of history repeating itself? A Web analytics vendor pulls out at the last minute of a technology conference at a boutique bank, and then announces that it has agreed to a richly priced sale of the company. That’s the way it played  out last fall with Omniture at ThinkEquity’s conference. And at least part of that has happened with Coremetrics this week at Pacific Crest Securities’ Emerging Technology Summit. (Coremetrics was slated to present at the event Thursday morning, but canceled its appearance, officially because the presenter was ill.)Of course, there’s been a lot of M&A buzz around Coremetrics in recent weeks, with at least two sources indicating that the company had retained Goldman Sachs to represent it. As to who might be a buyer for the Web analytics shop, we come back to one name: salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). We understand that the CRM giant was acutely interested in Omniture and, according to some sources, was the cover bidder in that process. (Omniture, of course, ultimately sold to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) in a somewhat puzzling  pairing.)Coremetrics’ analytics would fit neatly with salesforce.com’s sales and marketing offering. Both are also SaaS companies. And, as we  noted last month, the profitable company, which has about $1bn in cash available, has announced plans to raise another $500m in a convertible offering. Altogether, that’s plenty of cash to cover a potential purchase of Coremetrics, which would probably go for several hundred million dollars. And if the Coremetrics sale parallels the Omniture sale in that the analytics company goes to a somewhat unexpected buyer, we might put forward Autonomy Corp as a possibility, as my colleague Nick Patience did in a recent  report. The acquisitive British vendor also recently announced plans to  raise a slug of money."
190916,20856,2010-02-26T15:30:56-05:00,,"2010 is likely to be one of those years in which traders who participate on both sides of the tape (both long and short) will have a better chance of succeeding. Investors in the Sound Counsel Investment Advisers absolute return model are currently weighted with significant short exposure due to the high market valuation and the potential for a second bear market in equities. One of my highest conviction short positions is Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) which reported earnings earlier this week.Salesforce.com is one of the leaders in cloud computing technology which helps IT administrators make more efficient use of their resources. In the past, companies would need to own a server for every major function or individual operating system. The result was often a room full of dozens of servers which were all running at 20% to 30% capacity. The situation was an incredible waste until cloud computing technology allowed servers to run multiple systems and efficiently allocated resources between the servers.It’s easy to see how this exciting technology could lead to growing sales. After all, large and small corporations could save on IT costs by using the technology. And that’s why Salesforce.com has been able to grow revenues at a steady clip for several years. Most recently, the fourth quarter revenue was up 22% to 354 million and for the full year the company collected $1.306 billion in revenue which is up 21% year over year. Earnings were strong with the company posting GAAP earnings per share of 63 cents for the year – an 80% increase over 2008. But while these figures appear very favorable, it looks like investors have bid the price of shares too high and may be ignoring some of the dramatic risks in the stock.One of the biggest red flags that I saw when reading the quarterly report was the deferred revenue item. For companies like CRM which receives 92% of its revenue from subscription and support, much of the revenue is received well ahead of time because of long-term contracts which are paid in advance. Due to accounting rules, the company is not allowed to record the revenue until service has been rendered – so revenue for future quarters gets allocated to an account called “deferred revenue.”At the end of the quarter, CRM had deferred revenues of $704 million – which was only up 19% year-over-year. While positive movement is certainly a good thing, the company will need to attract a significant amount of new business in order to keep up with its recent sales growth. The company has 73,500 paying customers which is up 4,600 during the quarter and that performance will have to continue to justify the share price.For 2010, the company is guiding GAAP earnings between 58 and 60 cents per share. I found it a little disturbing that CRM offered “non-GAAP” guidance of $1.25 to $1.27 in earnings when it appears that this figure simply does not account for stock-based compensation (there are a few smaller items as well). To the non-suspecting investor, it might look like the company is really generating $1.25 to $1.27 in additional value for shareholders but stock based compensation truly is an expense and should be treated as such. Although the company does not have to pay cash for this compensation, the additional shares issued has the very real effect of diluting current shareholders.Finally, if you look at the current price of the stock ($66.75 as I write), and compare it to the earnings expected for this year, you can easily see that investors are paying 111 times earnings to own the company. Despite the fact that CRM is growing, the multiple is ridiculous and will almost certainly lead to a sharp decline in the stock sometime in the next year. I am completely astounded at the valuation and hope to profit when the stock trades back to a more reasonable level.Thursday’s trade offered some mixed signals for short-term traders. Initially, the stock gapped down well below the 50 day average as investors digested the earnings report. But by the end of the day, CRM followed the market back higher to recover much of its losses. Still, the stock was down on the day on volume that was well above average. My suggestion would be to buy some out of the money puts on this stock (which are actually relatively expensive) or watch for a clear break lower on volume to set up a short position. Keep your stop levels tight and don’t be afraid to stop out and then try another short trade when the stock breaks down again.My sense is that eventually this stock will run significantly lower, and while the price action will be sharp, it may take several weeks to a few months before CRM finds any significant support. Damage control remains an important part of investing, but wise and careful shorting of this high-flying Wall Street darling could turn out to be very profitable.Full disclosure: Author has a short position in Sound Counsel Investment Advisers accounts"
182668,22829,2010-01-15T02:43:02-05:00,,"By Brenon DalyAlmost two months ago, we  noted that several sources had indicated that salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) may have reached outside its own walls for a little help in getting its Chatter product out the door. (Salesforce.com showed  off Chatter, an enterprise collaboration product, at its Dreamforce conference in November, although it is not yet available.) The official company line at the time was that Chatter was developed in-house, which is consistent for acquisition-averse salesforce.com. The vendor has done just six deals – all of them tiny – in the decade that it has been in business.In recent days, it has surfaced that salesforce.com did indeed acquire a startup. A visit to the homepage of GroupSwim indicates that the company ‘is now part of salesforce.com.’ We have followed GroupSwim since mid-2008, with my colleague Kathleen Reidy initially  writing that the startup’s pairing of semantic analysis with content sharing/collaboration appeared to be a promising approach in a rather crowded market. When we  last visited with GroupSwim a year ago, the 15-employee firm claimed 30  customers. It was still living off angel money.In contrast to the rather meager financial situation at GroupSwim, salesforce.com is closing in on an all-time price for its shares. (Current market capitalization: $8.6bn, which works out to a triple-digit P/E ratio on a trailing basis.) And the on-demand giant just priced $500m in a convertible note offering that will bring its total holdings of cash and marketable securities to $1.5bn. With such a rich treasury, salesforce.com could likely buy hundreds more startups like GroupSwim. Or maybe it’s thinking of something bigger?"
199913,22762,2010-04-21T08:53:57-04:00,,"By Robin WautersSalesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has just announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Jigsaw, which provides crowd-sourced data services in the cloud, for approximately $142 million in cash, plus a performance-based earn out of up to 10% of the purchase price.The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, subject to customary closing conditions.The enterprise cloud computing company in a statement touts Jigsaw’s Wikipedia-style crowd-sourcing model, which it says delivers the world’s most complete, accurate and up-to-date business contact data (e.g. check out Salesforce’s profile on there).When we first reviewed the company back in 2006, Michael Arrington deemed it a really, really bad idea because Jigsaw would pay people simply to upload other people’s contact information (a privacy nightmare).Jigsaw has changed its model since then: people can now see if their personal information has been uploaded, and there is a process to have it removed, at least temporarily. And users are no longer paid cash to upload contacts. Instead they receive points that can be used to download contact other people’s contact information. Revenue was rumored to be around $30 million per year at the end of 2009.As for Arrington, he went from calling the company evil to simply amoral. The question is now if the new owner will be inclined to modify its questionable business practices.Going back to the acquisition: Salesforce says the deal will allow the company to combine its suite of CRM applications and enterprise cloud platform with Jigsaw’s model for the automation of acquiring and keeping up-to-date business contact data. Jigsaw’s data cloud platform, it adds, also creates an opportunity for developers and ISVs to deliver new applications that leverage the business contact data found in Jigsaw.Looking ahead, Salesforce seeks the creation of new partnerships with information services companies like D&B, Hoover’s and LexisNexis.Jigsaw’s community is said to consist of more than 1.2 million members. Over the last six years, community members have built and maintained a contact database of more than 21 million professionals at nearly 4 million companies, according to the press release. Jigsaw currently has 800 corporate customers.The company had raised $18 million in venture capital to date.Original post"

186512,21392,2010-02-04T07:23:40-05:00,,"One of the knocks against Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and the broader cloud computing movement is that these web-based, on-demand services can’t be customized to cater to the complex requirements of specific enterprises.While SaaS solutions have increasingly included a growing array of user configuration capabilities to respond to the individual needs of various organizations, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions have emerged over the past couple of years to permit end-users and third-party developers to build their own apps to meet their unique requirements.The latest indication of the escalating power of these PaaS tools is Wednesday’s announcement unveiling Salesforce.com’s (NYSE:CRM) new Force.com Visual Process Manager. This new feature will allow users to design and build business process-oriented applications quickly so they can automate them across corporate departments.Although the new Force.com Visual Process Manager won’t be generally available until later this year, it is the latest sign that cloud computing alternatives to traditional, legacy applications and systems are becoming more and more competitive with their on-premise predecessors.PaaS solutions may never be able to match the level of customization of legacy applications. However, that isn’t necessarily a bad thing given the black-hole that many enteprises have faced trying to customize traditional enterprise apps to meet their unique needs. This has often been an endless and costly chore for most organizations which has seldom met their corporate objectives. Instead, it has resulted in many organizations being unable to adopt the latest software updates and upgrades from their vendors.Rather than employ an army of consultants to customize traditional applications, Force.com Visual Process Manager promises to give corporate end-users the ability to create and implement business process-oriented applications which can achieve greater utilization in a shorter time-to-value.It is also important to note that this new functionality is the outgrowth of another recent, yet unannounced, Salesforce.com acquisition of a small SaaS vendor, called Informavores, founded in Scotland."

In the case of Salesforce.com, I will use the piqqem sentiment index for Salesforce.com to see how sentiment has changed in the last quarter, for the months within that quarter, and from the end of the reporting quarter through today.

Being unable to access their online customer relationship management system probably didn’t make them too happy.So, will this service disruption derail Salesforce.com, the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and broader cloud computing movement? Only if these isolated incidents evolve into an ongoing pattern of declining performance.Occasional problems happen. Back in 2007, I predicted that the on-demand services market would continue to soar despite more severe service delivery problems at NaviSite that year, because customers were already becoming convinced they could get a better return on investment (ROI) at a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) from SaaS. And, the SaaS market has grown faster and further than the industry analysts ever imagined.The latest round of Salesforce.com outages are certainly important reminders that SaaS and cloud computing vendors are vulnerable to service delivery issues. But, they shouldn’t distract us from the fact that most corporations and private institutions are equally, if not more susceptible to similar operational problems.The only difference is that the IT staff within corporations and private institutions only have to support and report to a single customer, in most cases. Salesforce.com and other SaaS/cloud vendors have rapidly growing customer populations to satisfy. Until now, this has been an inherent incentive to build highly resilient service delivery infrastructures and management processes to govern them.In order to continue to scale and keep their customers happy, SaaS/cloud vendors must mitigate these risks and clearly demonstrate they can outperform inhouse IT/data center staff in the following ways,In 2006, Salesforce.com experienced a series of service outages which raised serious concerns about the reliability and quality of its services. In response, the company launched the Trust.Salesforce.com site and set a new industry standard for service transparency.If the company’s service issues continue, it will have to pull another ‘bunny’ out of its hat to keep customers from jumping ship.

The vendor certainly has one of the lowest ratios of total M&A spending (probably around $70m) to market capitalization ($7.7bn) of any of the big software vendors.Nonetheless, there was some chatter (if you’ll pardon the pun) that Salesforce.com may have acquired some technology from a small startup to shore up the recommendation engine portion of Chatter, a collaboration/social networking offering that’s slated to come out next year. The M&A speculation centered on a startup that perhaps provided some natural-language search capability. We would note that a small shopping trip by Salesforce.com – if, indeed, there was one – to get some social networking/natural-language technology wouldn’t be without precedent. Rival CRM vendor RightNow (NASDAQ:RNOW) tucked  in HiveLive, which had just 25 customers, in a $6m deal last summer.Whether or not Salesforce.com went shopping for part of Chatter, it’s worth pointing out that the firm has used M&A as a way to go after Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) SharePoint in the past. In early 2007, the company picked  up Koral, an early-stage content management startup that Salesforce.com had effectively been incubating. (And on a smaller scale, several months after that, it quietly acquired a tiny social networking startup, CrispyNews.)However, we’re guessing that those purchases, particularly the Koral deal, haven’t generated the returns that Salesforce.com might have hoped. The vendor originally said that Salesforce Content – an add-on, extra-cost module based partly on Koral – could do to SharePoint (among other document management offerings) what Salesforce.com did to Siebel in CRM. That hasn’t come close to happening. In fact, Salesforce.com just announced that Content will be available free of charge to all customers."

As of Oct. 31, Salesforce.com had $1.07 billion in total cash and marketable securities."
174209,20856,2009-11-19T03:48:32-05:00,,"What happens when investors expect perfection from the companies they are invested in? Chances are, those expectations will eventually be disappointed and investors can realize that the level of confidence is unrealistic. This appears to be the case with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) which traded 4% lower in early trading yesterday after announcing earnings Tuesday night.Earnings per share grabbed most of the attention with the company posting a 100% increase and booking $0.16 per share for the quarter. The revenue figure was much less impressive with an increase of just 20%. Salesforce is at a critical juncture where revenue has grown to a place where it exceeds fixed costs, so small increases in the revenue base can have a much larger impact on earnings (on a percentage basis). The million dollar question is whether the company will be able to continue to keep costs low in order to leverage their revenue growth.While management tried to put a positive spin on the forward guidance, there were some significant red flags which will likely cause further selling in the stock. First of all, the level of deferred revenue dropped from Q2 to Q3. This is significant because CRM has many long-term contracts with customers where the client pays an up-front fee and then CRM offers service for several quarters or even several years. This up-front payment cannot be booked as revenue because CRM has not actually performed the service yet. Instead, the payment goes to an account called deferred revenue which then is recognized as revenue slowly over the coming quarters.If the level of deferred revenue is dropping, this has negative implications for future revenues and earnings. Essentially, this means that the company sold less in the way of new agreements than it completed during the quarter. If this happens too many times, we will eventually see a decline in revenues which would be bad news for this high priced growth stock. The other takeaway from the decline in deferred revenue, is that the economy as it pertains to business spending may be recovering more slowly than many anticipate.The second red flag relates to the headcount of employees which is a major portion of the company’s overhead expenses. During the third quarter, management stated that an additional 160 sales representatives were brought on board to help grow revenue during the fourth quarter. Additionally, the company expects to hire another 160 representatives in the fourth quarter in what appears to be a dangerous bet that the additional headcount will pay for itself in the form of new business.To its credit, the company did land an additional 5,000 customers which brings the total client count to roughly 70,000 relationships. It appears that low attrition rates also point to the fact that customers are happy with the service and CRM is providing value. Salesforce and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) are set to announce a new product in January which will be instrumental in connecting call centers with customers. That product launch could significantly add to revenue which appears to be what investors are betting on.Tuesday, the stock closed above $65. which is quite a hefty price considering the company is expected to earn 62 cents per share this year (fiscal year end is January 31) and 84 cents next year. Assuming these analyst expectations are correct (and I wouldn’t be surprised if they are revised lower this week), investors are willing to pay more than $77 for every dollar the company earns. That’s an incredible price which is very difficult to justify.It has been difficult to act on short ideas this year as the market continues to trade higher regardless of the fundamental underlying issues. CRM could certainly continue to trade higher in the short-run as management does a good job of creating excitement. But the risk is very difficult to overlook and at some point soon I expect CRM to give up a good bit of its gains. The 200 day moving average is currently at $45 which still seems like an aggressive stock price for the earnings level. So watch for volatility and short at your own risk, but don’t be surprised if this stock loses 1/3 to 1/2 of its value over the next two quarters.Disclosure: Author does not have a position in CRM"
174081,22762,2009-11-18T12:58:06-05:00,,"By Leena RaoWe’re here at Dreamforce, Salesforce.com’s (NYSE:CRM) annual cloud computing event in San Francisco. CEO Marc Benioff is delivering the keynote and we will be live-bogging the news below. Salesforce has had a banner year, reporting strong earnings Tuesday for the third quarter, launching a new version of their fastest growing product, Service Cloud 2; and rolling out a lightweight contact manager for small businesses. So what is the future? Benioff has long praised the virtues of the real-time cloud and said recently that real-time technology is not only crucial to Salesforce’s offerings but is the future of the company’s products. Benioff has even praised Twitter for making the transition between the cloud and real-time web seamless.Wednesday, Salesforce is making its own venture into the stream with Salesforce Chatter which allows any company to collaborate in real time with a secure, private social network for their business. Content, applications and people will now have profiles, feeds and groups, enabling them to be connected. In addition, developers will now be able to use the Salesforce Chatter platform to build social enterprise applications, and all 135,000 native Force.com applications will be able to tap into Chatter.Salesforce Chatter will let users post profiles, like on Facebook, which include things like contact information, area of expertise, work history and a photo. The social network will also include the ability to post real-time status updates. And Salesforce is tapping into the real-time stream that will feature status updates, not only from people, but also from content and apps. Content will notify users in the Salesforce Chatter feed when new or updated content is available. Apps will join the conversation by posting when there is a change in status, like when an opportunity closes or a case is escalated in Salesforce CRM. Salesforce Chatter will also allow users to create groups within the social network.Similar to Facebook, users will be able to post content, like documents, spreadsheets and presentations, in Salesforce Chatter’s feed. Companies can decide which employees have access to certain information on a network, with a multi-tenant sharing model.Of course, Salesforce Chatter will enable users to filter the most relevant Twitter feeds into their Chatter app. For example, a user can set-up a Twitter search for a competitor and automatically stream the real-time results into Chatter. Employees will also be able to pull information from their Facebook profiles to auto populate their Salesforce Chatter profiles.Any native app built on the Force.com platform can stream updates to Salesforce Chatter’s feed. And with all salesforce.com apps, Salesforce Chatter will be available on the BlackBerry, Windows Mobile devices or iPhone.Salesforce Chatter is currently scheduled to become available in calendar year 2010 and will be included in all paid editions of Salesforce CRM and Force.com. Chatter will also be sold for $50 per user per month and will include Salesforce Chatter, Salesforce Content and Force.com.Benioff will also be revealing more about Salesforce Chatter and his real-time strategy at TechCrunch’s Real-Time CrunchUp on Friday, November 20.Original post"
174059,21435,2009-11-18T11:37:44-05:00,,"Not exactly sure what is not to like about Salesforce.com’s (NYSE:CRM) performance in the last quarter, but the stock is getting hammered down more than 7% in post market activity. Earnings per share doubled from a year ago to 16 cents, which equaled the consensus of the 30 Wall Street analysts that cover the stock. Record sales of $331 million increased 20% over a year ago and also surpassed Wall Street’s predictions of $324 million. Operating cash flow of $36 million rose 107% compared to a year ago. Furthermore, the company raised its guidance for earnings and revenue to slightly higher than the analysts’ view.There is no doubt that the results appear strong, but perhaps the growth was not impressive enough to maintain such a lofty valuation. Coming into the day Salesforce was trading at a P/E or nearly 108x, and the forward looking P/E approached 80x. The PEG ratio for expected earnings growth over the next five years is nearing 3x, which is a stretch. Clearly, this stock is trading based on its potential in the future rather than its ability to earn today.We happen to think that the stock is Fairly Valued at the current levels, which means even by our value based methodology this stock is not so far out of line with fundamentals as to spark this sell-off, especially after a successful quarter. When you look at valuation multiples like price-to-sales for Salesforce.com, they are high but not compared to what the market has been willing to pay in the past. For example, CRM trades for about 6.9x revenue per share however historically the market has paid between 5.6x and 13.4x. Similarly, the current level of price-to-cash earnings of 49x while undoubtedly high is on the lower end of the historical range for CRM. So, while there are concerns over valuation in comparison to the market, at Ockham we think it often is more informative to compare the stock to itself in the past.Remember we have the stock as Fairly Valued, and it would be extremely difficult for us to recommend buying a stock with a simple fiscal P/E over 100x. That being said, the stock continues to improve fundamentally and if it drops back into the mid-$50’s that may make it a candidate for upgrade.We believe there is reason to believe that Salesforce.com warrants a significant growth premium in this burgeoning slice of the technology sector. The Customer Relationship Management industry continues its rapid growth, according to a recent report from Gartner it grew 12.5% in 2008, and Salesforce.com continues to grab an ever larger portion of the market. There was nothing in this quarterly release to make us believe that the growth is not still a compelling factor for this stock.Source for chart: DestinationCRM.comOriginal post"
174139,20099,2009-11-18T16:05:09-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) on Tuesday produced excellent results but disappointed some of its shareholders, who had expected better. The stock was at or near its 52-week high and reports of 20% increase in revenues in a terrible economy were not satisfactory to this very tough crowd. Who managed those expectations? Marc Benioff?Hmnm... How to please? Well, let’s look at some balance sheet issues. Salesforce.com currently holds approximately $1 billion in cash and marketable securities. About 60% of this balance seems to be something called a non-current or long-term asset, which raises enough questions on its own. This is a 600% increase in the last nine months. The cash items now constitute 13% of the company's market capitalization, as R&D is comfortably paid for from regular cash flows.So how do we please shareholders (because good results apparently do not cut it here)? I know, lets spend some cash and make some acquisitions; come up with joint ventures and other cool financial engineering stuff. By then, of course, the nature of the company will change and you will have to start wondering if the management group is the correct team, if the earnings be accretive and all that kind of stuff.Ever get the feeling that management is about to take their eye off the ball and make it sound like a complicated business school strategy case?"
175278,21392,2009-11-25T08:10:37-05:00,,"I’ve always been an admirer of the marketing prowess of salesforce.com… although it always drives me crazy to comply with the lower-case spelling of their name because it seems to genericize their value in my eyes.One of the specific aspects of the company’s marketing tactics which I’ve particularly liked is the way in which it continuously extends its brand identity by incrementally broadening and redefining its functional capabilities. This is a technique which I call “iterative marketing”.Some people use this term to describe a marketing approach in which a company continuously tests its marketing messages and lead generation tactics to see which works best. I’m using the term differently to refer to the way a company can continuously evolve, extend and expand their marketing messages to gain greater mindshare and ultimately marketshare as well.The simplest example of this marketing technique is salesforce.com’s (NYSE:CRM) seasonal releases which routinely include a set of functional enhancements which consistently add value to its existing capabilities.The company also maintains a related marketing discipline which I like. It always previews its seasonal releases a few months before their actual market availability, then announces their general availability, and then reports the results of the rollout of the release when the next seasonal release is unveiled. This means the company gets three rounds of headlines for each seasonal release.This marketing trick is one of the few which Marc Benioff overlooked in his new book, “Behind the Cloud”, which includes a wide array of tips and anectodes about the tactics and events which have helped to foster salesforce.com’s success.In addition to reiterating its capabilities and accomplishments over and over, salesforce.com has also been able to continuously rebrand its offerings as they evolve to make them look even more timely and newsworthy. Here are a few examples,The most recent example of this marketing technique was last week’s unveiling of Chatter at Dreamforce, which was previously referred to as ‘Social CRM’.This is not to say that salesforce.com is simply renaming its existing capabilities to grab additional headlines. In each of these cases, the company has genuinely enhanced its offerings and expanded its capabilities.However, in some cases salesforce.com has also succeeded in confusing its customers, partners, analysts and the press, as well as its own salespeople, who are trying to keep up with the latest iterations and keep them all straight.This was clearly true at last week’s Dreamforce conference where many of the attendees I interviewed were confused about Chatter and unclear about what was really new in its Winter 2010 release.As one attendee said to me,I guess that’s the risk you take when you’re trying to juggle a broadening portfolio of services and messages, like salesforce.com.The question is whether it is time to change its marketing tactics and slowdown the iterative process so everyone can catch up and get on the same page, or should I say ‘cloud’.[Disclosure: Salesforce.com paid my airfare to Dreamforce and has hired me to produce whitepapers on its behalf in the past.]"

Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and the many other companies that offer CRMs have well-established contact management systems within their products that can be incredibly useful to businesses both big and small. But what if you want a easy-to-use, but comprehensive contact management system without the bells and whistles of a CRM? Salesforce.com now has the answer: a Contact Manager Edition of its CRM that doesn’t include all the more complicated features of Salesforce’s conventional product.For $9 per user per month, Contact Manager Edition will store and manage all contacts and accounts in the cloud. The product will integrate with any email system, including Microsoft Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo. The system will track all emails, keeping a record of customer interactions and will run pre-configured and customized reports on contacts and accounts. Of course, this tracking system can be customized to track data that is most important to an user’s needs.Interestingly, the Contact Manager Edition will come automatically with integration with Google Apps, the search giant’s cloud based productivity suite that is steadily gaining enterprise customers and already has a foothold among small businesses. community. All applications within Google Apps, including Gmail, Calendar, Docs, etc, will be integrated with the lightweight CRM.

This online cloud computing site introduced by GSA will help US government organizations to buy and use the cloud computing applications already agreed upon by GSA.Salesforce.com enters the Government cloud computing segment in a big way with this deal, although many cabinet-level government agencies are already using the company’s services. The positive news comes just after the company’s introduction of Service cloud 2, an enhanced version of service cloud computing that provides better solutions to customers. This includes Salesforce knowledge, Salesforce Answers and Salesforce for Twitter. Salesforce is thus blazing all guns to make its cloud computing services available to customers across all segments.Historically, Salesforce has achieved success in all cloud computing deals with government organizations. NASA uses Salesforce’s CRM applications in its partnership program with companies, federal agencies and non-profit organizations to get a macro view of its interactions with these agencies, while the US Army uses Salesforce CRM for recruitment to save time and resources. This apart, the US Department of State's Office of Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund avails Force.com services for providing up to date budget information to program managers around the globe.Government organizations are clearly benefiting from the cloud computing services, saving time by reducing cost of additional hardware and software and without incurring any additional employee cost. Going forward, these benefits should draw the attention of other government customers around the world, generating additional demand for companies like Salsforce.com in the cloud computing segment.On the other hand, big companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), International Business Machine (NYSE:IBM) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are also entering this segment to get a share of this growing market, offering Salesforce.com tough competition."

In his introduction to the interview, Cramer attempted to explain what it is that Salesforce actually does. The world of cloud computing and Software as a Service (SAAS) applications is still very new to many investors. At Ockham, we recently moved our critical IT infrastructure to “the cloud” and are amazed by the potential and scalability of such a business. The opinion around our office is that these sort of solutions are undoubtedly the way of the future. Cramer did a pretty good job of explaining why he things Salesforce is an exciting opportunity. As you can tell from Cramer’s speech, he is excited about the market leading position that Salesforce.com occupies in this new and rapidly expanding business. The company has reported some excellent results even during the recession because in many cases they enable other businesses to save money. From a fundamental valuation standpoint, we believe that this stock still has great potential for appreciation.There is no doubt that CRM receives a premium for their growth potential as you can tell by a simple forward looking (to fiscal 2010 ending January) P/E multiple of about 92x. However, analysts are expecting earnings growth of 33% during fiscal 2011, and high doubt digit revenue growth over that period. So, the analysts are expecting big things from this company in the future. When we take a look into the past, you will notice that CRM has historically sold for 44.9x to 93x cash earnings, but in terms of cash CRM is selling about 10% below the low end of that valuation metric. The same is true for price to sales, as this company has normally pulled a premium of 6.1x to 14.4x sales per share from the market. The current price-to-sales is only 5.7x.The impressive performance of Salesforce.com in the last few quarters suggests that the company is continuing to grow very impressively, and we think that this growth is sustainable because of their revolutionary service. We are reiterating our Undervalued rating at this time. There will be competition from the other Internet powerhouses in the years to come, but we think that Salesforce is doing the right things to grab a healthy slice of the pie. We agree with Cramer that this stock has further upside, and we would recommend buying these shares anywhere below the low $70’s.Original post"

The CRM vendor posted strong earnings for the second quarter of 2009; just announced a new version of their fastest growing product, Service Cloud 2; rolled out a lightweight contact manager for small businesses; and opened up its Force.com platform to outside vendors. Wednesday, Salesforce.com CEO and Founder Marc Benioff is taking the stage at an event in San Francisco to announce more news and speak about the company’s strategy, the Service Cloud 2 and the power of Twitter. Here are my notes from his presentation:Benioff says that the Service Cloud has had “spectacular performance” in a difficult economy, which is one of the reasons Salesforce is focusing on continuous improvement. Benioff says that Salesforce is the “cloud computing evangelist” as the company tries to push for platforms and applications in the cloud. Benioff draws special attention to the SMBs as clients, which can run on the same software and platforms as large companies.Benioff highlights the real-time cloud, saying that applications and platforms need to deliver this value. Real-time is crucial to Salesforce’s offerings and Benioff emphasizes that real-time is the future of the company’s products.Addressing the capabilities of the Service Cloud, Benioff says that call center technology is outdated and can’t leverage the power of Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites. According to Benioff, the customer can save “millions of dollars” by using the service cloud and its “next-generation” innovations.Benioff really focused on the power of Twitter in the CRM, saying the microblogging network has “incredible capabilities” around the world. Twitter in itself, he says, is a tremendous knowledge base. Jason Goldman, a board member of Twitter, says that the Service Cloud 2 is taking conversations that take place on Twitter to another level. He says that the platform is one of the best examples he’s seen of using Twitter to help businesses.Goldman emphasizes that Twitter is imperative to businesses in many ways, especially given its real-time nature. Building Twitter into building processes is what makes the Service Cloud 2 a powerful platform, says Goldman.As I wrote Tuesday, Salesforce is making an interesting play in the cloud, almost making the transition between the enterprise and the social web seamless. The Service Cloud 2’s integration with Facebook, Twitter, Google and the consumer internet is made possible because it is a cloud-based platform and Salesforce isn’t letting anyone forget this.Original post"

Today, Salesforce will be opening up an additional distribution channel off of Force.com: the Value-Added Reseller (VAR) program.The VAR program lets partners, which are primarily IT consultants to large companies, resell Force.com and applications built off of Force.com to other companies. So for example, a VAR partner could create a recruiting app to manage HR processes for a company off of the Force.com platform and charge the company for the application and requisite services. VARs can resell the Force.com cloud computing platform, as well as additional services such as mobile capabilities, storage, sites, and development sandboxes.The possibilities for enterprise applications built off the Force.com platform are endless. Currently, there are more than 120,000 custom applications built off of Force.com to run businesses that perform a variety of functions, including supply chain management, compliance tracking, brand management, accounts receivable, claims processing, time-off applications and more.Salesforce will charge VARs $7.50 per user per month, but VARs can determine the pricing model they implement to outside companies. The program also includes sales resources, technical training for partners as well as support for issues with the Force.com platform. VARs are responsible for supporting their own customizations and applications. Initial partners that have joined the program include Appiphony, American Data Company, EDL Consulting, Lexnet Consulting Group, MK Partners, Reside, Silver Tree Systems, and Sundog.The fact that Salesforce is opening up its enterprise cloud computing platform to outside partners for reselling purposes is strong move towards expanding its play in the cloud computing space.

Read this excerpt, from SearchCRM.Com below:The offer is good through December 31.Microsoft has consistently sought to compete on price with its SaaS-based CRM offering. When it first rolled out CRM Online, it offered the product at a promotional price of $39 per user per month in its first year. The current list price is $44 per user per month for its Professional Edition, well below its competitors. Salesforce.com charges $65 per user per month for its Professional Edition, and Oracle CRM On Demand is listed at $70.It’s far from the first time a CRM vendor has offered to give away its product for a limited time to lure away customers from a competitor. Last October, NetSuite (NYSE:N) made a similar offer to Salesforce.com users, promising to cut their user fees in half and offering 100 hours of professional services to help with data migration and mapping processes across applications in exchange for a one-year commitment to NetSuite.While such programs may not significantly affect the number of companies that would not have switched otherwise, ""they definitely get people to look at the offerings,"" said Chris Fletcher, analyst with Boston-based AMR Research, ""especially with CRM online and Saleforce.com. It's apples to apples.""Microsoft has not been as aggressive with such promotions until now because it has already seen some success luring away competitors’ customers, Patterson said.""We wouldn't do them if they didn’t work,"" he said. ""I think they work better in the online space. Your propensity to switch is greater, and you have less of a capital investment [in servers and hardware] to make switching an easier proposition.""Authors note: Short CRM, alas in the massive recent runup.

To better serve international customers and increase adoption of enterprise cloud computing, CRM today announced that it has built an international data center in Singapore – the first center outside the U.S. In addition, it also plans to establish a Network Operations Center (NOC) in Singapore to monitor data centers in North America and Singapore. CRM has also been expanding its base in Australia and New Zealand (more than 1,000 customers) and in Europe (reporting more than 7,000 customers). The company surpassed 5,000 customers in Asia-Pacific (APAC) countries in its first fiscal quarter of 2010. Over the next five years, IDC expects spending on IT cloud services to grow almost threefold, reaching $42.0 billion by 2012. More importantly, spending on cloud computing will accelerate throughout the forecast period, capturing 25.0% of IT spending growth in 2012 and nearly a third of the growth in the following year.  Salesforce.com was recently included in the Leaders quadrant in Gartner's latest Magic Quadrant for Sales Force Automation. Its cloud computing applications, including the Sales Cloud and the Service Cloud, as well as the Force.com platform for developing and deploying custom cloud applications, enable companies to monitor and manage businesses rather than just focus on improving cost structure. CRM services have been deployed by big companies such as Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (Snapshot Report) and Dell Inc (NYSE:DELL) (Analyst Report). The Service Cloud solution transforms customer service through the power of cloud computing, and brings together industry-leading cloud computing platforms like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (Snapshot Report), Facebook and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) (Snapshot Report).  Recently, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) (Analyst Report) announced its entry into the cloud computing software market with its cloud computing platform – Windows Azure. On a pay-per-use model, it will charge $0.12 per hour for computing, $0.15 per GB for storage and $0.10 per 10,000 storage transactions. This move clearly shows IBM’s intention to compete aggressively in the emerging cloud computing market. We do not expect IBM to catch up anytime with CRM, as the latter is a market leader in the on-demand Customer Relationship Management space with continuous innovations in its offerings and strong brand equity. CRM is likely to lead despite tough competition from Google, Amazon.com and Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) (Analyst Report) in the cloud computing market.  With consistent double-digit revenue growth, Salesforce.com is growing well ahead of the software industry. Revenue per customer has grown at CAGR of 7.4% over the past three years. Moreover, Salesforce.com has shown the ability to retain and increase its customer base. CRM is the first enterprise cloud computing company to reach more than $1.2 billion in annual revenue run rate in fiscal 2009. With strong results in fiscal 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, the company has exceeded our estimates for both top and bottom-line growth. We reiterate our Buy rating on Salesforce.com’s shares with our six-month price target of $45.00."

Guidance for Q2 provided by management on its last earnings call was for EPS of 14c-15c and revenue of $312M-$313M. At that time, the company also raised its FY10 EPS guidance to 59c-60c vs. consensus of 55c, but lowered its FY10 sales guidance to $1.25B-$1.27B vs. consensus at that time of $1.31B. Wedbush is forecasting Salesforce’s Q2 revenue and EPS at $312.5M and 15c. The firm views Q2 consensus estimates for Salesforce as being too low, and it believes the company will meet or exceed those targets. The firm is looking for deferred revenue of $549.2M and billings of $312.3M vs. consensus of $541M and $303M. Wedbush notes that last quarter was the first quarter deferred revenue growth was below 20%, and management expects Q2 deferred to be flat to down. Additionally, last quarter’s billings were only +10% year-over-year, the second quarter in a row <20%. Wedbush's recent conversations with a number of Salesforce.com investors could suggest many believe that business activity at the company will come in well above consensus estimates over the next few quarters. While Wedbush agrees that consensus growth estimates for the next six quarters are not a particularly high hurdle, its view differs from many in that it doesn’t believe Salesforce will be able to re-accelerate growth significantly above the current FY11 revenue consensus of ~15%; it believes this could disappoint investors, who may be expecting growth well above consensus by the middle of next year. Specifically, Webush's view is that Salesforce.com will continue to face difficult compares over the next 1-3 quarters, and it remains concerned that the current challenges in the SMB market could make it more difficult for the company to back-fill the large seat count and price reductions from the mega-deals that were signed after the new platform was introduced, which could be up for renewal this year. The firm will look for signs of growth re-acceleration and a more inclusive channel strategy for its platform sales before we can become more positive on the shares. Wedbush's Q3 and FY11 estimates are 15c/$319.8M and 78c/$1.46B. Conseus for Q1/FY11 is: 15c/$318.36M and 79c.$1.45B."

Guidance for FY10 was 54c to 55c for EPS and revenue of $1.3B to $1.33B. PacCrest believes it's likely that Salesforce.com will beat the consensus revenue estimate; the firm is expecting $305.2M. Salesforce cut some costs during Q1, so PacCrest expects it to meet or beat the consensus EPS estimate and their estimate of 12c. Despite the weak economic environment, the firm believes Salesforce.com is making good progress with its new Force.com and ServiceCloud products. PacCrest sees bookings as the only potential issue. Consensus expectations are for 16% bookings growth, flat with last years growth, which could be among the fastest in the SaaS sector. Based on their checks, flat new business growth is possible. But, given the macro-environment, it would not be surprising if salesforce.com had a shortfall in new business and bookings. Given the recent rise in the company's stock, a bookings disappointment might weaken the shares. But there remains a relatively large short position, which would require seven days to cover, so the short interest might offset share weakness, say PacCrest. Looking forward, PacCrest says Salesforce.com pulled some Q2 expenses into Q1, so they expect that it will guide Q2 revenue and EPS above the consensus of $319.4M and 13c. Also: Shares of salesforce.com have had a nice run since a March 2 New York Times article speculated about new take-out targets for Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Salesforce.com was mentioned."

126190,20468,2009-03-16T11:59:15-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) turns 10 Monday and in the last decade it has cemented its standing as a leading enterprise software vendor and leader of the software as a service and cloud computing charge. However, the next 10 years may be much more interesting.Salesforce.com, officially launched in a San Francisco apartment March 16, 1999, finds itself at an inflection point. The company is posting solid financial results, saw fourth quarter sales jump 34 percent from a year ago and continues to poach customers who are sick of high maintenance costs. And the company is the first of its ilk to hit the $1 billion revenue mark.The big question: Where does the company go from here? It has developed Force.com a platform for on-demand applications and a marketplace for software, but is largely a SaaS customer relationship management software firm (its ticker is “CRM”). Salesforce.com is increasingly targeting large enterprises—the playground of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP, two companies with a lot more sales resources. Here’s a look at my five top unresolved issues for Salesforce.com in the years ahead:Here’s a look at the company’s financial results going back to 2005:As you can see the company has been growing at a rapid clip and it is projecting fiscal 2010 revenue of $1.3 billion to $1.33 billion. But it remains to be seen whether that pace can continue. Ultimately, the laws of large numbers catch up with companies. And while Salesforce.com isn’t at the point where the growth figures will slow too much, the trip to $5 billion in revenue will require different techniques. The company currently has about 55,400 customers worldwide.Salesforce.com’s regulatory filings tell the tale (albeit in a boilerplate fashion):In addition, SaaS purchases are becoming more scrutinized. In fact, some enterprises have determined that SaaS wasn’t the way to go, according to a Forrester report.To date, Salesforce.com’s success can largely be attributed to focusing on commodity software markets that lend themselves well to the on-demand model. The primary example of one of those commodity software markets is CRM. Salesforce.com has tried to expand its service via AppExchange, a marketplace for cloud computing apps that run on the company’s Force.com platform.However, it’s unclear whether that will be enough to build out a full enterprise suite.A Forrester report recently highlighted bevy of enterprise software categories moving toward an on-demand model. Forrester handicapped what categories would be successful under the SaaS model.Clearly Web conferencing and CRM are leading in adoption and growth. That’s the good news. The bad news is that these two categories are the closest to hitting equilibrium and their eventual decline. The challenge for Salesforce.com is finding that new category before on-demand CRM growth slows.Simply put, Salesforce.com needs to find a few new software categories. Does it need a suite? Forrester’s data is mixed on the subject.Human resources, collaboration and IT management have a high degree of success under the SaaS model. But ERP and supply chain management only has a moderate degree of success under SaaS, according to Forrester. Meanwhile, business intelligence—arguably the most important category in enterprise software—has a low chance of SaaS success.Add it up and it’s possible that Salesforce.com goes for the suite much like NetSuite (NYSE:N) has, but a far better option would be to develop HR, collaboration and IT management apps.Here are the leading players via Forrester in each category where Salesforce.com could tap into new growth:In any case, Salesforce.com’s mission will be to build new areas beyond CRM.One of the larger issues for Salesforce.com in the next few years will be competing with established rivals, notably Oracle and SAP, with more resources.Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff noted that the company was poaching customers from its largest rivals. On its last earnings conference call, Benioff said:Meanwhile, Oracle Larry Ellison also has Salesforce.com in its sights. In December, Ellison said:Toss in SAP and its BusinessByDesign SaaS effort and you have a multi-front war. The problem for Salesforce.com: This war is fought on the sales front lines and Benioff’s army is outnumbered by a wide margin. Salesforce.com has 3,566 employees as of Jan. 31 and plans to expand sales and marketing activities. Oracle has 86,657 employees and SAP has 51,536.Indeed, Oracle and SAP (all resources) dwarf Salesforce.com. In fact, Salesforce.com would be a fine subsidiary of either enterprise software giant.Salesforce.com may be able to avoid a lot of the Oracle and SAP pyrotechnics if it can position itself as a cloud computing platform. There was a not-so-subtle change during Salesforce.com’s last fiscal year” It began referring to itself as a cloud computing company instead of an on-demand software outfit.See Feb. 25’s earnings report:And the report from Feb. 27, 2008:Salesforce.com’s messaging points to the future, but in the present it’s an on-demand software company. In its annual report, Salesforce.com acknowledges that “substantially all of our subscription and support revenue comes from subscriptions to our core CRM application services.”How that balance changes may dictate how the next decade goes for the company. The problem is that many other companies—Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google and Microsoft to name a few—are positioning themselves as cloud platform companies. Salesforce.com said in its annual report:The other wild-card is enterprise demand for cloud computing. According to Forrester, only 5 percent of large enterprises have deployed cloud computing applications.It’s no wonder that Benioff is welcoming Microsoft to the cloud: The Windows giant could validate the movement.Given all the moving parts associated with pondering the next 10 years for Salesforce.com, we’d be remiss if we didn’t ponder the company as a takeover target.Google could be a candidate to acquire Salesforce.com. The two companies are long-time partners and Salesforce.com could give Google some enterprise credibility.Other potential buyers could also emerge, but Oracle would be among the most obvious choices to acquire Salesforce.com. Just the fact that Ellison mentioned Salesforce.com so much on the company’s December conference call may indicate interest. He used to beat up BEA too—right before buying it.Meanwhile, both Benioff and Ellison share a passion: They both like to give SAP hell. If you coupled Oracle’s Siebel on-demand unit with Salesforce.com, you’d have the SaaS CRM market locked up to serve as a hedge to Ellison’s more lucrative on-premise software business. At the very least, it wouldn’t hurt to own your biggest threat.So happy 10th birthday Salesforce.com. Now get back to work. Your next 10 years are going to be quite eventful."
127359,22762,2009-03-23T09:46:45-04:00,,"By Leena RaoCloud computing and social networks are two of the more powerful movements in the web 2.0 space. So the potential of social media and the cloud integrating is compelling to say the least. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) recently rolled out the Service Cloud, a customer service application that tries to capture the crowdsourced pools of knowledge floating across the internet from sites like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and then uses this information to better equip commercial customer service operations with useful knowledge. Salesforce has now connected Twitter to the Service Cloud, allowing customer service reps using the SaaS to access tweets from more than 8 million Twitter users.Salesforce’s CRM for Twitter allows enterprises to search for tweets about their companies, products and brands. Here’s how it works. First, Salesforce CRM searches within the Service Cloud for any tweets that are relevant to a company. Then, the company can capture and monitor the conversation, creating a database in the Service Cloud that keeps track of all subsequent conversations about the company. The Service Cloud also allows enterprises to tap into company-wide online communities, creates connections to existing social networks and the blogosphere, provides SEO tools, shares the social network knowledge with business partners, and integrates customer service operations into the cloud.The Service Cloud seems like a useful tool to capture and then sort conversations about a particular enterprise. But what’s fascinating is how businesses want to tap into the dialogue of what’s happening on social networks, like Facebook and Twitter. Social networks are becoming much more than an online gathering of friends; Facebook and Twitter are becoming destinations for ideation, e-commerce and marketing. Its of no surprise that companies want an easy and simple way to capture all of the information that is relevant to their businesses and then leverage this knowledge to improve customer service. As we’ve said earlier, Salesforce has consistently managed to provide innovative, desirable technology platforms for enterprises to merge their business operation with the web 2.0 world.Original post"
128856,20856,2009-04-01T05:41:49-04:00,,"In December of last year, ZachStocks urged caution on Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) as the stock appeared to be over-priced with an economic backdrop that caused concern. After the article was published, readers had an opportunity to bag a 27% gain over the next two months as the stock dropped from the mid 30’s to the mid 20’s.As the current market begins to rally, Salesforce is once again trading at a price that appears unsustainable. Investors are hopeful that a recovering economy will drive users to subscribe to CRM’s cloud computing offerings which allow companies to use programs that would typically be very expensive to install - on a per user, or per login basis.The business model is certainly attractive, especially in a difficult market environment where small and large businesses alike are looking for opportunities to cut costs. The company has seen revenues grow significantly quarter after quarter, and management is very proud to have crossed the $1 billion mark in annual sales. However, the rate of growth for the company has begun to slow and that may be more concerning than some investors believe.The last four quarters have seen revenue growth of 52%, 49%, 43% and finally 34% for the last quarter. Using the high point of management’s guidance for the first quarter, we can expect to see revenue growth of 23%. Now I know that it is impressive to be growing revenue at all in this type of market, but as investors we need to be aware of this trend of decelerating revenue growth. Regardless of the economic environment, it becomes much more difficult for a billion dollar company to grow exponentially compared to a younger startup.Lately some concerns have been expressed regarding the cash-flow trends as well. Since Salesforce.com receives the majority of its revenue from its subscription and support segment (91.8%), it can be concerning when cash flow numbers begin to drop. In this case, the company could still report strong revenue for a time as past subscriptions continue to be recognized in subsequent periods. But it is harder to mask this weakness when looking at cash flow numbers which were disappointing this past quarter.Deferred revenue is a helpful metric in determining future revenue. This is revenue customers have already paid for subscriptions. The deferred revenue came in below expectations which is just another metric that shows how difficult it is becoming to win new business. Now the company is sitting on $883 million in cash and securities and has essentially no debt. That should add stability to the company, but does not necessarily justify the extreme stock price.Management has begun to reduce guidance for Fiscal Year 2010 (the year end is Jan 31). At the same time, however, headcount is increasing as new sales positions are filled. The hope is that the additional employees will allow Salesforce to reach out to a broader client base. But the investment could be risky in such a difficult economic period.At this point last year, the company was very vocal in its excitement over new financial services clients. However, these “all-star” clients like Citigroup (NYSE:C), American International Group (NYSE:AIG), and Genworth Financial (NYSE:GNW) are now in the cellar and no longer represent the strong customer base CRM was trying to build.While Salesforce.com is certainly a strong, viable company; the stock as an investment still looks extremely dangerous. If I were to apply what could be considered a “generous” 25 multiple to this year’s expected earnings, the stock price would only reach $13.75. The current price in the mid 30’s just doesn’t make sense. I would recommend shorting CRM or possibly buying puts to benefit from a drop in the stock price. Timing could be difficult as the strong market can continue to prop up this name, but over the next 6 months I expect to see much lower prices. Disclosure: Author does not have a position in CRM."
122843,22263,2009-02-26T08:04:51-05:00,,"By any measure Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) fourth quarter was an exceptional performance in the savage economic environment companies face today. Revenue grew by 34% yoy, earnings almost doubled, and cash flow rose impressively. There were also substantial new contract wins; gains from upstaging the giants (Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP) on their existing clients and outright wins on new tenders. Management was justifiably content with the quarter and their confidence reinforced about the future of Software as a Service within cloud computing. What’s there to complain about?There is no problem with the company; it has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth in a particularly stricken period. The problem is a significant moderation in the growth rate.Although revenue grew 34% from last year, this only tells part of the success story - the bookings made and related to that specific quarter. The other part of the story is the change in deferred revenues, relating to contracts sold but due in future periods. So the overall customer success rate would be captured as an addition of quarterly revenue and the change in the deferred revenue over that quarter. This would give the true ‘customer traction’ over the quarter, and a year on year comparison would give a real growth rate without any seasonality, clearly a factor for the company.The table below provides two series: the revenue growth and the customer traction rate over the recent history of CRM.Three key observations:To reinforce the point, one needs to examine the cash flow. Cash rarely lies. This is relevant here as the deferred revenue would filter into cash but miss the income statement. The company’s cash flow for the year grew at 12%, remarkably similar to the 16% customer traction.So my point is simply this: CRM is a great company with an exorbitant valuation. Would an investor pay a forward PE of 60 for a company that is growing its cash flow at 16%? Granted, any growth at all is a rare entity today, but after the major reset we have witnessed in share prices and company revenue forecasts, there are numerous companies that will grow earnings from the depressed 2009 base at a superior rate and sport a fraction of the PE multiple.Combine this with the fact that this is the first quarter ever where management has not raised revenue guidance for the following year (they trimmed it marginally from $1.35bn to 1.33bn for FY10). They also forecast flat cash flow for the following year, due to higher cash taxes and capital expenditure, but let’s still say cash is growing at 16%.The graph below depicts the same series. What happens to an exponential growth company whose growth isn’t so exponential anymore? No doubt, investors in FSLR or RIMM would prefer not to be reminded. May the force be with you.Disclosure: Short"
145238,22829,2009-06-25T04:08:32-04:00,,"by Brenon DalyAfter unsuccessfully trying to find a buyer for several months, LucidEra has turned itself over to a workout firm to sell off the patents and whatever else has value at the once-promising on-demand business intelligence (BI) vendor. We understand that CEO Robert Reid and the company’s board members have left LucidEra, replaced by Diablo Management Group. DMG, which got the mandate last week, has sole fiduciary control at LucidEra. A scrap sale, if it occurs, is likely within the next two months or so.It’s a stunning fall for LucidEra, which was arguably the most visible startup in the market. Certainly, cofounder and former CEO Ken Rudin was one of the loudest – if not the loudest – evangelist for on-demand BI. (Rudin served as CEO until last July, when he assumed the role of chief marketing officer and turned the company over to Reid.) The company had raised some $23m from Crosslink Capital, Benchmark Capital and Matrix Partners over two rounds. We would note that if DMG does manage to sell LucidEra, the startups’ creditors will be first in line for payment, with any remaining funds then available to investors. LucidEra doesn’t have many creditor claims, but there are some.In many ways, what initially allowed LucidEra to get going ultimately proved to be its undoing. From the beginning, the vendor tied its fate to Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), specifically offering a pipeline reporting and analytics feature for the on-demand CRM vendor. That essentially made LucidEra an after-market add-on for Salesforce.com customers, which limited its market and always prompted questions about why Salesforce.com wouldn’t just offer that technology. It also got  us wondering in a report two months ago why Salesforce.com wouldn’t just acquire LucidEra. That may still happen. If it does, however, Salesforce.com will be picking up just a fraction of what LucidEra had been when they last discussed a deal. And it will be paying just a fraction of the price, as well."

Note that management tends to guide conservatively with actual revenue usually coming in several million dollars above guidance. The ""whisper"" for deferred revenue estimates ranged anywhere between $550M to $600M, along with a billings growth ""whisper"" estimates between 12%-19%. Wedbush expects Salesforce’s Q4 results to be in line to slightly above very low expectations, as their checks suggest the quarter closed better than the current extremely negative sentiment on the shares could suggest. Wedbush's current forecasts for Salesforce’s Q4 revenue and EPS are $286.4M and 6c. The firm is looking for subscription revenue of $261.4M, deferred revenue of $606.9M, and billings of $423.8M. Wedbush maintains its long-term neutral thesis given its belief that Salesforce.com's small and mid-size customers could continue to be pressured by negative economic headwinds and that subscribers at existing larger customers could decline over the next 1-3 quarters due to ‘shelf-ware’ reductions, as well as increased competition from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and its updated on-demand CRM product, Release 16. Wedbush maintains its target price of $27, but believes shares could spike to $30+ on a good quarterly print.

The company announced its fourth quarter and year-end earnings. It’s quarterly revenues were up 34 percent to $290 million, bringing the total for the year to $1. 077 billion. Net income for the quarter was $13.7 million, and $43.4 million for the year (which doesn’t sound like a lot compared to $1 billion in revenues, but it was more than double last year’s earnings). Its operating cash flow for the year was a quite healthy $230 million.Salesforce ended the year with 55,400 corporate customers, and 1.5 million individual subscribers. And it has $883 million in the bank. Salesforce expects revenues to increase by about 30 percent this fiscal year to $1.3 billion.Passing the $1 billion mark is a major milestone for both Salesforce and cloud computing in general. Salesforce is the first enterprise computing company to get to that size based solely on selling Web apps."

And, last year proved to be a boom-time for nearly every SaaS company with a quality service aimed at a legitimate business need. Now that the economy has sunken into a deeper economic decline than almost anyone anticipated, the SaaS industry is feeling the same pain that has afflicted every other major sector.Fear, uncertainty and doubt–the classic FUD factor–has hit home in the SaaS community. Despite the compelling business benefits of SaaS, corporate and IT, decision-makers are holding back on purchases. And, corporate layoffs are cutting into the subscription levels of current contracts.The latest victim of today’s economic realities appears to be Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), which at the end of last week, acknowledged that three corporate executives, including the company’s president and chief strategy officer had recently left the company. Although the company was unclear about the circumstances of these departures, it appears these executives may have been let go because Salesforce.com is facing serious challenges. I don’t have any inside information to confirm this, but executive shake-ups are usually a sign of problems, and it is easy to see that Salesforce.com is facing a tough situation.The company has been the poster child for the SaaS market since its inception, and it is now the most prominent proponent for ‘cloud computing’ in the corporate world. However, Salesforce.com is also facing the ‘law of big numbers,’ which makes it increasingly difficult to continue to achieve greater growth rates when the base of your operations is getting bigger.Salesforce.com’s challenges are compounded when you consider the bulk of its growth has come from large-scale enterprises, especially in the financial services sector. Not only have procurement decisions among many major corporations ground to a halt, but many of the banking companies where Salesforce.com made tremendous inroads over the past few years are also now gone, or facing consolidation.I’m convinced Salesforce.com will withstand the current crisis, just as I’m confident that the SaaS and broader cloud computing market will prosper long-term despite of today’s economic challenges. Salesforce.com is still the biggest and among the most influential players in the SaaS and cloud computing market, and I’d much rather be in the on-demand services sector than in either the housing or automotive industries.However, the latest moves at salesforce.com are a clear indication that the boom days of the SaaS movement are behind us, and every SaaS company must buckle down in order to survive the current economic crisis. What this is means more tough decisions ahead for SaaS executives and tough times for people in the industry.The keys to success and survival for SaaS companies will be emphasizing the tangible and measurable business benefits its solutions deliver, especially if the company includes greater cost-savings, higher sales productivity or better operating efficiency and customer satisfaction.Disclosure: None"

In a statement, Salesforce.com said that “two-thirds of all service conversations will take place in the cloud.”It appears that the Service Cloud is a part of the InStranet integration. While the details of the Service Cloud seem a bit fuzzy–Dennis Howlett will dissect later–the main pitch here is that Salesforce.com is trying to link up social networking and customer service. The idea isn’t exactly unique as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP have similar efforts underway. In general, customer service reps will be better able to monitor feedback from customers wherever they go–including Facebook.However, Salesforce.com is more likely to provide these linkages quicker given it’s a software as a service vendor.Key components include:"
110166,20856,2008-12-10T15:48:15-05:00,,"Investors have cheered the most recent earnings release from Salesforce.com Inc. (NYSE:CRM) and understandably so.  For the quarter ending October 31, the company managed to grow revenues by 43% to a total of $276.5 million.  Management noted that their services offer low start up costs, low risks, and fast results…  A valuable proposition in these challenging times. But despite the eye popping revenue numbers, earnings just don’t seem to add up when considering the stock price.  Earnings per share were $0.08 compared to just 5 cents in the third quarter last year.  While that is a full 60% gain, the fact remains that it is still just 8 cents.  Analysts are expecting a total of 31 cents for 2009 (the fiscal year ends January 2009), and expectations are for  $0.51 in earnings for the following year.  Impressive growth, but the valuation still seems quite a bit pricey.ZachStocks disclosed concerns with this company back in August prior to the second quarter release.  Since that report, the stock has dropped as much as 65% before rebounding sharply over the past month.  But despite this lower stock price, risks still seem to outweigh the potential benefit of owning this growing company.  In fact, investors will likely use the recent bounce to lighten up on their exposure and I expect the stock to fall again.  Momentum players will not likely be part of the shareholder base as CRM is somewhat tarnished.To be fair, Salesforce.com is actually a very good company and the business has performed tremendously well in this volatile environment.   The balance sheet continues to be healthy with no debt and cash equivalents of more than $800 million.  The number of new customers continues to increase impressively and international expansion should continue to bolster growth (even if the rate of growth decelerates).  Deferred revenue is $470 million meaning that the company has already received payments for services in the coming quarters and will automatically be able to recognize that revenue in Q4 and into next year.Still, the current environment has been brutal to high-multiple growth names.  I do not expect to see this trend abate because investors will continue to take a skeptical approach for some time.  High multiples will need to continually be re-assessed as companies are required to prove the merit of these valuations.  And disappointment will not be treated kindly for names that currently hold such a multiple.  In short, the risk appears to be quite large, but the potential reward is still questionable.Salesforce.com is a wonderful company that I would like to own at the right price.  I value the growth of the franchise and have tremendous respect for the management team.  However, with the stock at more than 100 times this years expected earnings, I believe the money is to be made shorting at current levels.  If the stock were to drop to $15 or below, that would begin to pique my interest.Disclosure: Author does not have a position in CRM"

Although I believe the long-term prospects for SaaS and cloud computing remain strong, there are plenty of short-term challenges facing SaaS and cloud computing vendors in today’s tough economic environment.Salesforce.com’s outage reignites the debate about the reliability of web-based services, and will intensify the concerns of those IT and business decision-makers who have been reluctant to adopt on-demand solutions. It also validates the claims of legacy software vendors that SaaS and cloud computing are not viable platforms for enterprise applications.The ultimate irony is that the public website, which Salesforce.com created after it experienced a series of outages in 2005-2006 to demonstrate greater accountability, www.trust.salesforce.com, also went down during the latest outage. In 2006, Salesforce.com was quick to turn its problems into marketing opportunities. This time, however, there is even more at stake. Salesforce.com will have a hard time convincing software vendors and enterprise customers to adopt its Force.com platform unless it can build greater confidence in its service delivery capabilities.It is not only important for Salesforce.com to quickly restore its own reputation, but also rebuild customer confidence in the overall SaaS/cloud computing industry. This is essential for SaaS/cloud computing companies to capitalize on their competitive advantage over legacy apps in today’s tough economic environment and rapidly changing workplace.In fairness, Salesforce.com’s uptime record is still the envy of many IT and business decision-makers. That is why an increasing number of IT organizations are not only supporting the adoption of SaaS and cloud computing, but also benchmarking themselves and their operations against these on-demand service providers. However, legacy software vendors will attempt to exploit this latest disruption to make their case for sticking with on-premise applications. For example, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has publicly stated that it is targeting Salesforce.com accounts and promoting its ‘pod’ approach as a hosted alternative.Disclosure: None"
101406,21620,2008-10-23T06:55:38-04:00,,"By Kris TuttleWe’re out and about meeting companies and attending some technology conferences in Europe this week. One thing we have heard a few times suggests that Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) may be looking more like legacy enterprise software than a new SaaS or PaaS platform.To be clear, nothing we heard suggests that it’s ""game over"" for Salesforce but rather that there appears to be a more robust market for more advanced, more flexible and lower-cost solutions in this market. It’s been over a year now since we first started hearing from corporate customers that their annual costs for Salesforce.com were out of line with what they felt was justified and what they could get from other offerings. Since people just about always prefer to pay less we didn’t think too much of it at the time.Wednesday we heard from some more organizations saying that they are finding Salesforce.com to actually be *hindering* and *slowing down* their sales process. This was a bit of a surprise for us but when they took us through the reasoning it had much to do with the rather clunky interface of Salesforce and their continued lack of real integration. (There is still a great deal of cutting and pasting involved in doing anything realistic.)At the same time we are hearing from consultants and integrators that they are increasingly recommending to clients that they consider options and even build their own systems.Although just a few pieces of evidence have come forward we generally find they are indicative of some emerging trends. As more software gets developed and deployed in the cloud, it becomes much easier to build applications based on open technology services. This will put some pressure on Salesforce to modernize their products and architecture. Their efforts to transform to a platform company aren’t looking very promising.At the same time this is probably a more fertile area for new companies than we thought a few weeks ago."

A $10 to $15 range implies that the stock still needs to be halved to reach this fair value estimate, and of course, when a stock has this type of a fall, a substantial overshooting on the downside is always possible. Disclosure: Author holds a short position in CRM"

Despite the challenging market conditions, Salesforce.com is set to cross the $1 billion revenue milestone. I believe the SaaS sector is relatively recession proof, and Salesforce.com’s performance this quarter is more evidence of the sector’s strength.Revenue was up 43% y-o-y and 5% q-o-q to $276 million versus Street estimates of $273.5 million. Year-to-date revenue was $787.1 million. Net income was $10.12 million or $0.08 per share (up 60% y-o-y) versus Street estimates of $0.07 per share.Subscription and support revenues were $253.4 million, up 44% y-o-y and 6% q-o-q. Professional services and other revenues were up 41% y-o-y and 1% q-o-q to $23.1 million. Total customers are up 36% to 51,800 with 4,100 new customer additions. The company’s churn rate continues to be less than 1% per month despite worsening economic conditions.Deferred revenue, an important metric for gauging new business for SaaS companies, was up 38% but down 2% q-o-q to $470 million. The sequential decline was mainly due to the impact of the strengthening dollar. It is also due to the seasonality trend that the business has started displaying as discussed in the earnings call: Salesforce.com signs more business in Q4, which leads to a big deferred revenue balance in that quarter. Q1 is down sequentially while Q2 and Q3 are relatively flat.This seasonality also affects cash flow. Cash from operations in the quarter was approximately $17 million, versus $52 million last year and $53 million in Q2. Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter was $805 million, down 2% q-o-q but up 22% y-o-y. The sequential decrease is attributed to the acquisition of InStranet, a provider of multi-channel knowledge applications, and to the purchase of shares in Salesforce.com’s Japanese majority-owned joint venture.Gross margin was 80%, up slightly from last quarter and up three points from 77% last year, driven by better margins in the professional services business. Salesforce.com ended the quarter with 3,300 employees, up 270 over last quarter including 40 employees from InStranet.For the fourth quarter, Salesforce.com expects revenue in the range of $284 to $285 million. GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $0.06 to $0.07. Analysts expected EPS of $0.07 on revenue of $289 million.For fiscal year 2010, Salesforce.com initiated revenue guidance in the range of $1.35 to $1.36 billion or 27% growth over 2009. At the time of writing, the stock was trading around $27 with a market cap of about $3.3 billion. It hit a 52-week low of $20.82 on November 21, after the results were announced.In the last few years, almost 600 SaaS companies have come into the market, including many that have sprung on the Force.com platform. Next year, I expect the acquisition spree of these companies to begin. The $800 million plus in cash and equivalent reserves will certainly help Salesforce.com pull together a wonderful portfolio of applications.By the time we come out of the recession, Salesforce.com should look very solid.Disclosure: None"

CRM has surprisingly managed to keep its share price above 30 in this equity meltdown, the only rationale being its cashflow (the pe of 100 simply could not have survived this carnage). But that cashflow does not account for all the shares they issue to staff (it actually adds to cash) to retain them, in lieu of normal salary.  Well, now most of the recent options are under water (price down about 40% ytd and falling) we'll see how secure their people are, and how much more old-fashioned salaries they have to pay and that will filter, in the old-fashioned way, through the income statement.  Force.com is wonderful for young trendy software people who cant get into the mainstream, who cant pay all those licensing fees for software that is vicariously at hand via the Force platform, but how many applications will be commercialized?

But worries abound under the surface.Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) reported income of $10.1 million, or 8 cents per share, on revenue of $276.5 million for the third quarter. Both tallies beat Wall Street estimates. The quarter also gave CEO Marc Benioff a little reason to show off some confidence–not that he’s short on it or anything. On the conference call, Benioff said:In many respects, Benioff was echoing what numerous research firms like Gartner and Forrester have indicated. Software as a service should hold up in a downturn. Why? Your CFO likes the payment model much better.Analysts, however, aren’t buying Benioff’s argument completely. Oppenheimer analyst Brad Reback noted Salesforce.com’s quarter wasn’t a lump of coal, but wasn’t a diamond either. Forecast subscriptions billing and cash flow was lighter than expected, said Reback in a research note. Third quarter operating cash flow for Salesforce.com was $17 million–a sum that fell short of most expectations. In fact, Merrill Lynch was expecting Salesforce.com to deliver cash flow of $50 million. Management noted the downward trend since the first quarter, but added that Salesforce.com is becoming more seasonal. Big contracts are signed in its fourth quarter and the money starts rolling in during the first quarter. From there it declines throughout the year.The cash flow worry is this: Salesforce.com could be seeing renewals fall. However, Pacific Crest analyst Brendan Barnicle noted that there’s nothing in Salesforce.com’s results that would indicate slowing renewals. For now, management’s expectation of seasonal adjustments holds. Salesforce.com is becoming a fourth quarter and first quarter company with not much happening in the middle.The problem in this market – as with every other company that claims it can weather a downturn well – is that you’re guilty until proven otherwise. We’ve seen these claims before.Cowen analyst Peter Goldmacher notes:Those worries are pretty evident in Salesforce.com shares today. An optimistic open was sold hard."

Another ace up Salesforce.com’s sleeve is that it is the exclusive customer relationship management offering at Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) launch of the new iPhone 3G and App Store.Salesforce is also developing its international presence. Nineteen percent of revenue came from Europe and 9% from Asia Pacific, while 72% came from the Americas.Gross margin was 79%, flat with Q1 but was up by about 300 basis points from last year. During the quarter, Salesforce.com generated approximately $53 million of operating cash, up 53%.Deferred revenue was approximately $480 million, up 49% y-o-y and 2% q-o-q but about $8 million short of Street expectations. Last quarter, it was up 59% y-o-y but down 2% q-o-q. A major reason for the Street’s high expectations is the company’s performance last year; deferred revenue grew $140 million in Q4 last year compared with just $9 million this quarter.On August 4, Salesforce.com closed a $31.5 million deal to acquire InStranet, the leading provider of knowledge management technology for B2C call centers, in its largest acquisition to date.

Analysts had estimated earnings of $0.09 per share on revenue of $272.4 million.For fiscal year 2009, the company raised its guidance yet again. It now expects revenue between $1.070 billion and $1.075 billion. EPS outlook is $0.34 to $0.35, up from prior guidance of $0.33 to $0.34. However, including the effect of the InStranet acquisition of about $0.05, EPS outlook is $0.29 to $0.30. Analysts had estimated full-year earnings of $0.35 per share which hadn’t accounted for the acquisition. The stock is currently trading around $53, down about $12 or 19% since the release. On June 23, it hit a 52-week high of $75.21.I recently placed Salesforce.com at the top of my Top 8 SaaS stocks list, and it very well deserves to be there as it is the first SaaS company to reach the $1 billion milestone. I also believe that it is the company best positioned to go an acquisition spree in the next two years and build a robust portfolio of applications that can be sold to its existing customer base profitably, and with great channel leverage.Disclosure: None"

Meanwhile, Salesforce.com is targeting larger enterprises and that means it faces a slower buying cycle.Bellini’s downgrade, which also came as UBS downgraded the likes of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Symantec (SYMC), touches on concerns that have been raised by Salesforce.com  watchers in recent quarters. Those concerns include:In her research note, Bellini didn’t say that Salesforce.com’s business is unraveling, but did note that the company is looking just like most software vendors. And as Salesforce.com targets larger customers it will increasingly be subjected to the same trends as other vendors. As a result, Bellini lowered her price target to Salesforce.com to $44 from $82. Her actual earnings and revenue estimates didn’t change much. She projects fiscal third quarter revenue of $264 million, down from $274 million and earnings a penny to 6 cents a share, compared to Wall Street’s estimate of 7 cents a share.Bellini notes:Thomas Weisel also cut its earnings estimates for Salesforce.com based on the company’s reliance on financial services companies. For instance, Salesforce.com counts Merrill Lynch (MER)–now owned by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)–and Citigroup (NYSE:C), which just got edged out by Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) to buy Wachovia (NASDAQ:WB), as some of its largest customers."
93815,22263,2008-09-04T03:05:05-04:00,,"When one listens to the upbeat tone of Salesforce.com’s (NYSE:CRM) management on the Q2 conference call, one is surely bewildered by the street's reaction - a 15% haircut. After all, the company made their revenue and EPS numbers- what’s the fuss about?Well let me clarify. Yes, they even eclipsed the street revenue forecast ($263.1m vs. the street’s $261m, a yoy leap of 49%) and reaffirmed their fiscal 09 targets (before the acquisition; by the way, how a $34m acquisition shaves 10% off EPS for an $8 billion company is a subject for another day).However, Salesforce did not anticipate such scrutiny over their deferred revenue balance. Why is this important? Well, the revenue line only tells part of the story of their customer success - the bookings made and related to that specific quarter; whereas the change in deferred revenue reflects more of the customer success story, relating to contracts sold but due in future periods. So the overall ‘customer success’ rate would be captured as an addition of quarterly revenue and the change in the deferred revenue over that quarter. This would give the true customer traction over the quarter, and a year on year comparison would give a real growth rate without any seasonality, clearly a factor for the company.So here’s the customer traction rate: revenue plus change in deferred revenue balance in the quarter, for the last few quarters, on a yoy basis.A few observations:This is clearly a company with decelerating customer traction. Although the sales growth for Q2 was 49%, the real revenue growth, the customer traction, has moderated substantially to 34%. So when a company trades on a current PE of 183 and exhibits a clear sign of declining customer traction, look out below.

100465,21979,2008-10-17T09:43:50-04:00,,"The first casualty of a crash  is innocence.  Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has been in a freefall,  the stock is down about 47% YTD and 57% from the peak in June, but it  is still trading at a ridiculous multiple of 112 P/E (4 x Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  and 5 x Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)), 26X EV to EBITDA (2 x Google and 2.3 x Apple)  and, even using the analysts surreal “pre recession” forecasts,  it trades at a 1.5 PEG (with Google and Apple both at 0.7).Suffice it  to say that I still see a lot of room to fall.  Amidst a universe  of 1330 companies listed in US exchanges with market caps over 1 billion,  Salesforce.com is amongst the 5 highest P/Es. The company, in spite of its hyped  rhetoric, is still just a one trick pony; it only competes in the Customer  Relationship Management (“CRM”) applications space. CRM is a crowded  market with about $7 billion in sales globally, their strong competitors  are companies such as SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sage; Salesforce is  not even a leader in this segment, has a market share of only 10-15%  and is #3 or four. The company’s other main initiative,  called “the force”, is “a platform as a service”.   Now, I confess that I’m not clever enough to know for sure what this  is; I believe it is a development tool that allows you to develop customizable  applications in the “as a service” format offered by the company.   The main problem is that software development tools have never been  particularly profitable. The company’s CEO conceded recently in an  interview that “platform as a service needs a decade to cook” (sic.).   Translation: form an investor's perspective, it is worthless. The CFO has admitted recently  that they expect a foreign exchange hit form the appreciation of the  USD and also that pricing softness is likely ahead. Considering this is the tech sector,  it is impressive that some people never seem to learn the lesson. 14  analysts recommend a buy on the stock with four recommending a sell.   Thomas Ernst with Deutsche Bank drew some chuckles yesterday by revising  the target price downwards from $98 to $80 (the stock is at $32!). I would love to understand the rationale why he thinks that after a  55% fall in the last three months, from its peak at $75, in a global  recessive environment, the stock is going to make a new high.More concerningly,  names like Fidelity, TCW, Sands Capital, Barclays, AXA, have significant  stakes in the company. How will they explain to their investors (pension  funds among them) how they have exercised their  fiduciary duties in keeping this investment at these price levels? This is a case where they, rather than listening to the CEO’s hype  and drinking the Kool-Aid, should have watched what he did - sell  more than $200 million shares of his shares since 2006. Disclosure: Author holds a short position in CRM"
99115,21392,2008-10-08T23:12:17-04:00,,"I've been saying for months that the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) movement will gain momentum as the threat of a recession intensifies.  Now that the prospect of a recession has turned into a full-fledged financial crisis and escalating fuel costs are fanning the flames further, the economic justification for adopting SaaS has become even clearer to a broader cross-section of business decision-makers.  The latest reinforcement of this point came yesterday from one of the most visible personalities in the business press today -- Jim Cramer, the host of CNBC's ""Mad Money"".  Love him or hate him, Cramer has become one of the most influential stock market commentators in the U.S., if not worldwide. And while many can criticize his ability to pick stocks or ridicule his crazy antics, Cramer does deserve credit for helping to educate people on Main Street about the nuances of Wall Street. And in the process, he has also made his viewers aware of many of the fundamental principles of business, as well as the critical success factors for market winners.  Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised to stumble across a segment of Cramer's show last night -- between the various post-mortems regarding the latest presidential debate -- that included an interview with Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) CEO Marc Benioff and a strong endorsement of the SaaS model by Cramer, albeit while still cautioning his viewers to hold back on buying Salesforce.com shares because of its current valuation.  Despite Cramer's hesitancy to recommend Salesforce.com's stock, he strongly endorses the SaaS and cloud computing business models which he describes as not only recession-proof, but perfectly suited for today's turbulent economic environment. (It is always nice to have a popular figure like Cramer echo the mantra I've been preaching for the past year.)  Cynics might discount the significance of Cramer's endorsement, but I believe it is an important milestone in the evolution of the SaaS and broader cloud computing markets."
91726,20856,2008-08-20T04:20:50-04:00,,"Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) reports earnings Wednesday after the market closes.  At this point, the consensus expectations are for revenues of $260 million and earnings of 8 cents per share.  But regardless of what the company reports for the second quarter, investors of all kinds will be paying much more attention to what type of guidance is given by management.  In the current environment where fears of an economic slowdown prevail, it is much less important to understand what has happened in previous quarters, and much more important to gain a clearer understanding of what forces will drive future performance.A recent note out from Raymond James painted the company in a somewhat negative light anticipating a “meaningful downtick” in free cash flow for the second quarter.  The analyst has a cautious view on the rest of the year and suspects that we will see a “deceleration in growth” heading into next year.  Not only is there concern in regards to a slowdown in economic growth, but the prospect of market saturation could begin to play a hand in dampening investor enthusiasm.Management of Salesforce.com appears to have a history of giving conservative guidance. This allows the company to set the bar somewhat low and then impress stockholders by beating its arguably artificially low target.  But this game can become more difficult when low guidance begins to anticipate much slower growth, or if actual numbers only beat the previously issued guidance by a small amount.  In a report issued Tuesday, RBC stated that the company would need to increase full year guidance in order to keep up with an ever optimistic consensus expectation.The report also mentioned that fundamental metrics beyond the headline revenue and earnings numbers would play an important role this quarter. An increasingly more difficult business environment has made investors more skeptical and so the company will likely be required to show “proof” of its strong operations and disclose positive metrics such as deferred revenue statistics and number of active customers.  Since the long-term subscription model yields more visibility in regards to future revenues, there will be special attention given to the number of new customers which RBC estimates near 3,000.For my part, I remain skeptical that this stock can trade much higher.  With a multiple of 185 times this year's expected earnings the valuation seems absurd.  A few have suggested looking at the price to sales ratios, but this type of ratio only makes sense when a company can convert the sales to true economic earnings.  However, timing has made shorting this stock difficult and there is certainly risk that it will gap higher if management paints a rosy picture after the close.  But with the stock unable to make a new high in the last two months, a price that is well below the 50 day average, and strong volume on several days in which the stock traded lower; I believe the time is fast approaching where profits can be made on the short side.  I would approach the earnings announcement with caution.CRM NotesFD: Author has a short position in CRM."

Here are some clear indications that my prediction is coming true:
You can also add standardization to the list. Many of the CIOs who spoke at SaaScon 2008 admitted that they like the limitations which SaaS places on customization, and they have always known that business unit demands for customized solutions were a major factor in the high costs and failure rate of legacy applications. CIOs are seeing SaaS as a way of reshaping the expectations of business end-users.
The CIOs I've talked to recently also recognize the financial benefits of SaaS in today's recessionary climate. Its subscription pricing model permits companies to shift their software acquisition costs from tightening capital budgets to more flexible operating expenses.
And speaking of the climate, many CIOs are viewing SaaS as a 'green' solution because it reduces their computing needs, and 'carbon footprint.'"

67861,20856,2008-03-10T10:58:42-04:00,,"Last month Zachstocks profiled Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) as a potential short candidate in a volatile market. Since that time, the company came out with an earnings report that initially propelled the stock higher. The company grew revenues to $217 million for the fourth quarter ending January 2008. This was 50% above year ago levels and allowed the company to post profits of 6 cents a share versus break even last year. Management was very enthusiastic about the success of the quarter and continued to pronounce “the death of software” which has become the firms mantra of sorts. Of particular note, Aeon became the company’s 7th corporate customer to top 10,000 user licenses while at the same time the split of revenue continues to be roughly 1/3 large cap, 1/3 mid cap, and 1/3 small cap customers.Guidance was also impressive with management expecting revenue to be around $1.03 to $1.035 billion dollars converting to earnings of 32 to 33 cents per share. This estimate should be fairly stable given the high degree of forward contracted business which gives a good amount of visibility when looking at upcoming revenue figures. Overseas business continues to ramp up with European revenue growing by 70% and Asia revenue growing 85% over the last year. These geographic areas still make up a relatively small portion of total revenues but the growth rate is impressive. The company will likely have to spend a decent amount to open new data centers in these new areas which will cut into margins but will also better prepare the firm for future expansion.Despite the rosy outlook for the company, and the impressive execution by management, the fact remains that this stock has a multiple that is extremely presumptuous. Imagine that the consensus expectations are correct in assuming next year’s earnings will come in at 34 cents per share. Further imagine that the company doubles earnings for an additional 2 years (quite an impressive feat) giving the company earnings of $1.36 per share for the fiscal year ending January 2011. The multiple on earnings three years in the future is still over 40, so even if the stock treaded water for 3 years, the multiple would still be high compared to traditional methods of valuing earnings flows. It is very difficult to imagine a scenario where the fundamental news would continue to be strong enough to propel this stock significantly further and yet any disappointing news could have a devastating effect on the stock price.After watching the stock gap higher on the most recent earnings announcement it is interesting to note that the gains are quickly evaporating. Whether this is due to overall market effects or stock specific dynamics, Salesforce is having a difficult time maintaining its market value. This is a classic signal of significant risk being in the shares and has convinced me to begin building a short position in the name. If the time to buy is when there is blood in the streets, the time to sell must be when things are as good as possible. It will be difficult for Salesforce to offer significant upside to the current expectations and with the stock showing weakness the timing seems right to profit from a decline.CRM NotesDisclosure: Author has short position in CRM."

Its Apex platform allows customers and partners to customize and integrate Salesforce CRM applications or build new applications. The company also offers AppExchange, an online marketplace for on-demand applications.Agreed that its products are highly in demand and it has very little competition other than Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), but is that enough justification for the stock to trade at a Forward PE of 200, and more shockingly, a PEG of 13?Over the past few months, the message boards for CRM have been constantly inundated with messages from buyers saying the company is due for a buyout by Oracle or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). I think either of them is highly unlikely, because Oracle recently bought Siebel, and wont be looking to another acquisition so soon. As for Google, these rumors are completely unfounded, as Google has enough on its plate with the gPhone release due next year.Here's something which should worry the longs in CRM: a look at insider trading over the past 6 months. If the management was even half as bullish as the investors, they would have shown some signs of confidence in the stock, by buying it at these levels. Instead, they have been dumping shares like there's no tomorrow. Now, I own Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) too, and the stock has taken a beating recently. Nevertheless, the management team bought back half a million shares at 40+ levels, which gives me the confidence that they have their own money on the stock and they know its got a positive future.With CRM, I am sure the sign is that they are making hay while the sun shines and getting out at the top. Smart work, guys!The market is very bullish now, and the trend seems to be CRM's friend, but when the first signs of weakness come out, it will get plundered like never before.

64489,20856,2008-02-15T05:41:00-05:00,,"Investors have high hopes for Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). The company has championed the “death of software,” offering clients an alternative to bulky programs that typically run on centralized servers requiring constant maintenance and monitoring. CRM instead offers an online solution where customers can set up and maintain business intelligence programs that are accessible from anywhere and are maintained and supported by CRM. Customers appreciate CRM not only for the ease of use and the flexibility of the platform, but also for the cost savings. Paying a fee for each user is often much less cost intensive than purchasing a software package, loading it onto a server, backing up the data, not to mention the personnel costs to maintain and upgrade both the hardware and the software.The CRM solution is very attractive to small businesses who may purchase one or two licenses instead of a large expensive name brand package from People Soft or SAP. At the same time, the company has been able to land several large customers such as Citigroup who typically purchase large numbers of seats. These large clients are more likely to drive higher margins as there is less administrative work per user for CRM to take care of. The diversified base of customers helps drive revenue stability and ward off weakness from any one sector in the overall economy. Interestingly, the company has noted that business from its financial customers has held up relatively well despite challenges in that vertical.The typical revenue model used revolves around user licenses. A company will pay a monthly fee for each ID that is able to access the system. This drives a stable cash stream as visibility into renewals is typically very strong. At the same time, CRM is experimenting with the idea of charging for each time a user logs into the program. This may help to land smaller customers who only need CRM for a small portion of their business and do not want to pay the full license fee for unlimited monthly access. It will take time to see how many clients adopt this option and what the overall effect to margins and profitability are. Analysts appear excited about the choices, but it is difficult to see how this will drive profitability enough to make a material difference.Up to this point, CRM has enjoyed a relatively stable monopoly and has built quite a following being the only major player to offer this type of service with a strong quality and reliability approach. Now that the market sees a profitable business operating in the space, competition is picking up and the heavy hitters are getting involved. Deep pocket competitors such as SAP and Oracle could wring a substantial portion of the profit margin out of the businesses as the participants compete for customers. CRM has stated that they are not concerned with new entrants because they have an eight year technology lead on the market. However, it seems likely that that gap would be narrowed rather quickly if it became a strategic initiative of one of these larger firms.The largest concern for investors is one that is currently being completely overlooked. The stock is trading at 175 times NEXT year’s consensus earnings estimates. Now the counter to this concern is that the company is growing revenue at geometric rates and it is only a matter of time until this revenue is translated to profitability. This argument sounds reminiscent of the logic from the late 90’s when every growth company traded on a price to sales ratio regardless of whether the company earned money or not. Now CRM is profitable and growing, but not nearly fast enough to make up for the price tag that is placed on this emotional name.Shorting momentum stocks is very tricky because it is difficult to tell exactly when the market will finally begin to value a stock based on more traditional measures. If it is overvalued at 175 times earnings, it doesn’t mean the market can’t push it farther towards 200 or 250 times earnings. However, the unstable stock market, and the increase in risk aversion has begun to change the market dynamics. As investors look for safer places to park their capital, names with hefty price tags will likely see multiple contraction and few growth stocks will escape unscathed. CRM appears to be a good candidate for devaluation and may present an opportunity to capitalize by selling short. Notes on CRM  Disclosure: Author has no position in CRM"

It crossed the 1 million mark in subscriptions. Its stock price has increased almost 50% from $36 last year to around $53. It hit a 52-week high of $65.52 on December 21. Its market cap is around $6.2 billion. While still expensive, it is by far the strongest beneficiary so far of the SaaS trend, CEO Marc Benioff having been the original trend-setter who set the industry in motion. In the latest quarter, it reported revenue of $193 million, a growth of 48% y-o-y and 9% sequentially. GAAP net income was $6.5million, up 74% sequentially. For 2008 or its fiscal year 2009, it expects to be the first on-demand company to exceed $1 billion in annual revenue. It has 38,100 customers, up 41% y-o-y and 8% sequentially.

Earlier in the year, it acquired an OnDemand Content Management SaaS company, Koral.Salesforce.com has started the New Year with a bang winning a big customer, Carlson (a $37 Billion Travel conglomerate) for its new Force.com platform. This on-demand application development platform is expected to help Salesforce.com expand its subscriber base beyond its trademark CRM. It also expects Force.com to help face competition from Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP. Oracle has recently come up with its own on-demand “social” CRM that Larry Ellison claims will challenge Salesforce.com’s dominance in the market.Long before the Webex acquisition by Cisco, I had suggested that Salesforce.com, Webex, and NetSuite should merge to offer a separate alternative to the big boys. I still feel Salesforce.com should consolidate the SaaS category before someone else does it.One final comment on the topic of mid-market SaaS: Salesforce.com should make sure that it keeps an eye on this ball, and not let its largely enterprise-oriented “Oracle-culture” drop it. The SME opportunity is large and robust. It is not Oracle’s (NYSE:ORCL) strong-suit. Salesforce.com, once upon a time, had penetrated the market through this door.

60892,21394,2008-01-21T23:37:04-05:00,,"Salesforce.com, (NYSE:CRM) the company that pioneered Software-as-a-Service [SAAS] through its revolutionary web-based Customer Relationship Management tool, is making new waves touting a new cloud computing platform – Force.com.  Salesforce.com was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff and has investors including Oracle CEO, Larry Ellison. Salesforce.com’s CEO, Marc Benioff has claimed that the company has reached 1 million subscribers and it’s on track for more than $1 billion in revenues for its coming fiscal year.  Salesforce.com is a darling with Web 2.0 fans, as it cultivated the platform-as-a-service concept and today, SAP, Oracle and Microsoft are trying to catch up with an on-demand CRM offering. SAP offers CRM in a hosted model and is investing millions in building a suite of applications called SAP Business-by-Demand for SMBs in a hosted model. Microsoft recently announced a new version of its hosted CRM software - CRM 4.0, and plans to launch its SaaS version, called CRM Live, in the first half of this year.Today, every major internet player wants to get into Cloud Computing, formerly known as on-demand computing, and Salesforce.com, the pioneer on Web 2.0, is following suit! Cloud computing is a concept by which computing is moved away from personal computers or an application server to a “cloud” of computers, connected by the Internet. Software manages the computing resources in the cloud and a slew of services including web applications can be served. Experts say that this simplifies IT management as computers can be consolidated and can be used for more tasks, while underutilized systems do not sit idle. The architecture behind cloud computing is a massive network of ""cloud servers"" interconnected in a grid formation running in parallel, sometimes using the technique of virtualization to maximize computing power per server.We have major players with cloud computing platforms today including Amazon.com’s Elastic Compute Cloud, Google File System, IBM’s Blue Cloud for example. In the past, we always used to run software on single computer that you mostly have to buy, own, and manage. This shift to a cloud platform, which is internet based, can change the tech industry tectonically! The big deal is that Internet and cloud platforms make is far easier to create and deploy applications. Today if you use applications on Facebook for example, you know developers are all building their companies and products virtually. Salesforce.com on Thursday launched beta tools that make it possible for developers to integrate the company's software-as-a-service platform with their application development environment. Called the Force.com Development-as-a-Service, the tools include a metadata application programming interface for accessing database schema, user interface code and business logic on the Salesforce.com platform. Developers can also download from Salesforce.com an application that enables development and deployment of software from an open source development framework.This will give subscribers of its CRM software, the flexibility to tailor the company's hosted customer relationship management and sales force automation software. This flexibility in application development appeals to large corporations with an IT staff available to build on top of Salesforce.com's core services. Long known as a provider of online services for small and medium-sized businesses, the company is trying to capture large enterprises as its customers. Earlier last year, Dell became Salesforce.com's second large customer with 15,000 licenses. Now, the company has signed $37 billion Travel Company Carlson, the company which owns Radisson Hotels, T.G.I. Friday's, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises, as a customer. With Internet becoming a secure platform and large enterprises willing to host applications on internet and transact sensitive data on it, we can only see Salesforce.com signing more large sized deals in the coming days. The cloud is powering on."

A year ago, the seller of Internet-based customer-management software posted a loss of $145,000 (nil/share) on revenue of $118.1M. The results topped expectations of analysts who forecast earnings of a penny a share and sales of $173.7M, on average. Excluding items, however, earnings were $0.09/share -- below the average $0.10/share expected by analysts. The company attributed the customer increase, in part, to a new partnership with Google. It also noted that its customers are getting larger. ""A year ago, our largest customer had roughly 7,500 subscribers. Today, our installed base includes two customers with more than 30,000 subscribers; four customers with 20,000 or more subscribers; five customers with over 10,000 and a remarkable 68 customers with more than 1,000 subscribers -- a greater than 40% increase in the number of customers with 1,000 or more subscribers versus six months ago,"" the company said. It ended the quarter with 800,000 subscribers. Possibly contributing to the higher earnings was a 50% tax-rate, rather than 70% as the company had expected, analysts said. Looking ahead, Salesforce.com now sees earnings of $0.08-$0.10/share on sales of $727M-$732M, up from the $0.07-$0.09 on a high-end of sales of $728M it previously had forecast. Analysts had been expecting earnings of $0.08 on sales of $730.4M, on average, for 2007. Third-quarter profits may be a bit below expectations as the company said it sees earnings of $0.01-$0.02/share on revenue of $187M-$189M. Analysts were expecting earnings of $0.02 on revenue of $188.3M. The company shrugged off concerns about competition from companies such as Microsoft, Oracle and SAP, saying it ""had no attrition of any consequence.""

Rene Bonvanie, whom Salesforce.com had recently hired to head up its super-critical AppExchange program, left for Serena Software.  Chances are, you have not heard of Serena Software, while you have most certainly heard of Salesforce.com. Let me enlighten you. Serena Software offers Application LifeCycle Management [ALM] products, and was bought in November 2005 by Private Equity firm Silverlake Partners. While Salesforce.com has created maximum excitement, Serena is a sleepy company, albeit with over 15,000 customers. So why does a star executive like Bonvanie leave Salesforce.com for Serena? In the answer to this question lies some of the challenges hot companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Salesforce.com (and to some extent Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)) are facing. There is a general anxiety that the upside is finished. Salesforce stock has fluctuated in the $40-$50 band over the last 6 months. Google and Apple are still showing very good gains. In contrast, Serena software is probably getting ready to go public again, and will most likely offer an obvious upside to its new EVP of Worldwide Marketing, one that Salesforce.com presumably could not match. It does send out a negative signal to the market for a really excellent company like Salesforce.com to lose a key executive. I wonder how they intend to address this going forward. CRM 1-yr chart:"

They believe CRM's business trends improved materially subsequent to a soft start, perhaps favorably impacted by a mid-quarter sales push. Sources in CRM's ecosystem have generally indicated that the business performed ""much better"" in 2Q than it did in 1Q.
Currently the firm is unaware of any particularly large enterprise transactions that closed during 2Q. However, contacts suggest several are actively engaged and in the pipeline for the second half of FY08, including the oft-speculated 30K+ seat transaction. Recent checks lead them to suspect that the current consensus of 778K subscribers should be achievable.
Sources also indicate the internal shakeup continues and that material personnel changes could ensue. Apart from potential personnel changes, they believe current Street concerns (about competition from Microsoft and subscriber trends) could fade if CRM meets consensus revenue and subscriber targets.

41340,20358,2007-07-17T15:44:18-04:00,,"In fact, with the forthcoming Summer ‘07 release, salesforce.com now describes itself as a the “world’s platform-as-a-service,” complete with acronym, PaaS. It would have been more accurate to add the word ""programmable.""
“The vision for the company is around the platform as service,” Collins to me. “We delivered applications as a service with CRM, and now people can create their own applications as a service. That’s the true benchmark and test of a platform.”
Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff calls it “programming without software,” which is an obtuse way of saying ‘code to our platform and run without worrying about any infrastructure issues.’
The Apex development environment gives developers the capability to create a variety of enterprise applications that run on the salesforce on demand infrastructure. “We are popping the top off of our platform, and with the advanced logic and the capability of our programming language, developers can write inventory management, ERP and transactional applications like ecommerce, ” said Kendall Collins, senior vice president of product marketing at salesforce.com, when Apex was introduced in October of last year.

An example of Apex Code used in an application for assigning and tracking hardware.
At this point, the company is not heralding any of those breakthrough Apex platform applications.
The platform play is also a business strategy. From the inception of the company, salesforce.com CEO and co-founder, and former Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) executive, Marc Benioff has wanted to conquer the larger enterprises served by Oracle, SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) rather than focus on the vast small business sector.
Speaking earlier this year about the Apex platform, salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff said, “We want a killer app to emerge from a third-party. We don’t want to do it all ourselves…we can’t. It’s better to aggregate the whole industry and go at development as a team effort, especially for an distributed environment like AppExchange….We can sell far more seats and at much higher margin over time. As a platform company, we can enter all markets. CRM is only one information management market; there is such a wide area of applications–ERP, custom, custom apps, agile apps. And, the cost and heavy lifting of building apps and the risk associated with developing each additional app for each market and geography is diminished. We share in the success but not in the risk, and the developer doesn’t have to take big risk investing in capital expenditures or taking venture capital money.”
According to Collins, a platform-as-a-service requires three key elements.
Collins said that salesforce.com consistently provides above 99.9 percent availability. “Three nines is the best quality of service you can get today from any on demand player,” he said, claiming that the best deployments of Siebel and Oracle are closer to 96- to 97-percent available.
In any case, as salesforce.com scales up the enterprise and companies have more dependence than for just CRM on its platform, three nines, which doesn’t include times when the service is up but suffers performance problems, won’t be sufficient for customers who can’t afford 8.76 hours of downtime a year.
On the integration front, the salesforce/Apex platform has been successful, with more than 50 percent of the 4.2 billion transactions in the first quarter handled by the Salesforce Web Services API.
Customization is core to salesforce.com’s platform transition, moving from changing a field to writing to code to deliver any kind of application, Collins said.
In addition, the Summer ‘07 release includes some enhancements to its workflow component, renaming it Enterprise Intelligent Workflow and adding the capability to add Excel-like formulas as part of the workflow management.  Customers can also deploy  multiple Salesforce Sandboxes, which give companies a place outside of their production environment for testing, training and development."

This week salesforce.com (the publicly-traded company, with the ticker symbol “CRM”) introduced Force.com, the new moniker for the salesforce (the applications–sales, services, marketing, partner, content and a new one to be introduced Monday) platform (see chart below), which is based on Apex (the code running on the salesforce.com/salesforce/force servers).

He told me that force.com is a “a strong platform name to umbrella all of our innovations.”Salesforce.com is claiming that Force.com “delivers the application development power of .NET or J2EE without software infrastructure,” and has 44,000 custom applications. It basically allows developers to create and run their code on salesforce software and hardware infrastructure.Force.com also has a baby brother or sister, Visualforce, a tool for building custom user interfaces that Larry Dignan wrote about last week after the news escaped prior to the salesforce.com Dreamforce 07 conference.Salesforce.com, the company, has a parallel quest to simplify its branding, and overcome its overabundance of prefixed forces–Sforce, Appforce, salesforce,  Successforce, Dreamforce, Force.com, etc.I expect that Apex will go away at some point and be called Forcecode and that the company will become Force, Inc. (FOR ticker symbol), signifying a graduation from its salesforce automation origins to an application platform and the passing on of the outdated .com appended to the company name.It will take more than marketing and name changes for the Force to be with salesforce.com as SAP (NYSE:SAP), Business Objects (BOBJ), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and others invest more heavily in on demand services. But, Benioff and company continue to lead the charge.In a blog post, Ken Rudin, a former Siebel executive and now CEO of Lucid Era, which develops on demand business intelligence software that also integrates with Force.com, described the challenges of the well-funded newcomers.In time, they will overcome those challenges.

Citi thinks it's possible that this urgent meeting never occurred. In fact, CRM sales management has weekly forecasting calls. And some key sales execs reportedly were absent from this call leading Citi to believe that if the business was way off track, why wouldn't some of these keys execs show up. From firm's view, there is no issue in overall demand. But CRM has to demonstrate it can close this rich pipeline of potential deals. Post the GOOG partnership a couple weeks back, CRM saw a record surge of new customer leads. The firm also believes hiring trends remain very healthy this Q. At 2,243 total employees at end of Q1, CRM has hired ~150-200 new employees per quarter over the past year. They believe CRM continues to hire aggressively in Q2. Even a small slowdown could be beneficial to the overall operating margins for the company.

The firm also noted their contacts indicate that CRM's SVP and GM of AppExchange and Developer Marketing, Rene Bonvanie, recently resigned. In their opinion, Mr. Bonvanie was a relatively high-profile hire, and represented a symbolic move because he was hired from SAP, where he was VP of Global Marketing. First Albany reduced their tgt on CRM to $53 from $58 saying it is still fairly early in CRM's July 2Q; it is possible that close rates will improve during the remainder of the quarter, or that CRM will make up the difference in other segments (e.g., Enterprise, International). I think Citi's right. Either this meeting never happened or it was just one of regular sales forecasting meetings CRM likes to hold. Adding 2,500 customers/quarter, sales management is always fine tuning the business. As for the departure of Mr. Bonvanie, it's likely a non-event. I think CRM will be an early bouncer.

Dewes joined SFDC nine months ago from Hyperion. This comes on the heels of last week's unannounced resignation of the company's Director of Treasury, and marks the second resignation of a senior finance person in less than a week.
Firm notes they view these resignations as a sign of waning morale and other garden variety personnel issues associated with high growth companies experiencing growing pains in a white hot labor market. While they are not sure where Mr. Dewes will wind up, competition for talent in the Valley is very high, particularly for battle hardened managers that have experience working in On Demand/Subscription businesses.
Notablecalls: Expect to see weakness in CRM today. I didn't care when Rene Bonvanie resigned just 4 months after joining the company (looking at his track record, the guy just keeps jumping from one company to another, often from competitor to competitor), but the two resignations highlighted by Cowen do sound alarming. Something is rotten in the state of salesforce.com.

Here’s why: When Salesforce.com announced a ‘major’ development with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in late May, the stock surged on hype. The fact that the details of the partnership with Google were less than impressive did not deter CRM from trading in the high $40s range. After all, the stock has been climbing mostly on hype. Take a look at recent news on the company, and its full of conference presentations, speeches, and nebulous awards. The CEO and CFO have been doing a fabulous marketing job and Wall Street analysts have been eating it up. The substance of the company, however, is not as peachy as these headlines make it out to be. It is amazing that a company with a P/E ratio of 3,660, yes three thousand six hundred sixty, can be adored for so long. Even with an optimistic growth outlook, forward P/E is at 150...what a bargain! Now imagine the wonders an economic slowdown will have on CRM’s stock performance. Every time I look at this chart I feel I am living in bizarro world. In fact, I started to adapt to the bizarro rules (society is ruled by the Bizarro Code which states, ""Us do opposite of all Earthly things!”) When the stock hit close to $50 on May 30th, I became really happy, finally it has hit a pinnacle, and has no where to go but down. By June 25th, it was briefly under $40. I will give Salesforce.com credit where it is due, they have aggressively pursued their clientele and the number of subscribers they are attracting is allegedly growing at a healthy rate. That is the good news. The bad news, is that both Oracle and Microsoft have been aggressively pursuing their own versions of Customer Relationship Management. Oracle has fifty software versions for CRM solutions. What does this mean for Salesforce? Well about the same thing that Wal-Mart means for your local JC Penny; Its not going to go out of business, but its going to lose a heck of a lot of business. Not to mention all that price competition. To support the above, take a look at the earnings consensus for the 24 analysts covering this stock. This past quarter, Salesforce brought home 8 cents per share. Not too shabby considering they made virtually nothing all of last year. Next quarter the consensus shows eight times less than their previous quarter, one cent, and the next three quarters combined hope to bring in seven cents. So lets recap.

Dissatisfaction among independent software vendors “could hinder early stage adoption critical to longer-term growth,” he warns. Goldmacher says the rules require software vendors to pay Salesforce 10% of the first year value of deals in which the lead came from the App Exchange. The company is also supposed to pay 10% of any incremental product sold to the same customer within a year of the original lead. He says the software companies “also are being pressured to pay for booth space” at the company’s user conference in November, and at a significant price increase over last year. And they are supposed to pay 10% royalties for any leads generated at the conference that turn into deals. “Partners are feeling nickel and dimed,” Goldmacher says."
35671,20093,2007-05-21T07:00:36-04:00,,"Ever since SEC rules required the expensing of stock options, the company has been posting disappointing earnings due to the number of options exercised by management and employees. This hurt results last quarter even though the company reported that Cisco had acquired 15,000 licenses and it branched into financial services software. The company reported earnings of less than a million ($0.516 million to be precise) on revenue of $144 million last quarter.
After looking at the number of options insiders had exercised last quarter and the earnings report from the quarter before that, I was convinced that Salesforce.com would report very low earnings while still growing top line revenue. Right before earnings were released last quarter, I bought March 2007 $45 put options. I sold those options less than two weeks later for a gain of 149%. I do not trade very often and this was an uncharacteristic trade for me. Moreover the position was highly speculative as I bought options expiring in a month and had I been wrong, I would have lost most of my ""investment"". This was the primary reason I did not mention this trade in the newsletter or blog.
However as I look at the insider selling at Salesforce.com this quarter, I see the same pattern emerging and I think buying June 2007 put options would be a good play on disappointing earnings from Salesforce.com and as a hedge against a general market decline.
One could argue that Salesforce.com is sacrificing the bottom line in order to continue growing revenue at this point and that investors would be rewarded a couple of years down the line. Such a line of thinking would not only be ignoring the fact that management is willing to significantly hurt earnings through its options exercising practices and that competitors such as NetSuite could capture more market share. Even Microsoft through its Sharepoint software and Oracle through its Fusion product (when it is released) could put a dent into Salesforce.com's growth. In case you are interested, NetSuite plans to go public sometime this year.
I had a chance to review offerings from both Salesforce.com and NetSuite for a client of mine. While I like Salesforce.com's AppeXchange platform and the options they provide for custom development, NetSuite offers a more integrated and broader platform. If only NetSuite provided development support in languages other than Javascript, they would win over more developers.



These put options are highly risky and there is a very good chance that we could just as easily lose our entire ""investment"" as make money on it. Hence I am allocating just 0.5% of the portfolio to this position."

While the firm has readily acknowledged the significant growth of salesforce.com revenues, they remain concerned that the company is generating the growth at an increasing cost. They need to see better operating leverage - something that has yet to improve, and in fact may be weakening. Hence, they remain Underweight CRM shares. - Cowen says they would not be surprised to see the stock trade off in the coming weeks following a decent, but not great quarter, in the face of high expectations and the looming specter of a full frontal assault by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the coming quarters. While most financial metrics were good, none were outstanding, and the company continues to be only marginally profitable on a GAAP basis. Despite a high level of predictability in the subs model, the firm believes heavy infrastructure investments intended to stimulate growth could have a negative impact on profitability and FCF should the competitive environment heat up, a scenario they consider highly likely. CRM trades at 38x Cowen's revised FCF forecast of $146M (+67%). Maintains Neutral. Notablecalls: Well, it looks like growth is becoming more expensive for CRM. Oracle, Microsoft and SAP (NYSE:SAP) have participated half-heartedly in the SAAS space so far but as Cowen notes, this may be changing soon.

32704,20717,2007-04-18T09:42:24-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is a classic case of a good product with a bad stock. I have used the customer management software [CRM], and I must say that I am quite impressed. It’s very user friendly and its advantages over CRM sold in a box are numerous and more than I can list here. Analyst reports with strong buy recommendations rave about the future of on-demand CRM and Salesforce. There’s just one problem: too many people on Wall Street know about it and love it. With so many people excited about the real future of on-demand, Wall Street is pricing Salesforce as if the profit is already in the corporate coffers. Leading the speculation is the idea that everyone will want on-demand CRM. However, this may not be a good assumption. My assumption is that some people will want on-demand and some people will prefer box software. Sure, on-demand has lower start-up costs, but box software can have lower long-term costs. Salesforce has done a good job of protecting against hackers. However, there will always be firms will want the added security of local customer information regardless of however slight the risks are of data intrusion of customer info being sent over the web. As we now see, the expense of only one data intrusion can far exceed any savings from reduced IT departments. Salesforce’s shortcoming is that it doesn’t offer fully featured in-the-box solutions along with its on-demand service, something which Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and, soon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) do offer. The conventional wisdom for on-demand software it is that its recurring revenue. And Salesforce’s less than 1% churn rate adds huge credibility to that claim. However, on-demand software has one disadvantage to it which is not being adequately priced: with recurring revenue comes recurring obligation to maintain the service. Conventional wisdom also says that low earnings are OK for stocks with strong potential growth. So instead of earnings, we can look to revenue and its growth, right? Salesforce.com’s revenue may be recurring but so is its cost of revenue. A much more accurate measure of Salesforce’s value is gross profit because it will never be the case that Salesforce receives revenue for which is doesn’t provide on-demand service or pay a cost of goods sold. On a good day, Salesforce’s Enterprise Value-to-Revenue ratio is around 9.5. So what, Salesforce has 3 times the revenue growth of other techs, right? The problem is that the other techs that Salesforce is being priced in comparison to are profitable operations. Yes, Google has an EV/Rev of 13, but it also has a P/E of 50 in comparison to Salesforce’s P/E of 11,500. The future P/E ratio of Salesforce is also riding quite high as well. So maybe Salesforce’s 2-year forward P/E of 60 makes it a bargain? If the analyst earnings forecast were written in stone, I might agree with you; however, the $5 billion question is whether these forecast can adequately predict the effect of the two barbarians knocking at the gate, Oracle and Microsoft. Salesforce may go on to do well in the world, but there is tremendous risk that isn’t being priced into the stock. Disclosure: Author has a short position in CRM    CRM 1-yr chart"

With the new Salesforce Platform Edition, developers can build and deploy applications independent of salesforce.com’s CRM applications.  The company expects to have applications in new categories, such as  ERP, ecommerce, financial services, human resources and legal, using its Apex development language and supported on its on demand, multitenant infrastructure. Speaking earlier this year about the Apex platform, salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff said, Apex, a Java-like programming language, won't be foreign to developers, and taking advantage of  infrastructure-as-a-service, such as what salesforce.com offers, is the wave of the future. But, it remains to be seen if major ERP applications developed natively on Apex that can compete with SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) will be appearing soon. Workday, for example, is developing on demand ERP applications on its own platform that company CEO Dave Duffield boasted will reach parity with SAP and Oracle in 18 months.  Currently salesforce.com's AppExchange marketplace has about 550 applications, mostly tied into salesforce.com's CRM solutions. Salesforce Platform editions have been in beta test with a few customers, including The Schumacher Group, which has been developing internal applications for contracting, recruiting, credentialing, and payroll departments. Salesforce Platform Enterprise Edition is priced at $50 per user per month, $75 off the bundled price, and includes the capability to run up to 10 AppExchange applications, 25 custom tabs and 200 custom objects.  CRM 1-yr chart:"

32092,20521,2007-04-12T04:29:56-04:00,,"I wrote a piece earlier called Is Bootstrapping Becoming Sexy Again? in which I made the point that, given where the Internet is today, bootstrapping companies has suddenly become very easy, and gobs of venture capital are no longer required to build the vast majority of businesses.
Now, many of the larger companies are actually trying to reap the benefits of this trend. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Yahoo (YHOO) have been very vocal about wanting to acquire bootstrapped companies BEFORE they take in large chunks of venture money. In this piece, I will explore how Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is playing the incubation game by empowering companies to bootstrap.
At the Salesforce.com luncheon in San Francisco on Tuesday, I happened to sit next to a couple of guys from a company called Vertical Response. VerticalResponse is an email marketing vendor that is one of the most successful participants of Salesforce.com’s AppExchange program, an on-demand application marketplace where vendors can market their apps to Salesforce.com customers. This little company was built to profitability with ~$2 Million of Angel money. Since they struck the partnership with Salesforce.com, they have recruited 1400 Salesforce customers as their own customers, which now amounts to 10% of their overall customer base. By all measures, a highly successful channel.
Another model that Salesforce.com is promoting is a complete OEM offering, whereby app vendors can use their data-center, their on-demand operations infrastructure, etc. and simply invest on the innovative application that they want to build. Apttus is a Contract Management startup that is leveraging this model. The founders are two domain experts in the segment, Kirk Krappe and Neehar Giri, formerly of Nextance, a Contract Management vendor. They already have 10 customers, and are sincerely hoping to not require venture money to scale the company.
Finally, Salesforce.com has built an incubator in San Mateo, which they have invited me to visit. I have to see what’s cookin’ there sometime.
The greatest opportunity that the Company has today is to learn from working with all these innovators, see which ones succeed, and then acquire them. If you fast forward a few years, they could accumulate a comprehensive, integrated portfolio of applications that would constitute a robust company, quite unlike the disjointed enterprise software nightmare inside Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)!"
27817,20099,2007-02-22T15:59:13-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) announced Q4 and year end results. The sub headlines promote extensive business successes such as large increases in net new customers and users. In the conference call (transcript available), Marc Bienoff, Chairman of the Board and CEO, continued to sell the sizzle. Reminding one and all that major third party forecasters are predicting that in the not too distant future, significant percentages of the market place will be using software as a service. Well maybe, but what about today and now? EPS under GAAP methodology was break even. All the success of new customers and users was squandered. For some reason they started a hiring binge in Q3 and ramped up costs. There is nothing to indicate that the costs will settle down. Guidance is only in the $0.07 to $0.09 per share range. This is a shadow of previous more profitable years. The company went so far as to promote a marketing event next week where a major customer is expanding from 6,000 to 25,000 users. This all smacks too much of hucksterism and not enough of financial fundamentals. Show me the money? Methinks the stock is being talked up. Currently trading near its 52-week high, will the stock break through into new territory? Look at the insider trading reports from Yahoo Finance. Insiders have been selling like crazy in recent weeks. The Chairman & CEO Marc Bienoff, The CFO Steve Cakebread and others have been exercising and selling on their options. If it was just once or twice we could understand a little bit. In this case the pigs were at the trough. Salesforce wants to discontinue reporting growth of users. They state this no longer truly represents business drivers. The report will be phased out quickly. In actual fact with insider trading at this frenetic level, they develop huge problems as they may be accused of trading on the basis of insider information. They would be better off just releasing monthly numbers as major retailers do and leave it at that. So if the stock can now drop and management loads up on new options, then we can drive the price up and make more money. Its all just too pink sheet for my tastes. CRM 1-yr chart:"
32023,20521,2007-04-11T09:43:23-04:00,,"Tuesday, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) announced the acquisition of an OnDemand Content Management SaaS company, Koral, which is a Web 2.0 spin on a mainstream enterprise software application: Content Management.
I listened to Marc Benioff’s presentation at the Four Seasons Tuesday afternoon. Marc and the CEO of Koral demonstrated some funky functionality, touting Unstructured Data Management as the core problem the acquisition will attempt to solve. As they rightly pointed out, 85% of enterprise content happens to be unstructured data, and in 2006, the content management segment clocked $3.6 Billion in revenues.
Against that backdrop, Koral is an extremely user-friendly ECM system, effectively using tagging, rating a la Digg (”wisdom of the crowds”), sharing a la YouTube, etc. as mechanisms to make unstructured content searchable, findable, usable. They have learned from how the consumer internet industry has rapidly scaled applications by using these techniques, and by focusing on extreme ease of use.
Last year, when I covered SAP’s (NYSE:SAP) Collaboration Strategy, I repeatedly heard Shai Agassi’s famous quote: “When Enterprise 3.0 meets Web 2.0, the game will get really exciting!” Well, Shai has since announced his departure from SAP, leaving that vision without a champion, and focusing his own attention elsewhere, in Cleantech.
Marc Benioff, however, seems to have preserved his freshness and enthusiasm for enterprise applications, disrupting the old order with his “Death of Software” mantra. I really liked what he said yesterday:
My assessment is that Marc is actually serious about the enormous opportunity that lies in the cusp of Web 2.0 and Enterprise 3.0. He is young enough, internet savvy enough, and still motivated enough, to lead the charge in this direction.
There is a massive battle ready to be fought between Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) over Online Collaboration. My sense is, Benioff is also eying that opportunity, and will acquire other pieces (like Web Conferencing, Project Management, On Demand Office, Contract Management, etc.) to pull together a compelling alternative to Microsoft’s Sharepoint-based ad-hoc collaboration offering, as well as Cisco’s newly acquired Webex-led solution.
Unfortunately for Cisco, in its Webex acquisition, Subrah Iyer, the Webex Founder/CEO, will not feature as a large contributor to the vision going forward. Subrah is very smart, and comprehends the opportunity, including the Extended Enterprise trend. However, having made the amount of money he has made, and having acquired the number of Bentleys he already has as his toys, I simply do not see him being interested in helping Cisco out. He is also not the greatest communicator, most certainly not at par with Benioff, the master evangelist.
On the Microsoft camp, I’m afraid, I just don’t see the visionary who will drive their collaboration strategy to the level of success that they could potentially achieve. They seem to be failing at everything these days!
Thus, I am very excited to see Benioff’s mind at work, and how he is plotting his course through the Enterprise 3.0 disruption."
28030,20468,2007-02-26T06:11:57-05:00,,"Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) big enterprise customer that will be announced Tuesday is apparently Merrill Lynch (MER).
BusinessWeek reports in its latest issue (subscription required) that Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff is looking to take on Bloomberg. For the non-Wall Street types Bloomberg provides a box much like a PC that pumps financial information and real-time tools into bond and stock trading houses. On Wall Street Bloomberg terminals are everywhere. (And they are a bit addictive if you are a financial nerd.)
Benioff's play, which was teased during Salesforce.com's earnings call, is to try to undercut Bloomberg, which charges $1,500 a month.
BusinessWeek reports:
Merrill Lynch will be the first customer and has signed up 25,000 Salesforce.com subscriptions for its financial advisers. This move makes total sense since ""financial adviser"" is a nice way to say ""broker."" These brokers can use the customer relationship management tools Salesforce can toss into its wealth-management system to track commissions and calls. The Merrill Lynch announcement will happen on Feb. 27 and the invite from Salesforce.com does note some financial partners in attendance—notably Thomson Financial and Dow Jones.
Salesforce.com is reportedly trying to use financial advisers as a beachhead that will eventually take the product vertical by targeting insurance, real estate and other markets.
Will it work? A few years ago I'd say Salesforce.com had a shot to upend Bloomberg. On the surface, it only makes sense that some Web tool could put a dent into a business that relies on putting a fancy terminal on your desk. However, Bloomberg terminals stay put and Wall Streeters love them. Bloomberg has fended off encroachment from Reuters, Dow Jones and Thomson Financial to name a few and made Michael Bloomberg billions of dollars. Salesforce.com's best hope is to share the desk with Bloomberg.
Case in point: BusinessWeek reports Merrill Lynch is keeping its Bloomberg terminals too."
31480,20358,2007-04-04T04:58:03-04:00,,"Mitt Romney’s Republican presidential campaign has raised about $20 million so far in 2007 with the help of  “com-Mitt” software for interacting (fundraising) with donors. The activity is otherwise known as CRM, customer relationship management, and salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) on demand platform is the foundation of com-Mitt.
Not one to miss a new, and timely, market opportunity, salesforce.com is using the customization concepts developed in com-Mitt to create a new application, CampaignForce, for other individuals and parties on the campaign trail. 
""We first got in touch with the Romney team six or eight months ago,"" said Dan Burton, senior vice president of global public policy at salesforce.com. ""As the fund raising level for Romney illustrates, it's a sophisticated piece of technology.""
It's not much of a stretch to see how customizable, on demand CRM software can help in fundraising and volunteer efforts, and would be an improvement over Excel or more heavyweight applications. CampaignForce is expected to be available in the next two months for use by other candidates, the company said.
Salesforce.com is also looking to gain more government customers for its CRM-based applications and Apex development platform. ""We have been successful in commercial market,"" Burton said. ""The next big wave is government and [political] campaign management is a piece of that."" Many government agencies would be hesitant to store their data in salesforce.com's datacenters, and that objection isn't going away any time soon."
27857,20521,2007-02-23T03:48:24-05:00,,"I wrote a piece on Tuesday remarking how Webex (WEBX) has done an excellent job capitalizing on the Extended Enterprise opportunity.  In this discussion, I want to explore how Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) takes advantage of the Extended Enterprise trend.
Salesforce.com has, of course, been THE poster child of Software-As-A-Service (SaaS), OnDemand, and other buzzwords that have come to characterize the next generation Enterprise software business. It’s an unbelievabe growth story, with the stock trading near its all time high, recently named on the Forbes top disrupters via Internet technologies, and one of the fastest growing technology companies around.
All this, when set in the context of the fact that almost every VC turned Marc Benioff down, and it was Larry Ellison who actually funded this company, makes you wonder about the incredible visionaries the venture business is full of. But that’s a separate discussion!
So, let’s explore why the Extended Enterprise phenomenon has been so very important for the growth of Salesforce.com.
If you look at the CRM workflow (sales force, distributors, resellers, customer support, technical support, telemarketers, telesales reps), much of the participants in this portion of the business ecosystem operates from outside the firewall. The sales force is traveling with laptops. Distributors and resellers are most certainly not within the enterprise IT system. The telebusiness functions are often outsourced, but in that early part of funnel building, leads and account data need to be shared with the in-house sales force in a time-critical manner.
With Salesforce.com it is easy to do exactly that. And thus, I believe, the company aligns well with the Extended Enterprise trend, which the bulkier enterprise systems would have more difficulty adopting to.
Now add in the post sales support functions, which are almost inevitably being outsourced to a low cost destination like India. Often the up-sell, cross-sell opportunities need good understanding of the support call logs. Now we’re talking about a very complex workflow integration, which definitely has to straddle the Extended Enterprise.
In fact, I am not even saying Salesforce.com can do this quite yet. However, they are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. And I think they will.
And I will also submit that if the gigantic egos of their CEOs would not be on the way, Salesforce.com and Webex would make a terrific merger, and can give SAP (NYSE:SAP)-Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) a run for their money. Then, add in Netsuite, which is preparing its IPO - you have a completely separate alternative to the big boys!"
30778,20307,2007-03-27T05:55:58-04:00,,"One thing I’ve always found about Wall Street research is that if you simply look at ratings and price targets and earnings models, sometimes you miss something more interesting. Consider, for instance, a brief note yesterday from Cowen’s Peter Goldmacher on Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Cowen reiterated his Outperform rating, and did not change any earnings estimates; on the surface it looked like a pretty standard note following meetings with management. The long-term story, he wrote, is unchanged, with the story continuing “to drive impressive revenue growth as the flag bearer for On Demand.” But he had some unsettling observations about the short-term outlook, and that may have contributed to some weakness in the stock yesterday: Goldmacher doesn’t stop there, either. He says that he “would not be surprised to see valuation become an issue absent significant profitability improvements.” He says the “high level story is as strong as ever,” but that investors are “becoming increasingly frustrated with the company’s inability to translate growth into earnings.” And Goldmacher says that he “fear[s] this frustration will increase in coming months as impressive wins for large sub counts in high profile accounts don’t translate into material revenue upside due to typical enterprise discounts, exacerbated by seasonally weak [free cash flow].” Wow, those would be some pretty strong negative sentiments for an analyst who gives the stock his firm’s highest rating. Salesforce yesterday fell 28 cents to $43.02; the stock was off another 17 cents after hours."
27769,20468,2007-02-22T07:49:24-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) ended its fiscal year with 646,000 paying subscribers and a large enterprise that accounts for 25,000 subscriptions.
The company didn't name ""the largest on-demand CRM customer ever"" in its earnings statement.  CEO Marc Benioff said the customer will be revealed Tuesday at an analyst day in New York.  One favorite is Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). Benioff identified Cisco Systems as its largest customer in the company's earnings call last quarter. In any case, the enterprise rollout provides an interesting proof of concept for software as a service in a large corporate environment.
According to Salesforce's previous earnings statements Cisco is ramping up with SaaS. On November 15, Salesforce said its largest customer–later identified as Cisco–doubled its deployment to 15,000 subscribers. Cisco is using the company's sales force automation application. Salesforce also started a partner relationship management program with Cisco. With more than 50,000 employees Cisco has the headcount to add Salesforce.com subscriptions.

22347,20349,2006-12-13T06:39:52-05:00,,"Salesforce.com will take a cut of the first year's revenue earned by ISVs who closed deals via AppStore. At the same time, it will collect money from partners that want to take part in the AppStore Referral Program. Partners who kick in fees will get premium placement in application search results and head various application categories, in a system similar to the paid listings that search engines place at the top of natural search results.
Standard Referral partners will pay a 10 percent referral fee on the first year's revenue from all closed transactions. Premium Referral partners will kick in 25 percent of the first year's earnings, in return for additional benefits including handholding and mentoring by Salesforce.com. The standard program is scheduled to go live in the first calendar quarter of 2007; the premium program is scheduled for the third quarter.
Since it launched the AppExchange, Salesforce.com has taken no fees or percentages from participants in the marketplace; executives said the company benefited by selling more basic subscriptions as the software ecosystem offered more benefit to customers.
At a lunch for press and analysts today, CEO Marc Benioff said that partners and the company's internal sales division had pushed for the premium referral program.
The company already offers support and co-marketing to partners:
Ariel Kelman, director of Apex platform product marketing, said partners wanted to work on a shared risk basis with the company:
The company also announced AppStore Checkout, a package of commercial services that will let customers immediately purchase AppExchange products, with Salesforce.com facilitating the transaction and taking a cut. Checkout is expected to go live in the fourth quarter of 2007.
In addition to providing incremental revenue to Salesforce.com in the form of transaction fees, Checkout will act as an upsell mechanism. When a customer logs in to the AppExchange and selects a product, the system will check to see whether that customer has enough seats of the basic application to cover the app, as well as suggest upgrades.
Also this morning, the company raised its guidance by $10 million for its full fiscal year 2008, expecting revenue to be in the range of $710 million to $720 million.
Benioff said he expects the referral programs to generate more revenue than Checkout:

23187,20349,2006-12-28T15:46:34-05:00,,"The conventional wisdom about Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is that in order to grow, it needs to continue to acquire bigger customers. The on-demand CRM provider isn’t doing badly at landing larger engagements — as well as small engagements at bigger enterprises, which could lead to continued penetration and more seats.
But it has another growth area: online marketing. While the company continues its core focus in customer relationship management, it’s quietly moving to add more and more marketing and advertising campaign management functionality to the core product.
Last October, the company brought campaign management for Google AdWords into the basic product. Now, it’s working on doing the same for Yahoo Search Marketing, as Yahoo gets its new Panama platform up to speed.
Says Kraig Swensrud, who oversees marketing programs for Salesforce.com, “The dream scenario for customers is that marketers can generate demand and nurture prospects, customer service can support them, and sales can process and track transactions, all within Salesforce.”
Salesfore.com will focus on email and search marketing, plus tracking interactions with the company website. Customers can use the application to execute, track and measure the response for email, search and direct mail campaigns. It will stay away, for now, from the more trendy media, such as blogging or video. Swensrud says most Salesforce.com customers aren’t yet doing all they can to create and nurture leads via these three established media.
The Interactive Advertising Bureau says spending on internet advertising in 2006 rose by 30 percent to $12.6 billion, and the industry is hoping for even greater growth in 2007.
Salesforce.com has close to 30,000 customers for its SaaS offerings, while an estimated 500,000 to 750,000 businesses use Google AdWords. An estimated 300,000 to 400,000 companies use Yahoo Search Marketing (although there’s likely plenty of overlap between Google and Yahoo search marketers).
Says Swensrud, “With advertising budgets shifting onto the web, it’s a great time for us as a company to be doing what we did for salespeople over the last decade: giving marketing automation tools to marketing people.”
Salesforce for Google AdWords is based on technology developed by Keiden, formerly a Saleforce.com ISV. The CRM provider thought Keiden’s technology, which lets companies buy Google AdWords from within Salesforce, and then to track exactly which ads and keywords turn into leads, deals and revenue downstream, was important enough to acquire.
The Keiden team, which came along with the acquisition, will develop the Yahoo Search Marketing integration, either independently or in collaboration with Yahoo’s engineers.
Salesforce for Google AdWords complements and extends Google’s own analytics product. Swensrud says that 90 percent of Salesforce customers use it in conjunction with Google Analytics. Google considers it a conversion when a searcher clicks on an ad and goes to the advertiser’s website. Salsforce.com lets the company follow the searcher’s interaction with the website, and also keep track of the lead to determine whether the person returns to the site a future time to make a purchase.
Swensrud says that Salesforce.com prioritizes its projects based on customer demand. In marketing, that demand so far has been overwhelmingly for Google integration. He expects demand for Yahoo integration to pick up in 2007, as Panama rolls out. So far, there hasn’t been a flicker rest in Microsoft AdCenter, he said. “It’s massively dwarfed by Google and other marketing initiatives.”"
24679,20358,2007-01-22T03:30:04-05:00,,"In 2000, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) started selling a basic CRM solution delivered via the Internet. The company was swimming against the tide. Businesses, especially large enterprises, weren't disposed to giving up control of their applications and infrastructure to a startup with outspoken and sometimes bombastic CEO Marc Benioff, who proclaimed the ""end of software."" When the company launched in Februrary 2000, Benioff said, ""Our objective is to put Siebel Systems out of business."" More recently, Benioff boasted, ""We will destroy Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) because they won't be able to respond to the innovation we are about to unleash."" Trash talking aside, in the eight years since salesforce.com was founded, the idea of software-as-a-service–or the ""Business Web"" concept as pioneered by Benioff's growing team and prodigious marketing efforts–has taken root. Benioff hasn't much tempered his verbal baiting of competitors, but with more than $500,000,000 in annual revenue, 27,100 customers and 500 applications in AppExchange (a directory of products that integrate with the salesforce platform–now called Apex), he no longer has to shout to be heard.  Benioff's latest weapon to compete with SAP, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle is Apex Code, a Java-like programming language that will allow developers to write directly to salesforce.com's servers. With the language, developers can create the kinds of hefty ERP and transactional applications that are the bread and butter of the big enterprise software providers, he said. As an on demand service, salesforce.com eliminates the need for developers to muck with supporting or acquiring the complex infrastructure to serve up applications. Just as with Microsoft, SAP or Oracle, developers are locked into the platform, but cost and complexity are greatly reduced. Apex Code is just going into testing with customers, and will go into beta later this year. Fundamentally, salesforce.com has morphed from a customizable, on demand CRM application to a full-blown development platform supplier. ""We want a killer app to emerge from a third-party,"" Benioff said. ""We don't want to do it all ourselves…we can't. It's better to aggregate the whole industry and go at development as a team effort, especially for an distributed environment like AppExchange."" The economics are also attractive, according to Benioff.  He also touted the AppExchange and AppStore, which will provide merchandising, maintenance and software distribution services, as advantages for developers and customers. I asked Benioff about his expectations for getting applications into the AppExchange that can compete with SAP's ERP suite, for example. He wasn't prepared to make a prediction and trotted out his stump speech: However, Benioff also expects that companies who currently build applications on their own server platforms will write natively to the Apex platform. I asked him whether a company like SuccessFactors, which has an HR on demand application with more than 2 million subscribers, should write to the Apex platform, rather than just integrate with the salesforce CRM application through Web services. "" A spokesperson for Successfactors said the the company has no current plans to develop an Apex native version of its software. I also asked Benioff about competing with the very developers who he wants to build killer apps on his platform. ""We have certain apps that we make, such as salesforce automation and customer service and support. With our new platform, we don’t have to be the only SFA provider. With our OEM Edition, developers can compete against us. On Windows, Microsoft makes a spreadsheet and other companies have spreadsheets. We want to have same open environment and to create competition. Excel is not the best example of enabling healthy competition, given Microsoft's spreadsheet has somewhere in the neighborhood of 95 to 99 percent market share. Last year, salesforce.com acquired AppExchange products, such as Kieden, which manages Google-driven ad campaigns. Over time, what is in salesforce.com's self interest and that of developers will come into conflict. At the end of the day, salesforce.com is competing for developer attention. The Oracle Technical Network has 5.2 million registrants. SAP has more than 100,000 members of its Developer Network. Microsoft's Developer Network is massive. Salesforce.com claims 25,000 developers, which would be about one per customer. ""We feel it is our biggest issue in the company,"" Benioff told me. In typical fashion, he thinks big: ""We have to get to 5 million as fast as possible."""

He announced that Dell (NYSE:DELL) bought into the on demand service, adding 15,000 subscribers to the more than 550,000 base of subscribers and the Winter '07 code base has been fully deployed across salesforce.com's data centers. But the highlight of the day was the preview release of Apex, which the company hopes will transform the company from an on demand CRM provider to an full blown application development platform.  It will allow developers to create any kind of database, user interface and business logic. However, those tools are only available in a preview edition for developers, pre-beta. With the preview edition of the Java-like Apex programming language, now called Apex Code, developers can get up to speed on the environment and provide feedback to salesforce.com on Apex's design and capabilities. Beta of Apex Code, which will be part of the salesforce.com platform exposed to customers (which has been renamed the Apex On Demand as of the Winter '07 release), is slated for later this year. Salesforce.com is also rolling out Apex developer toolkits for AJAX and Eclipse and a new Wiki-based developer site, the Apex Developer Network."

Its growth rate far surpasses that of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) or SAP (NYSE:SAP) for that matter. Its 52 week price performance is up 43% as opposed to 13% for the S&P 500. As its customer base is currently located in the United States it has the international market to look forward to. So you may ask, if I am such a big fan what is with the call for going short? Great question… Let’s start with the companies gross margins which have trended lower from 79% in October 05’ to 76.9% in the October 06’ quarter. What I find most disturbing however is that the Net Margins for the same timer frame have dropped off a cliff from 6.4% to 1.3%. Yikes…. I am of the firm belief that a speculative bubble has been built around this stock. The speculative story is one of a take over. All one needs to do is review the company’s 8K which was filed with the SEC on January 16th. CEO Mark Benoff and his management team set up handsome golden parachutes. All systems go for the traders to squeeze the shorts. Whey you buy a stock with 40% earnings growth you expect to pay a premium. With a current PE of 954 and a forward looking PE of 115, I think you would agree that there is plenty of room for a correction in this stock. Currently the stock sports an RSI rating of 79% which is at extreme nose bleed overbought levels and provides me with a fair risk to reward opportunity to hold a short position heading into earnings. With current expectations so high and in light of it’s hefty PE, anything shy of a meets could sent Salesforce.com down to the low 40’s in the blink of an eye.

Apex, as it's also known, offers products from other software providers which can be incorporated into Salesforce.com's core sales and marketing management service. Currently, CRM only charges the company for a place on the exchange. Starting in February, the company will offer premium placement on searches and AppExchange categories for companies willing to part with a piece of their revenue. In December 2007, CRM will launch AppStore Checkout, a complete online billing, invoicing and collection service for AppExchange partners. CEO March Benihoff is hoping to get Salesforce.com's annual revenue up to $1 billion. In FY 2005, the company reported $309.9 million.

15884,20220,2006-08-23T20:52:11-04:00,,"A few weeks ago I participated in a detailed conversation with some fellow Irregulars centered around Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) AppExchange. It was a detailed and varied conversation featuring many different perspectives. At the time, I wondered whether AppExchange was as much a chance for salesforce.com to outsource R&D and cherry pick tuck-in technologies (and people) as it was about driving near-term revenues and creating a platform. Today, salesforce.com validated my assertion by acquiring Kieden. Kieden is a very cool little company that I had the chance to see firsthand at the SfDC AppExchange Seminar in New York (for a detailed review of that meeting, check out Mark's writeup). Kieden was one of several AppExchange partners highlighted in a presentation that revolved around the power of enterprise mashups and how easy it was to build compelling new services by simply tying together SfDC's API with other available metadata (like Google Maps and Google AdWords). SfDC is re-branding the Kieden solution as Salesforce for Google Adwords (see online demo). The Kieden solution allows salesforce users to create and manage their AdWords campaigns directly from SfDC. You can then automatically track leads (i.e., click-throughs) all the way through deal closure. Imagine the power of a sales rep knowing that the customer he just signed was a direct result of a specific keyword placed on the Google network? Or imagine the power of a marketing executive seeing in real-time which keywords are leading to closed deals versus which ones are generating click-throughs from unqualified leads (which could in turn be turned off and spending could be redirected to the high throughput campaigns). Interestingly, SfDC is planning on charging for this service on an organizational basis...the tear sheet suggests $300 per organization per month. If SfDC can make this pricing stick, it will help ASPs and set a precedent for further monetization of the AppExchange. This is the second time in the last few months SfDC has brought an AppExchange solution in-house (Sendia is now salesforce Mobile Edition). For a company I've taken to task in the past for their de minimous R&D spending, I have to tip my cap to this model as it truly does enhance the SfDC development ecosystem in an efficient manner. SfDC has been on a roll of late, reporting a blockbuster quarter (see conference call transcript) that blew past analysts expectations and put to rest some of the concerns that emerged in the prior quarter.

20715,20307,2006-11-16T04:15:27-05:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) late yesterday reported results for the fiscal third quarter ended October 31 which were about in line with Street expectations - but apparently slightly disappointing to some.
Salesforce reported revenue for the quarter of $130 million, and pro forma EPS of 6 cents a share; the consensus view was for $129 million and 5 cents. The company sees fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $140 million to $142 million and pro forma profits of 20-23 cents a share; the Street had expected $142 million and 7 cents. For all of fiscal 2008, the company sees revenue of $700 million to $710 million; the Street has been looking for $699 million.
CEO Marc Benioff seemed to like the quarter; in the release, he described it as “spectacular.”
But the stock nonetheless sold off after hours, backing off 91 cents to $41.48, after losing $1.11 in the regular session. Nonetheless, the shares have roughly doubled in price since mid July.

10789,20180,2006-05-12T22:46:16-04:00,,"I think people are in a state of panic and everyone is in sell mode. Time to buy. Trade  1. Company: Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM)  2. Trade: 1,000 shares long  3. Price: $31.70  4. Target Price: ~$42  5. Stop Loss: $29.9  6. Date: May 12, 2006 Investment Thesis I love the Salesforce product and business model. The company offers a hosted CRM, or Customer Relationship Management, software application. That means that you log in through a normal web browser like Internet Explorer or FireFox, and access your company’s sales data. The beauty of CRM is that ALL businesses have a sales team, and the market is huge. Companies in this space include PeopleSoft (now part of Oracle) and SAP, two of the largest software companies in the world. What SalesForce.com does that is so special is offer a multi-tenant, simple and lightweight instance of it’s software. That means they don’t need to constantly service older versions of the software, since every single customer is logging in and using the same piece of software. Think about a company like Microsoft. They have people using Windows 95, 98, XP Home Edition, XP Professional, and Media Center. They need an army of people to support their customers; luckily, they’re a consumer company so they simply don’t service the majority of their customers. CRM is different - it’s a mission critical application that requires immediate support for users that are having issues. Having one version of the product cuts their service costs tremendously. Moreever, they spend less money on R&D since all their engineers are working on developing one version of the product, instead of splitting their engineering resources dealing with upgrade or migration paths for older versions of the software. Risks Salesforce is trading a very rich valuation. It is trading at a market capitalization of $3.5 billion dollars, with TTM revenues (trailing twelve months) of $310 million. That’s a 11x Enterprise Value to Revenue multiple, with an even more ridiculous 130x Enterprise Value to EBITDA multiple. There is also rumors that the company has reorganized its sales team in Q1, which could have resulted in some lost sales. However, I believe that the company has already guided Wall Street’s expectation’s down for Q1 and should beat expectations. This is widely considered to be one of the more innovative software companies to have emerged from Silicon Valley in the last 10 years, and it deserves a rich premium. Their revenue figures cannot be compared apples-to-apples with other software companies because CRM is a recurring revenue business as opposed to an upfront license business. Most importantly, Salesforce has invested significant dollars into their new AppExchange product, which allows partners to integrate the SalesForce product into numerous other applications, driving both adoption as well as stickiness of the product."

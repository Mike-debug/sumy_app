The stock was deeply undervalued pre-COVID, but post-COVID, valuations have moved to near-ludicrous levels, in my view. For CRTO to work, I do not think investors need to adopt a view on a potential turnaround - the company is well-capitalized and cash-generative, yet the equity value lingers far below its tangible assets and replacement value.At current valuations, the market appears to be either expressing an extremely bearish view on the company as a going concern or assigning zero credit to Criteo's balance sheet value (likely the latter). At ~1.6x FY20 EBITDA, the market seems content to ignore CRTO's depressed multiples, but with cash flow generation set to continue (even in a bear case scenario) and accumulate on an increasingly net-cash balance sheet, I think patient investors stand to be well-rewarded.The headline numbers for the quarter did not make for pretty viewing - revenue ex-TAC was down 13% YoY (-11% YoY on a constant currency basis) to $206mn, while adjusted EBITDA came above consensus in at $59m (-14.5% YoY). Free cash flow remained strong at $45m for the quarter. Criteo ended the quarter with 20,360 total clients (+5% YoY).Source: Investor PresentationGiven Criteo's exposure to the travel segment (~10% of revenue) and the Asia Pacific region, Criteo has felt the impact of COVID-19 earlier than peers such as Snapchat (SNAP). The latter noted strong January and February trends with end-March cited as a key period of weakness, while Criteo noted weakness as soon as the last guidance update in February.For 1Q20, the COVID-19 impact on revenue ex-TAC for APAC, EMEA, and the Americas stood at $2m, $5m, and $3m, respectively. Same client revenue declined by 9% YoY (-4% YoY ex-COIVD), with client spend in travel and classifieds severely hit, posting a 95% and 40% YoY decline, respectively.Source: Investor PresentationOn a more positive note, though, Criteo was able to reduce non-GAAP operating expenses by $20m relative to the prior year, on lower R&D expenses (-19.5% YoY) from the closing of its Palo Alto R&D center, as well as modest cuts across other opex areas (e.g., G&A fell 23.3% YoY). For 2Q20 and FY20, the non-GAAP OpEx is guided to fall by a further $27m and $77m relative to the prior year, respectively, with most of the savings being employee-related. The company will also reduce capex by >10%, leading to an FY20 capex target of ~3% of gross revenue.Source; Company FilingsDespite the opex cuts, the company is still moving forward with its unified retail media platform in 2Q20 in response to the demand for retail media in the current environment. In addition, the company's recent partnership with Nielsen is positive, as it should help facilitate deeper integration with its Digital Ad Ratings and Digital Brand Effect measurement solutions.Source: Investor PresentationOverall, the results were slightly ahead of the company's initial reaction to COVID-19, though management's internal assumptions for the remainder of the year appears to be also have flattened out. Revenue ex-TAC for 2Q20 is guided to decline by 32% to 35% YoY (implying a $60-65m impact), with a gradual recovery expected in 2H20 (high-teens YoY decline in 4Q vs. high-20s YoY decline in 3Q). Official FY20 guidance has been withdrawn for now. Thus far, in 2Q20, revenue ex-TAC has declined by ~25% YoY, largely due to COVID-19's impact on ad spend.Source: Investor PresentationThe key to the CRTO thesis lies in its balance sheet - the company ended 1Q20 with ~$434m in net cash, with an untapped ~€350M (~$380m) revolving credit facility. With a liquidity position of ~$820m, Criteo can theoretically sustain ~six quarters worth of operating expenses (based on the FY20 Non-GAAP expense base) and is thus, more than adequately equipped to weather a COVID-19-driven downturn. A testament to the strength of its balance sheet is the fact that the Board has authorized a new buyback of ~$30m to offset employee grants and vesting.My base case calls for a continued rise in the net cash balance - expect Criteo to end FY20 with ~$450-460m in net cash (~$7.50/share). Note that Criteo should still generate cash through FY20, with a gradual recovery scenario from FY21, further adding to the net cash balance. By my estimates, this would imply Criteo's net cash moving above the current market cap by FY22.Source: Company Filings, Author's EstLike the Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) thesis, the Criteo case also leans heavily on the balance sheet, in my view. In this case, the value is a lot more apparent, in my view, with the core business firmly on track for cash generation in the near-to-medium term.I see two key ways to measure the extent of the undervaluation - 1) an approximation of the business' replacement value and 2) the value of the tangible assets on the balance sheet. To estimate Criteo's replacement value, I add the ~$450m net cash position (post-buyback) to ~$450m in FY20 accumulated depreciation as a proxy for maintenance capex over the last five years, driving a replacement cost valuation of ~$900m (implying a ~35% premium to the Criteo market cap). Tangible book per share, on the other hand, comes up to ~$14 (FY20 book value of ~$1bn less ~$80m of intangible assets), implying a ~39% premium to the market cap (at the time of writing).Even in a bear-case scenario, where Criteo loses ~50% of its legacy retargeting revenues (~$260m) and assuming an in-line ~30% non-GAAP EBITDA margin (relative to revenue ex-TAC), this would imply ~$78m of EBITDA ""at risk."" This would require taking out a large chunk of the cost base to offset the loss and a likely post-tax restructuring cash charge to boot. But even after applying a haircut to the Criteo net cash position to account for this, the balance sheet still offers considerable value, in my view.Thus, at an FY20 EV/EBITDA of 1.6x (FY19 EV/EBITDA of ~0.8x), CRTO offers exceptional value, with the market unfairly assigning zero credit to Criteo's balance sheet value, in my view. Key catalysts include a potential take-private scenario, an expansion of the buyback program, while key risks include an adverse regulatory fine."

Despite negative developments, over two-thirds of internet users use Google Chrome, where Google ([[GOOG]], GOOGL) has taken a much more balanced approach than Apple (AAPL) and Mozilla by allowing the use of third party cookies for retargeting, provided users give consent. This is similar to E.U.'s GDPR and will have minimal impact on Criteo's core revenues as over 90% of internet users do not care about the implications of consenting to cookies. Meanwhile, Criteo's core value propositions has consistently delivered high CTR and ROAS for advertisers as to warrant it a necessity on Facebook/Instagram, where 25% of all ad campaigns consist of retargeting. While installing ad-blocking extensions have become a trend dominating over 40% of global internet users, the company's revenues have not witnessed a likewise pro rate decline. Overall, Criteo has seen remarkable resiliency in holding onto its core revenues. Looking back at last year's thesis, the author did state the stock was justified in its valuation of $26 with just 5% or more in sales growth, and hence Criteo's buy rating will be reiterated today. Source: OneLoginThe General Data Protection Regulation legislation for E.U. citizens became enforceable in May 2018 and requires the user's explicit consent for advertisers to use their browsing cookies for data analytics. Users who wishes for more information can be then taken to a compliance section of the publisher's website, where their rights with regards to privacy are explicitly stated along with the option to refuse consent to allow cookies. While seemingly burdensome on advertisers, the legislation specifically allows the practice of ad-retargeting for both advertisers and middlemen ad-tech companies like Criteo. Moreover, operational data have revealed over 3/4 of internet users agreed to giving consent with the a click of a button; 1/10 of users visited compliance pages for more information, and just 1/100 users opted out of cookies altogether. With its core business founded on analyzing cookies for ad-remarketing, Criteo is extremely unlikely to see its bottom line impacted by 1% of internet users refusing to allow cookie-tracking when surfing the web. Source: AdPushupWhile GDPR is likely to see negligible impact on Criteo, investors should beware an estimated $460 million, or, 20%-22% of Criteo's FY2017 revenues are either en route or have already gone to zero due to Apple's ITP 2.0+ rolled out last September. Apple has prohibited the practice of ad-retargeting on its Safari browsers and is unlikely this decision will be reversed due to Tim Cook guiding specifically that he wants Apple to focus on consumer products and not advertising. Nonetheless, it is important to note Criteo was growing at well over 22% CAGR before ITP 2.0, and since this impairment, the company's revenues have not been materially lower on a TTM basis. This irregularity should warrant further research below. Source: Help Net Security The percentage of online users with Firefox as their default browser are estimated at around 10% globally. With this new feature rolled out across all browsers in 2019, advertisers would no longer be permitted to user Firefox users' data for retargeting purposes. Keep in mind however, Mozilla is a nonprofit organization which does not rely on advertising revenues unlike Facebook (FB) and Google. Hence, whether or not retargeters are permitted to operate on its browser is of little financial interest to the organization. As we will see below, such policy implementation would be nearly impossible for tech giants which rely on ad revenues as their core business model. Source: Google Support Google Chrome accounts for two-thirds of all web browser usage on a global scale and Google has explicitly stated ad-retargeting is permitted on Chrome after Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox banned the practice on their browsers. Since an overwhelming majority of the company's revenues comes from advertising (~80%), Google has no choice but to develop its services in a way which allows retargeting in the foreseeable future. With impairments from Safari and Firefox's browser restrictions gone, at least 90% or more of Criteo's revenues would be secure from further regulatory risks. Source: AdExpressoAccording to one estimate, Instagram's acquisition price of $1 billion has perhaps grown to $100 billion in recent years. Part of this growth can be definitively linked to the abundance of both Shopify users and Instagram influencers running massive ad-campaigns on its platforms to fuel e-commerce. Over 25% of all such campaigns on Facebook and Instagram are retargeting ones, and they play a crucial role in improving CPC; CTR, ROAS, and RPC metrics for advertisers. Shoppers would seemingly become ""flaky"", indecisive, and or straight up forget items added to their shopping carts after an initial hype. Retargeting will then provide a crucial element to make customers ""return"" to their purchase after an item becomes abandoned. With over 80% of Facebook's sales coming from ad revenues, it is highly unlikely the practice of retargeting will be prohibited on its platform, and serves as a reassurance Criteo's revenues will not see anymore erosion from this segment. Source: Criteo.comCriteo's clients have experienced 7-8 figures in ad impressions, with over 3 to 4 figures in ROAS, and double digit percentage improvements in CTRs. These metrics are simply amazing considering the top standard for the industry lies with ads creating up to 100k-250k in impressions and 4x in ROAS. Simply put, the company's algorithm is amazing at creating the technology required to ensure visitors are converted back into paid customers after website visits. It should be no surprise the company is operating at over 90% client retention rates as of FY2019. While any entrepreneur/publisher/advertiser with a bit of capital can budget themselves to run ad campaigns on Facebook or Google, the process of reducing churn rates/abandoned checkouts by showing ads to users who visit a website only to leave before purchasing any of its services is an extremely difficult endeavor. Numerous variables relating to consumer behavior such as session time; number of impressions, country of origin, etc. are required to build an effective retargeting algorithm. Hence, Criteo certainly possess an unique technical edge which isn't going away anytime soon. Source: globalwebindexNonetheless, it should be noted 47% of the world's internet users now use ad-blocking software at least once per month. With industry CTRs of 0.5-2% on average, ads simply aren't relevant to over 98% of us out there. However, despite a 30% CAGR in the past few years of ad-block users, Criteo's revenues have not declined proportionally and instead have ballooned to over $2.3 billion for TTM 2019. Source: globalwebindexDespite these negative feedbacks, ad-tech is constantly improving. For example, Facebook now possess the technology to target an audience based on country of origin; age group, interests, gender, behavior on social media, and more. While the number of ad-blockers are no doubt increasing, the relevancy of ads are increasing as well. This results in a more efficient advertising environment as more and more users see ads that are relevant to them for greater conversion rates, and no doubt improves the advertiser' bottom line. Source: Author.Revisiting the valuation guided in the author's report last year, Criteo has been able to stay in range of the estimated growth rate for FY2019 as to keep the author's thesis intact. Moreover, the company is likely to sharply return to growth (upwards of 10%) after all the turmoil surrounding GDPR, Safari's ITP, and Mozilla's Quantum Tracking subsides. For Criteo's biggest revenue partners Facebook and Chrome, their sales are simply too dependent on advertising revenue (over 80% in FY2018) as for them to carry out an outright ban on retargeting. As long as Criteo's core partners have skin in the advertising game, the company continues to uphold its value proposition by improving ROAS metrics via its retargeting algorithms. The author hereby affirms his buy rating on this stock, issued one year earlier."
4295595,104697,2019-10-08T12:18:42-04:00,The recent decrease in Criteo's share price has created an attractive risk/reward scenario for the stock.The company benefits from sound financing and a large holding of cash which it can leverage to enhance shareholder value.Recent fears in changes to the Chrome browser may be largely overblown.,"With its share price decreasing more than 36% in the past 6 months, Criteo (CRTO) is now an attractively priced company benefiting from a competitive moat and sound financing. For investors looking for a major player in the adtech industry, the stock of the digital advertising software provider has become an attractively priced opportunity.Criteo as a technology company provides an advertising platform for the open Internet. The company's offerings essentially collect clients' proprietary commerce data such as transaction and browsing activity in order to identify high-intent customers as they browse the Internet. Once these high intent customers are identified, Criteo's software will feed them highly personalized ads to entice a purchase. Criteo’s software is employed by a variety of retailers, travel agencies and publishers. Every time a potential customer visits one of these websites, Criteo will gather a small amount of information with regard to a variety of customer features such as interests on the website, device IDs, previous visits to website, etc. The company then combines all these data points in order to derive a graph exhibiting the customer's online persona. The company itself was founded in 2005 and is headquartered in Paris, France.In spite of a recent slowdown in revenue growth, Criteo has in recent years showed impressive discipline with regard to its approach to managing its finances. The company has successfully reached a position where it has established a significant cash pile in addition to a very low debt holding. With $422M of cash as of June 30th, 2019, Criteo has the flexibility to pursue a variety of shareholder value enhancing measures going forwards.(Source: Company Presentation)As of Q2 FY19, the board authorized a new $80M share buyback program following on from the previous program it authorized in Q4 of FY18. In addition to its share buyback program, Criteo’s significant cash pile allows it to pursue other value adding opportunities such as M&A and capital expenditure. With regard to investment directed at organic growth under the form of Capex, Criteo has set out to maintain a rigorous overall investment agenda with the majority of investment focusing on hosting capabilities, facilities and internal IT. In terms of potential M&A activity going forwards, Criteo will essentially look to continue in its disciplined approach to acquisitions by looking mainly at companies featuring a range of adjacent technologies, products or human capital that the company has identified as attractive.(Source: Company Presentation)Data by YChartsCompany insiders have also looked to benefit from the company's financial position. This is highlighted by a strong increase in insider ownership of Criteo shares.Data by YChartsCentral to Criteo’s business is the large amounts of customer data it has accumulated from its clients. The granularity of this data is a key feature with regard to how Criteo can effectively leverage its growing data set and monetize it. Through the large volumes of customer browsing data Criteo has acquired through its clients, it can look to express and quantify consumer shopping intent and engagement all while using the transactional data, at the individual product and individual user level, to create a unique customer profile. This data pooling process is characterized by the Criteo Shopper Graph product on the advertising platform. The Shopper Graph is currently composed from three data collectives: The Identity Graph, the Interest Map and the Measurement Network.The Identity Graph allows Criteo to essentially identify users across a variety of devices they may be using to purchase products both online and offline. Criteo can do this by recognizing a browser-specific cookie or a specific device ID (computer, tablet, mobile phone). As of December 2018, the company estimating having over 4 billion user IDs with an estimated average of three user IDs per customer.The Interest Map feature collects and organizes consumer intent and purchasing data across the products available in Criteo's wide network of commerce clients. This allows the company to build a comprehensive and accurate shopper profile for all consumers who have previously been a source of data through their previous browsing activity.The Measurement Network provides Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) level sales attribution for consumer brands across its network of retailer partners using the line of Criteo Retail Media solutions. This means that, using a deterministic measurement approach, Criteo's Consumer brand clients can precisely track and measure the effectiveness of their ads by attributing their sales at the SKU level to the clicks that were generated on their ads across the network of retailers.(Source: Company Presentation)With the shopper data set Criteo has acquired and the unique insights it can provide to its clients, Criteo is in a position where it has built up an attractive position. Going forwards, it can look to sustain this position with the scale and reach of its technology. Clients who want to benefit essentially from customer insights that are derived from a lot larger dataset than their own will be able to use Criteo's products to do so. And as more clients join, the larger the data pool becomes and the more accurate the insights become. This creates a cycle of network effects for Criteo to leverage. This dynamic is demonstrated by the ~90% client retention Criteo exhibits for all of its combined solutions.On March 22nd, 2019, Adweek released an article titled, “Google Mulls Third-Party Ad-Targeting Restrictions” speculating that Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) may be likely to follow in Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) footsteps in rolling out its own version of the Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) measure Apple added to its Safari Browser. A move that impacted Criteo 3Q18 revenues, causing them to dip up to 5% on a year-on-year basis. The impact was essentially felt industry wide as it became increasingly difficult for ad-tech companies to identify and retarget users on the Safari web browser platform. The Adweek article on Google had an adverse effect on Criteo’s share price as it pushed investors into speculating that Criteo would be exposed to a similar policy to Apple’s, only it would be targeted at the Chrome web browser, a platform that is responsible for as much as 50% of Criteo’s revenues, according to the CEO Jean-Baptiste Rudelle.Data by YChartsThere is an argument that the market has overreacted to this news and that in fact, Google’s changes to its Chrome web browser will not be as impactful to Criteo’s top line as originally thought. In the 1Q19 Earnings Call, JB Rudelle, Criteo CEO, when asked about the impact of potential Chrome changes gives this interpretation :He also elaborated on the firm's change in attitude towards cookies since the changes Apple made to the Safari web browser impacted the business:Furthermore, JB Rudelle in the more recent 2Q19 Earnings Call shed some light on the changes Google has made to its Chrome browser:Given the arguments stated above, there is reason to believe that the market took a very pessimistic view on how Google's proposed changes to the Chrome browser would impact Criteo, thinking that the impact would be similar to the one Criteo felt when Apple made its changes to the Safari Browser, a view that may in fact no be at all warranted.There is a foreign exchange rate risk as the company incurs large portions of their expenses and derives significant revenues in currencies other than the euro.Criteo's ability to generate revenue depends on their ability to collect significant amounts of data from various sources, which may be restricted by consumer choice, restrictions imposed by clients, publishers and browsers or other software, in addition to changes in technology and new developments in laws, regulations and industry standards.Moderate share price depression over the last 6 months has created an attractive entry point for an asymmetric risk-reward scenario. Criteo currently has no long-term financial obligations and has accumulated an attractive holding of cash. This provides a potential platform for the business to leverage its attractive financial position and look to potentially make targeted and strategic acquisitions to create shareholder value going forwards. In addition to shifting its business model away from cookie generated revenue, Criteo will look to capitalize on the vast amounts of data it has already accumulated to continue generating valuable insights and specific advertisement strategies to its clients. At this stage, given the recent share price action and the risk profile of the stock, accumulating shares priced under $20 is an attractive strategy."
4326565,105510,2020-02-24T07:05:22-05:00,"Disappointing FY20 guidance amid a challenging regulatory backdrop gives Criteo the “ick” factor.With a new CEO in place, the turnaround plan is now in motion.Rock-bottom valuations offer investors multiple ways to win.Alongside a negligible debt load, the cash balance looks set to exceed the current market cap within 4-5 years.","Criteo (CRTO) remains at the forefront of the programmatic buying space, with strong technology and scale advantages, but the key issue here is that its core retargeting business looks to be in decline. In response, Criteo has implemented a new business transformation plan, with a new CEO at the helm. With numbers set to come under pressure in the interim and little sign of a successful turnaround anytime soon, the stock is now available at fire-sale prices.With Criteo now firmly in the ""ick"" category, I think there could be something here for patient investors - at current levels, I believe the bar has been lowered too far, leaving the risk/reward skewed firmly to the upside, in my view. Criteo is still a highly cash-generative asset and assuming a base case FCF trajectory (continued core declines; new products to maintain current growth rates) could see its cash balance exceed its market cap within 4-5 years.Criteo reported above-consensus 4Q revenue ex-TAC and EBITDA of $266 million and $109 million, respectively for the quarter, while guiding FY20 revenue ex-TAC to -10% y/y (ex-FX), on stricter GDPR implementation and ad-targeting restrictions by browsers (e.g., Firefox & Microsoft), which are set to come into effect this year.Source: Earnings PresentationClient count rose 276 on a sequential basis, aided by strong holiday performance, though spend per client declines accelerated (-6% y/y vs. -5% in 3Q).Source: Company FilingsGeographical & product penetration: Criteo saw a decline in revenue ex-TAC in APAC (-2% ex-FX vs. -2% in 3Q), while core EMEA grew (+1% ex-FX vs. +1% in 3Q) and Americas growth was -3% ex-FX vs. flat in 3Q.Source: Earnings PresentationWhile the mobile ID-based solutions and Retail Media products, which utilize multiple first-party or cookie-less mechanisms, still constitute ~50% of the overall business, management aims to cover the other 50% from its first-party coverage, ID graph, products at the higher end of the marketing funnel, and through partnerships with other players. New solutions constituted 16% of total Revenue ex-TAC and grew +44% y/y, while the re-targeting product declined modestly in the upper-mid single-digit range, especially with large customers.Source: Company FilingsBusiness transformation. As part of the ongoing initiative, the company's four-pronged strategy includes building out a full-stack differentiated DSP, expanding its product portfolio, exploring partnerships/M&A opportunities, and investing in tech innovations. Per new CEO Clarksen (excerpted from the 4Q19 transcript):Source: Earnings PresentationShare Repurchase. Alongside the continued share price performance, management has been executing on its $80mn share repurchase program (announced in August 2019) - at end-2019, the company had purchased ~3.2mn shares, bringing the total to ~$59mn at an average price of $18.07 per share. Per management, the base case remains for the buyback program to run until completion, leaving an additional $20 million to go (likely implying $10 million for 1Q20 and 2Q20).Source: Company Filings, Guidance, Author EstIn addition to the 1Q20 revenue ex-TAC of $209-212mn and adjusted EBITDA of $55-58mn, the full-year 2020 guidance for revenue ex-TAC reflects a decline of approximately -10% YoY on a constant currency basis, implying a revenue ex-TAC of ~$848mn. Applying adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of 30%, this implies adjusted EBITDA of $254mn for the full-year.Source: Press ReleaseThough the guide was below consensus, there was likely some cautiousness embedded, especially with regard to anticipated and announced privacy and platform initiatives coming into effect this year. Specifically, management guided to 7 percentage points of headwinds from stricter GDPR implementations and ad-targeting restrictions effective this year in browsers/platforms such as Microsoft and Firefox. On the GDPR front, management also highlighted their expectation for the stricter implementation of explicit consent, which should result in the increased prominence of consumer opt-out functionality.While revenues are guided to decline, management did point toward significant leverage benefits within the R&D and G&A expense line items - for instance, the closure of an R&D center in Palo Alto, California.Criteo's 4Q19 call was also notable as it was the first we heard from the company's new CEO, Megan Clarken (15 years at Nielsen before taking the helm at Criteo). The prevailing takeaway was Clarken's ability to inject a fresh perspective, given her traditional media background. New initiatives thus far include a move toward mobile apps and connected TV (part of a full-stack demand-side strategy to combine the company's upper funnel and lower-funnel capabilities). In addition, Clarken also plans to explore partnerships to add complementary capabilities (e.g., cross-platform targeting and measurement).Source: Earnings PresentationCriteo's turnaround plan is built around active steps to move up the funnel, shifting from retargeting to broader services that help advertisers target up the funnel. The new CEO is also pushing for further retail media ad solutions (e.g., sponsored products on Best Buy sites), along with more cross-platform ad delivery and measurement services. In sum, the turnaround is complex, and execution will be key given the ongoing shifts in the ad tech landscape, which will likely lead to headwinds ahead.Yet, the market has de-rated the stock excessively, in my view, and I now see asset value emerging in Criteo - the stock has traded down to ~2-3x EV/EBITDA. In addition to M&A potential (Criteo's broad shopper graph and deep client and publisher relationships could be better realized within a broader product suite), the cash on its balance sheet alone accounts for ~47% of Criteo's market cap (see cap structure outlined below).Source: Company Filings, Market Data as of 19th FebWith the company set to add >$100m in FCF over the next year in my base case scenario (lower earnings/operating cash flow offset by lower capex), the cash balance could exceed Criteo's current market cap within 4-5 years. The excess cash leaves plenty of room for further capital return - an additional $80m buyback program, for instance, would imply an ~10% buyback yield. Thus, Criteo offers investors many ways to win at current levels - a further buildup in the net cash balance and the massive capital return optionality should eventually shift investor focus toward Criteo's overwhelming asset value, in my view. Key risks include an intensifying competitive and regulatory environment, as well as execution risks around the turnaround plan.Source: Company Filings, Author's Projections"
4305309,101928,2019-11-11T03:10:08-05:00,"The competitive landscape has continued to deteriorate for the company during the last year.It appears increasingly unlikely that a $1 billion business can withstand overt hostility from the likes of Amazon, Facebook, and Google.Shares trade at a cheap multiple, but without growth, they are still unappealing.","Between July and August last year, shares of Criteo (CRTO) quickly dropped over 30% following downside Q3 and lowered guidance. Although the stock looked optically cheap, in this article I recommended readers to disregard bullish “buy the dip” calls and remain on the sidelines. Several concerns were of interest: 1) the ITP impact related to the Apple (AAPL) ecosystem 2) the GDPR law implementation in Europe, 3) the metamorphosis of several long-term customers, namely Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) in competitors. All mentioned worries have proven disastrous for Criteo, albeit to different extents, and the company has so far been incapable of putting its cash to good use and restart growth.Consequently, shares have underperformed the market, as demonstrated by the further 30% fall since my SA contribution. Most recently, Criteo has dipped once again about 20% following a disappointing Q3 release and CEO departure (for his second time!). Shares have since recovered some, still virtually attractive at a forward P/E of just seven times 2019 earnings. However, I remain skeptical that there’s any real value left within the company and recommend investors to avoid the name.Earlier this year, Criteo shares came under pressure on reports that Google was considering restrictions in ad-targeting access, somehow similar to the already implemented privacy-enhancing feature (Intelligent Tracking Protection or ITP) available on Apple’s Safari. Because Safari only accounts for about 9% of worldwide desktop browser market share, Criteo felt the impact of the new policy in its revenues, but it was still manageable. However, any restrictive change within Chrome, which carries almost 70% of the world web traffic, would be of a completely different magnitude. Criteo’s Rudelle responded to analysts’ questions in the only possible way: downplaying the issue. Nonetheless, he could not completely rule out the potential of possible restrictive moves when directly questioned.While no significant change has happened to date on Chrome, the situation remains fluid. Google could act not only by locking out Criteo, but also leveraging on DoubleClick to push for a more intense competition. The markets are, therefore, rightfully concerned. Criteo already sat in complacency once when the Safari storm was approaching and did not correctly foresee the impact of such changes. But even if the company can see the threat now, there’s little it can do, other than maybe find new possible lines of business. Two clear trends have advanced in the last few years, both hostile to the company:Unfortunately for Criteo, these are not favorable developments, and the competitive landscape has only continued to deteriorate. Google remains an essential partner for Criteo to operate, but Mount in View is also one of the company's worst competitors when it comes to advertising. It is in Google’s best interest to cut out the middleman at some point. After all, it is what Amazon and Facebook have already started to do.In my last article, I made the case that the company was ambiguous to investors by representing Amazon as a simple customer in need of the “ad-brokerage” services provided by Criteo. Yes, the relationship started that way, but it became more complicated than that when Amazon entered the internet advertising arena as a new competitor of the French company. Big retailers may be reluctant to sign a pact with “the devil,” but Amazon’s offers are attractive to smaller private businesses, which are also Criteo’s target.In the last earnings presentation, investors have also seen more of the same (rose-colored) PR, with Criteo putting up the usual “all is well” parade. Criteo cited Facebook among its partners, but the company has become more and more of a competitor. In Q4 2018, Rudelle warned:The relationship with this “partner” did not improve over the last months. As I said, the trend we are seeing is ring-fencing, and things got sour to the point that Criteo has freshly filed a complaint with the French antitrust body over the discriminatory practices used by Facebook to exclude Criteo from its platforms.The complaint may be the prelude to even more severe actions (a lawsuit?), but even if so, there is very little chance that FB will be bound to take any efforts to reverse course. I feel this is just another nasty piece of news for the company.(Source: Criteo Q3 2019 earnings presentation)For Criteo’s shares to recover, the company will need to prove it can survive all the highlighted issues and show top line growth. When I last wrote about the company, I assumed it could grow ex-tac revenues at 5% over the next ten years. Since bulls were calling for double the amount, it seemed an already overly conservative take. However, with another year of flattish-to-negative turnover under its belt, even this target appears increasingly out of reach for Criteo. Will Criteo ever grow again? It might not.I am not the only skeptic here. Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi, who covers the stock, now projects average revenues to decline of 1% and average operating margins of 7% during the next five years. Though he estimates Criteo will acquire new customers at a pace of 2%, driven by retailers’ continued shift to e-commerce, he also predicts gross average revenue per client to decline 4%, more than offsetting the increase. In my view, Mogharabi is still generous with margins, expecting Criteo to leverage operating efficiencies and reach 8% EBIT over the next ten years. For this reason, he assigns a target price of $25 to the stock. However, this is above a Street consensus price for Criteo shares of $21. In my model, I expect revenues to barely keep up with inflation (+1.7% over the next decade), but I am not equally bullish on margins at this point.In my last evaluation, I considered Criteo could reach approximately 7% EBIT over the full cycle, a slight increase from 6.34% averaged last year. I am now lowering the expected EBIT margin to instead decrease and average just 5% over the next decade. This adjustment reflects my bearish argument that heightened competition in the space, with Amazon increasingly contending new business to Criteo as well, will drive down margins. I expect large tech companies to accept lower profits for single customers, leveraging on their scale and network effects to drive smaller independent players out of the space.Also, the risk that Google could significantly restrict access to Criteo would most certainly turn into a complete disaster for the company. A total ban, as already said, is unlikely, but there are other ways for Google to put pressure on a small competitor like Criteo, tilting the playing field in its favor. To account for such a black swan event, I included a 10% distress probability in my DCF valuation, which reduces the potential upside. The downward adjustment appears appropriate, since it is an effective way to account for moderately adverse actions that Google could likely take at some point.Criteo currently earns high returns on capital (above 15%). I previously assumed the company could hold this higher ROC in the future because the company has some competitive advantage, but I no longer believe this is the case. Hence, I only expect Criteo to barely earn its 9% cost of capital over the long run. Even if the company has so far benefited from network effect and intangible assets derived from the collection of user data through machine learning, I agree with Morningstar’s view that these factors are unlikely to constitute a sustainable moat going forward.The company has a pristine balance sheet, with a good cash position and no long-term obligations. Longs have been vocal about this feature, but as good as it seems, I believe the strong balance sheet is not of much help to Criteo. The company does not pay dividends, and therefore, readers should question the use of the retained earnings. Criteo has started a buyback program, effectively investing in itself. Yet, the used capital has barely managed to limit the share count dilution, without any noticeable effects on EPS. An even more significant concern is that Criteo has no way to use the excess cash to pull any real growth levers. Because the company is so tiny when compared to the FAANGs which are eating away its lunch, it can neither outspend them nor acquire them. Hence, a clean balance sheet remains a nice-to-have feature but of little value with regard to Criteo’s future earnings power.My DCF model, based on available templates provided by professor Aswath Damodaran, includes all mentioned assumptions to derive a $17.7 value per share. The DCF hence explains why Criteo can trade at “only” 7x forward earnings: the market has discounted the poor prospects of the company.Bulls might argue Criteo prices in already all negatives, and the shares are, therefore, a good buy, but I am not convinced. Prospective investors must answer these questions to consider a position: 1) Will Criteo be able to maintain fair access to Chrome? If yes, for how long? 2) Will traffic acquisition costs and gross average revenues per customer stabilize? 3) Considering retention ratio of 90%, will Criteo be able to add 13% of new customers each year? Will the company maintain current operating margins on those customers despite heightened competition from the FAANGs?To conclude, because of the substantial headwinds in its industry, I find no compelling reason to buy the dip in Criteo, even at a very cheap multiple of 7x forward earnings. I believe the company fits the classic definition of “value trap” because it is fighting challenges that are structural and long term in nature.Investors that are looking for “buy the dip” bargains in the tech space might want to dig deeper instead into online TAs Booking Holdings (BKNG), Expedia (EXPE), and TripAdvisor (TRIP). Shares of these companies, which also trade at reasonable P/E multiples, recently fell as much as 30% hit by higher marketing expenses, global industry slowdown and recession fears.Opposite to Criteo, however, all these factors appear to be transient in nature, and these companies are moaty businesses. I believe all the three players enjoy network effects, in particular in the US market for Expedia and internationally for Booking. Also, the companies will likely reap the benefits of the secular shift towards online TA. The oldest incumbent in business, Thomas Cook, recently went bust - perhaps a telling sign of the times. However, the market share of online bookings through these platforms remains modest compared to the overall potential: and a slight increase in market share can drive a significant boost in a $1.7 trillion industry. Also, in this expensive market, I encourage investors to continue to seek and “buy wonderful companies at a fair price rather than fair companies at a wonderful price.”"

The company released its FY 2019 results on February 11th, but even the earnings topper provided no relief to investors. On the contrary, after a short-lived rally, shares slid again and are sitting at historical all-time lows at the time of this writing. CRTO's chart is painful, but also when adding the three-year performance of competitor firm The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) to the mix, it is almost insulting. While shares of the French company lost over 2/3 of their value, investors in TTD made 10 times their money.Source: MorningstarThose who follow me on Seeking Alpha know that I cautioned readers about Criteo on two occasions. I did not love the company when I first covered it in 2018, and then again, I recommended steering clear of the company in November last year, with shares already trading at dirty cheap multiples.Towards the end of last year, Criteo also brought onboard a new CEO, Megan Clarken, who joined from Nielsen. The move was not a bad one per se, but it was a bit depressing to see co-founder JB Rudelle resigning from the CEO position for the second time in four years. The first quarter under the new leadership was ok, with adjusted EBITDA well above the $102.1M consensus at $109.5M. The EBITDA margin was also particularly strong for the quarter at 41%, although the FY EBITDA margin compressed 160bps from 33.2% in 2018 to 31.6% in 2019. FCF conversion also remained relatively steady at 42% of the company's EBITDA, with elevated CAPEX, but on the bright side no interest expenses.While the company kept producing good results in terms of margins, the top line tells a different story. Criteo's revenues barely remained afloat, and the company ended the year with ex-TAC revenue growth of +0.3%, which is within the initial 0%-2% guidance range provided. However, the disturbing note of the day was the FY2020 guidance, with ex-TAC revenue expected to decline by 10% in constant currency. If results are to end in line with expectations, this would be a dramatic deceleration compared to the 2% decrease registered by Criteo in the fourth quarter and no doubt a major reason for traders to run away on the update.Source: Criteo Investor PresentationEven though investors could applaud Criteo for maintaining a high customer retention (over 90%), the trend shows that customers' growth is now tapering off. More importantly, the decrease in revenues, despite an increase in customers, confirms that advertisers are moving away some of their retargeting ad dollars towards different platforms, and net additions do no longer make up for this shortfall. The decrease suggests that Criteo must discount to clients its lower effectiveness in targeted advertising, a decline that the company is not expecting to reverse this year.Source: Criteo Investor PresentationAlthough management still makes a case for Criteo as a classic ""growth stock,"" with a huge TAM of $47 billion and a high reinvestment rate in the business (with the share buyback and bolt-on acquisitions strategy), the company cannot address the decline in revenues ahead , at the moment. The situation seems quite desperate, and the market has reacted accordingly. But with pessimism quickly approaching its climax, it may finally be time to consider CRTO as a buy.As I noted in my last publication, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) potential restrictive actions over cookies and data sharing were an overhang to CRTO ad-retargeting business, because ""Google could act not only by locking out Criteo, but also leveraging on DoubleClick to push for a more intense competition.""Fast forward two months and the insight proved farsighted. Google (GOOG) (GOOGL_ announced that by 2022, it would be phasing out third-party cookies. The change adds another layer of risk to all ad-tech companies, not only Criteo, although at least, now that all is said and done, the market should be fully price the risk in the shares. Also, there could be life after the end of cookies. Dave Pickles, TTD founder and CTO, argued that cookies are already an ""archaic technology,"" and The Trade Desk does not rely on them to deliver its services.Criteo has worked as well for years to diversify its products offering away. In a statement following Google announcement, the company specified that a ""significant and growing share"" of revenues no longer relies on cookies. Still, the elephant in the room for Criteo remains the increased competition from Silicon Valley. Not only Google and The Trade Desk but also Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), once a partner of the French firm, turned to restrict data access granted to technology partners, pushing customers to rely instead on Facebook's in-house solutions.The headwinds are considerable, but Criteo still enjoys some network effects. Its partners are prominent international brands in retail, and while I do not think this is enough to generate a moat and earn above-average returns on invested capital, the company should earn an average ROIC over the next decade.Source: Criteo Investor PresentationIn my last article, I assumed Criteo was trading near its intrinsic value of $17.7, a 35% discount from the current price of $13.26. However, back in November, consensus mean target was $22, and Morningstar had a target of $25. Analyst Ali Mogharabi then slashed its fair value estimate by almost 30% to the current $18.2, and consensus target similarly trended downwards to $18, as analysts are now finally considering 2020 guidance in their targets.In support of its assessment, Morningstar now projects an average revenue decline of 4% and an average operating margin of 5% during the next five years. However, these basic assumptions are not very dissimilar from what I already inputted in my model back in November. Increased competition and lower retargeting efficacy are no last-minute surprises, and my long-term revenue forecast was already flat. However, I am now adjusting for initial decrease, followed by growth in the back part of the decade.Although I revised my DCF model based on the new information provided, in contrast with most other analysts, I am not downgrading Criteo further and simply reiterating a $17 target for the stock based on its intrinsic value. While the discounting effect on the first years has slightly decreased my November estimate, the buyback activity in which Criteo engaged during the last months has been beneficial.I am still assuming Criteo will eventually move towards the French marginal tax rate of 33% and EBIT to stabilize at 5%, while the company will keep earning its cost of capital of 9% over the long run. Based on this information, Criteo shares finally appear moderately undervalued, but this is not a defensive name and uncertainty is still very high.While I am certainly upgrading Criteo on valuation, I am still wary of a long position for a couple of reasons. First, as already stated previously, Criteo's size is small compared to its competitors. Its budget to fight off rivals is limited. I do not see the company as an acquisition target either because it is likelier that companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will rather push and upgrade their in-house solutions than acquire Criteo. For the same reason, I also think that Criteo will need to keep spending the better part of its earnings on acquisitions and reinvestment only to stay relevant, thus limiting potential shareholders' returns from the cash flow the company currently generates.Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, Criteo is not immune to unfavorable macroeconomic trends, but vulnerable like traditional advertising agencies such as WPP (WPP) and Omnicom (OMC). The company needs the general economy to be in good shape and high levels of discretionary spending, as it earns revenues based on ad impressions purchased by retailers.Considered the risks and the current point in the economic cycle, I'd still like to see a higher margin of safety to entice me into a long position. With a safety margin above 40% and forward P/E of about 6x (equals to $10 per share), I believe Criteo could be a reasonable contrarian buy. At the moment, however, I believe there is potential for further downside and the stock will underperform other more defensive names over the next months.TipRanks: SELL"
4202058,101928,2018-08-25T10:05:25-04:00,What has gone wrong with Criteo in the last twelve months.Growth expectations for Criteo are very optimistic considering the current slowdown.DCF and PEG-based valuations reveal a not-so-attractive risk/reward profile.,"Once upon a time, a small French ad-tech company started to gain popularity and market share. The company helped retailers launching effective marketing campaigns through its innovative ads-retargeting technology. The compounding CAGR was stunning. After only eight years of life, the company listed on the NASDAQ in 2013, reaching $1 billion in revenues the following year.The company I am talking about is Criteo (CRTO) and in the last year has gone through a lot of pain. The stock has almost halved, but nobody seems to understand what turned this “mega success story” and darling of The Street into a dog with fleas. I do not need to quote any specific article: if you follow the ticker, you will know that most contributors are suggesting investors buy the dip. The perfect regulatory storm will pass, they say. Harsh actions (indirectly) against Criteo by Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) are not enough to take the company down.Well, that may be true, these activities won’t put Criteo's core business under, at least not in the medium term; but are its shares such a bargain? That’s the question I will try to answer here.To understand the drama Criteo is going through, it is necessary to look back at summer 2017. At the time, Criteo was trading at all-time highs, but a tech-savvy was writing that the new Apple’s ITP system was about to tilt the playing field even more in favor of Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (FB). The newly designed one-day tracking window was about to give popular web services a definite advantage, in the sense that it was weakening the position of all other ad-tech providers like CRTO. The Street didn’t seem to notice, but this was indeed a signal.What instead was only noise? The change in the primary EU law regulating how companies protect its citizens' data. Subsequently reported as a great cause of concern, the GDPR directive was an even older issue. Adopted in April 2016, implementation was deferred for two years to allow Criteo, and all the others involved, to review the law implications on its business practices and adapt.Management did the homework and adapted the business to withstand the GDPR, but grossly miscalculated how the competitors were changing their practices during the last few years. CEO Eichmann did not understand how the firms’ competitive landscape was moving towards mobile and in-app ads, away from Criteo’s more “traditional” strengths in online re-targeting. After shoveling out shareholders’ money to develop new services that were shut down within two years, Eichmann was suddenly out. Another signal that more pain was on its way.Criteo recently posted decent results for the 2Q 2018, but after quarters of denials, co-founder and re-appointed CEO JB Rudelle finally acknowledged it: Apple’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention - ITP - is very bad for business. Rudelle’s words do not leave much room for doubts:While Criteo might be the “platform of choice for the open Internet,” Apple, Facebook, and Amazon are doubling their efforts to move users within their walled gardens. Sure, on the GDPR side things are holding, but this didn’t save Criteo from slashing its FY2018 guidance. Rudelle reassured shareholders that ITP and GDPR are “not existential threats.” But where is Criteo’s growth going forward when top-line progress gets cut from about 5.5% (midpoint) to zero?A recent bullish article on Seeking Alpha called for Criteo a stellar valuation of $58 (a nice 55% margin of safety, considering the current price) “achieving just 10% sales growth Y/Y from 2019 to 2034”. I have some doubts on the “just” word: statistics at hand, how many tech companies out of a random 100 list can achieve a 15-year revenue CAGR of 10%? My bet is for only a few. Sure, Criteo can be one of those few firms, and to be fair, this seems possible from a purely theoretical perspective based on the advertising market size. Such valuation would imply that Criteo revenues will be slightly north of $10 billion in 2034. Facebook revenues are already worth $40 billion today. But Criteo has also - just - communicated that the company will not grow ex-TAC revenues at all this year. Research studies also show that mobile advertising growth will far outpace online browser advertising. Mobile and in-app advertising are areas where Criteo lags the competition, although management has promised effort and “growth” in the area. Again, from JB Rudelle's 2Q earnings call:It might be the fastest growth area, but I honestly suspect it is because the starting base is relatively low, allowing for higher compounding rates.From Criteo article by Zhiyuan SunBy looking at this graph, it seems Criteo is growing, but careful observation will indeed reveal that a plateau seems to be forming. Allow me to add a disappointing spin to this very same graph by checking the actual growth rates.The truth is, Criteo’s growth is rapidly decelerating, and I am not so confident the company can sustain a 10% growth rate for the next 15 years. Criteo has been long battling Facebook and Google in what is an almost duopoly in online advertising, but Amazon (yes, Amazon) is now also coming for them. Bezos has earned quite a reputation for entering industries and disrupting each contestant’s margins first and asking questions later. Amazon competing in the space is terrible news for two reasons: more competition for revenues and added pressure on margins. An all-out war with the FAANG (well, for now except for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)) sounds for Criteo very akin to David against four Goliath.Criteo 2Q Investors Presentation (notice Amazon position among clients)As an additional note, I’d like to point out that Criteo management has done a poor job in being transparent to its shareholders. ITP was a severe misstep which maybe costed the CEO’s post, but it seems that the company still doesn’t particularly care about making blunders. Based on what I reported above, in fact, I think the above slide misrepresents the current competitive landscape. Why Criteo still wants investors to believe that Amazon is among its potential customers, rather than a new fierce competitor?Before assessing Criteo’s fair price, I’d like to go back to the basics and remind readers of the three essential elements playing a role in determining business valuation.From Prof. Damodaran’s blogThese three are cash flows a company can yield, the risks involved in producing cash flows (captured by the discount rate) and the potential growth of the firm’s cash flows over time. Last twelve months' developments indicate that in the case of Criteo, cash flows have become less likely to grow in the future due to an increase in competition and the ITP impact. Any new assessment of Criteo’s fair value should embed such issues.The company balance sheet is solid, and Criteo has no debt. Therefore, the business is unlevered. Considering the use of WACC as discount rate proxy, Criteo has a simple capital structure where the discount rate equals its cost of equity. The current environment has low but rising interest rates, so I think it is an error to capitalize deceptively low current risk-free rates over the next ten years. In my valuation model, I used an average 9.5% discount rate, which assumes an average 4% risk-free rate, 5.5% equity risk and 0.9 beta.The resulting DCF reserved me no surprises. I tried to build the model as emotionally-detached as possible, but I must point out that any valuation reflects the analyst’s bias, and valuation inputs are always subjective. The most significant uncertainty relates to the firm’s growth rates: the more the expected growth differs from what the market’s opinion, the more a company will be under/overvalued in the analyst‘s eyes. However, I eventually discovered that I have roughly the same conclusion as the market on Criteo. Although revenue guidance for 2018 was lowered to -1% to +1% ex-TAC increase, I still expect that over the next ten years, Criteo will achieve a CAGR of roughly 5%. However, it turns out the market price is already embedding this expectation as well.I also double-checked Criteo’s value with Lynch’s rule-of-thumb valuation based on PEG (Value = EPS * Growth Rate * 100). I would consider consensus forward EPS of $1.43 and EPS growth of 15%. Bottom-line growth that doubles the top-line one is usually a reasonable guesstimate, but in the last year, Criteo's earnings growth was closer to 3x sales. A fair P/E of 15 seems, therefore, adequate to the case, but such valuation finds no bargain in Criteo as $1.43 x 15 equates to fair value (PEG = 1) of $21.5, still above current market price.Author’s appraisal of CriteoIt is impossible to know if Criteo can make a comeback or not at this stage. The company might release incredible new products and steal market share from its deep-pocketed competitors, but the odds are reasonably stacked against the French firm. Valuations range of $21.5-$28.6 see no real upside from the current price, and the Street is already pricing Criteo for a somewhat positive outlook, expecting future growth will exceed 2018 guidance.All considered, I believe there are opportunities with more exciting risk/reward profile in the market. In a recent article, I shared with readers my current top idea in the tech space, YY Inc. (YY). The company currently trades at a forward P/E of 10x, but growth can exceed 25% over the next five years (and I believe I am conservative), resulting in a PEG ratio of 0.4x. Too good to be true?Nothing is set in stone, but I have seen my fair share of severe mispricing when it comes to Chinese stocks. The market has been - rarely - right. It is more than just ratios though. Criteo is currently wrestling competitors with deeper pockets and sharper teeth, while YY is a leader in live video streaming in China, with direct interests in one of the most promising new industries (e-sports). When it comes to growth stocks, I am more willing to engage a bloody war with volatility rather than be stuck with anemic growth forever.My ratings: CRTO – Underperform. YY – Strong buy."

This is due to a number of factors – a highly dynamic industry requiring constant R&D, strong competition, a change of CEO, and a strong level of uncertainty in the minds of investors.Our assessment of CRTO’s business and our valuation indicates that the stock is heavily undervalued as it is around the bottom of its cycle. The stock price of the company is to rebound in the near future and we believe that it would be an interesting bet for medium-to-long-term investors.CRTO is a French multinational player within the digital advertising and technology space. The company offers various advertising and data management solutions to e-commerce companies all over the world and its core technology is called the Criteo Engine. This enables advertising firms to launch their campaigns across multiple channels and devices, monitor the progress of each campaign real-time, modify the target group, and carry out a real-time Return on Investment analysis. CRTO’s product is comprehensive and attempts to automate a large part of the campaign process. The company was founded in 2005 and has its headquarters in Paris, France. Currently, the CRTO stock trades at around $24 and from the point of view of technical analysis, this price is below the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day simple moving average of the stock.However, the fundamentals of the stock tell us a completely different story. The revenue growth over the past five years has been excellent and the company has been having excellent margins too. If we analyze the data in the image below, we see that the company is ticking all the boxes for a fundamentally solid and yet a heavily undervalued firm. The Price to Sales ratio is as low as 0.69 and the Price to Earnings ratio is also ridiculously low at 16.35. All these valuation ratios are low despite the fact that the Sales growth for the past five years is 53.2% and the EPS growth is a phenomenal 134.80%. Now the big question is - what is the reason for the recent crash in the stock price?Source: CRTO/ Finviz There are a number of factors which could have caused this crash. First and foremost, it is the basic nature of CRTO’s business that doesn’t inspire a lot of investor confidence. Digital advertising is an industry that is evolving extremely fast and businesses have to keep innovating all the time. A simple example of this was the arrival of ad blockers on the digital scene a few years back that had posed a significant challenge to companies like CRTO.Another factor is the nature of competition that CRTO faces. The main competitors of CRTO are firms like Amazon and Google which have a massive spending power and huge R&D budgets. These firms have the ability to come up with a product that can destroy the revenues of a company like CRTO overnight. An example of this is the recent launch of Amazon’s new advertising tool which news reports claimed, would adversely affect the business of CRTO. The news led to CRTO’s stock falling by around 2.62%.Lastly, the recent change in the CEO of CRTO was a factor that created a bit of a panic and led to a reasonable amount of knee-jerk selling, causing the stock price to fall further.If we analyze the five-year chart of CRTO, one interesting observation is that the stock price has followed a seasonal trend. Currently, all the above-mentioned factors, particularly Amazon’s new product launch and CRTO’s CEO change, have led to the price being at the bottom end of the cycle. While the negative sentiment around the stock might stay in the short term, the upswing is not far away as the market will not be able to ignore the solid fundamentals of the company for long. All it requires is a solid quarterly result that would put the share price back on track.Source: Yahoo FinanceProjected Income Statement & Cash FlowsSource: Historical Data from CRTO; Estimates based on calculations by Baptista ResearchSource: Historical Data from CRTO; Estimates based on calculations by Baptista ResearchOur projection of the company’s revenue for 2018 is largely based on the management guidance during the Q1 2018 earnings call. While the company’s revenue growth has been well over 25% for the past couple of years, 2018 could be a dry spell with an 8% growth in revenues. However, the management will make up for this by working on margin expansion and might succeed in arriving at an 11% EBITDA and a 4.7% Net Income margin.The capex for this year could be on the higher side given the need to invest heavily in R&D in order to keep innovating and prevent the obsolescence of the company’s core product. This would result in a lower free cash flow and a higher depreciation. There isn’t much deviation expected in the working capital and the company is expected to continue re-investing all its profits back into the business and continue its zero dividend policy.Source: Historical Data from CRTO/ Morningstar; Estimates based on calculations by Baptista ResearchGiven the historical track record of CRTO of dealing with competition and the dynamism within the industry, we are reasonably confident of a reversal in the falling trend. As we see above, the current valuation multiples are already very low and there is little scope for a further crash unless there is an unexpected news in this regard.Towards the end of 2018, the expansion in the valuation multiples should start after the fears of obsolescence and the new management have subsided. This will result in a decent appreciation in the stock price. Our price target of $43 for 2018 also happens to be a key static resistance as per the Gann’s Square of Nines technical indicator and hence, we provide for a marginal expansion in multiples as compared to 2017.Source: Yahoo FinanceAs we can see in the chart above, there is a key resistance for the stock around $31 which is expected to be broken in the near future and the next big resistance is around the $43 mark, which also happens to be a static level as per Gann's Square of Nines.The stock currently trades at around $24 which means that the upside is almost 79% which implies phenomenal returns for investors entering the stock today. Our valuation of CRTO in this article and our projected price is specific to the date of the analysis i.e. 23rd May 2018. This is dependent on a number of factors - the ability of the CRTO's core product, the Criteo Engine to continue to be in demand, the realization of the revenue growth, free cash flows and the other assumptions taken into account.While we are reasonably confident of these assumptions, there is a possibility that the actual results of the company may be different from our projected results and this may cause CRTO's stock price to change its trend and not follow our forecast. There may be a number of unexpected events/ circumstances that may result in the stock failing to achieve our target e.g. CRTO being unable to compete with Amazon's new ad product, reduced R&D spends by CRTO causing rapid obsolescence of their product, the new CEO of the company being unable to continue the revenue growth trajectory, changed investor perception regarding CRTO and the digital advertising sector, and so on.Lastly, we would like to emphasize that our valuation is subjective in nature and is largely a function of our own judgment. We do not believe that this is the only correct methodology of valuing CRTO. Also, we had no interaction with the management of the company and they did not comment on the achievability or the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying the financial forecasts. Our projections are based purely on the belief in the management’s ability to continue its revenue growth and sustain its current level of margins.The strong competitive threat from giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook was always high but CRTO has not only managed to survive but also managed to demonstrate double-digit growth in its revenues and generate good profits and cash flows. The management may not have an R&D budget as large as its competitors but they have always managed to find a way to keep the company growing and that is the biggest confidence booster with respect to this stock.Our price target of CRTO for the end of 2018 is $43, which is a 79% appreciation over the current market price. We believe that this stock is a great buy at the current valuations and can provide excellent returns to investors once the upward movement of the cycle begins."

But with the NASDAQ trading at all-time highs, such lucrative opportunities have become extremely difficult to find. After careful research, however, the author has uncovered one tech gem that is shrouded in negative sentiment. At this point, market participants are so pessimistic about this data stock they are valuing it at a huge discount to a brick-and-mortar competitor. This beaten-up stock is France's ad-tech darling Criteo S.A. (NASDAQ:CRTO).Criteo S.A. is a French marketing technology company founded in 2005. Its main business is to help commerce companies and brand manufacturers acquire, convert and re-engage their customers, using shopping data, predictive technology and large consumer reach. With its proprietary Criteo Engine and its machine-learning algorithms, the company engages with consumers in real time through the pricing and delivery of highly relevant digital advertisements, across devices and environments.Beginning last year, a series of bad news caused temporary headwinds for Criteo. First, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) limited ad-tracking on its iOS software; next, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) made an announcement to move into the ad-retargeting industry. Thirdly, new legislation from the European Union required ad retargeters to gain user consent before executing their business strategy (known as GDPR). With all three variables in mind, fearful investors sold off their shares in herds expecting an impending doom to the company. However, no cataclysm has materialized in Criteo's business model. In the meantime, the emotional overreaction from the market has created a significant opportunity to purchase Criteo at rock-bottom valuations and will be examined by the author.The article shall progress as follows: first, the author will investigate Criteo's continued client growth and high retention rates. Second, Criteo's valuation will be analyzed in comparison to a brick-and-mortar ad company. Finally, a discount cash flow model will be built to find and discuss the implied growth rate the market assigned to Criteo's share price. The conclusion from all three methods is unanimous: Criteo is a high-quality tech company trading at an incredible bargain.Source: Author's Curation, Criteo Q22018 Earnings SlideSince 2015, the number of clients using Criteo's ad retargeting engine has increased 33% CAGR. During the first two quarters of 2018, new customers increased by a whopping 16% and 20%, respectively. Keep in mind, this is at a time where the market expects Criteo's services to be rendered useless due to Apple's new iOS restriction, Amazon entering the market and the EU's new privacy legislation. Yet, Criteo's customer count actually went up. As long as there is continued demand for Criteo's product, then temporary headwinds will not affect the company's long-term revenue momentum. As one shall see below, Criteo's business model is built on a substantial moat of retaining customers.Source: Criteo Investor RelationsSource: Criteo Q22018 Earnings SlideA stunning 92% of Criteo's sales are recurring revenues. When combined with a near-term retention rate of over 80% and double-digit client growth, this provides a substantial margin of safety to keep Criteo's gross revenues above the $2 billion mark reached in FY 2017. Although retention rates have declined marginally in the recent quarter, they are nowhere near enough to justify a 50% plunge in stock price from 2017 heights. Due to multiple sources of revenue streams, no single customer's or region's difficulties can cause irreversible damages to Criteo's core business.Source: Criteo Investor RelationsSource: Criteo's Latest SEC 10-Q FilingWith roughly 40% of gross revenues exposed to Europe, 40% to the Americas, and 20% to Asia, Criteo is a rising star on the global advertising arena. The company is well-positioned to receive the benefits of a sector projected to grow at over 10% CAGR. Moreover, less than 3% of the company's revenues come from one single customer. These diversified revenue resources provide a substantial margin of safety, should existing clients churn in light of the aforementioned three headwinds. With new, loyal customer growing each year, many would expect Criteo to be valued as a premium tech company. However, this is the exact opposite; in fact, it is Criteo's brick-and-mortar brother which is being valued at a premium.Like Criteo, JcDecaux (OTC:JCDXY) (OTCPK:JCDXF) is also a French company operating in the advertising industry. Unlike Criteo, this is a traditional advertiser selling brick-and-mortar billboard space to clients as its business model. Despite both companies being in the same sector and having a diversified global clientele, the spread between valuations of the two companies are extraordinary. Using trailing-twelve-month financial statements for both companies, the author calculated their key financial ratios adjusted for share-based compensation (less) and operating leases capitalized (at 0.75% borrow rate), resulting in the following:Source: Criteo SEC-10K Filings, JcDecaux Investor Relations, Author's Curation *Note: Criteo margins reference revenue ex-TAC From above, one can spot Criteo is trading at roughly 19x free cash flow in terms of both market cap and enterprise value. At the same time, JcDecaux trades at nearly twice as high as how much investors are willing to pay for Criteo's cash flows despite being a traditional advertiser. Continuing on, Criteo's EBITDAR yield of 22% is more than double that of JcDecaux's 10%; its EBIT yield is 50% cheaper; and the company's ROIC of 15% is nearly twice the amount of JcDecaux's 8% adjusted for a one-time tax increase in 2018. Usually, such extraordinary differences between the valuation of two companies in the same sector can only occur if one company is far inferior to the other. Studying this table further, however, reveals just the opposite.Looking at the debt situation of the two companies, Criteo has a negative financial leverage not because it is losing money, but because the company is net cash positive (even adjusted for capital leases) on its balance sheet. In fact, this is a company which has consistently operated debt-free since its IPO in 2012.Moving onto margins; the spreads between the efficiency of Criteo and JcDecaux are also huge. But no matter which one is analyzed, Criteo is a far more productive company than JcDecaux, remaining hundreds of basis points ahead at turning revenues into bottom line profit.One could argue Criteo's margin advantage can be negated by using gross revenues instead of revenue ex-TAC, but this just creates more undervaluation. For if this method was to be used, then Criteo's EV/Sales multiple will be reduced to a mere 0.72x, and imply investors are willing to pay more than twice the amount of a brick-and-mortar company's revenues to that of a tech company in the same sector. Hence, Criteo is undervalued according to every metric of relative valuation. But what kind of growth rate is the market expecting for a bargain price of $26.41 a share? To investigate the problem, the author has built a discount cash flow model for bottom-up valuation, with astonishing results:*Note: There is not enough room in this section to place an entire DCF, hence, only its assumptions will be listed. The complete model can be accessed on the author's personal drive here. Assumptions: With these assumptions in mind, the author first reverse-engineered the model using an expected sales growth to induce the current share price of Criteo as follows:Source: Author's Curation*Note: Company Value and Shares Out in Millions USDAs one can see, the market is only expecting a pessimistic 5.43% revenue growth Y/Y to justify its current valuation. This is an enormous discount to the company's historical growth rate of 41%. In the Q22018 earnings call, CEO J.B. Rudelle has already thrown out one of the key pillars of investor capitulation - the GDPR. Realized ex-TAC revenues during the quarter were down only 1% in Europe, while growing at high single-digits for other geographical segments. As for Apple's new iOS policy on advertising, this represents only a temporary decline; as mentioned in earlier sections, Criteo's client count continues to grow over double-digits. Hence, the long-term growth in market share should offset near-term software restrictions.With two key pillars of bearish sentiment thrown out, the real question becomes the impact of Amazon entering the ad-retargeting duopoly of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Criteo. Although this represents an uncertainty, it has been illustrated in the earlier sections Criteo is both capable of growing its client base and keeping them loyal at a very high retention rate. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely the addition of another player will steal Criteo's market share. Instead, all three participants are expected to be competing for customers requiring digital ad services.Using this assumption, one can reasonably deduce a fair value for Criteo using a conservative growth of the company's sales via the same DCF. For extra margin of safety, the author assumes roughly three-quarters of Criteo's historical revenue CAGR are crushed post-2018. Here are the results:Source: Author's Curation*Note: Company Value and Shares Out in Millions USDEven after a conservative projection, Criteo's stock price is easily a double by achieving just 10% sales growth Y/Y from 2019 to 2034. Post-2018, as long as Criteo beats the implied market growth rate of 5.43% but remains at a 75% discount to its historical CAGR, then the upside potential of 100% can be very quickly realized as market participants abandon its pessimistic lens en masse.In short, when sentiment deviates from the fundamentals, an opportunity is created for the investor to take risks with the possibility of a great reward. Hence, the author concludes Criteo's current price level offers a significant margin of safety to grow one's investment.Criteo is a tech company with double-digit client growth compounded by sky-high customer retention rates. On the other hand, investor capitulation has taken the company so far down it currently trades at a roughly 50% discount versus a traditional non-tech advertiser. Moreover, absolute valuation has revealed a strong margin of safety to purchase the stock at its current value. At 10% earnings yield, Criteo is a lucrative gem for anyone wishing to invest in a high-quality tech company, with great management, at a bargain price."
4268382,24361,2019-06-05T08:09:18-04:00,"Criteo has seen revenue growth effectively vanish as data privacy concerns and ad blocking have sapped the core ad retargeting business.
        Criteo's core capabilities are being repurposed into several new initiatives, but it will take time before they can really move the needle on revenue and profits.
        Mid-single-digit adjusted FCF can support a fair value above $20, but the company's credibility is broken and the stock badly needs a return to growth.","As an ad tech company built around a machine learning-based ad retargeting engine, Criteo (CRTO) has had a rough go of it in recent years. Between concerns about privacy and the growing use of ad blocking software, Criteo has found it harder and harder to generate growth from what was once a very successful differentiating technology. While the company has been building up other businesses, they’re simply not big enough yet (nor will be in the near future) to offset the fundamental underlying pressures in the core business.Expectations are low for Criteo now; low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit FCF adjusted free cash flow growth can support a fair value above $20, but 2019 is going to be a year of next-to-no growth (and possible contraction), there are still risks with changes to Google’s (GOOGL) Chrome browser, and management frankly doesn’t have much credibility with the Street. Newer offerings like sponsored products and in-app advertising could help spark a turnaround, and expectations are low, but investors will need a lot of patience.There’s been considerable fear that new data privacy features in the next iteration of Google’s Chrome browser would be a near death-blow to Criteo’s core ad retargeting business. Were Google to go the same route as Apple (AAPL) and Mozilla have with automatic/default ad tracking cookie blocking, 50% of the company’s revenue could be soon at risk.My read on the new privacy features and tools is that it’s not nearly as bad as that. Chrome developers will need to explicitly specify which cookies work across websites (tracking) and Chrome will be providing tools that enhance transparency for users so they can see (and likely block) cross-site cookies while preserving single-domain cookies. How many users will go to that trouble has yet to be seen, and websites still have the option to block or limit users who don’t allow such cookies.Helping Criteo here is the fine line Google has to walk with respect to antitrust. Criteo’s core business basically helps advertisers place more effective digital display ads, but Google also offers a similar remarketing service, so any steps that hamper outside service providers to Google’s benefit are likely to be carefully examined by government officials.Unfortunately, while the new Chrome may not be so bad for Criteo, the underlying remarketing business is far from strong. Retargeting revenue declined 6% in the first quarter on a 1% decline in same-client spending. While the total customer count did still increase (up 5%), it declined sequentially for the first time in the company’s history.I believe there are several issues at work here. First, widespread ad-blocking is changing how companies approach online advertising, with many reducing or shifting their budget to other forms of advertising beyond display ads. Second, while Criteo’s retargeting engine is powerful, helped by using deterministic first-party data where many other companies have tried to use probabilistic data, they’re not the only game in town with respect to remarketing. Third, and related to the first point, many platforms are changing their policies and approaches to how user data is collected and shared; Apple has made enhanced privacy a selling point and Criteo has never really been able to work around changes to Safari that crippled its functionality (and Safari was once more than 20% of revenue).Although the changes to the internet ad market have hit Criteo hard, they didn’t hit the company flatfooted – management has been working for years to diversify the company’s revenue base beyond ad retargeting. Unfortunately, those efforts haven’t really amounted to a lot in terms of revenue contribution, and the last two quarters have seen ad retargeting account for 91% and 88% of total revenue.Criteo acquired Manage in 2018 for its app-install ad business and to help develop other identity mechanisms beyond cookies for ad targeting. While the business grew 32% yoy in the first quarter, it’s a single-digit percentage of revenue. Likewise with the company’s Sponsored Products offering built through the 2016 acquisition of HookLogic. At the time of the deal, management projected that this would constitute 10% of 2019 revenue, but that’s unlikely to happen.Criteo’s non-retargeting businesses are arguably viable and interesting (particularly the app-install ad business), but the problem is that 74% growth of not much revenue (the non-retargeting revenue growth in Q1’19) is still not very much revenue. These could become more significant businesses given enough time to grow, but they aren’t going to offset the weakness in the core business.New efforts to watch in addition to sponsored products and app-based advertising include audience generation tools, predictive bidding algorithms for digital ad placements , and tools (including self-service tools) that harness Criteo’s core capabilities to allow websites to better engage/market to users on their own site, including shopper targeting (Shopper Graph, et al), campaign management, and measurement/analytics. In essence, Criteo’s tools can be used by e-commerce sites to better serve and market to customers who are already interested in the site (as opposed to tracking them across the ‘net and marketing to them on other sites), which is less problematic from a data privacy and ad-blocking perspective.Although Criteo doesn’t generate huge adjusted free cash flow (stock compensation has been a significant portion of free cash flow in recent years), the business is profitable and does generate cash flow. If management can restore the core retargeting business to even just low single-digit growth, the company will continue to generate free cash flow while newer businesses ramp up.If Criteo can generate long-term revenue growth around 4%, I believe the business can scale up enough to produce high single-digit adjusted FCF margins and long-term FCF growth around 6%. Discounted back, that would support a fair value above $20. Revenue hasn’t grown much since 2017, though, so management still needs to reassure investors that even low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth is a viable target.While I normally like to use secondary valuation methodologies to supplement discounted cash flow, I don’t really have one that works here. Criteo isn’t valued anything like a software company, nor like an internet or e-commerce company, so I don’t really have a solid back-up here yet.Criteo trades with very low expectations embedded in the share price, but management first has to get back to maintaining/meeting its own targets and restoring the company to growth. Unfortunately, it looks like investors will have to wait until for better than low-single-digit growth, and there are still ample uncertainties as to whether management will be able to successfully repurpose/reposition its core capabilities. The upside if this all works out is meaningful, but it’s going to take time to work out."

Click here to find out more »Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO) is a French company evolving in the digital advertising space and proposing a whole ecosystem of marketing products designed to cover the entire online customer journey. The goal of this article is to explain why Criteo is an attractive investment at its current price. The company exhibits indeed strong fundamentals (growing net income, positive cash flows, and very little debt) and trade at an attractive P/E ratio of 17.38 (TTM). The stock is cheap because its price has sharply declined following the release of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) ITP update and because of the global consolidation happening in the digital advertising sector. Nevertheless, this article will show that Criteo has still some strong growth prospects and is well positioned to benefit from its growing industry.Criteo competes in the highly challenging environment of digital advertising against well established companies such as Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) or Facebook (FB). This is a very concentrated environment, where according to the International Advertising Bureau, the top 10 digital ad spenders' account for 75% of the overall revenue of the sector. However, the recent study conducted by the IAB and PWC shows that digital advertising is a fast-growing market and is full of opportunities. Initially powered by the rise of the Internet on our desktops, mobile now makes up the bulk of the growth.As mentioned above, mobile is the fastest grower with 36% of revenue growth against 21% for the entire digital sector. To stay competitive, companies now need to develop products optimized for a cross-device environment.The shift from desktop to mobile is verified for nearly each form of ads.One last interesting chart, Social Media is becoming increasingly important in the digital advertising universe. In 2017, they accounted for 25% of the total advertising revenues. Companies such as Facebook are indeed well positioned to take advantage of cross-device environments due to their large amount of log-in data available. Criteo's value proposition is a marketing ecosystem composed of several tools designed to cover the entire consumer journey.This whole ecosystem is fueled by the Criteo engine, a technology capable of processing the data of 1.4 billion active consumers per month. The size and the power of this technology give them a competitive advantage over smaller market competitors because of the investments needed to replicate something similar to the Criteo's engine.Complete details about Criteo's computing power can be found in the below statement extracted from their 10-K report (2017):Criteo must also compete and develop an edge against much larger entities. To that end, they have for example implemented the Criteo Shopper's graph which is now a central element of their offering. It is based on three types of data (identity, interest, and measure) and powerful proprietary machine learning algorithms. With customers now shopping on multiple platforms, the development of Criteo Shopper's graph gives the French company a competitive advantage in the cross-device environment. It enabled them to match around 3.7 billion of users IDs across multiple digital devices. This is approximately the same number than Google and Facebook according to their clients' feedback.Over the years, the French company has been able to turn some of their enemies into ""allies."" They have contracted direct partnerships with high quality publishers such as Google, Yahoo, or eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). This enabled them to bid directly on their inventory without the need to go through Supply Side Platforms. As a result, Criteo is boosting the revenues of publishers and is ensured to buy quality inventory in a timelier manner.What I have described so far is that Criteo is a company deriving its revenue from an ecosystem of marketing products relying on data to be efficient. Their structure exhibits positive scaling effects thanks to the fact that each product is useful to the functioning of the others. Inversely, clients leaving Criteo will have a negative impact on these network effects.Historically, Criteo's retention rate has always been high. Criteo has computed this number each quarter over the last three years. Each time, the result was at least equal to 90%. This is partly justified by the performance paid model used by Criteo to charge its customers. In a cost per click model, Criteo is only paid when a shopper clicks on the ad they put online. Therefore, if the ad is not attractive enough, it will generate no revenue. We can assume that if the retention rate of clients stayed this high in the past years, that is because they were satisfied by Criteo's services. For that particular reason, this will be one of the key metrics to follow in the future.So far, Criteo has been successful with the task of convincing their clients to share their proprietary data. 79% of them have accepted and now benefit from the overall contribution of their ""community."" This approach is useful for the French company because it creates switching costs for their clients. They will be reluctant to stop working with Criteo if they lose the benefits of the community.Regarding other risks, it is also worth mentioning that except for their core product, Criteo Dynamic Retargeting, no product accounted for more than 10% of the firm's consolidated revenue last year. Moreover, Criteo's largest client has never accounted for more than 2% of their revenue over the last three years.Clients and revenuesIn spite of showing strong signs of seasonality in revenues, the bottom line is constantly growing since 2014. The EBITDA margin is now 10.64% and the company exhibits very little interest expenses due to their little use of long-term debt.Free cash flow and debtThe numbers mentioned above logically resulted in a positive free cash flow that is growing on a YoY basis. The amount of long term debt in the balance sheet is negligible. Criteo has already done strategic acquisitions in the past (the acquisition of HookLogic, which is now being commercialized under the name of Criteo Sponsored Products) and they now have the money to finance others. In a market where the capacity to adapt is the key to success, this is one of the most valuable asset.This is highlighted in the below extract of Criteo's last-quarter earnings call:R&D is essential to maintain Criteo technologic edge over its smaller competitors. Managers plan to spend increasing amounts in it but it will remain flat in terms of percentage of revenues. Hence, margins will be preserved and the bottom line will not be impacted. In my opinion, this means that the management is confident about the quality of their technological infrastructure. They would have invested more aggressively if they thought they were being outpaced by competitors.The company is currently priced at a P/E ratio of 17.38, which can be considered as excessively cheap especially when compared to Criteo's previous levels.Apple ITPsOn Sept. 19, 2017, Apple released its Intelligent Tracking prevention program (NYSEMKT:ITP) on its safari browser. This feature prevents Apple users to be tracked around the internet with their ""cookies"". The impact on Criteo's share price has been immediate, and the stock fell from $45.92 dollars (Sept. 11, 2017) to $22.49 (Dec. 18, 2017). That is partly because, according to Criteo's 10-K, this release had a negative impact of $1.0 million and $25 million on revenues ex-TAC for Q3 and Q4, respectively, but also because investors had to assess the likelihood of similar events occurring in the future.Since then, the stock price has not risen to its previous levels, even if Criteo managed to beat analysts' estimates by a fairly large amount (EPS was 30% higher than the expected amount). It's true that there were some one-off benefits for Q1 (i.e., Disposal of Hook Logic travel business for $1 million), but it's pretty clear that investors still fear other future bad news. As of today, the negative impact of Apple ITP feature is already reflected in management projection for 2018 and only new unplanned events will be able to harm Criteo's share price even more.GDPR regulationOn May 25th 2018 the GDPR regulation will take effect across the European Union. The biggest change compared to previous legislation is the increased territorial scope of GDPR. Indeed, this law applies to all companies processing data of European residents, regardless of the location of the company. On top of that, GDPR enforcement will be ensured by a new tiered system of fines with the maximum charged amount for the most serious infringements being set up to 4% of the global annual turnover of the fraudulent company.The implications of GDPR have been known for a long time and Criteo seems confident on its ability to comply with the law. According to them, they are ready for it and even think that it will be an opportunity for them to stand out from their U.S. counterparts. Their participation since 2008 within initiatives such as the ""Adchoice"" program shows their willingness to be proactive regarding new regulations. They enabled everyone to know exactly where Criteo was using their personal data and therefore they were in line with the ""Right to access"" requested by European regulators 10 years before the global application of the law.What to watch going forwardGoing forward, I think the consolidation of the advertising sector is the most important thing to keep an eye on. Spotting an interesting opportunity, some companies have indeed invested aggressively to gain market shares. On Nov. 10, 2016, Adobe Systems (ADBE) acquired TubeMogul for $540,000,000, becoming the first end to end independent data and ad solution that spans TV and digital formats. The release of Apple ITP has harmed every small company and spared the likes of Google and Facebook. The way I see it, the pace of acquisitions will only increase in the future and there will be little room for small players unless they managed to find a niche market or something else they are very good at.Criteo exhibits strong fundamentals and its current price is attractive for investors. Even if the legislation about data protection is bound to evolve significantly in the years to come, I believe that Criteo is well positioned to take advantage of these new regulations. In the short term, the French company should benefit from the growth of the digital advertising sector and this should have a positive impact on its financial statements. In my opinion, the ability of Criteo's to thrive in the long term will depend mostly on their capacity to scale their business model before it becomes too late.In such a fast-growing sector, companies that fail to adapt are the companies that will be left behind. Investors should therefore monitor closely the forthcoming changes in the sector and especially the moves of Criteo's competitors. Key indicators to watch for the French company going forward are the growth in revenues, the quantity of data collected and the revenue retention rate of clients. In my opinion, the latter is the most important and any significant drop could mean that they are about to lose their place in the competitive digital advertising world."

Year-over-year quarterly EPS growth is expected to be strong, with forecasts anticipating upwards of 20.8%, Revenues by the same measure also grew by 30.1%, and are an improvement of 5% on the previous quarter, whilst the broader trend for Criteo's revenue stream is consistently upwards. Furthermore, although quarterly EPS figures have been more volatile of late, forecasts suggest EPS growth over the next year of up to 80% and 229% by 2020. Combined with an average growth rate of 158%, a low forward P/E ratio of 18.64, based on yearly EPS forecasts of $2.27, an solid industry standard P/E ratio of 36.64, and a PEG Ratio of just 0.69, there seems to be plenty of value in CRTO.CRTO EPS Data + Forecasts, Annually + Quarterly. A Broad Rising Trend. Source: GuruFocusCriteo has a market capitalisation of $2.76bn, has posted a solid if not spectacular 16.23% return over the past year, and its current share price, whilst on the back of a steady downward trend, looks cheap given its P/E ratio and its product offering, and it has potential to significantly climb, due to its ""robust product set"" having the potential to expand its ""moat,"" according to some analysts.Criteo Growth Information, EPS, Sales, Income (Net). CRTO shows mostly positive growth, with Q/Q Net Income an Issue. Source: MSNLooking further at the company's financial data, it has a solid if not spectacular net cash ratio of 9.5%, suggesting some level of stability against risk, positive free-cash-flow (2.5%), and the relationship between its sales of over $2bn, and its low P/E ratio, suggests that maintaining earnings growth ought not prove an insurmountable task. On a very long-term metric, EPS growth over 10 years, Criteo's 115.7% is more than healthy. Criteo's earnings growth, as the 10-year figure suggests, is consistent. The last five years of Criteo's annual EPS came in as follows: $0.02, $0.03, $0.72, $0.92, $1.25. Forecasts of $2.27 support the probability that this steady growth trend will continue.Criteo's Client Retention and Revenue Growth Support the Financial Evidence in Favour of CRTO as a Growth Stock. Source: Seeking Alpha, CRTO Commerce Presentation.Despite plenty of positives, there do remain issues around Criteo. First of all, given Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) likely disabling of the use of third-party cookies, with Criteo's exposure to Apple's user-base making up 20% of its revenues, this has the potential to prove problematic. Yet, Criteo has already found a work-around, and although it has come in for some criticism, one would imagine the likelihood either to be that some compromise solution will be settled on, or for a game of tit-for-tat work-arounds to become the norm. Neither outcome ought to prove too disruptive once normalised.Competition is also an issue, given Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) marketplace dominance, but Criteo, as the company is unafraid to note, shows $550bn in online sales across its whole client base, whilst Amazon's come in at $300bn. Granted, this statistic is somewhat skewed, given the strength and economies of scale that having that $300bn under one roof gives Amazon, but it does show that Criteo has a strong share of the market. Criteo also competes with other advertisers in the same space, such as Adroll, though as this report on similartech.com notes, Criteo is far ahead of its rival in all market share segments.Ultimately, the real risk that Criteo faces surround Apple's Intelligent Tracking Prevention roll-out, which has seen some analysts, like those at KeyBanc Capital, cut their forecasts and downgrade CRTO. If you think CRTO is likely to push past such technology-solutions concerns, then the stock looks cheap, if not then steer clear.Criteo vs Adroll - Market Share Shows Criteo Dwarfs its Rival. Source: Similartech.comConclusionWhat marks Criteo out as interesting is its potentially low value, when compared to its strong position in the targeted advertising market. The company has launched a slew of products over the past year and is especially bullish about its new marketing engine that has broadened the variables its system applies, its user device graph that has been augmented with third-party data, which has helped Criteo's clients post increasing sales, and its new Direct Bidder tie-up with over 450 large publishers, which it hopes will increase monetization by up to 40%. Criteo is also boosting its involvement in video advertising and has added a number of new retail partners over the year, with around 1000 new clients on board. It will, moreover, be interesting to see client acquisition for Q3, given the company's 38% year-over-year client-base growth in Q2.Bullish Words from Criteo's Last Earnings Call: (Source: Seeking Alpha)A further positive comes from the fact that the French company has a focused global strategy, with North American, and Western European markets showing double-digit growth, and growth also occurring in Japan, and significant investment has been made in both China and India, in order to grow these markets' contribution to CRTO's revenue mix.Ultimately, if you think that Criteo can work around the present Apple dilemma, this company looks very much long a strong buy candidate. It has significant market exposure, plenty of growth potential, solid long-term growth, rising revenues, and a growing market, and an average price-target with a 32% upside. As with all investments, there are risks, and the technology sector can prove highly volatile, and there is prudence in waiting the few days until the next earnings call reveals how Criteo are dealing with the third quarter's Apple dilemma, and whether their growth trajectory continues. Guidance suggests revenues of $227m, and adjusted EBITDA of $69m, if CRTO beats these figures, and provides a satisfactory answer to its key technology problem, then there is an awful lot of upside to this French stock."
4235039,101801,2019-01-23T15:04:09-05:00,"Advertising software leader Criteo SA has lost ~50% of its market value since May 2017 on a couple of significant hiccups.With its founder back at the helm, the company is repositioning itself for future growth by expanding its solutions portfolio.The CEO bought over $500K in new shares late in November, and the company has announced a stock buyback program.We take an in-depth look at this global commerce marketing technology company in the paragraphs below.","Today, we look at an interesting concern based outside the United States. This global commerce marketing technology company is down substantially from recent highs. The shares have seen some insider buying of late, and the company put a stock buyback program in place recently as well.Criteo SA (NASDAQ:CRTO) is a Paris-based global commerce marketing technology company. It helps companies conducting e-commerce and brand manufacturers acquire, convert, and re-engage their customers, using shopping data, predictive technology, and large consumer reach. The company pioneered the cost-per-click digital marketing model in 2008 and currently has ~19,000 clients with campaigns in over 95 countries. Criteo was founded in 2005, and its American Depository Receipts went public in 2013 at $31 per share. It has a market cap of ~$1.6 billion and currently trades at $24.00 a share.The internet ecosystem consists of users (i.e. potential shoppers), content providers, and digital advertisers. Criteo's endgame is to maximize the experience for all three. The company's advertising platform collects data on consumer transactions - $760+ billion worth by most recent count - which is then run through its AI engine. For each user, product recommendations are made, which results in an internal advertiser auction. Criteo's engine generates ~600K real-time bids per second that optimize post-click sales for advertisers while optimizing revenue for the content providers. Once a bid is selected, which occurs ~40K per second, a targeted advertising banner is created. Users react by clicking on the banner, and more information is fed into Criteo's AI engine. Rinse and repeat. This header bidding technology is deployed to ~2,600 large publishers worldwide. According to IDC, Criteo is the number one provider of advertising software in the world, commanding 7.4% of the $12.7 billion global market in 2017.The company, until recently, had generated its revenue from four products (Dynamic Retargeting; Customer Acquisition; Audience Match; and Sponsored Products), all of which are priced on a cost per click basis with the ultimate goal of delivering post-click sales. Approximately 60% of the revenue is shared with the content provider with the balance accruing to Criteo. This is known as traffic acquisition costs (TAC). Management employs the non-GAAP metric of revenue ex-TAC as a basis for its other performance metrics.In April 2018, Founder and Chairman of the Board JB Rudelle returned to the role of CEO, replacing Eric Eichmann, after some significant headwinds arose in 2H17 - more on those issues shortly. Rudelle is repositioning Criteo for its next phase of growth as the internet advertising landscape has changed over the past three years.According to data provided by Nielsen, users now spend 50% of their internet time on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with the other half of the time dedicated (to what the Criteo euphemistically calls) the 'open internet'. However, Google and Facebook capture ~70% of the total ad spend. It is through this disconnect that Criteo sees opportunity.Source: Earnings SlidesPart of the issue for most retailers trying to drive traffic to their sites is all the buying done at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The data generated from this retail behemoth is highly valuable. In response, Criteo is pooling most of its retail partners' data in a platform called Criteo Shopper Graph, so they can better compete against Amazon. Criteo Shopper Graph is one of the world's largest and most open data sets focused on shoppers and a tool for clients to precisely track the effectiveness of their ad spends at no extra charge.Also, in response to its clients' changing needs, the company is expanding its suite of offerings to include awareness and consideration models. The goal of these portfolio additions is not necessarily converting clicks into sales but rather getting the user to visit the client's website for the first time or install its app. The advertiser pays for this service not on clicks but rather on impressions, known as the CPM (cost per one thousand impressions) model.Source: Earnings SlidesTo play catch up with others CPM modeled offerings, Criteo announced on August 3rd, 2018, that it had purchased Storetail Marketing Services, a retail media technology platform that enables retailers to monetize native placements on their e-commerce sites on a CPM basis, for $47.9 million.With the emergence and popularity of apps, Criteo purchased app in-store advertising solution provider Manage on October 29, 2018. This transaction will complement the company's already significant app conversion business and expands its client base as Manage is strong in the gaming, food delivery, and ride-sharing verticals, whereas Criteo is dominant in retail and travel. Terms were not disclosed other than that the company paid 5x's Manage's 2018E EBIDTA.Part of this transformation to a more flexible and modular platform was brought about by headwinds to and hiccups in Criteo's business over the past two years. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) launch of mobile operating system iOS11 featured ITP on its default Safari browser, preventing platforms like Criteo's from retargeting customers effectively. [Retargeting in laymen's terms: if you browsed a hair product website that you had never been on before, the cookie on that site follows you over to your social media platform instantly, where an ad has been placed to remind you of your interest in that product.] This was a significant disruption to the advertising ecosystem, considering ~15% of internet users choose Safari as their browser. Criteo thought it would solve this issue with a simple workaround. When it could not, it had to re-update the market of the potential revenue impact in mid-December 2017, resulting in a one-day 23% repricing of its stock.Another headwind was added by General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) implementation in the EU. Although not easily quantifiable, many think this regulation, which became enforceable on May 25, 2018, will challenge Criteo's first-party data collection practices. As an example of the potential minefields in these regulations, Google was recently charged with GDPR privacy violations by consumer groups in seven countries on November 27, 2018. If upheld, the complaints could mean a hefty fine for the search giant.In late 2017, Criteo was also accused by investment firm Gotham City Research and Harvard professor Ben Edelman of linking to and placing ads on publisher sites that have millions of non-human visits; thus overcharging advertisers.These negative events caused the shares of CRTO to crater from the mid-50s in 2Q17 to the low-to-mid 20s by YE17, leading to the return of Rudelle to CEO. Rudelle used the 2Q18 earnings release to lower guidance for the balance of the year, stating that the company's transition to a true multi-product platform was going to take time and internal reorganization, resulting in sub-double-digit growth until 2H19. Given that Criteo had grown revenue ex-TAC at a CAGR of ~41% since 2012, investors ran to the sidelines, tanking the stock 19% on August 1, 2018.An all-time low was realized in the shares in early September when Criteo's July removal from Facebook's partner list became known. A source of 9% of the company's revenue in 2015, it has now dropped to 3%. As a result of the social network's move, Criteo will not have access to beta testing new features on Facebook's platform. Although the stock dropped 16% intraday, this move shouldn't have a major impact on Criteo. From a technical perspective, Criteo's sync with Facebook has become less efficient versus other web properties, meaning that its supply agnostic platform is going to allocate less ads to Facebook versus other sources of inventory; thus, the decline in Facebook's contribution to Criteo's top line. Management indicated that it expects to shift to Facebook's standard application program interface.In other news, it recently came to light that the world's largest advertising group WPP (WPP) considered purchasing Criteo in early 2017 but walked away from discussions over a difference of opinion concerning Criteo's valuation. With its stock more than halved since those talks, there has been some speculation that Criteo may be back in play. However, it should be noted that WPP's long-time CEO Martin Sorrell has since left, and his replacement (Mark Read) has indicated that acquisitions are not part of WPP's growth strategy going forward. That doesn't necessarily mean there isn't interest in this space as AT&T (T) purchased online advertising platform provider AppNexus in June 2018. In addition, Criteo recently made it on to Aegis Capital's potential acquisitions in 2019 list.Criteo's 3Q18 results, released on October 31st, 2018, reflected a slowdown attributed to ITP, GDPR, and its repositioning. Adj. EPS decreased 18% to $0.53 on revenue ex-TAC of $223 million, reflecting a 2% decrease on a constant currency basis. Overall revenue was down 4% on a constant currency basis to $529 million, while Adj. EBITDA dropped 11% to $70 million.On the positive side of the ledger, revenue ex-TAC from its Customer Acquisition, Audience Match, Sponsored Products and Storetail products combined increased 82% year over year at constant currency, to over 7% of its total business. Customer retention remained at ~90%.Source: Earnings SlidesManagement guided 4Q18 revenue ex-TAC to $259 million and Adj. EBITDA to $89 million (based on range midpoints), reflecting 5% and 26% decreases over 4Q17, respectively. For FY18, this would translate into no revenue ex-TAC growth and a ~2% decline in Adj. EBITDA on a constant currency basis.Source: Earnings SlidesThe company declined to provide a 2019 outlook.As of September 30th, 2018, Criteo had $458.7 million of cash and no debt. The cash position will be reduced to reflect the Manage acquisition, the amount of which is still unknown. The company will be using $80 million to repurchase stock - an announcement it made concurrent to its earnings release.Analysts are in a wait-and-see mode with ten hold ratings doubling the number of buys (2) and outperforms (3) amongst prognosticators offering an opinion during 2018. Their median twelve-month price target is $29.25 per share. Yesterday, Berenberg Bank maintained its Buy rating but did lower its price target on Criteo from $42 to $40 a share.Founder and reinstated CEO Rudelle isn't waiting as he recently invested ~$515K into Criteo at $23.42 a share on November 29th.Although the company has not provided guidance for 2019, Criteo stock is trading at approximately 10x's 2019E Adj. EPS, with no debt, has nearly $7 per share in cash (minus the Manage consideration), and a share buyback program in place. From the perspective of a board of directors whose revenue ex-TAC has grown at a 41% CAGR since 2012, it is easy to see why it think its shares are cheap.Also, the stock has stopped going down on bad news - and the stock has a decent over the past three months - while Wall Street analysts (collectively) don't like it. If double-digit growth resumes in 2H19 under the stewardship of Rudelle, his recent purchase will look well-timed.I think Criteo is a best a 'watch item' until there is greater clarity that a turnaround is gaining traction. After all, the company has had myriad hiccups and has destroyed shareholder value in the past. Hopefully, that changes under new management. I am also encouraged that there are no balance sheet issues with this company especially, given how the credit markets behaved in the fourth quarter.Bret Jensen is the Founder and author of articles on The Biotech Forum, The Busted IPO Forum and The Insiders Forum."
4158886,104144,2018-03-26T12:33:11-04:00,"Criteo competes in the very competitive online advertising space, but this didn't prevent the company from making constant profits and being cash flow positive for the last 5 years.In the last 6 months, the stock price plummeted due to concerns about the implementation of Apple ITP, but Q4 results weren't affected.The outlook of the company looks positive, making it an attractive opportunity at the current price.","Facebook (FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) are the biggest players in the digital advertising space, but other players managed to find a nice niche for them and the most interesting one is Criteo (CRTO).In the digital advertising space, it is difficult to be just competitors, that's why Criteo established partnerships with all the main players:Source: Q4 earnings call slidesHow can Criteo be able to operate (and thrive) in this space with such powerful frenemies?That's what I would like to show in this article.Criteo bases its business model on retargeting. When you visit an e-commerce website, a tracking system (done mostly using cookies) will register your actions.Later you will see on other websites ads related to the purchase you recently made or the one you just dropped.In order to make the retargeting even more accurate, Criteo needs a big amount of high-quality data and an algorithm able to process them and transform them in relevant recommendation (and ads) for the users.Let's start from the first point: Criteo has 12 years of operational experience during which it collected different data, and only in 2017, they matched an estimated 1.2 billion individual users.That's not all: According to their 10-K, they have a ""flexible and scalable high-performance computing infrastructure, made of two Hadoop clusters hosting 76,000 processing cores with a total storage capacity of 240,000 terabytes and 530 terabytes of random-access memory. Every day, our platform can process 250 terabytes of additional compressed data. We own approximately 25,500 servers through a global network of eight data centers.""In a nutshell, Criteo has plenty of space to store users' data and the ability to process them.With the data part covered, we can move on to the algorithm that should get the best out of them, and this is Criteo's strongest point.Criteo is using multiple machine learning algorithms to tailor personalized ads and here ""machine learning"" is not just a buzzword.Currently, Criteo employs more than 700 engineers in R&D, an area where they are heavily investing while reducing the other less strategic expenses.Source: Q4 earnings call slidesMoreover, Criteo is on top of the game in another (usually underplayed) dimension: company culture and attractiveness for new potential employees.Software engineers are more in demand, and a key challenge for the tech companies is being able to attract and retain smart people.That's not an easy feature, especially when you compete against all the FAANG and a lot of nimble (and sexy) start-ups.One reliable indicator to see if a company is appreciated by its employee is checking Glassdoor, and Criteo has stellar reviews, with an average of 4.3 out of 5.Criteo's HR is aware that the competition is fierce, and in this interview with Olivier Giovanni, HR business partner for product and R&D global functions, we can see some of their strategies, such as recruiting people outside of Silicon Valley and having strong relationships with local tech universities (especially in France).As a cherry on the top, Criteo gives the chance to its employees to spend 10% of their time working on side projects focused on digital advertising (a different twist than Google's ""20% policy"" which has a broader scope).Before 2017, Criteo's main products were Criteo Dynamic Retargeting and Criteo Sponsored Products. The first one targets users who have already expressed a shopping intent, while the second one targets users searching for a specific product and they haven't made any purchase action.But now Criteo wants to cover all of the customer's journey.That's why they launched two new products, Criteo Customer Acquisition and Criteo Audience Match, which focus respectively on acquiring new customers and on retargeting effectively existing customers.Source: Q4 earnings call slidesEven when adding new products, Criteo's focus remains intact: driving post-click sales.Moreover, the sector where Criteo operates is growing.According to eMarketer: ""Digital marketers spent $185 billion on Paid Search Advertising and Display Advertising combined in 2017, with this combined spend, defined as Digital Marketing, expected to grow at a 10.3% CAGR to $249 billion in 2020. Display Advertising involves placing images, video or advertisements that incorporate animation, sound and/or interactivity, alongside website and mobile application content. According to eMarketer, Display Advertising, including on social media, represented 52% of the Digital Marketing market, or $97 billion in 2017, and is projected to grow at a 12.2% CAGR to $137 billion in 2020.""Criteo has been growing significantly in the last year. Their clients' base more than doubled in 3 years, and they managed to do so while keeping a 90% retention rate.Source: Q4 earnings call slidesThe retention rate is unlikely to drop anytime soon, because of the payment model Criteo uses. They charge only when users engage with an advertisement, usually by clicking on it (pay-per-click) instead of paying per impression (just how many times the ad is displayed).This is a double win: Criteo gets better data, and the clients pay only for the users who really engaged with their message.Adding more clients translated into more revenues in 2017: at 277 million, a +20% compared to 2016, and more earnings with a +36% on Adjusted EBITDA.Source: Q4 earnings call slidesIt's not only about revenues and earnings. Criteo had a positive operational cash flow in the last 5 years, and the free cash flow followed the trend accordingly.Source: MorningstarLast but not least, Criteo has basically no debt. That's an ideal situation that will give the management plenty of room for action in case the conditions in the online marketing space should change for the worse.Source: SimplyWall.StIf Criteo is so good and the outlook for the sector is so optimistic, how is it possible that the price dropped significantly during the last year?Source: Google FinanceThe main reason was the implementation of the Intelligent Tracking Prevention (""ITP"") from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on its Safari Browser.The ITP is a feature of the Safari browser added in September 2017, which blocks some third-party cookies by default on mobile and desktop and therefore makes it more difficult for providers like Criteo to access data about Safari users.Although this looks like a serious issue (especially considering that most of the advertising revenues are coming from mobile devices and Safari users are 35% of the total), so far it has not been a problem.The ITP does not block ads, it simply prevents websites from being able to track users' browsing habits without their permission. So, as long as a user clicks on a consent form to access a specific site, he will give his permission to be tracked, and I don't think people will stop browsing their favorite websites because of it.As a second thing, ITP blocks third-party cookies, preventing them to track users' behavior. So, Criteo decided to implement a workaround: a ""privacy-friendly solution, which is reliant on a [non-cookie] identifier that allows the transfer of information between websites and our servers"" (words from Eric Eichmann, CEO of Criteo).So far, this solution has worked.If it should stop doing so in the future, there is a good chance that Criteo will come up with something else, considering their strong investments in R&D and skilled software engineers.There are few challenges that can make Criteo to suffer in the next months.The first one is the negative impact of the recent scandal of Cambridge Analityca harvesting Facebook data. Even if selling and utilizing data of users is what makes the internet free of charge, now people are becoming more and more conscious of this issue and can ask for more protective laws to keep their data safe, undermining Criteo's business model.In this regard, it will be interesting to see the impact of the implementation in the EU of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), due in May 2018.The GDPR is a regulation that requires businesses to protect the personal data and the privacy of EU citizens during transactions that occur within EU member states.According to this new EU law, companies must provide a “reasonable” level of protection for personal data, but it does not define what constitutes “reasonable.”Moreover, these are the most sensitive data that will be protected:(Source: CSO)As you can see, the only cluster of data that could be monetized is the location, while all the rest is something of little or no value for marketers.Moreover, Criteo is fully aware of GDPR and its implications.In this article on their own website, Criteo explained in detail which measures they took to be compliant.The last potential issue is the usage of adblocking devices on laptop and mobile devices.Before starting my analysis, this was the point, which was worrying me the most. If there is a chance to get an internet ad-free version for free, why not go for it?Turns out that I was wrong on this one.As highlighted in this interesting report, the current ad-blockers for mobile are not working very well: they can block ads on the browser, but not on installed apps. Moreover, half of the users are not even aware that they can install one on their phone.It's true that there are some browsers with ad-blockers embedded, but people are creatures of habit and so far they stuck with the solutions they already use (Safari and Chrome).That's not all. When it comes to the current usage, around 80% of the people over 35 (the ones who have the biggest spending capability) don't use it, so there is a high chance that they will still be affected by ads.Source: inside.globalwebindex.netFrom this analysis, it looks like Criteo was heavily oversold on the news of ITP implementation, and the results of Q4 and the outlook should justify a higher price.The guidance provided during the last call is positive: According to Criteo's CFO ""We expect Q1, 2018 revenue ex-TAC to be between $230 million and $235 million. This implies constant currency growth of 3% to 5%. We assume that year-over-year Forex Exchanges will have a positive impact of approximately 640 basis points as the reported growth in Q1. And we expect Q1, 2018 adjusted EBITDA to be between $60 million and $65 million.On full year 2018, we expect revenue ex-TAC to grow between 3% and 8% at constant currency. We assume that Forex exchanges we will have a positive impact of approximately 120 basis points on our reported growth for 2018. And we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin for 2018 to be between 28% and 30% of revenue ex-TAC.""Considering all of this, I agree with KeyBank's recommendation, which updated Criteo's target price at 50, a 57% upside from the level at the time of writing."
4132104,103437,2017-12-15T11:32:04-05:00,Criteo dropped heavily on announcing the impact of the iOS update would be worse than initially feared.However the shares have dropped much more than the guidance for C2018.The drop provides an excellent buying opportunity if you can stomach the high risk profile.,"Sometimes things are bad, and sometimes they get worse. Criteo (CRTO) knows this first hand this year after learning that the update for Apple iOS 11.2 would interfere with their advertising solution for Apple's safari browser. Apple's intelligent tracking prevention (NYSEMKT:ITP) will cause cookies to be deleted after 24 hours hurting the ability of CRTO to collect and utilize data. This data is the backbone for the business, using it to create an ecosystem of data for advertising for brands and retailers. They predicted this change would cause a 9%-13% negative reduction for in revenue for 2018, however on December 14th they announced the reduction would be much worse. The now 22% impact to revenue has caused an overdone selloff, with shares down between 25 and 30% in wake of the news. Small-cap stocks often have downswings like this, and excellent management is a key to these speed bumps. Is Criteo a buy even after such a staggering selloff, or should you avoid the stock for greener pastures and safer returns? The stock will continue to be attacked by shorts and those who find the business model troubling regarding advertising quality online. However this negatively already has been baked into the stock price over the past year and is not relevant to the rest of the change in revenues. Criteo has continued to add transparency to their business with the rest of the industry and it will help clients' trust over time. Next I will dive into some of the fundamentals and why I believe Criteo is a buy at these depressed levels. When looking at a company that has been beaten down like CRTO has over the past six months you want to look at the positives first. The chart above highlights a few of those things that lead you to believe a rebound is possible. For example Criteo is actually increasing revenue per customer, which seems to hurt some of the bear cases around the stock. Add in the 90% retention rate that has been seen for five years and its hard to see the company falling apart, rather than just slowing its growth trajectory. CRTO has large traffic acquisition costs or ""TAC"" in order to attain the revenue. Excluding TAC, CRTO has managed an impressive growth rate of 32% year over year. In Q3 2017, ex-TAC revenue was $234,397, besting the $176,557 of 2016. This growth is both the third quarter as well as in the year to date, showing growth has not slowed thus far. In November, CRTO guided to a 32% adjusted EBITDA rate for the year. This updated guidance will likely mean a decrease in that number for the next year, but the company will stay solidly profitable. The likely scenario is EBITDA growing in the low single digits percentage in 2018. If it is able to maintain that positive number without a large benefit of Apple users, it should rebound sharply with a positive solution. Part of the weakness is attributed to the uncertainly regarding full-year guidance, but the share price is assuming the worst. The key to their product is the Criteo Shopper Graph, providing granular data on shopping habits across a number of platforms and mediums. CEO Eric Eichmann touts the technology by saying ""Our Commerce Marketing Ecosystem resonates well with Chief Marketing Officers worldwide. A Forbes Insights study recently found that 71% of retailers are willing to contribute data to a pool. This provides them with the opportunity to level the playing field with the largest commerce players when it comes to online data, technology, and scale."" Companies that make the lives of other business easier on such a large scale have immense value to the business community. In the end if making a change saves your company money or adds to the bottom line you will make those changes. Long term the data-driven solutions of companies like Criteo or The Trade Desk (TTD) will mean better targeted marketing and happier customers. The technological excellence of Criteo should allow a solution to the ITP issue to form in 2018 allowing for a regain of any lost share. While I do not believe the quality of the advertising provided by Criteo compares to Facebook (FB) or TTD the price you pay for the revenue growth is extremely low here. Outside of business specific issues, you do have to consider some other issues going forward.One of the downsides going forward is a continuing rotation from the big winners of 2017 into the laggards. Energy, retail and financials are all seeing strong new inflows over the past month. Stocks like CRTO with high growth but warts are often the first to get sold instead of blue chips like the FANG stocks. Keep in mind that the tax rate change should not impact CRTO very positively as they have a large portion of revenue, and especially growth, outside of the United States. Criteo had a tax rate of 27.5% in 2016, with it continuing to decrease to the mid 20s this year. Many of the largest moves lately are moving to the companies with moderate growth and favorable tax rates. They will get a larger boost in EPS next year once the tax plan gets ratified and signed. However at the current share price we should expect a solid rebound in the first half of 2018 for the shares as you will see below. Many of these issues are sector based, with lots of information technology shares under pressure for the same reasons. However, it has given an even better entry point for a name such as this with a medium term headwind.The chart above on CRTO shows a bounce is very likely over the coming weeks. Technically the stock is beaten down, but with the growth from the remainder of the business it should be able to rebound from this level. Trading at 8.5 EV/EBITDA the stock has been unfairly punished for what is essentially a 10-11% decline in revenue with a 25-30% drop in share price. Also the company could still post an increase in adjusted EBITDA in 2018, extremely impressive considering its multiple. When a growth stock slows its revenue growth this quickly many investors jump ship, but the change to programmatic marketing and data driven technology is accelerating. With an impressive 17,000 retail and brand clients and 90% customer retention, I expect this recent selloff and technical issue with iOS to be rectified in time. While this will substantially hurt the growth prospects for 2018, and potentially customer retention, the company will be able to mitigate this throughout the year and minimize the impact. Once they do, their ecosystem of products will continue to gain traction as digital data becomes even more important to selling products offline as well."
4073911,21815,2017-05-16T20:56:31-04:00,"Criteo is one of those stocks you buy and then can almost forget about.Since going public, the company has managed to exceed Revenue ex-TAC and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 14 consecutive quarters.We see little in the way of clouds on the horizon, at least for now.","Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO) is the French innovative advertising technology company or performance marketing company (as it prefers) we first introduced early January. The share price has performed pretty well since then, up by a good 20% since. This article tries to find out whether more gains are in store.Criteo published Q1 figures that were quite well received. Some highlights (from the company PR and Q1CC):Top line growth is still very good, but net income decreased considerably, although it still beat expectations by 3 cents. The reason for that is mostly the acquisition of HookLogic (a one-time equity grant, a $3.9 million intangible depreciation expense relating to the HookLogic acquisition).If one excludes the non-cash accounting effects of the HookLogic acquisition, net income would have increased 15% to $21 million, so these HookLogic-related effects caused a one-time $6 million negative for earnings.That's not all, though. Some expense categories are growing faster than underlying ex-TAC revenue growth:While the increases in cash flow from operations and free cash flow look really impressive, we wouldn't pay too much attention to them, as they contain specific and volatile items (like a decrease/increase in trade receivables and trade payables, see the 10-Q).The increase in operating expenses was driven in large part ($18 million) to the introduction of Sponsored Products, much of which is non-cash and one-off.GuidanceA little introThe essence of what Criteo does in big lines isn't hard to understand (even if how it does it is much harder, and much of that isn't explicit). The company offers technologies that enable people-centric, data-driven advertising which is tied to performance metrics. This is, of course, the general direction in which advertising moves anyway.Collecting as much information about people so that they can be targeted ever more precisely and keeping track of what ads drive sales. For the latter, Criteo's $20 million acquisition of HookLogic provided additional technology (and clients).Much of Criteo's competitive advantage is based on the engine, which is simply a set of algorithms to handle the full chain, from collecting the data to serving the ad in real time and predicting the right value for an ad.The engine went from click optimization to conversion rate optimization, and it's now moving towards being a value optimizer. The algorithm that drives these are constantly improved by machine learning and ever-increasing data. Here is roughly how it works (from the company's Investor Day presentation):It all depends on massive amounts of data. The company has access to half a trillion (by mid last year) of purchases on its client websites. Then there is the data from publishers that ads are served on.By the middle of last year, it had a stack of 102 terabytes and 31,500 processing cores, the largest Hadoop cluster in Europe. And there's 26 terabytes of additional data. The company has 600 terabytes of data about shopping intent on 4 billion products (also by mid last year). The Criteo engine, driven by machine learning, is able to translate that data into ads that people click on and then purchase from.This hardly begins to tell what the company does and how it does it. Besides, it does many more things, like the cross-device graph where it integrates data from different devices (a real problem for marketing, as 40% of transactions are across devices, which are much harder to track, but Criteo has come up with some innovative solutions here).InnovationThe R&D really is the heart of the competitive advantage of Criteo. The company spends 16% of non-TAC revenue on R&D, which has a headcount of over 600. Just in the first half of 2016, it ran 190,000 tests to optimize the engine, and the amount of testing is increasing rapidly.The amount of innovation that is going on at the platform is quite impressive. This is a company that doesn't sit still by any means. For anyone that wants to do a deep dive, the Investor Day presentations are probably a good place to start.For the purpose of this article, we don't really need to go into all the technical details of the different technologies. Suffice to say that these are still evolving. Some recent innovations and improvements are as follows:The Criteo User Graph matches data from the mapping of user identities across multiple digital devices and leveraging anonymized CRM data provided by advertisers (which a whopping 76% of customers share with Criteo, per Q1CC). The company was the first to create an Apple-compliant solution to be able to track information about users on Apple devices.Predictive Search (from Criteo PR):See here for a description of this solution.Sponsored products (from Criteo):One has factor in that Sponsored Products is highly seasonal, but it's expected to increase revenues ex-TAC by mid-single digits this year (even if it has a slight negative impact on EBITDA as a result of introduction cost), so it's far from an inconsequential product.Criteo initially experienced some headwinds with header bidding (see here for an explanation and alternative solutions), but after testing it with some 100 clients this is turning around, and management argued it could become a significant tailwind for the company.It is also opening up new marketing channels like email, search, video and offline. This stuff is only really for illustrative purposes, as the heart of what the company does and on what its competitive advantage rests is rather complicated. Much of it isn't explicit - these are trade secrets like the algorithm driving the engine.Even more complicated is to compare the Criteo engine to those of competitors. But basically, we don't have to know what's in ""the box"" as long as that box keeps performing, and that performance is visible in the financial results.There are a couple of other metrics that the company shows to demonstrate its growth potential (from the 2016 Investor Day transcript):So far, Criteo seems to have a point. The company has exceeded Revenue ex-TAC and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 14 consecutive quarters since it was listed.Drivers of growthApart from the innovations mentioned above, the following points were nicely summarized by the CEO on the Investor Day last year:On average, Criteo drives between 8% and 9% of the sales of its clients. The company believes it can get that up to 10% with further optimization of the engine and data pooling.In Search, management believes that the company can capture between 10% and 20% of the ad spend by clients, a $6 billion market opportunity. Acquisition marketing is another $9 billion market opportunity. Management believes it is confronted with a total of $25 billion in new market opportunities (ex-TAC).Now, before you get excited and press the buy button, this is loosely equivalent to a total addressable market, and there is no guarantee that the company will capture all or even a major part of it. What it does show is that Criteo still has plenty of opportunity to grow, and as commerce increasingly moves online, the market and the opportunity themselves are growing.RisksWith the ongoing expansion, a 90% retention rate and the settlement with Steelhouse, we think the short thesis discussed in our previous article, where a competitor accused Criteo of click fraud, is now well and truly behind us.Given the growth rate, it's not obvious that performance receives much hindrance from adblockers either, although it remains to be seen what the new version of Google's web browser (which has an inbuilt adblocker) will do.While the technology is inherently creepy, as it is based on collecting as much information about people as possible, Criteo has solid privacy policies in place:ValuationAnalyst, on average, expect an EPS of $2.45 this year, rising to $3.09 in 2018, but these estimates have come down a bit after the Q1 results. On this basis, the shares are not overly expensive, given the growth and a solid balance sheet ($302.7 million in cash and just $2.61 million in debt).ConclusionWhile the shares aren't cheap (though they are lower these days), we think they are still a buy. The company has a proven track record of solid growth over all its important metrics, and there are still plenty of opportunities for improvement and further growth left."

Nothing of the sort has happened and the shares are curiously cheap.The company has long ceased to be a simple ad engine, but has added sophisticated products, like Criteo Shopper Graph, which consists of:Then there is Sponsored Products and Customer Acquisitions. Here is not the place to explain all this (we refer you to the links), but it's clear that the company has built a sophisticated platform.Growth has been good and fairly smooth, also from an operating point of view:CRTO Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsAnd the number of clients:The addition of new clients slowed in Q1, but management argues this is a transitory phenomenon (see below).There was a really considerable (30%) earnings beat of $0.14 to produce an EPS of $0.60, and revenues also exceeded expectations by $7.3M (3%).There where a number of one-off benefits though:However, even after leaving out some of these (Q1CC):In the coming quarters, the company is focusing on the following items:Guidance for Q2 is fairly soft, although this is seasonally the weakest quarter. Here is the guidance from the earnings PR:Despite expected softness in Q2, the full-year guidance has actually been maintained. And there are some special situations in Q2 that produce the uncertainty:Both of these will be discussed below.The company is going to focus more on large and mid-market clients while developing a fully scalable self-service platform to manage smaller mid-market clients in a more efficient way. When the latter rollout is complete, the company expects a re-acceleration of new client additions. In the meantime, this will remain somewhat subdued.We have the implementation of the new EU data privacy law, the GDPR, at the end of this month.Management argues that some publishers could resort to very interruptive, hard obtained things, where you cannot do anything before obtaining their consent. This could impact the browser experience and create some friction that might affect results, which is one of the reasons for the relatively soft Q2 guidance.Management believes that this won't be universal, and their own suggested solution (consent portability) would constitute an easy transition (Q1CC):They are working closely with the French regulators and are optimistic that this is in the spirit of the law.Management also argues that the company has been in the forefront of data protection from the start, and that these changes also offer a bit of an opportunity for them (Q1CC):So the soft guidance for Q2 could simply be caution, as visibility is temporarily obscured because of the changes in regulation and the uncertainty about the reaction of publishers.It might seem a little curious to see a heading Amazon (AMZN) here, but that Swiss pocket knife of a company is also making big inroads into the ad market. How much of a threat is that, an analyst wanted to know during the CC. Management explains (Q1CC):But management argues they are doing the same thing with their Sponsored Products (Q1CC)More in general, they're up against the big walled gardens of not only Amazon, but of course of Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (FB). Here is management (Q1CC):So every disadvantage seems to have its advantage as well.The sudden reappearance of former CEO JB Rudelle at the helm of the company (he already was Chairman of the board) created a bit of a panic on the markets, as it wasn't very well communicated at the time and, we have to say, the CC didn't really provide much additional color.What management said was that they felt that the company wasn't always moving fast enough; they want a more entrepreneurial mindset. Here is JB Rudelle on the Q1CC:So it looks like they want to be a bit more proactive and the former CEO fell asleep a little behind the wheel, or something like that. Given that the stock price hasn't recovered from the $5 selloff that followed this surprise, we have some ways to go as we don't think it's a negative, unless there are things they're not telling us.Margin development isn't really a cause for concern:CRTO Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsManagement commented (Q1CC):So this looks like a temporary boost and things will get back to normal.CRTO Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsIf you look at the chart above, then the stock price chart does make very little sense. And it gets better:CRTO Cash and Equivalents (Quarterly) data by YChartsYes, the company has nearly half a billion dollars in cash, and no debt. This is almost a third of their market cap. Yes, there is a bit of dilution, but this isn't terribly dramatic.Do they create the cash flow with the help of copious amounts of stock-based compensation? Well:CRTO Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsIt's certainly not negligible, $75M out of $179M in free cash flow for the past 12 months. But it's a tiny fraction of revenue ($2.3B), so it isn't excessive by any means.CRTO PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsQuite frankly, these shares are dirt cheap. The shares sell at an almost unfathomable 0.5 times sales, and that's a backward looking figure.This year analysts expect an EPS of $2.27 rising to $2.65 in 2019. With almost a third of the market cap in cash, and strong cash generation, these multiples are way too low, in our view.We are at a loss to explain why the shares of Criteo trade at such low multiples. This isn't an imploding business, but it's valued as one. In fact, it's a business that generates lots of free cash flow, the gold standard in investing."
4036697,21815,2017-01-13T11:32:51-05:00,"This company has built an impressive online advertisement engine which works differently than many others.It's actually the leader in performance-based ads. Recent innovations and acquisitions offer good ways to leverage its already leading position.Despite impressive financial performance, its shares are still below the all-time highs set a year and a half ago.There are some risks investors should consider though.","Many people will be familiar with the uncanny experience of ads seemingly following you around on the Internet. You've looked up available spaces in London on Airbnb (AIRB), and before you know it, Airbnb ads suggesting spaces in London follow you around like puppies.There is a good chance the technology behind these ads is driven by the leader in so-called performance-based ads, Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO). The practice we just described is known as re-targeting, and Criteo has one of the best engines to produce these ads.This is based on having large amount of data (basically it's 'big data' mining in real-time), allowing the company to personalize ads ever more precisely. To some extent, the engine also has a bit of an increasing returns model baked in. The better it performs, the more customers it wins, the more data it will gain.The revenue development of the company reflects this; these have been increasing rather steeply (even if profits haven't always kept pace, due to a strong dollar for instance).Criteo is also different from other online ad technologies as its business model is basically based on arbitraging between CTR ('click-through rate') and CPM ('cost per thousand'). Basically, Criteo purchases ad spaces on the basis of impressions (CPM), and sells these on the bases of clicks (CTR).We will come back to this below, as this potentially opens up the company to artificially boost clicks (and indeed it has been accused of just that).Some figuresWe've already seen the impressive increase in revenues in the last couple of years. Third quarter figures were also pretty good:And there are still plenty of growth opportunities to chase for the company, like:In short, the company is increasingly improving its platform, expanding it to new segments and verticals, and new geographical locations. There is plenty left in the tank and the opportunities for leverage are considerable.Their track record should give some room for comfort. Since Q4 2015, the company has consistently beat earnings, at times by a wide margin. It's the 12th consecutive quarter that the company exceeded revenue ex-TAC and adjusted EBITDA guidance (per Q3CC).So it's perhaps somewhat surprising that a company which produces such consistently good results, enjoying a strong balance sheet and what seems like a considerable moat, hasn't seen more of this reflected in the share price.There are actually some reasons for this relative underperformance.ThreatsOne problem the company can run into is concerns about privacy. The EU is consistently at the forefront of this, for instance on January 10, another measure was announced (from The Techportal):While this particular measure could actually hobble some of Criteo's competitors, so it could work out as a net benefit. But there are parts of the proposed measure that could bite:Another threat is the increasing use of ad blockers. Even Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has allowed ad blocking apps on its store. One could argue that Criteo doesn't get much traffic from iOS devices or that ad blockers reinforce its competitive position because their ads are more targeted and hence less irritating, but we still think it's a fairly serious threat.The most serious one is perhaps clickfraud. As we explained above, Criteo's business model (arbitrage between CTR and CPM) makes it more susceptive to this than other online ad technologies.Indeed, in a blistering attack, SA Pro contributor The Friendly Bear has argued just that. This is based on the settlement with competitor Steelhouse. Initially, Criteo accused Steelhouse of stealing its customers. But Steelhouse countersued, accusing Criteo of clickfraud.The Friendly Bear argues that the settlement reveals a weakness, but it's possible to interpret this differently, as a way to avoid the legal discovery process, which might reveal some of the sources of its competitive advantage.Without getting into the intricate technicalities of the Friendly Bear article, there are some more sources offering a modicum of reassurance:ConclusionThe company has established itself as one of the bigger ad platforms on the internet. It's high growth and solid financials don't seem to be entirely discounted in the share price, which is still some way off of its high set in the summer of 2015.We think there is room to run, but one cannot close one's eyes entirely from the risks we mentioned. Another thing is that the shares have rallied quite a bit (30%+) from the lows in October; one could wait a little for a better entry point."
4010452,101471,2016-10-05T18:31:28-04:00,Criteo has not done badly this previous quarter.But online ads as we see now have a bleak future.Will Criteo (and other similar small players) survive?,"Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO) is a Paris-based junior competitor of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the online ad delivery space. Its business model is to deliver targeted ads to mobile and desktop users through websites and dedicated apps. In its latest quarter for which data is available, it had a 36% increase in gross revenue and other various positive figures. See below:However, all is not well with Criteo or with the entire online ad delivery business. First, Criteo had a partnership with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) whereby it delivered ads to its clients via a Facebook ad exchange platform called FBX, which delivered ads to non-Facebook websites. Facebook is now shutting down FBX in order to deliver higher quality ads that provide a better return on investment. Criteo stock suffered on the news.However, this really isn't a big deal in itself because the FBX platform was only PC-based, didn't support video ads, and PC accounted for only 18% of Q1 ad revenue for Facebook. The reason it is an indicator of the real big deal is that globally there's a silent but strong movement going on against unwanted, lower quality ads. This has been going on for years, but a change is slowly coming, and only those that adapt will survive. The rest, well, they will perish like a bunch of blocked ads that nobody likes.Ad blocking impact windowThere are three major developments to ad blocking - one, Google's Chrome browser which is supposed to be the ""top facilitator of ad-blocking software."" Two, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS 9, launched last year, which makes it easier for mobile users to download and install ad blocking software/extension, and three, popular ad-blocking software like Ad-Blocker's tremendous growth.According to a research analyst covering CRTO, ""ad blocking may someday be an issue, but... it will likely be some time before investors see any impact to Criteo's income statement."" Criteo and others are saying that, well, yes, there's ad blocking, but it isn't having a huge impact on our bottom line. That's because only a very small percentage of Internet users ever install ad-blocking software. The small percentage that do are not the real targets of online ads anyway. The following quote from the Guardian is so relevant I would present it verbatim:This ties in with what the research analyst quoted above said, that ad blocking may someday be an issue, but it isn't, right now. So when will ad blocking become an issue? That is the critical question. The answer lies in the Guardian quote above. If more young people are using ad blocking today, it isn't likely that they will stop using ad blocking as they grow older. In fact it is more likely that they will continue to use ad blocking in larger percentages as they grow older and enter the income group ""worth more to advertisers."" That gives us a 15-20 year window for the survival of the online ad business.Before that sets investor worries to rest, let's also understand that the baby boomer generation takes a little longer to adapt to new technology. That doesn't mean they don't hate off-topic, irrelevant online ads as much as youngsters. Mac users, remember Mackeeper? Who doesn't hate an invasive ad like that? It is just that the older generation takes a little longer to find a solution. But I am sure it will be much, much less than 15 years before ad blocking will become an industry killer for the online ads business.Creating entry barriersSo, why is Google, over 90% of whose revenue comes from online ads, helping users block ads through its Chrome browser? Why is Apple, which certainly doesn't make negligible amounts of money from advertising in its ecosphere, enabling ad blocking through iOS 9? Why is Facebook concentrating on improving ad quality, shutting down a revenue-generating platform?I think the big boys are trying to create a rule-based barrier to online advertising, which will make it difficult for smaller players like CRTO and others to sustain themselves. The rule here is simple - create higher quality ads that do not annoy users but actually help them, or perish. And this isn't just about desktops - the same Guardian article quoted above is titled - ""Ad blocking almost as popular on mobile devices as desktops.""I have an example for a really targeted, high-quality ad that I actually find beneficial. I use Airbnb, the homestay platform, whenever I am visiting countries outside the UK. When you find a place you are interested in, and scroll all the way down, reading its description, there's a set of 3-4 very targeted ads, which show me similar places, in my price range, in the locality I am searching. I often select one of these instead of the one I originally found. They are so useful.However, if I am not planning travel, in the middle of work, no amount of invasive ads will/should distract me from whatever I am doing online.This is the barrier these big businesses are trying to build. It is easier for them to do so, because, having huge financial strength, they can afford to dictate to ad clients just what sort of ads they will allow. This, for smaller folks, becomes a little difficult.Therein lies the worry for players like CRTO. They are small players compared to Google or Facebook, and ad blocking will hurt them.Escape HatchAny ad blocking software will allow users to unblock specific websites. Take a website like Seeking Alpha, which provides useful content that many people just need to visit this site. Seeking Alpha serves up targeted ads, but if I block the ads, and the site doesn't load (this can happen, I was reading about this in the comments section of an earlier article on CRTO), then, since the site is very useful to me, I will probably not mind the ads.That's one way to escape the ad block barrier to become immune to ad-blocking.The other way is to target ad-block immune products like advertising within apps, and innate advertising, meaning where the ad looks very similar to the content. The first one works really well and its logic is similar to the one about Seeking Alpha. The app is so useful that I don't mind the ads. And also important, the ads are not annoying enough that I would upgrade and go ad-free.Innate advertising limits the quality of your ads, and a fine balance has to be struck between content differentiation and content relevance. Consider how Motley Fool or Forbes, or nowadays, Yahoo Finance, innate advertising works. Their ads are literally hidden within the content. I for one hardly ever click them because I find it a little ""fraudulent"" to hide something like that seamlessly within content.ConclusionGiven what I just discussed here, it seems to me likely that within a small time frame - I would guess at less than five years, probably three years - the bottom line of companies like CRTO would be impacted by various sorts of ad-blocking. If their ads don't display, they don't get paid. They may adapt, charging higher for higher quality ads, getting more ROI. But there's no doubt in my mind that the online ad space will see a constriction soon, and I wouldn't hold stocks of these small players too long unless they tell me how they plan to adapt to the new scenario."
4027176,83086,2016-11-30T11:00:00-05:00,"We analyzed metacode relating to Criteo and found massive red flags including Criteo’s undisclosed relationship with a notorious adware company and Criteo’s ads on numerous shady websites with suspicious traffic.We join a chorus of skeptics, including vocal Criteo critic and Harvard Business School Professor Benjamin Edelman, who have publicly questioned the veracity of Criteo’s “return on ad spend"" metrics.Our analysis raises real questions about Criteo's metrics – i.e., placing ad on a shady website that derives traffic from porn, inconceivable margin profile, nefarious adware injections, etc.Criteo’s decision to settle with Steelhouse (represented by Latham & Watkins) prior to discovery is particularly worrisome because Criteo initiated the action and our analysis appears to corroborate Steelhouse’s claims.We believe advertisers are potentially wasting vast sums of money on Criteo and could pull back spend with limited sales impact, potentially invalidating Criteo's entire business model, or 'raison d'être'.","In the early 2000s, a group of enterprising masters of the universe implemented complicated and opaque trading strategies in order to make a market for electricity in California. This group dazzled Wall Street investors with financial wizardry and sky-high returns on capital, somehow able to print money out of thin air by adeptly navigating the complicated world of electricity trading in never before seen ways.The company saw its market capitalization swell to as much as $70 billion as investors flocked to take part in what felt like an energy trading revolution. The entire time, the group's trading strategies remained a black box, impenetrable from the outside and impossible to understand. And in our experience, when black box ""trading strategies"" seem too good to be true, they always are.The scheme, of course, was Enron. And according to the New York Times, a key piece of Enron's many wrongdoings was that it deceived California into buying power it did not need. The company's trading ""strategies"" were able to exploit weaknesses in California's energy markets through multiple avenues, filling Enron's coffers, while leaving Californians with rolling brown outs and tax payer losses.In many ways, we see significant similarities between the ad tech industry today and the energy trading markets of the Enron-era. The ad tech industry has similarly dazzled Wall Street investors - just look at the number of ad tech companies that have gone public in the past few years. The IPO prospectuses have been filled with dizzying jargon and buzz words that leave investors with very little true understanding of underlying business models.Like Enron in the case of California power, the ad tech industry as a whole has tricked unsuspecting advertisers into buying ads they don't need - specifically, because the ad tech industry has ""looked the other way"" while fraudulent web traffic pads their bottom lines. At the end of the day, all traffic is good traffic for the ad tech industry, regardless of source.According to industry estimates, the revenue tied to fraud in the ad-tech industry is somewhere in the range of $7.2 billion to $18.5 billion. In fact, some industry watchers have argued that more than half of the ad tech space is just a big fat fraud - fake traffic being used to skim advertising dollars due to the opaque nature of the middlemen. It's not just industry associations that have called out the massive fraud in ad tech. In July 2016, Senators Mark Warner and Chuck Schumer wrote to the head of the FTC asking her office to look into digital advertising fraud.The World Federation of Advertisers projects that ad fraud is likely to exceed $50 billion globally by 2025 on current trends, second to only the illegal drug trade as a source of income for organized crime. The WSJ also recently highlighted advertiser doubts about digital ads after revelations from industry giants including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) suggesting that viewership metrics have been materially overstated. Therefore, while consumers clearly continue to spend more time online and away from traditional media, internet advertising remains riddled with fraud.Enter Criteo (NASDAQ: CRTO). Criteo is a bit of an outlier when it comes to the ad tech space. The company operates within the opaque ad tech re-targeting space. When you visit a website - such as Toms.com - and then bounce to a different website - i.e. DrudgeReport.com - you will often find yourself inundated with ads for Toms that include a small AdChoice banner on the right hand side. These ads are often placed by Criteo. Criteo clients hope that by bombarding you with ads for products you have recently looked at, you will eventually come back to their website and purchase.Summary Of Thesis: Why We Think Criteo Is On The Verge Of A ""Client Revolution""There have been several epic blow-ups in the ad tech space over the past few years. Rubicon Project, Rocket Fuel, Tremor Video, RetailMeNot, and Tube Mogul (which was taken out at a price well below its all-time high) are just some of the high profile disasters.Our analysis hinges around a few key third party data points, including recent litigation between Criteo and a competitor Steelhouse. Criteo was recently involved in a very public, bitter and ugly, lawsuit with Steelhouse. Criteo struck first, alleging its competitor was a thief, and the competitor (Steelhouse) struck back with a countersuit, alleging Criteo is running a click fraud scheme.Based on Criteo's stock price move, the market has clearly ignored the claims made in the litigation and has jumped for joy now that the litigation was recently settled.However, we think the market is getting this one totally wrong. We think Criteo's decision to settle its litigation with Steelhouse comes from a place of weakness, not strength. Steelhouse made a number of claims about Criteo, essentially alleging that a significant chunk of Criteo's clicks (and therefore revenues) are derived from fraudulent sources.Despite having a strong case against Steelhouse in its original lawsuit, Criteo voluntarily settled its dispute with Steelhouse weeks ago in exchange for Steelhouse also dropping its countersuit. We think Criteo was terrified about the potential revelations that would come out about its business practices in the discovery phase of a potential trial.Many market participants / Criteo bulls share Criteo's view that Steelhouse is a bad actor and therefore were dismissive of the lawsuit.However, our own forensic analysis into Criteo suggests the market is potentially making a huge mistake by ignoring the claims that Steelhouse made against Criteo. We believe we have surfaced evidence (including Criteo's ties to a notorious adware company, and Criteo's advertising relationships with highly suspect websites) that appear to corroborate many of Steelhouse's claims. We provide just some of our evidence in this report.Up until now, Criteo shares have meaningfully outperformed ad tech peers. We share the view of an esteemed Harvard Business School professor who has suggested publicly that this outperformance is misguided and based on incorrect analysis. Our report includes information pertinent to advertisers evaluating the true effectiveness of Criteo's business because we also present evidence that undermines the quality of clicks Criteo is delivering to advertisers.While Criteo has touted its ""return on advertising spend"" metric, we demonstrate that such metrics are notoriously unreliable and subject to gamesmanship. Most notably, we surface evidence that we believe is not well known on Wall Street about how critics have already accused Criteo of manipulating ROAS data in the past through relationships with shady adware companies that remain a part of Criteo's business model that management and the sell side never discuss publicly.Don't take our word for it - Professor Benjamin Edelman of Harvard Business School (cited later in this article) has openly and publicly admonished Criteo for its business practices.We believe that as advertisers digest the information in this report and the Steelhouse lawsuit, Criteo could be forced to cut pricing and/or provide rebates in order to appease customers who have been overpaying for useless clicks for years. We see ~65%+ downside in Criteo shares.""Success Based"" Pay Per Click Model - The Supposed ""Secret Sauce"" Of Criteo:The key issue that differentiates Criteo is how it operates its algorithm. Criteo prides itself as being differentiated because it buys ""traffic"" on a CPM (cost per impressions) basis, but sells ad space on a CPC (cost per click) basis. For readers less familiar with what this means - let us explain in the graphic below.ILLUSTRATION OF UNIT ECONOMICS EARNED BY CRITEO (DO NOT TAKE THIS LITERALLY):Source: Friendly Bear graphicsLet's use the example of Seeking Alpha. The Seeking Alpha example is PURELY ILLUSTRATIVE, and is NOT based on any conversation we had with Seeking Alpha - we simply wanted to use a website as an example in the illustration of the business model for readers.Seeking Alpha has millions of visitors and wants to monetize those visitors, so it asks advertisers / ad tech companies that want to place ads on SeekingAlpha.com to pay $1 per every impression on the website. Criteo, which is paid by advertising clients, offers to buy that space. Criteo would only do so if its algorithm believes that the traffic on Seeking Alpha's website is likely to translate into clicks because Criteo's ""revenue"" is ultimately dictated by click-through rate NOT by impressions (this is important).In other words, Criteo's algorithm is designed to only keep ads on a website if the click through rate is strong.(Update 12/2/2016 4:05 p.m.: A Criteo representative disputes this characterization: ""Criteo’s algorithm is designed to purchase any display where the expected cost-of-sale of the associated e-commerce transaction is below the client’s target cost of sales. Criteo might thus choose to buy ads on a website where the click-through rate is relatively weak, but where such clicks have a higher-than-average conversion rate once they land on the e-commerce website. The actual bidding formula used by the Criteo engine contains, among other terms, the product of the predicted click-thru rate and the predicted conversion rate, ensuring that Criteo only buys traffic that converts into e-commerce sales."")If Criteo advertised on sites that didn't provide a strong click through rate, Criteo would effectively guarantee losses given that it has to pay for the impressions regardless of whether the impressions are generating any clicks. For instance, if Click Count = 0 but an ad is displayed, then Criteo's CPM is a positive number, meaning has paid the website (Seeking Alpha) but has earned zero revenue (no clicks), and thus, Criteo guarantees itself losses.Naturally then, Criteo will not leave ads on websites that generate no clicks. Keep this fact in mind as you continue to read this report. This fundamental principle - that Criteo should ultimately only bid on websites that generate clicks - is crucial to your understanding of whether or not the allegations that Steelhouse made are true.Most of the players in the ad tech space are simply playing the CPM arbitrage game (i.e. buying at one CPM and trying to sell at a higher CPM). However, Criteo's value proposition to its clients is that it is providing a ""performance"" based system - by only charging customers for clicks. This helps Criteo differentiate itself in sales pitches as the company can claim to clients that it is getting paid for only clicks. However, our research as well as court filings both suggest that the quality and source of some of Criteo's clicks is highly suspect in nature.In other words, Criteo's entire business model is predicated on finding websites that generate heavy amounts of traffic but also have users that tend to click through at a high enough rate to offset Criteo's CPM costs (unsuspecting advertisers assume this equates to websites that are trafficked by humans who click on ads).Time To Toast Some Balls!When we first started researching Criteo, we came across an article that discussed an obscure website called ""ToastedBalls.com."" We had our fair share of ToastedBalls sent our way when doing our work on MeetMe, so were naturally cautious about opening the link.To our surprise, rather than re-directing us to a pornographic or otherwise smutty website, we found ourselves at a website about… absolutely nothing. Just a bunch of links to videos ripped from other websites. A totally junky garbage website.Similarweb.com provides web statistics on ToastedBalls.com that paints a pretty fascinating picture… a website that has no original content and looks like it was made up on the fly boasts between 25-60M+ unique visitors per month from May 2016 through Oct 2016 (for context, this level of unique visits puts ToastedBalls.com in a similar league to the Wall Street Journal in terms of monthly unique visits):Source: SimilarWebAnd these ""ToastedBalls"" visitors happen to largely end up on ToastedBalls.com after first visiting the following porn sites:Source: SimilarWebNone of the porn websites referenced above were mentioned in a fairly recent Buzzfeed story about the top 13 porn sites on the web. While this point may seem obscure now, later sections of this report that touch on the role porn websites play in ad tech traffic laundering schemes. The fact that ToastedBalls.com derives so much traffic from relatively unknown porn sites is a major red flag. Genuine human interest in porn (which clearly exists) presumably finds itself on the most well trafficked sites first, leaving a significant risk that third tier porn websites such as ""eporner.com"" are in fact pieces of elaborate traffic laundering schemes.But this totally junky website - that appears to be largely frequented by ""individuals"" coming directly from porn websites (or bots given the vast number of views despite the low quality of the ToastedBalls content) - also just so happens to host a Criteo ad link in the top right corner of the page (we did a mouse over the link when we were in the process of taking screenshots, so you can see the Criteo link in the bottom left of our screen shot):Some readers may be wondering why we make such a big deal out of Criteo's ad appearing on ToastedBalls.com.We think the appearance of a Criteo ad on ToastedBalls.com may potentially be a crucial evidence regarding how Criteo's business model works and that ties back to a recently settled legal battle between Criteo and a competitor named Steelhouse.To return to our original Enron analogy - we believe that the appearance of Criteo ads on ToastedBalls.com suggests that advertisers are buying ads that they may not need!Before we explain why we think a Criteo's ad showing up on ToastedBalls.com is potential evidence of the type of 'click fraud' Steelhouse alleged, we first want to provide a little more color on the Criteo/Steelhouse litigation.The Litigation that Exposed the Rampant Fraud in the Ad Tech Industry:Back in July 2016, Criteo found itself in a rather ugly legal dispute with Steelhouse, a much smaller private competitor. You can find a timeline of events here. The litigation was fairly well covered in the press - we suggest turning to Business Insider for both copies of the lawsuit as well as commentary.Despite being well covered in the press, we think the market has completely dropped the ball when it comes to the implications for Criteo coming out of the (now settled) litigation.Criteo initially sued Steelhouse, alleging that Steelhouse had improperly gamed the ""click attribution"" system, effectively a system that ad tech companies (including Google) use in order to be given ""credit"" for generating ad traffic. Criteo claimed that Steelhouse used a ploy to take so-called ""last click attribution"" credit for clicks on ads that should have actually been credited to Criteo.Steelhouse then fired back with a countersuit, claiming among other things that:Steelhouse went as far as referring to Criteo as ""the true fraudster in the Ad Tech industry.""The mere fact that a Criteo ad (and ONLY a Criteo ad) is appearing on ToastedBalls.com should give any shareholder in the company real pause for concern as we show below that this fact strongly corroborates some of the claims that Steelhouse lobbed in against Criteo regarding ""traffic laundering.""The Steelhouse filing against Criteo reads like a short report - full of hard hitting allegations and charts and tables (that we will go into more detail on later in this article) that essentially allege that Criteo is engaged either knowingly or unknowingly in a massive click fraud scheme that results in its clients paying for advertising they do not need. It is worth remembering that Steelhouse's aggressive filing against Criteo came only after Criteo, the initial aggressor in this legal situation, essentially accused Steelhouse of being a thief (or a ""Stealhouse"" as referenced in the litigation!).Source: Business InsiderIt is not every day that a company comes out publicly and essentially calls its competitor a fraud. Competitors will quibble over who has the better quality product or the better customer service approach. But to outright call a competitor a fraud is a VERY serious allegation that should not be ignored by investors.Case in point… Allergan (NYSE:AGN) and Valeant (VRX).In May 2014, Allergan issued a scathing presentation that painted Valeant's business model in a highly unflattering light - and went into great detail regarding Valeant's business model, showing various charts and tables that suggested Valeant's business model was not all that it was cracked up to be at the time. While Valeant's stock continued to soar for a period of time following Allergan's initial presentation, we all know what eventually happened to Valeant. The stock is down almost 90% since Allergan put out its presentation on Valeant.We therefore think investors would be well served to take Steelhouse's legal claims very seriously.For some reason, investors appear to have forgotten about this litigation all together, particularly after Criteo and Steelhouse settled their disputes and CRTO's stock was back off to the races:We think investors have learned nothing from the events of the Allergan/Valeant debacle. Again, it is not every day that a company calls out and refers to its competitor as a fraudster. While investors now appear excited about the settlement of the Criteo/Steelhouse case, we actually think Criteo's decision to settle the case is a HUGE red flag.To recap, Criteo was the initial aggressor and filed suit against Steelhouse. Criteo then went as far as requesting sworn declarations from five of its customers to help strengthen its case against Steelhouse on the matter of last click attribution theft. If Criteo was afraid of the PR implications of getting involved in litigation with Steelhouse, it would likely not have requested sworn declarations from its customers alleging to strengthen its case, as this maneuver clearly drew attention from customers to its legal dispute with Steelhouse. Based on our reading of the litigation, we also think that Criteo genuinely believed it had a very strong case for theft of last click attribution against Steelhouse (particularly given the sworn declarations of shared customers).Therefore, we are left to believe that a major reason Criteo suddenly, mysteriously, and voluntarily backed out of the litigation is potentially because Criteo was uncomfortable with going forward with the discovery phase of the Steelhouse countersuit. Did Criteo not want customers and investors finding out ugly aspects about its business?Until today, to our knowledge Criteo fielded almost no questions on public calls that went into the detail of the accusations Steelhouse lobbed against Criteo (citing a desire to not discuss ongoing litigation).Given that Criteo has had ample opportunity to address Steelhouse's claims over the, we did not reach out to Criteo for comment regarding Steelhouse's claims. Instead, we point readers to Criteo's legal filings in response to Steelhouse that attempted to dismiss Steelhouse's claims, that can be found in Case 2:16-cv-04207-SVW-MRW Document 40 Filed 10/04/16 and Case 2:16-cv-04207-SVW-MRW Document 44 Filed 10/24/16.The Steelhouse litigation makes our analysis of the ToastedBalls.com Criteo ad all the more crucial.The existence of a Criteo ad on ToastedBalls.com causes us to seriously question what is going on with Criteo's algorithm and what types of revelations could have potentially surfaced over the course of a prolonged legal discovery process with Steelhouse.Using the Ghostery browser plug-in, you can easily find out what advertising trackers are associated with a website. As one can see below, Criteo stands out in the list of ad tracking companies tied to ToastedBalls.com.Source: Toastedballs.com & Ghostery plug-inSo why does this even matter?As outlined in the Kalkis research piece, the relationship between Criteo and ToastedBalls.com is described in the following way:Source: Kalkis-Research.comSo why, we ask, would a Criteo ad ever end up on this website that is so obviously suspect in nature from a traffic perspective, and potentially riddled with fraudulent / ""laundered"" traffic derived from porn websites?First of all, Criteo's algorithm is not in the business of signing up to lose money. As described previously, Criteo should only place an ad on a website where the clicks are sufficient enough to offset the CPM costs of placing a banner ad on the website.So somehow, in some way, ToastedBalls.com is a hot bed for clicks. Despite the fact that the website that has some sort of ties to obscure porn websites and traffic that suggests ""bot views.""Kalkis first wrote its article in June 2016. We have visited ToastedBalls.com's website for over a week straight now and have consistently been served a Criteo ad in the top right of the window.This leads us to question Criteo's algorithm. The algorithm has to be written in a way to maximize margins and has somehow been ""convinced"" into keeping an ad up on ToastedBalls.com. The only way this could happen is if ToastedBalls.com is somehow generating robust amounts of clicks for Criteo (the Criteo ad link has been on Toastedballs.com live since June 2016, so it is clear we did not just catch ToastedBalls.com at an opportune time and that Criteo is well ingrained in the site's ad framework).While we are speculating, we ultimately highly doubt that ToastedBalls.com - a clearly very highly suspect website - is receiving many actual human being clicks.So where does this leave us?For Criteo's algorithm to be willing to place ads on ToastedBalls' website, we believe that Criteo is potentially monetizing highly suspect clicks. A website that is largely a ""tier 2 porn"" redirect website is unlikely to be generating the volume of human clicks that one would envision are necessary to justify trying to pull off a CPC/CPM arb spread trade.If Criteo were like other ad tech companies and charged on a per impression (CPM) basis, then ads showing up on ToastedBalls.com would only be a modest red flag. We are pretty sure advertisers would prefer their content not show up on some joke of a website such as ToastedBalls.com. But, in a CPM world, ads showing up on Toastedballs.com would be akin to ads showing up on MeetMe - honest mistakes as algorithms are running simple screens based on demographic data.However, given that Criteo charges on a per click basis, the fact that Criteo's algorithm has deemed ToastedBalls.com as economically lucrative enough to justify laying out an ad STRONGLY suggests that ToastedBalls.com has found a way to ""generate"" enough clicks out of Criteo ads to get Criteo's algorithm excited to view ToastedBalls.com as a credible website for the purposes of publication.If we (and others) were able to dig up Toastedballs in short order, what does this say about what other publishers are hiding under the hood?We decided to take Toastedballs and run with it. So we did an exhaustive search of internet metacode that included entries for the term ""Criteo."" Our search returned hundreds of thousands of results. As of publication, we were still working through the dense record set. While there were some benign websites that came up in our work - such as Zerohedge.com and Drudgereport.com - we also quickly found numerous instances of other suspicious and shady websites such as Toastedballs.com. We summarize just some of the websites that came up in our research to date below:Source: Friendly Bear color - websites were found through metacode record searchesWe prepared a set of slides (that include evidence of Criteo's ads on the sites) available below:We also found direct evidence of Criteo's ads being involved in elaborate click fraud schemes. We encourage readers to read through this article from Sentrant, a company focused on detecting and mitigating online advertising fraud, regarding an elaborate click fraud scheme that Sentrant alleges resulted in 154 million fake ad impressions a day. Sentrant goes into great detail regarding a bot scheme referred to as the Bedep Ad-Fraud Botnet. Sentrant also shows how this click fraud scheme took advantage of ads run by Criteo.This confirms both our hypothesis as well as allegations from Steelhouse that Criteo's business model is plagued with click fraud issues. Given its pay per click business model, this should give any investor concern about whether Criteo is truly on top of the charges it is assessing its customers.Source: SentrantSo do the highly suspicious websites - like the ones identified in the Sentrant analysis above that took advantage of Criteo ads - result in material amounts of clicks for Criteo? If so, what is Criteo doing to combat these click fraud schemes? And how much faith can investors and Criteo clients really put in the metrics reported by Criteo?Would any advertiser actually want to pay for clicks on an ad placed on websites such as ToastedBalls.com and Dumpaday.com?What About Criteo's Purported Return on Ad Spend? Shouldn't that Give Us Comfort that Click Fraud Is Not a Big Deal?Some readers are likely to argue that ""fraud is part of the business"" in ad tech. When we spoke to a tech executive who regularly uses ad tech companies and asked about fraud in the industry, he laughed and said ""Of COURSE there's fraud."" (Hmm…note to self…an industry that is ""riddled with fraud"" seems like a great place to park capital, right?)However, Criteo seemingly works its way around claims of impression fraud by pointing to its unique ""click"" driven business model that should - theoretically - subject it to less risk of fraud. It is easier for ""bots"" to create fake impressions than fake clicks. However, we showed in both the Sentrant and ToastedBalls case studies that there is clearly a very high likelihood that websites have managed to find a way to get traffic to create fake clicks as well. As an aside, we find it hilarious that people actually ""click"" as a free-lance job.Ad tech companies such as Criteo are obviously heavily incented to ""look the other way"" when possible instances of fraud do emerge. Why? Because all traffic is ultimately good traffic for an ad tech company as it is traffic that turns into revenues. While one would hope that ad tech companies are behaving ethically and cutting off traffic to potentially fraudulent sources, the ""bad guys"" are always getting smarter about how to game ad tech algorithms. And ad tech companies have a natural disincentive to ""police"" fraudulent traffic in the short term - as it would result in a hit to revenues. This makes policing ad tech fraud particularly challenging for public companies such as Criteo that face the quarterly Wall Street gauntlet.So what do advertisers do to keep ad tech companies honest? They try to measure the effectiveness of ad spend and use that as a tool for marketing / determining pricing.Criteo touts its ""return on ad spend"" aka ROAS as the holy grail of all metrics, used in competitive bake off situations to win and retain clients. The actual calculation of this ROAS is opaque itself, with Criteo providing little color to investors on how it arrives at ROAS figures.But what happens if Criteo's ""return on ad spend"" metric itself cannot be trusted?We point readers to this crucial presentation (actual audio available) from Professor Benjamin Edelman of Harvard Business School that explains how Criteo has used unethical and unscrupulous adware injections in order to artificially inflate its return on ad spend metric.If you either own Criteo shares or are a client of Criteo and have not yet seen this video (recorded in April 2015) - do yourself a favor and watch right now (starts at 24-minute mark):Source: Original video can be found here - Criteo section begins at 24-minute markWe took the time to transcribe key lines out of Professor Edelman's presentation and provide them below:Source: Transcription of Professor Edelman's speech (TFB Transcription Services)We did NOT contact Criteo with respect to Benjamin Edelman's claims that were lobbed in against the company back in early 2015. However, we conducted a Google search and transcript search on Criteo to determine if the company had ever responded to these claims and found no such evidence. Edelman himself does suggest Criteo has spoken with him about the issues in the presentation - which again, we think you need to watch if you have any position in Criteo shares.We think it is worth pointing out again in bold face font - an esteemed professor at Harvard Business School outright claimed that Criteo is involved in nefarious business practices that 'swindle' and 'shake down' advertisers.Professor Edelman's claims provide support to allegations made in the Criteo v. Steelhouse countersuit:Source: Criteo v. Steelhouse (countersuit filing)Our own deep forensic analysis of Criteo not only confirms that Criteo has direct ties with adware companies - but also appear to support the notion that Criteo's dealings with adware companies persist through the present (Professor Edelman's presentation was made in April 2015).In our metacode records analysis, we came across Criteo's involvement with a company called Montiera. Numerous malware tracking websites confirms that Montiera is quite notorious in computer protection circles as it is seen as a nuisance adware toolbar enabler:Source: Spyware.comA simple Google search for Montiera also confirms its ties to adware (amazingly, a Google search for Montiera does not even return the corporate website in the top search results, instead returning results that point to Montiera being a notorious adware company):Source: GoogleGiven Professor Edelman's claims that he could easily find ""50 examples"" of Criteo improperly using adware injections to wrongly take credit for sales, you will not be surprised to discover that Montiera proudly touts Criteo as the first on a short list of third party partners that work with Montiera:Source: Montiera WebsiteIt is important to note that this is Montiera's representation of its relationship with Criteo. Criteo does not disclose its partnership with Montiera in its SEC filings and we did a transcript search for the terms ""adware"" and ""Montiera"" and found no mentions in Criteo transcripts. We question whether advertisers are aware of Criteo's reliance on a company that is known to power numerous suspicious adware toolbars.In light of the claims put forward by Professor Edelman, Criteo's apparent relationship with Montiera leaves us highly suspicious about any claims made by Criteo regarding the accuracy of its ""Return on Ad Spend.""And if you still trust Criteo to get attribution calculations ""right"" - then perhaps this recent news release from Facebook will make you rethink your belief:Source: StreetAccountIf Facebook - the second most powerful digital advertising business in the world - can't get attribution and measurement metrics right - then HOW can any advertiser trust numbers coming out of much smaller companies such as Criteo that has partnerships with adware companies, runs ads on suspect websites such as ToastedBalls.com, and gets into legal spats with competitors that are 1/10th its size?Perhaps this is why the Wall Street Journal recently suggested that rebates are on the way across the ad tech space:Source: WSJ (link provided in earlier section of document)We believe that Criteo is ultimately going to have a mea culpa moment that will be far more damning than Facebook's and will require the company to return huge sums of money associated with invalid clicks. Google already has a program to return revenues from invalid clicks -Source: Google SupportSimply put - we think that the Criteo/Steelhouse litigation opened Pandora's box in terms of advertisers (and hopefully investors) beginning to ask questions about what is actually going on inside the Criteo blackbox. In turn, we expect that savvy and sophisticated ad buyers will begin to demand rebates. Particularly when they find out that their ad dollars are being wasted on websites such as ToastedBalls.com and that Return on Ad Spends are allegedly being gamed through complicated adware schemes.While our report has focused on ads from desktop sites, we believe that all of the issues that we have identified in this report impact the mobile side of Criteo's business as well. Many of the ads we pulled are also available in mobile browsers (i.e. many of the ads we found will show up on both your PC as well as through Safari on an iPhone).Furthermore, sophisticated scammers have already figured out numerous ways to game ads that are served on mobile devices. Scammers go where the money is, and the money is moving to mobile. Therefore, all of the issues we have raised thus far in this report (in our view) apply equally to both desktop and mobile viewership with respect to ads served on websites.The main exception to this claim comes through ads served through mobile apps (i.e. banner ads at the bottom of the MyFitnessPal app). Given the need to actually drive an app install in order to game these types of ads, they are harder (but not impossible) to defraud. We take comfort in our view that a very small piece of Criteo's business is driven through in-app ads.The company recently suggested that in-app ads are growing at a rate of >300% per year (3Q16 earnings call) which is ~10x higher than the company's overall growth rate. In other words - in-app ads - the kind that are less impacted by the issues we raise in this report - are growing off a very small base, and likely remain immaterial as a percentage of Criteo's overall business.Toastedballs, Montiera adware, and suspect ROAS are only some obvious red flags that should give any Criteo shareholder heartache.We see many other grave problems with Criteo that appear to be somehow overlooked by the market.Other Red Flags That Lead Us To Believe Criteo's Blackbox Should Terrify Investors#1 - Surprise History - How Can A Business With Presumably Low Visibility Always Crush Revenues?It is always a real treat to see a company that never misses on revenues. Usually we see companies that never miss earnings as exhibiting signs of possible accounting fraud because earnings can easily be ""massaged"" through accrual games etc. It is far less common to see a company - particularly one in the volatile advertising space - that has such incredible visibility into its revenues…yet Criteo has done so quarter after quarter:Source: BloombergWe think Criteo's revenue history should cause any naturally skeptical person to start asking questions about what is going on…#2 - When Every Other Ad Tech Company Has Blown Up - How Has Criteo Magically Bucked The Trend?… The backdrop for other ad tech companies has been downright ugly - yet Criteo has somehow magically been able to buck the trend. This should cause any naturally skeptically investor to ask serious questions about how Criteo was able to generate the stable revenue trajectory relative to consensus described above…Source: Bloomberg#3 - With 57% Of Its Business Allegedly ""Mobile"" Today, And That Figure Growing Rapidly, Why Did Criteo File An Ugly And Expensive Lawsuit That Was Essentially All About Desktop Last Click Attribution?This claim requires a bit of education but is arguably the most significant red flag we saw when researching Criteo.Criteo's mobile business is allegedly 57% today according to management. On earnings calls, the company claimed that mobile was >47% of the business in 4Q15, >50% in 1Q16, >50% in 2Q16, and now is 57% as of 3Q16.It is also well understood today that mobile is the future - in fact all digital growth is now coming from mobile usage according to studies.Criteo's mobile business - if you believe management's claims - are growing at an incredible clip that is far in excess of desktop. And over time, this trend is likely to continue given the explosive growth in mobile is clearly coming at the cost of desktop share - just see the table below:Source: Marketingland.comSo take a step back and noodle on this point. The original lawsuit that Criteo filed against Steelhouse all related back to ""utm"" codes being slapped onto URLs. For readers less familiar with the ad tech space, ""utm codes"" are a VERY desktop-centric methodology for last click attribution. This is because the utm code methodology works quite well when it comes to desktop clicks. The declaration from Criteo's Vice President of Analytics (can be accessed in Case 2:16-cv-04207-SVW-MRW as Document 14-7 filed on 7/1/2016, ""Declaration of Jaysen Gillespie"") goes into great detail about how utm codes work - so we will let readers do their own homework on this point.However, when it comes to mobile attribution - utm codes are far less effective. Context is lost when ads are placed inside apps - making it harder for app based advertisers to determine source of attribution. The blog excerpt below provides some color with respect to tracking data issues that go along with app based ads. The blog also provides some detail on the solutions to attribution puzzle in mobile that involves a newer version of attribution called ""deep linking.""Source: Attribution App BlogWe also spoke to a very senior level former executive in the mobile gaming space - experts in app based attribution given their insatiable desire to drive higher installs - and they told us that mobile attribution remains the Wild West where no one is quite sure of where clicks really came from.Based on the litigation, it is apparent that Criteo's main beef with Steelhouse was around utm codes relating to desktop last click attribution. Furthermore, Steelhouse is a fraction of the size of Criteo - having done around $130 million of revenue on a run rate basis in 2015. This compares to Criteo that is on track to do $1.6 billion of gross revenues (before traffic acquisition costs) this year.So why sue a competitor that is a fraction of your size (1/10th based on our estimates) over a spat relating to desktop last click attribution when your mobile business is a) growing much faster, and b) clearly should be turning into the focal point of your business given secular market dynamics?Why subject your company to public scrutiny and enter into costly and expensive litigation against a competitor over something that on FACE VALUE appears to be such a nonevent? An alleged desktop last click attribution scheme hatched by a tiny competitor?We think investors ought to be asking this question of Criteo. We think the mere decision of Criteo to enter into an ugly and messy spat with Steelhouse over what appears to purely be last click attribution issues in desktop suggests to us that Criteo's mobile business may not be all that Criteo claims it is cracked up to be, poking a major hole in the bull case on Criteo. And Criteo really did appear ""in it to win it"" - even going as far as taking the unusual step of asking clients to provide declarations in support of Criteo's position - effectively drawing more attention to the ugly legal spat.Ultimately, we think Criteo's decision to enter into aggressive litigation with Steelhouse in the first place suggests that the company remains far more economically reliant on desktop than it lets on. Suing a competitor 1/10th the size (and getting clients involved in the spat) over a business segment that is not of significant importance to your company would be a very unusual move.#4 - How Has Criteo's Shift Into Mobile Resulted In No Margin Pressure?Conversion factors in mobile are far lower than in desktop - with smartphones having less than 1/3rd the conversion rate of desktop, and tablets having ~3/4th the conversion rate.Source: SmartInsightsFrom a practical perspective, this means that in order to generate the same amount of clicks on a mobile device, you need to buy far more impressions (people are simply clicking ads far less frequently on mobile versus desktop).We also believe that mobile CPMs are actually higher than desktop CPMs, removing the possibility that higher volume buys could be offset by lower price points.One would therefore naturally assume that in the near-term, Criteo's margins should have come down as Criteo has been forced to go out and buy more impressions - increasing the ""CPM"" side of its two-sided margin equation, in order to keep the CPC side intact.However, instead of net revenue margins going down, they have actually shot up despite Criteo's alleged massive growth in mobile since 4Q15:Source: Friendly Bear analysis of CRTO SEC filings and transcriptsThis makes no sense to us.However, Criteo's odd and illogical progression in net revenue margins is not the only metric that leaves us puzzled…#5 - After Guiding The Market To Expect Header Bidding To Be A Near-Term Headwind, How Did Criteo Magically Overcome The Headwind IMMEDIATELY?Header bidding is a bit of a complicated topic. Historically, publishers have taken a sort of waterfall approach to the auction process of bidding for advertising inventory, meaning that certain demand side platforms get first dibs at the inventory. The larger and more prominent demand side platforms (i.e. the Criteos of the world) were given opportunity to bid first for inventory, giving them a distinct advantage - they could clear out available CPM inventory before smaller competitors stepped in.Under the new world of header bidding, this VIP status for larger ad tech companies has effectively been done away with, making the overall system more egalitarian - at the cost of larger companies such as Criteo and Rubicon Project. This article provides some color on what has been happening with header bidding.Source: AdExchanger.comIn its analyst day in September 2016, Criteo even highlighted the issues with header bidding and called out the expectation that its margins would erode in the near to medium term as a result of the new header bidding rules:Source: Criteo September 2016 Investor Day PacketKeep in mind that header bidding implementation changes have been taking place for the last several months - so should have been seen in Criteo's numbers by now.Instead, magically, Criteo was able to show a 4% constant currency DECREASE in its CPMs (its cost for acquiring traffic):Source: Bloomberg transcript of 3Q16 Criteo Earnings CallNow we are left with two puzzling dynamics. First, Criteo has been blowing out its mobile growth - yet net revenue margins have done nothing but increase despite the conversion dynamic described in the prior section. Second, Criteo itself told us to expect an INCREASE in traffic cost as a result of the header bidding ""challenge""…yet the company reported a 4% decrease in traffic cost on a constant currency basis in the most recent quarter.So something smells fishy to us.#6 - For A Supposedly Disruptive Technology Company, Why Is R&D Spend So Low?If CRTO really is a cutting edge technology company, then why is its R&D spend so low when compared to its comp set? Low R&D spend relative to peers is often a glaring sign of problems to come. The earlier analogy we used - Valeant - will remind readers that when companies with ""trust management"" and ""blackbox"" approaches to business have low R&D, it is wise to take notice and remain very skeptical.

Steelhouse (Steelhouse countersuit)In light of us finding a Criteo ad - and only a Criteo ad - on ToastedBalls.com, we have to wonder how this allegedly ""rocket fueled"" click rate at Criteo is being generated.#8 - Why Is Criteo Apparently The Only Company That Is Using A ""Cost Per Click"" Methodology When Every Other Player Has Moved Away?Source: See table for individual sources#9 - Why Are Criteo's Margins Literally Double That Of Its ""Transparent"" Peer 'The Trade Desk' (TTD)?The Trade Desk recently went public and prides itself on being a ""clear box, not black box"":Source: TTD prospectusPerhaps not surprisingly, TTD's ""clear box"" results in 50% lower margins than Criteo's ""black box"":Source: Friendly Bear analysis of TTD and CRTO SEC filingsSimply put - we have no good explanation for why Criteo is literally twice as profitable (on a net revenue basis - i.e. just factoring in traffic expense) when compared to The Trade Desk.The fact that Criteo is the only player in the industry we have found using a ""CPC"" model and is somehow able to put up spectacular margins that are 2x higher than a very closely linked peer in The Trading Desk should cause any reasonable investor to question what is going on with Criteo, particularly in light of the allegations from Steelhouse.#10 - Despite Criteo's Obvious Fear Of Adblockers (Evidenced By The Company Paying To Get On A Whitelist), Why Has The Company's Top Line Continued Surging Without A Hiccup?Business Insider reported that Criteo paid to be part of Adblock Plus's ""Acceptable Ads Initiative"" so that some - not all - Criteo ads would be whitelisted from adblockers.This clearly suggests that Criteo is concerned about the future of adblocking - as it should be:Source: eMarketer.comOf course, with ad blocking penetration set to reach almost 1/3rd of internet users next year - and the safe assumption that 100% of clients with ""ad blocking"" technology are in fact human and not ""robot"" in nature - we wonder - is Criteo either a) about to hit a wall in terms of growth, or b) going to have to soon provide massive rebates to its customers who have believed they are paying for human clicks when evidence continues to mount that the actual proportion of human clicks may be far lower than one thinks.#11 - How Many Instances Are There Of Criteo Serving Ads That Should Never Have Been Served In The First Place?In a presentation from Professor Benjamin Edelman of Harvard, he shows an example of a Zappos ad being served to a customer already on Zappos.com. This should obviously never happen. How forthcoming and honest has Criteo been with its clients in terms of these types of obviously objectionable situations?Source: Benjamin Edelman PresentationIn our research, we also came across an instance of Criteo serving a ""re-targeting"" styled ad to us for a website we have never visited!Source: Ad from Zerohedge.com pulled on an AndroidThe ad itself establishes that there was no reason cited for why we got served a re-targeting ad from lovelywholesale.com. We hypothesize that Criteo served this ad to us based on our general browsing behavior. Which is a major red flag from an advertiser perspective as it suggests Criteo may be serving ads based on data collected from OTHER advertisers (otherwise why serve this ad at all?). Would other advertisers - potentially competitors of lovelywholesale.com - be comfortable with competitor ads being served based on our browsing behavior? We doubt it.#12 - Why Did Two Chief Product Officers (One Who Was Also The Co-Founder) Both Resign In The Past Year?Source: BloombergSource: Criteo 8-K for 3Q earningsMr. Niccoli resigned in October but had only been Chief Product Officer for a few months.

We believe that this is a sign of either a) mix shift away from high quality customers into lower quality and smaller customers, or b) existing clients are reducing spending with Criteo.Source: Criteo SEC filings and Friendly Bear estimatesAs we have already outlined in detail in this report, we believe Criteo's business model remains highly economically levered to desktop clicks - a relative secular share loser relative to mobile today. This alone is a huge headwind to Criteo's growth going forward.Source: DigidaySecond, Criteo's mobile business leaves us asking more questions than having any real view given how much data we have surfaced that calls into question the real strength of that business.And Criteo has essentially no meaningful video ad capabilities today in our view.Furthermore, our conversations with industry experts suggest that many advertisers are bringing their ad tech budget back in-house, and transacting directly with publishers. The chart below from an industry rag helps explain the upside from bringing an ad budget in-house:Source: NanigansFurthermore, Criteo is notoriously weak in video. This is despite the fact that video is widely expected to be the future of digital advertising going forward.Source: eMarketer.comAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) recently purchased Tube Mogul (a video ad tech specialist), speaking to the interest in the space.And Mark Zuckerberg recently highlighted the significance of video for Facebook going forward on his earnings call:Source: Bloomberg transcript for Facebook 3Q16 callValuationCriteo is a difficult company to value. One could argue that a business with no long-term contracts and accusations of massive click fraud should not be valued on the assumption of any terminal value.The market broadly has agreed with our view that genuine terminal value should not be ascribed to these ad tech arbitrage schemes. RUBI and FUEL both trade at pathetic valuations, and even Tube Mogul, that had strategic value to Adobe due to its video capabilities, was sold for a relatively paltry sum in the grand scheme of things.The way we approach valuation is to take Steelhouse's litigation claims - that never had the chance to be heard in court - and assume they are true. Our own analysis into ToastedBalls.com suggests that there is clearly merit to some of the claims Steelhouse made, and the forensic analysis included in Steelhouse's litigation holds weight with us.First, on the comps, we pulled RUBI, FUEL, and TUBE as the most relevant comps. Below we show TUBE's valuation including the M&A deal:Source: Bloomberg and Friendly Bear analysisNext, we take Steelhouse's case at face value and assume that ~50% of Criteo's clicks are in fact fraudulent, and that the company is going to get pressure from clients to return revenue dollars tied to fraudulent clicks in the upcoming year as pressure mounts for greater ad tech transparency:Source: Bloomberg and Friendly Bear analysisWe use a 0.64x revenue multiple - the median of the 3 best comps. We think this is a generous valuation because we believe the TUBE comp is a poor proxy for Criteo's valuation due to TUBE having strategic value in its video capabilities. Professor Benjamin Edelman also directly compared Rocket Fuel to Criteo, suggesting they are in fact very similar business models that could warrant similar valuations. On our math, we see ~67% downside in Criteo shares.Source: Professor Benjamin Edelman presentationConclusion:Take notice when competitors get into public spats about topics pertaining to fraud. Lawyers do not take tossing out such accusations lightly. And both law firms involved in the Criteo/Steelhouse spat were of top notch caliber.Take notice when a company that claims to have a success-based click model is placing ads on a suspect porn redirection website that we have a hard time believing sees many if any genuine human clicks.Take notice when a company in the online advertising space is freely willing to associate with suspect adware manufacturers. Take notice when a Professor at Harvard Business School has outright accused a company of being involved in nefarious billing activities.Take notice when a company's margin profile makes no sense and does not even follow the path that management guides towards - particularly when the business that management runs is a blackbox that no one truly understands.We think Criteo does not deserve a genuine terminal value multiple and is a very dangerous stock position. The company has no long-term contracts so advertisers can pull dollars with a moment's notice. We ultimately believe that longs who own the stock are playing a waiting game. Sure, Criteo may continue to put up a few more ""awesome"" quarters - but we think those awesome results are coming at the cost of advertisers who may not (yet) fully understand the lack of value we believe Criteo is providing to its customers.Over time, we believe that Criteo's customers will discover that they are buying ads they do not need from Criteo, just as Californians discovered in 2002 that they were buying power they did not need from Enron.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

3954806,52382,2016-03-05T10:28:44-05:00,"Doubts over the company’s ability to survive ad blockers seems overdone.Performance is strong and there is little, looking at fundamentals and technology, to suggest that the momentum may slow anytime soon.Conservative estimates and increased volatility, both opportunities worth monetizing.This note carries forward the argument for improving ad tech space covered in previous notes on Rubicon and YuMe.","Criteo S.A. (CRTO) is being punished because investors are overly concerned about re-targeting technology losing its relevance in a world with less cookies, more ad blockers and Internet with high walls, but the fundamentals of the business suggest otherwise, imploring investors to monetize volatility rather than getting caught in endless discussions about technology.Retargeting model. Source: CriteoBarring the last few weeks, the stock has been hammered over the last 6-7 months. There is a school of thought in tech that believes that eventually the Internet traffic will grow in high walls, e.g. Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG), which, when combined with ad blockers, can make re-targeting (targeting an ad to someone that has already viewed your website) technology difficult to work with. Besides this overarching macro concern, potential pricing pressure, especially as competition sees through the steady and industry leading 40% fee (ex-traffic acquisition cost revenues) of the company, is another issue that is holding the stock back.But now that the ad tech space in general is improving, as covered in previous notes on Rubicon (RUBI) and YuMe (YUME), and within that improving industry, Criteo is emerging as a clear leader. The company is showing strong growth, relative to not just other players in the ad tech space, but also the tech industry, in general. A closer look at the fundamentals, including product launches and partnerships, suggests that the current pessimism may have been overdone. Financially, Criteo and Rubicon are probably the only publicly trading ad tech specialists that delivered a positive net income, positive free cash flow and EBITDA margins of more than 20% for 2015.Clearly, the stock is getting no premium for delivering industry leading growth or consistent profitability, even though the estimates continue to rise.Source: Y! FinanceNot to mention that the company has a history of delivering ahead of expectations.Source: Y! FinanceBears oversimplifying the technological edgeAs covered in detail in my previous note on the company, before these ad blocker issues gained prominence, Criteo mainly focuses on the re-targeting segment of the ad tech space, which theoretically is nothing more than using algorithms to track consumer web behavior and serving them targeted ads. If browsers install ad-blockers, most ad servers, including Criteo will suffer. But this oversimplification, currently adopted by the markets, is ignoring important aspects of the business.The business model is closer to the Search model than the ad tech space, which it is clubbed with. The clients (mostly marketers rather than advertisers) treat Criteo as a sales cost rather than a marketing cost, making it less dependent upon volatile marketing budgets and less prone to negotiations, which helps in drawing better margins as well. On top of that, the client retention rate is nearly 90%. The company has led the space in integrating 'deep-data' with advertisers or using performance advertisers' full product catalog data, including recently browsed or purchased products, for re-targeting.Who knows if ad blocking may start hampering growth someday, but it does not look like a big issue right now, at least looking at the fundamentals. There is hardly any consensus among third-party researchers, as to the penetration rate of the ad blockers, but estimates range between high single digits to low double digits. As for the trend going forward, inventory available from publishers continues to increase and prices are following a normal trend, things that would have been difficult if ad blockers were making a serious dent on the industry. Ad blocking companies have already started to offer 'white labeling' options, which is similar to paying up to not get blocked by ad blockers.Facebook's Dynamic Product Ads and Google's Product Listing Ads are often talked about as significant threats to Criteo, but here again, the fundamentals suggest otherwise. With more than 3000 clients connecting Facebook via Criteo, the company can buy these new ad formats and replicating Criteo's scale may not be easy for other players, even if Facebook and Google encourage direct connection and competition.Enough catalysts to believe that the momentum may pick the paceThe business is 'firing on most cylinders' and with the rise of cross-device marketing, new products and stability across all geographies, it may start to fire on all cylinders. Almost all growth metrics have been impressive, be it a strong growth on the top line across all geographies, except currency related problems in Europe, 42% growth in the number of clients on the network or the addition of almost 2000 publishers to the network. Even digging deeper, strength was across existing and new clients as well as across different size of customers, especially the mid-market clients.The problem of cross-device sales attribution has been a problem for the industry and Criteo's large cross device user graph should act as a significant asset. Almost 25% of the revenues last quarter came from users that matched across at least two different devices. A strong device graph can help gain access to bigger inventory, an opportunity to serve a targeted ad that can drive sales and cater to transactions that are happening across devices. Almost 40% of the transactions are starting on one device and end on another one.Geographically, there are opportunities to grow by improving presence in the Americas and APAC regions. As most readers would know, the company was founded in France and still derives a significant share of revenues from Europe, a geography that is suffering from weak growth and a weak currency. The Americas region was the largest region for the company during the last quarter, a first for the company. APAC is the fastest growing retail e-commerce market and expected to constitute 60% of the global retail e-commerce by 2018, but makes up less than a quarter of the revenues for the company.Near term, the deployment of Facebook's dynamic product ads across desktop newsfeed placements, mobile and apps should help beat off any seasonality blues.After all, technology is as good as the numbers backing itNot just the top line, but on margins and cash flows basis too, the performance is industry leading.The margin improvement is visible and there is ample room to deliver continued operating leverage, especially in sales and operations and G&A.The cash flows have shown an equally impressive trajectory, even though the company has not shied away from investing. The capital expenditure is expected to wind down after increased spending on data center equipment for increased capacity and leasehold improvements in new facilities. Adjusted EBITDA margins on incremental revenues have been almost 50%.Another thing that stands out for the business, relative to other ad tech peers as well as tech businesses in general, is the low level of share dilution.Note: Detailed proprietary model is not attached in this note for the sake of easy readability, but happy to help and provide more details to readers interested in understanding the calculations used in this note."
3662606,54942,2015-11-10T05:00:00-05:00,"Criteo is an emerging market leader in the adtech space that should see continued adoption of its technology within the retail environment due to compelling ROIs.The adtech programmatic ad buying space is fast growing, with strong secular tailwinds as the industry shifts towards targeted ad-buying.The company's proprietary ad retargeting is a strong growth driver as the retargeting moves from larger retailers to the mainstream mid-market space.We think the shares are being sold off for transitory and irrational fears that are not likely to come to fruition, with massive upside potential using conservative assumptions.","Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO) is a way to play the shift in the advertising industry towards performance-based display ads. We think the company is well situated to benefit from the shift in display ads toward programmatic buying and bidding in real-time due to its strong competitive advantages and innovative technology. We think this emerging leader in data-driven marketing has the best position in the display advertising market, with opportunities to expand into new verticals and geographic regions.The shares sold off following the company's third-quarter earnings release, which we think is based on irrational fears. In addition, the growth drivers are abundant, with significant growth potential over the next several years as Criteo expands rapidly into new geographies, while moving outside of retail into new industry verticals such as the lucrative banking and finance spaces. The company's technology gives it a strong competitive advantage over the competition, while providing a cost advantage and strong ROI to advertisers.Business OverviewCriteo is a global technology company that enables e-commerce companies to leverage the deep data background and efficiently engage and convert their customers. The company purchases ads from publishers on a cost-per-impression business model, and then resells on a cost-per-click basis. It uses proprietary software technology and predictive algorithms to price and deliver higher-quality display ads and other advertisements in real time.Clients provide customer e-commerce data to Criteo, which then uses it to serve the right ad at the right time. Its clients provide this data so that the company can drive better conversion rates. And since the clients only pay for performance - as opposed to impressions - the client's and Criteo's interests are perfectly aligned. Given the size of the amount of data that it analyzes each day (230 terabytes), the company serves more than two billion impressions each day, and is able to update its predictive algorithms every day.Industry OverviewThe e-commerce ad market has been in a state of flux for some time as advertisers navigate an uncertain industry without a mechanism for measuring the return on their investment. Global business-to-consumer retail e-commerce was a ~$1.3 trillion industry last year, and is expected to grow at a 19.5% CAGR through 2017, according to eMarketer. Most of that growth is coming from the proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices that are driving both in-store and home e-commerce transactions.Internet-based ads are an increasingly important area for retailers to engage with potential customers - especially Millennials - and generate leads that ultimately lead to sales, both online and in their physical stores. However, the expertise needed to navigate the massive data-driven internet universe is immense, given the fragmentation and complexity. This is making it difficult for advertisers to engage with the right audience and convert customers at an effective rate for their investment.There are two primary channels for customer ad placements: search and display. Search marketing essentially consists of advertisements alongside their search query results, as well as links within the search results themselves. This represented approximately 43% of internet advertising spend last year and is growing at a 12.6% CAGR, according to ZenithOptimedia.Internet display advertising is simply the video and image ads embedded onto a web page. This type of advertising accounted for 46.3% of the total internet advertising market last year, and is projected to grow at an 18% CAGR. This market is highly fragmented compared to search display ads, and is growing more rapidly due to the rise of social media and video watching (YouTube).Why The Current Opportunity ExistsCriteo reported an in-line quarter, but gave fourth-quarter guidance below the Street's expectations. The shares declined by over 16% on November 4th, and is now down over 13% on the year and 42% from the all-time high near $61 per share in March 2014. Fourth-quarter ex-items earnings of E0.16, or about 0.17 in dollars, was down 11% yoy in local currency due to the stronger dollar. Analysts were looking for E0.18. In addition, for the fourth quarter, the company guided for revenue minus TAC of between E134 million and E139 million, up 39% to 44% yoy in local currency. That was well below the consensus estimate calling for E141.6 million.We think the company is simply being conservative with regard to its currency effects. Criteo CFO Benoit Fouilland stated as much on a phone interview given shortly after the results were issued. He stated the Street was probably not anticipating the impact of foreign exchange [that we are]. But we think this is a buying opportunity and an overreaction to the results and guidance. For one, we would note that the company reiterated its full-year guidance despite the larger currency effects. In essence, had Criteo not seen higher foreign exchange impacts since its last earnings release, the company would have raised guidance.We would also note the huge increase in client additions, which were up 41% to 9,290 at the end of the third quarter. Much of the growth came in the coveted mid-market segment, where growth typically ramps over time as they see the results of their investments.In terms of the bottom line decline, we would ignore this, as the company is investing heavily to ramp up its operations globally and scale the business. Much of the operating expense increase was driven by new hires in its research and development division, along with a 44% increase in sales and operations employees. We think these investments in their early stages of Criteo's global expansion are critical in garnering market share and increasing revenue. In a few years, once scale is reached, we think margins will expand very rapidly, as the company's retention levels are already above 90%.The stock also fell after the company reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations. But the main reason for that drop was not so much the earnings and guidance, but the rumor that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would let users install apps that block ads on the Safari mobile browser for the first time. We think this is an overreaction as well, as the majority of Criteo's mobile ad revenue is driven through Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Android operating system and its underlying products rather than Apple's. While ad blocking will remain a concern going forward, we think the issue is actually a bit exaggerated and already factored into the share price.Adblockers are primarily a threat to sites on the open web, which rely on third-party ad networks like Google's AdSense to sell and deliver ads to their sites. But the most commonly used ad blockers do not work on ""walled gardens"", such as Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) app and other similar social networking sites. We think the adtech space is large enough that even a small penetration of ad blocking technology (currently at less than 20% in the US) would mean significantly less advertising dollars. That is enough to warrant the development of new technologies that allow advertisers to get past ad blockers (such as native ads) or suppress total content on the website to only those users of ad blocking technology - in other words, restrict the ads, and they restrict the entire website.The other key theme which we think helped pressure shares is the access to display inventory. But we believe that the Facebook opportunity will eventually create an abundance of inventory as their ad exchange allows for shorter retargeted ad displays for consumers, especially as retargeting moves into the middle market.Move Towards Programmatic BuyingThe US advertising market is valued at $70 billion, but new technologies like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and on-demand, along with DVRs, are disrupting the TV advertising world. Meanwhile things like ad blockers and other browser extensions create havoc within the e-commerce industry. In the latter, the web-based world has been an enigma for advertisers, as they simply have not been able to ascertain a return on their investment.There is an ongoing shift towards programmatic ad buying, whereby ads are placed using certain algorithms either through real-time bidding or buying it directly so it's guaranteed to be yours. The industry continues to move towards purchasing media at the impressions level. The shift away from widespread audience ads towards real-time content targeting is happening rapidly. Third-party research suggests that the global programmatic buying of display ads is expected to triple over the next four years to over $35 billion.As e-commerce sales grow rapidly over the next several years, we think the shift towards display ads will continue as advertisers move away from the traditional environment. Criteo's net marketing opportunity will allow for considerable growth over the next several years. Based on the company's internal assumptions, it sees the core retail opportunity at over $7 billion, non-retail at an additional $8.7 billion, and search and in-store at $4 billion, for a total of nearly $20 billion ex-TAC.We think the industry will continue to shift towards performance display advertising, due in part to the large and fast-growing amount of lower-priced ad space inventory that advertisers can bid on and target for a direct marketing response. This is more and more going to be accomplished through programmatic ad purchases through exchanges and demand-side platforms. In addition, slower desktop search growth is likely to shift advertisers to other, faster-growing mediums for their ads. There is also the case to be made that advertisers may look to shift away from solely using Google as their platform and diversify towards other advertising technology companies.Business Model: The Machine Learns From Itself, Improving PerformanceAs we noted above, the engine algorithm is self-learning every day, and improving as it gather more and more data. This allows it to make better ad placement recommendations and improve on the underlying performance (cost-per-clicks), and thus, generate more revenue for the firm. The amount of data Criteo is analyzing is growing rapidly, from $200 billion in observed sales transactions in 2013 and $350 billion last year to an estimated $500 billion this year.Over the last two years, the algorithm has been able to improve its performance significantly and give the advertiser hard data on their investment. It was estimated in the company's registration statement (S-8) document that it were able to earn $13.50 in sales for every $1 clients spent on Criteo ads. In its most recent Investor Day presentation, the company noted that the figure had risen to $17 per dollar spent, an improvement of nearly 26%.(Source: Investor Presentation)Criteo drove more than $16 billion in post-click sales for clients in 2014, an increase of 67% yoy. The company ended the year with over 7,000 clients - an increase of 40%, and with retention rates staying well above 90% - allowing increasing scale advantages and higher revenue per client. It continues to onboard new clients with this ROI proposition, typically by utilizing smaller campaigns in order to test the market and measure the potential for the prospective client.Criteo works with each new client to define their objectives and the targeted ROI. It then places markers on certain product pages in order to track consumers who visit the website. The company also can tie into the client's CRM system and sales tracking software so that Criteo has more data to enter into the algorithm and create better ad recommendations. Ultimately, this leads to stronger ROIs as well as a deeper integration with the client, which allows for higher retention levels.This data-driven virtuous cycle, whereby the algorithm learns, is a massive competitive advantage. The more data the company collects - as we noted, Criteo collects 230 terabytes of data daily, and growing - the better the algorithm will perform, creating better targeted ads and winning more impressions. The more impressions it wins, the more data it collects, and so on, delivering better ROI for its clients. This huge data set is a massive competitive advantage that is an intangible asset to the company.(Source: Investor Day Presentation)Retargeting Growth Drives Conversion RatesCriteo's technology allows for strong retargeting advertising campaigns. Retargeting (also known as remarketing) involves hitting consumers with the brand again after they've left a certain website. For example, someone shopping for yoga pants at one store who leaves the website and goes somewhere else may get a new advertisement for the original e-commerce site. Most e-commerce sites can only convert approximately 2% of web traffic on the first visit. Using retargeting, companies can reach the 98% of users who don't convert right away, and attempt to convince them to make the purchase.Retargeting generated greater online sales by keeping the brand in front and on the mind of the shopper, and converting them from window shopper to a buyer. The more times a customer sees the retargeting ads, the more the company's brand gains traction and recognition. Retargeting campaigns typically carry much higher click-through rates and increased conversions, underscoring the value of the technology with repeat exposure.(Source: ReTargeter)Criteo has a cookie-based proprietary technology that uses a Javascript code to anonymously follow the potential customer all over the web. If the shopper does not ""checkout"" their cart at a site, the user then becomes eligible for a retargeting ad. The Criteo technology allows the brand with the unchecked-out item to be targeted with an ad from that brand and potentially draw them back to the site.Currently, mostly the larger retailers are using retargeting campaigns, but we think it will slowly gain steam down the food chain to the middle market. Once it becomes mainstream, the growth trajectory for a firm like Criteo will be huge. It has already occurred in Europe and is spreading to the US and APAC markets. This will be driven by the onboarding of a large amount of mid-market advertisers, which will mean a substantial growth pipeline for Criteo.Global Expansion and Multi-Device Capabilities Drive GrowthThe company has a competitive advantage in that it was started in France, and derives most of its revenue from the Europe (EMEA) geographic segment, as opposed to the competition, which is centered on North America. With an established market share lead in Europe as a base, Criteo has rapidly expanded both East and West, and is now growing rapidly in North America, which should eventually overtake Europe.It is making inroads into Japan and other Asian countries, where programmatic ad buying is newer and penetration much lower. The company has an exclusive relationship for first-look inventory with Yahoo Japan, which then resells Criteo's services to its direct-response advertisers. Penetration rates in Japan and the US remain low, which leaves a significant runway for growth over the next several years.Latin America and Asia may be the company's largest near-term incremental revenue drivers, as penetration is next to nothing, especially in Brazil. While Americas revenue should grow at a fast rate, above 60% over the next three years, Asia could grow well in excess of 100% as the Criteo adds new geographic markets like China, Taiwan, and India. We think global expansion alone will help propel growth for several years to come as it enters underpenetrated markets, where programmatic ad buying is still just getting started.Less than two years ago, the company introduced a new multi-screen advertising capability that allows advertisers to receive the same user-specific advertisements as they move across devices: smartphones, desktop, tablets, etc. This is a massive competitive advantage that is unique to the adtech space, as only a few of the top companies have this capability. This is driving new growth as clients shift to this multi-screen solution. By the end of last year, over three-quarters of its clients were using this new product, and we think this will eventually become 100%.New Verticals and Facebook Should Significantly Increase Market OpportunityThe majority of the company's clients are in the retailing vertical, along with some classifieds, travel agencies (Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE)) and auction-style websites. In addition to geographic expansion to grow its market opportunity and expand revenues, we think Criteo could expand into other industry verticals, like banking and insurance, telecom and automotive. As we noted above, the non-retail market opportunity is approximately $8.7 billion and represents a larger TAM than core retail.(Source: Investor Day Presentation)Moving into the banking and finance industries could allow for significantly higher revenue ramp, given the high cost-per-click in the space. We think it's a suitable vertical for direct-to-consumer advertising. Much of the growth, we believe, will come from credit cards, brokerage, core banking, and mortgage end-markets paying high cost-per-clicks and driving strong growth for Criteo.Within Facebook, the company is building a highly customized performance solution on top of its marketing APIs. Through its dynamic product ad solution recently launched, Criteo is now able reach consumers using Facebook on their smartphones. This is part of the multi-device exchange leveraging the Criteo Engine to deliver better targeted ads and recommendations as well as bidding campaigns.As people spend more time on Facebook's mobile app than on any other single app (with approximately 20% of all time spent on mobile), the website has become critical in reaching consumers, especially the coveted Millennials demographic. The Facebook ad exchange, which was launched in late 2012, created a large new source of inventory for programmatic ad buying and retargeting opportunity. The site allows Criteo and its clients to re-target potential customers in a short period of time after leaving their e-commerce site. We think Facebook will remain a significant opportunity for the company to drive incremental revenue growth through retargeting opportunity.ValuationWe think the drop in the share price following Criteo's third-quarter earnings release presents a solid entry point and a skewed risk-return payoff. The 18% drop in the price over the prior two days has created a re-rating to the downside, which allows for a lower-risk long opportunity. The forward P/E is now below 23x for a company that is expected to grow easily at 25% and likely north of 30% over the next five years.We think EBITDA can grow well in excess of strong revenue growth, given the scale of the business model. Our DCF model assumes conservative top line growth averaging mid-20% over the next several years, with EBITDA growing more strongly due to the growth in margins. Using a discount rate of 11% and a terminal growth rate of 4%, our target price was just over $51, for upside of 54%.We also looked at other fast-growing comps which are mostly being valued on a multiple of revenue-basis. Some of these comps (Rocket Fuel (NASDAQ:FUEL), Marin Software (NASDAQ:MRIN), Millennial Media (NYSE:MM), ValueClick (now named Conversant), Google, YuMe (NYSE:YUME), Tremor Video (TRMR)) are not as profitable as Criteo, or are growing at inferior rates. Yet, Criteo is trading at just 1.4x revenue compared to the median comp average of 2.9x. At that level, the shares are worth $46, based on 2017 revenue.Lastly, on an EV/EBITDA, we think the shares are trading with a massive slowdown embedded within them at 16.9x - a large discount to the EBITDA growth rate of the next several years, which we forecast at nearly 40%. With almost no debt on the balance sheet and $5.13 in cash per share, we believe the downside risk is minimal. Given the growth potential and the discount to that growth rate, we think the return potential is highly skewed to the upside.Our bear-case scenario is based on EBITDA growth slowing materially due to technological disruption (more effective ad blockers), which lowers the prices for ads and the ROI potential of Criteo's technology. Under this scenario, EBITDA growth would slow to a crawl and be approximately $125 million in 2016 and $130 million in 2017. At 12x those levels, the shares would be worth $31 and $33 today and one-year out, respectively, for minimal downside.But our bull case rests on continued strong top line growth, without the large slowdown that the market is currently expecting as they expand into new geographies and industry verticals. This scenario calls for $200 and $295 million in EBITDA generation in 2016 and 2017. At 16x those levels, the shares would be worth $58 and $84 respectively, for upside of 77% and 154%.ConclusionThe shares are baking in significantly lower top and bottom line growth as the entire adtech market gets re-rated lower. We think the multiples are low enough for Criteo to go long the shares, with the risk squarely to the upside and only limited downside probability. This asymmetric risk-return opportunity is being created following the company's third-quarter earnings release, whereby investors didn't care for the fourth-quarter guidance numbers despite a reiteration of the full-year figures. We think Criteo has a large advantage in the data-driven marketing industry, and that it will be one of the other winners along with Google over time. The short-term view of the market belies the huge opportunity as the company grows into new geographic markets and industry verticals. The shares appear significantly mispriced following the sell-off, providing a great entry opportunity."

Revenues ex-TAC of €105 million ($119.77 million U.S.) were ahead of our €99.2 million ($113.16 million) estimate, and compared to company guidance of €96 to €99 million. These revenues grew 68% annually, and 59% at constant currency for the same period. EBITDA was €28 million ($31.94 million), ahead of our €24 million ($27.38 million) estimate and company guidance of €18 to €21 million.Criteo continues to enhance its targeting engine, which improves its ability to generate sales for its clients, and consequently leads to strong growth in Criteo's revenues. The new enhancement, which evaluates the total value of the potential purchase as opposed to only gauging intent to purchase, has been rolled out to about one quarter of the client base, and further penetration will continue to favorably impact revenues.Client growth was particularly strong, with approximately 642 new clients added in the quarter. This appears to be the highest net customer additions ever, which continues to be aided by the mid-market telemarketing focus in the US. Direct publisher relationships crested past the 10,000 mark and ended the quarter at 10,050. These relationships provide access to more premium inventory of pages for targeting users and enhances the value proposition delivered to Criteo's clients.As we had outlined in our earlier reports, here and here, Criteo is favorably positioned in the digital ad marketplace for automated advertising. The company's ability to target customers and be paid based on performance creates a very powerful, unique and effective message for customers who continue to shift their advertising dollars to digital marketing and expect a more transparent ROI from automated advertising.Criteo continues to strengthen its presence across all channels and has emerged as a leading ad targeting player in the industry. Its growing access to premium inventory through direct publisher relationships as well as access to Facebook mobile native inventory continues to bode well for future growth. As we had mentioned in our earlier reports, we believe with 90+% customer retention and over 75% of clients with uncapped budgets, the growth constraint for Criteo will be access to quality inventory (supply) to create targeting opportunities rather than finding clients (demand).We anticipate second quarter ex-TAC revenues to be €111.8 million, EBITDA to be €26.1 million, and non-GAAP EPS to be €0.25 on 65.75 million shares outstanding.We continue to maintain that Criteo is well-positioned in a highly attractive ad tech segment, which is benefiting from a mega shift toward digital advertising and a greater emphasis on audience targeting. There are a number of ad tech companies, including AOL Ad Networks (NYSE:AOL), Rubicon (RUBI), TubeMogul (NASDAQ:TUBE), Rocket Fuel (NASDAQ:FUEL), YuMe (NYSE:YUME), AppNexus and MaxPoint Interactive (NYSE:MXPT), to name a few, and a basket exposure of highly selective names within the sector will be a profitable strategy.Strong and profitable business momentum for selective players will underpin and enhance valuations at a time when consolidation activity will provide support and a floor to valuations. The recent purchase of AOL by Verizon Communications was principally driven by Verizon's interest in the ad tech platform. We believe Criteo's business positioning is unique, and it remains a key holding for exposure to the ad tech sector. In addition, Criteo also can be considered a play on the Eurozone recovery as and when it occurs. We anticipate Criteo's shares will make new 52-week highs, from the current $45.50 level, as they approach our 2015 price target of $52 to $54. Valuations may move even higher during 2015 due to consolidation related activity, greater business momentum from a recovering Eurozone, and faster traction on Facebook in-app inventory.Do your own due diligence.

3043156,97096,2015-03-31T16:50:00-04:00,"Criteo has a fairly unique and pivotal position in online ad targeting across platforms.Last quarter's results demonstrated continued business momentum across geographies and platforms.Engine upgrade, expanding platform and channel presence, growing mobile in-app inventory, and pure-play stature in a consolidating industry will continue to drive growth and a favorable valuation.Anticipate stock price to reach $52-54 between now and the end of 2015.","Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO) came out swinging hard in its fourth quarter. All financial measures exceeded our expectations, which already were above the consensus estimate. Revenues ex-TAC were €96.3 million ($103.45 million U.S.), about €4 million ($4.3 million) above our expectation of €92.2 ($99.05 million). Gross margin was a full percentage point (100 basis points) higher than our expectations. EBITDA was €31.8 million ($34.16 million), above our estimated €28.6 million ($30.72 million) estimate; Non-GAAP Net Income was €23 million ($24.71 million) versus our estimate of €21.8 million ($23.42 million); and Non-GAAP EPS was €0.37, ahead of our expectation of €0.34.The business momentum remains strong for Criteo. It has a fairly distilled message - performance for its clients. The entire business strategy is honed towards delivering sales performance for its customers whose ad impressions are placed on websites based on an evaluation by Criteo's algorithm-driven, adaptive engine.As we had explained in our earlier report, Criteo's viewer targeting technology is geared toward identifying potential buyers. The predictive engine technology analyzes the potential probability of the user to make a purchase on the advertiser's website whose products will be displayed in the ad. Based on this analysis, as well as other parameters, including the ROI expectations and Criteo's margin, the company purchases an impression on behalf of its advertising client and presents the ad. The ability to convert an ad impression across channels into a click-through, and thereafter, a conversion into an eventual ecommerce sale over the attribution period - all accomplished with a relatively high degree of success rate - is the essence of the value of its technology and the company's business model.Criteo accomplishes this targeting quite well - and perhaps better than most at the scale that is warranted - as was witnessed during 2014, with a 90+% customer retention rate, 75+% of the customers with uncapped budgets, 77% growth rate in post-click sales, and 37+% revenue growth in fourth quarter 2014 from existing customer which have been with the company for at least 12 months. The successful ecommerce outcomes for clients at preset ROI create deep client relationships or stickiness, increase client spending, and drive Criteo's revenues.In addition, the business model is fairly stable, with a high-level of predictability, and leverages key trends - ecommerce growth, digital advertising shift, real-time bidding (RTB), and targeted advertising.The catalysts and key investment points going forward remain similar to the ones we had outlined earlier:CONCLUSIONWe believe Criteo is well positioned in a highly attractive ad tech sector, which is benefiting from a mega shift toward digital advertising and a greater emphasis on audience targeting. There are a number of ad tech companies, including AOL Ad Networks (NYSE:AOL), Rubicon (RUBI), TubeMogul (NASDAQ:TUBE), RocketFuel (NASDAQ:FUEL), YuMe (NYSE:YUME), AppNexus, and MaxPoint Interactive (NYSE:MXPT), to name a few.Criteo would be one of our key holdings in the sector. Besides a number of sector and company catalysts, which can provide the impetus for higher multiple and valuation, there's also continued consolidation activity, which provides a floor to valuation and enhances the attractiveness of the investment. Keeping an eye on the downside is equally important in small-cap investing. We estimate Criteo to deliver first quarter non-TAC revenues of €99.2 million, a non-GAAP EBITDA of €23.7 million, and non-GAAP EPS of €0.22 on 63.5 million shares outstanding. Although the second quarter will be volatile for the stock market due to a potential shift in interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve, we anticipate the share price to rise from the current $39.25 level to $52 to $54 over the remainder of 2015 - a median return of 35%.Do your own due diligence.

2828436,97096,2015-01-18T02:13:21-05:00,"The Ad Tech market has significant business momentum as a result of a strengthening shift towards digital advertising and an accelerating embrace of programmatic advertising.Criteo has a differentiated business model focused on delivering targeted ad click performance to its clients.The effectiveness of its proprietary technology in delivering successful revenue outcomes for clients has driven revenue and profitability.At the present share price level of $38.75, we believe Criteo’s shares are attractive and anticipate them rising to $52 to $54 over the next 6 to 12 months.","We believe the Advertising Technology (Ad Tech) sector offers exciting investment opportunities during 2015 as business models have strengthened and industry momentum is beginning to drive earnings growth. The pivotal position of the Ad Tech industry in contributing to the economics of Internet business models, requires investor consideration of the industry. The strengthening shift of underlying trends towards digital and programmatic advertising, and the consolidation interest spurred by strategic interests and scale considerations, creates an opportunity for investors to consider a basket of differentiated Ad Tech companies to gain exposure to a high-growth segment of the market. There are many public and private companies in the sector including Tremor Video (TRMR), Tubemogul (NASDAQ:TUBE), Yume (NYSE:YUME), AppNet, AppNexus, OpenX, and Xaxis. In a recent report, we gave a brief industry background and recommended consideration of Rubicon Project (RUBI). Today, we wish to add another name to the basket of Ad Tech stocks, Criteo SA (NASDAQ:CRTO).Criteo is an Ad Tech company, headquartered in Paris, France, providing targeted advertising services to Ad Buyers. Leveraging its unique technology to deliver a higher probability of successful outcomes, Criteo impacts the top-line of its clients. The approach and methodology in achieving these sell-through outcomes differentiates Criteo from many of its competitors in the Buy Side Ad Networks & Demand Side platform (DSP) segment of the Ad Tech market.Criteo's technology engine is able to analyze data on user behavior and generate sufficient algorithm-based user knowledge in its analytics to predict a user-intent with improving probability. A user or potential buyer exposed to the targeted ad is sufficiently influenced to initiate a click and then transform the interaction into a sale for Criteo's clients. As per Criteo's attribution methodology, the sale can occur immediately or over the next 30-days for Criteo to receive ascription.Based on the recommendation of Criteo's user-behavior driven analytical engine, a determination is made by Criteo to purchase an ad impression for its clients. The user, a potential customer for the client, is then presented with targeted ads, which have a high probability of a successful revenue outcome. All these algorithmic-driven decisions are made mostly in real-time. The Company charges for its services based on performance CPC (cost-per-click) model.KEY HIGHLIGHTSWell-Positioned to Benefit from Market Trends. The Ad Tech market is being driven by two powerful trends. First, an accelerating shift towards digital advertising, and second, a shift towards programmatic or automated advertising. According to researcher Magna Global, display, mobile, social and video channels for digital advertising are forecast to grow from $45 billion in 2013 to $82 billion in 2017 globally, a 16% CAGR. In addition, there is a growing shift towards more automated buying and selling of advertising, referred to as programmatic advertising. Such a shift benefits Ad Tech companies which rely on technology to buy, create and place an ad for client, compared to a traditional placement through an ad agency responsible for these tasks in the printed or broadcast world.Performance-based CPC model. Criteo's innovative approach to pricing its technology service creates a clear differentiation with its competitors. The Company is paid based on the sales it generates. In other words, if the click is attributed to a sale the Company receives a click-rate. Obviously, that click-rate has to be high for the value-add that the service delivers to its clients. This performance-based approach lowers the initial resistance of potential customers as there is a clear return on click-investment.Proprietary Technology. In order for Criteo to price its service in this manner, the Company has to possess a very high level of confidence in the predictive intelligence of its engine, which can decipher a user intent with improving probability and create a successful sales outcome for the client. The adaptive algorithm learning has improved over time, particularly with the rollout of the latest version of the engine, and the results are demonstrated in Criteo's strong sales growth. The value of this powerful, real-time, big data analytics function distinguishes Criteo from traditional ad models and other DSPs.Deep Integration with Clients. The company's technology is well-integrated with the product and sales databases of its clients. This deep-level integration is critical in order to achieve the granularity that the predictive algorithms require. In addition, since Criteo's service model is based on its successful sales outcomes for its clients, the advertising budget that the clients place at Criteo's disposal is potentially uncapped. This high value-add relationship of trust and performance, creates for an entrenched presence, which is evidenced by the 90+% client retention rate.Criteo's Buyers & Sellers. As the Company's entrenched presence with Ad-Buyers increases and consequently its Ad purchasing power rises, there is a gravitational pull of Ad-sellers towards its platform, thus creating a virtuous cycle.Growth in Mobile Channel. Criteo's technology is being used across all channels - display, mobile, social and video. Mobile commerce is growing rapidly as users begin to use the platform from mostly a browsing experience, to now engaging in purchasing products at an accelerating rate. A recent market report from Criteo on mobile commerce revealed the growing presence of mobile purchasing habit, with mobile in the 2014 period accounting for 30+% of eCommerce transactions globally, and 27+% in the U.S. The relevance of a growing mobile commerce presence lies in the expansion of the opportunity for Criteo to have access to and engage with potential buyers and serve its targeted ads.FOCUS AREASReliance on User Data. It is abundantly clear that Criteo needs access to high quality data about user behavior in order to drive the accuracy of its predictive algorithms. Such data can be acquired from different sources, including the clients' websites and ad inventory sellers. In addition, user identification data can be derived from cookies and third-party platforms is dependent on government regulations and rules established by the platform providers. The mobile platform is dominated by Apple's iOS and Google's Android, while on the desktop platform, even Microsoft maintains a strong presence. The ability of platform providers to limit the accessibility of user identification data can have an influence on the predictive algorithm.In addition, Search related targeting is very good at determining user intent and presenting targeted advertisements. Search functionality providers like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) incorporate this ability in their solutions, which is further enriched by monitoring user's browser behavior, to build a strong competitive advantage in targeted advertising.A problem that is evident in digital advertising compared to traditional advertising is the absence of data integration between DSPs and SSPs; in other words the dataset sharing between inventory providers and ad buyers is limited. This gap results in losing data insights which can allow amongst other things for better targeting and attribution.Criteo's direct relationship with inventory providers is beneficial and perhaps of great importance as it gains access to more granular data points, even though we believe such granular access pushes the TAC costs higher. As the ad transaction process continues to shift towards programmatic exchanges, Criteo will have to continue pushing for more data insights from the exchange supply for its algorithms to deliver the targeted ROI for ad buyers.Advertising agency solutions. As the shift towards digital advertising accelerates, advertising agencies continue to strengthen their own strategies to participate. However, Criteo's ability to work with agencies is constrained to the extent that in the digital world a worthwhile portion of the value-add of an advertising agency is being provided by Criteo - channel and site selection, ad framing, placement, monitoring, analytics - and all available in real-time. It would be interesting to see how Criteo can structure more collaborative arrangements with digital agencies.CONCLUSIONWe believe Ad Tech is a highly attractive technology sector with promising companies benefiting from entrenched megatrends. There are a number of catalysts in the sector including the rapid shift towards digital and programmatic advertising, and consolidation activity to achieve scale and market penetration by larger players, which provides a floor to valuation and enhances the attractiveness of an investment.We feel Criteo has a strong and differentiated business model which is beginning to demonstrate growing earnings momentum. We anticipate Criteo to deliver an adjusted or non-GAAP EPS of $0.34 for the fourth quarter ended December 2014, which will be above consensus estimate. We believe Criteo can achieve a share price of $52 to $54 in the next 6 to 12 months, and potentially higher based on rising earnings outlook. We will consider purchase of Criteo at current level of $38.75, based on the industry outlook, business momentum, its differentiated technology and positioning in targeted advertising, and the positive sentiment around consolidation activity in the sector."
2564995,66533,2014-10-15T18:18:48-04:00,"Shares of Criteo have fallen almost 25% in the last one month.
        The company could be acquired by a multinational advertising and public relations company.
        We believe that Criteo is a good stock for bargain hunting when stocks in general are correcting.","Stocks are undergoing a corrective phase, which we believe is a decent opportunity for growth seeking investors to buy some high growth companies. Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO) is one such company based in Paris, France. The company together with its subsidiaries operates as a tech company that tracks user activity on websites to help advertisers target potential customers. It designs software applications that enable advertisers to make targeted ad placements.Shares of the company have fallen almost 25% in the last one month and people looking to invest longer term should take a serious look into this company. In this article we will tell you why Criteo could be a good bargain at the current price near $28-29.CRTO data by YChartsWhy Criteo is a ""Good Bargain?""Criteo reports its financials in euros. In the second quarter of 2014, Criteo's revenue increased 66.3% (or 71.5% at constant currency) to €165.3 million. The company's net income in the second quarter was €2.4 million, compared to a net loss of €5.6 million in the same quarter of the earlier year.Criteo's said that its new Criteo Engine was responsible for a significant increase in post-click sales. Criteo Engine allows Criteo to make retargeting decisions based on click-behavior as well as purchase behavior. In addition, Criteo's mobile solution grew steadily with 69% of its clients choosing mobile ads.We expect the trend in revenue growth to continue over the next few years, albeit at a slower pace. The company added the following clients in the second quarter:Carat, the leading global media network, recently published its updated forecasts for worldwide advertising expenditure in 2014 and 2015. Based on data received from 59 markets across the Americas, Asia Pacific and EMEA, Carat forecasted that overall global advertising revenues will accelerate by 5.0% in 2014, an increase from 4.8% predicted in March 2014. Carat reaffirmed its positive outlook for 2015 with year-on-year growth predicted at 5.0%, which would augur well for Criteo.Is Criteo Undervalued?At $29 Criteo's stock is trading at 78x fiscal 2015 estimated earnings, and 37x fiscal 2016 estimated earnings. The valuation is certainly not very attractive at the first glance. However, if one considers the niche in which Criteo operates, i.e., the targeted ad tech space, the valuation should appear compelling.CRTO EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsCriteo made a big push into mobile this year and its mobile solution will drive revenue growth going forward. Criteo is optimistic about its mobile product in sectors like travel and tourism. The company's mobile product vice president Jason Morse said, ""Mobile is the driving force behind the exponential growth in online travel booking and sales, and that's only set to continue in the second half of this year and beyond.""Global mobile advertising spending is forecasted to reach $18.0 billion in 2014, up from the estimated $13.1 billion in 2013, according to Gartner. The market is expected to grow to $41.9 billion by 2017, an increase of ~130% from 2014. We believe Criteo is undervalued in terms of long-term growth prospects.Criteo Could Be Acquired by Publicis GroupeThe targeted ad tech market is highly fragmented with the world's biggest players, such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), developing their own ad technologies. We believe the market needs to be consolidated, and such a consolidation is near.Publicis Groupe (OTCQX:PUBGY), a French multinational advertising and public relations company, may be close to a deal to acquire Criteo. Publicis's digital operations accounted for 41% of its sales in the first half of 2014, up from 37% a year earlier. Criteo would boost Publicis' digital capabilities with its data and targeting technology.Final WordsCriteo might have lot of upside, but it's a high-risk high-reward small cap tech stock. The risky part of the company is that it's a business with operating leverage. However, even though Criteo is a small cap tech company, it's actually very international with three-quarters of its revenue coming from outside the U.S. We'd recommend buying the stock to investors seeking growth with medium risk tolerance.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a BB Research stock analyst.

2473865,71125,2014-09-05T10:41:49-04:00,Criteo's business holds spectacular growth levels.The company keeps on improving its products and adding better services for its clients.Its disruptive cost-to-click pricing system paired with its solutions for all screens will make Criteo a winner looking forward.,"With a new engine growing global clients, Criteo (NASDAQ: CRTO), a French technology company specializing in digital performance advertising, is poised to become a highly rewarding stock. Here's why.The businessAlthough conceptually it is rather simple, what Criteo does is a bit tricky to explain. Basically, its business comes from its targeted advertising platform, which is a software that uses an internet user's viewing history and/or search history to predict potential customer purchases. The business rests on direct relationships with advertisers, who pay Criteo based on the measurable per-click performance they deliver.Thanks to constant improvements of the software and by delivering better results for clients, Criteo managed to grow its business and clientele at high speed. In fact, the total number of clients grew 43% year-over-year to 6,131 in the second quarter, adding more promising accounts with a high amount of traffic such as ING, PayPal and Samsung.The new engineThe catalyst for the client growth is in part related to a recent success coming from the company. After three years of development, Criteo rolled out significant technical enhancements to its proprietary prediction and recommendation engine.This new technology improves Criteo's decision making with regard to buying each ad impression based on the probability that a user will both click on the ad and make a purchase on the advertiser's site. Technically it is marvelous, since before the company was optimizing mostly on clicks and now it is optimizing on conversion, which is ultimately what really matters for the client.The clear advantage of the improvements is that now clients will also be able to expand their reach to a greater number of potential buyers without paying more per sale. It's not buying clicks for clicks, it's buying clicks that convert into revenues at zero extra cost. It just creates leverage. In fact, this breakthrough has brought a 38% sales increase in the first quarter while maintaining the same cost per sale.Criteo's better engine will not only improve the accuracy of the company's click and sales predictions, but also help customers maximize the reach and effectiveness of their marketing campaigns.So, here's the deal. The new engine has been rolled out to only 60% of Criteo's client base as of now - there's more business to generate. Things are working out.The driversThere are three main characteristics that reinforce Criteo's growth fundamentals.1. Improved delivered performance: The constant enhancements in primarily the engine and mobile solutions has been a fundamental growth factor. As a result, per-clicks sales for clients grew by 88% year over year.2. Client growth: Not only clients are growing but existing clients increasingly contribute to growth. As a matter of fact, more than 35% of Criteo's year-over-year second quarter growth came from increased spending by existing clients. Plus, client retention rates are above 90% and 80% of clients are in direct relationships. The retention turns into profits. Clients who were already live in the second quarter last year generated 24% more revenue ex-TAC for Criteo this past quarter.3. Strong execution in all geographies: Criteo holds a strong drive and discipline on commercial targets that has led all regions to grow between 60% and 100% at constant currency this quarter compared to the second quarter last year.Any Risks?Much of Criteo's issues have to do with the company's current characteristics rather than with its performance. Facts are facts - it's a technology company, it's small, and it's growing very fast. That usually is an interesting cocktail for volatility. Plus, Criteo's business relies essentially on an algorithm, which needs to continuously get better. It's a competitive business, and software must always improve to keep adding clients. So far, Criteo's latest engine improvement has been a success.Another issue could be the company's positioning. Criteo's global reach is second only to Google Display Networks - we are talking about a strong competitor. The technology race can get aggressive.Nonetheless, Criteo reaches a large and growing group of Internet users whom other major marketing channels do not. As a matter of fact, about half of Internet users worldwide who saw a Criteo ad were not exposed to Google search ads. There seems to be a market for everyone.Another risky factor could come from Criteo's main source of profits as the advertising sector is inherently cyclical. But since the company's clientele is globally diversified and growing across all regions this should not be a huge issue. Excluding traffic acquisition costs, Criteo delivered comparable revenue growth of 67.2%, 61% and 87.6% in the America's, Europe/Middle East/Africa and Asia-Pacific region, respectively.Price volatility should be considered as well. We probably all agree here this stock has been quite volatile. The company was over $58 a share at the beginning of March and now is trading around $30.CRTO data by YChartsHence, size your position appropriately. This French ADR is more the high-risk, high-reward type of stock.Looking aheadAnother key growth driver for Criteo's clients has been its insertion into mobile. Ecommerce is shifting from desktop to mobile devices, and Criteo is capturing more business behind this transition. The company's solution that brings these clients the ability to shape mobile-based ads content to optimally target their audience has been a success.This last quarter, the company personalized mobile ads for 69%, making revenue coming from mobile clicks grow faster than the overall business - which grows at an outstanding 72% year over year. As of now, 20% of revenue ex-TAC comes from mobile clicks versus March, which was at 15%.But despite the transition growth, Criteo's future relies on all the screens. In today's world there is a continuum of devices. Users move from their laptops to small smartphones on to a tablet and clients must reach their customers across all screens. They have to be present and target each device, and Criteo's products are here to help. As of today, 69% of total clients have converted to all screens.Summing upCriteo's new engine improvement is gaining traction and expanding the company's business. Its basics just add to the company's services: its cost-to-click pricing adds more benefits at the same cost for clients, strong client growth, and growing revenue generation coming from existing clients."
2109663,20521,2014-03-26T07:04:17-04:00,,"According to ad agency ZenithOptimedia, global ad spend is estimated to be worth $503 billion in 2013. The U.S. accounts for $109.7 billion of this market. The research study estimates that last year, 22% of U.S. ad spend was on digital media, compared with 19% in 2012. Internet advertising is projected to grow 16% annually over the next two years and will account for 28% of all U.S. ad spend by 2015. Global ad spends are expected to follow similar trends.Criteo's Offerings Paris, France-based Criteo (NASDAQ: CRTO) is a global leader in the Performance Display advertising market. Founded in 2005 by Jean-Baptiste Rudelle and Franck Le Ouay, Criteo uses their predictive software algorithms to enable advertisers to make more targeted ad placements.Criteo's offering is chiefly driven by their Criteo Engine, database assets, access to display advertising inventory, and their advertiser and publisher platforms. Criteo's data portfolio includes clients' proprietary data including transaction activity on their websites, publisher-specific data including performance of advertisements, third-party data such as customer demographic and internally developed data based on proprietary knowledge from previous campaigns. The Criteo Engine then uses several machine learning algorithms to analyze each opportunity that the end consumer is faced with and converts the volumes of data collected to observe and predict user intent. Criteo partners with their clients to track activity on their websites and thus optimize their advertising placement capabilities. Criteo believes that their solutions help their clients in creating more effective ad placements that are more likely to be converted to sales.Earlier this year, Criteo announced the acquisition of Tedemis, a provider of real-time opt-in personalized email marketing solutions, for an estimated €21 million (~$28.9 million). Tedemis solutions help their portfolio of more than 200 clients by providing them with the ability to address the user's expectations via email to deliver high-performing Internet traffic. Criteo plans to leverage the acquisition to expand their presence into new channels.Criteo's Financials Criteo charges their clients based on the number of clicks on an advertisement they deliver. The strength of their offering can be ascertained from the fact that even with a pay-for-performance pricing model, Criteo boasts of extremely high client retention rates. Their client list includes names like Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), Macy's (NYSE:M), and Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) to name a few. They also have a strategic relationship with Yahoo! Japan (YHOO) which grants them privileged access to the advertising inventory.Over the past few years, Criteo has seen strong growth in revenues. Revenues have increased from €65.6 million (~$90.5 million) in 2010 to €271.9 million (~$375.1 million) in 2012. For the first half of the previous year, Criteo saw revenues grow 72% over the year to €194.3 million (~$268.1 million). Adjusted EBITDA has grown from €9.0 million (~$12.4 million) in 2010 to €13.9 million (~$19.2 million) in 2011 and €17.4 million (~$24 million) in 2012. For the first half of 2013, adjusted EBITDA fell 40% to €5.2 million (~$7.2 million).For the recently reported Q4, Criteo saw revenues grow 57% to €135.9 million (~$187.5 million) with adjusted EBITDA recording a 227% increase to €14.5 million (~$20 million). They ended the year with revenues of €444 million (~$612.5 million) and adjusted EBITDA of €31.3 million (~$43.2 million).Till October last year, Criteo was venture funded with $63.4 million from investors including Idinvest Partners, Elaia Partners, Index Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and SoftBank Capital. Last October, they raised $251 million by selling 8.08 million ADS at $31 each on the Nasdaq under the ticker CRTO. Their stock is trading at $44.39 with a market capitalization of $2.53 billion. It touched a high of $60.95 earlier this month.Disclosure: No positions"
2985026,52382,2015-03-10T10:50:48-04:00,"Among the few Ad Tech businesses with good top line growth rate and sustainable technical edge.Well positioned to benefit from new prediction engine, cross device functionality and middle market clients, especially in the U.S.Stock, a potential acquisition target, deserves to trade at a premium, considering the position in the retargeting marketing space and market leading growth rate.","Other than the timing of going public, Criteo (CRTO) has limited similarity to some of the high profile ad tech names that are falling off the cliff over the past few weeks due to not living up to the expectations. The company is fast establishing its leadership in the retargeting marketing space and one of the best-positioned advertising technology (Ad Tech) names to benefit from the rollout of emerging technologies like the cross device functionality or the growth of mobile traffic.As some of the loosely similar ad tech peers failed to deliver consistently just after going public, an otherwise excellent execution of the business was not spared from the general investor distaste for the space. Besides the sentiment, concerns regarding the long term growth prospects of the retargeting technology caused the investors to adopt a wait and watch attitude towards the company, which was somewhat exaggerated by a not so cheap valuation and limited track record as a public company.But the consistently strong performance is already proving naysayers wrong, while fundamentals suggest that momentum may just continue and investors may be well served by taking a closer look at the name. The rollout of a new generation of prediction engine, multi screen solution and expansion across clients and publishers is providing a strong push to the top line. The expected launch of a new generation of Criteo prediction engine, deepening partnership with Facebook, expansion across new channels like email and the rollout of a cross device matching engine may act as significant positive catalysts for the business. Margins, except the adjusted EBITDA margin that is somewhat held up due to increased level of operating expenses, are already trailing near the high end of the long-term model range.The stock may look less impressive based on some of the traditional valuation metrics, but high visibility and strong momentum should help the business live up to the expectations set by the relatively rich valuation, especially for deep value oriented investors. Hardly any business in the Ad Tech space can claim a revenue growth rate of 60-70% per year, deliver gross margins consistently above 70%, generate positive cash flows and have revenues reaching half a billion dollars, all of which should make the business a good acquisition target.Technology makes the differenceEven though broader trends within the Ad Tech space are bound to affect names like Criteo, Rocket Fuel (FUEL), YuMe (YUME), Rubicon (RUBI) and TubeMogul (TUBE) similarly in the short term, there are enough technical differences among the names that should lead to significant divergence between the fundamental performance of the names over time, a fact that seems somewhat ignored by the market so far. Most investors may already know that Criteo is mainly focusing on the retargeting market, which is serving personalized ads based on customers' online history and the revenue model works on a cost per click (CPC) basis. Whereas other names mainly focus on providing automated solutions to buy advertising and revenues are mostly based on commitments by customers, which can 'loosely' be clubbed under ad buying platforms. Please refer to my previous note on YuMe, the stock which I'm long for more details on the subject.Confusion emanating from the volatile performance of ad buying platforms due to revenue lumpiness, inventory quality issues and lack of clarity about how far is the company from launching a fully enabled solution for programmatic Real Time Bidding (RTB), may have overshadowed Criteo, but provides an opportunity for investors looking for a high quality and high growth name with positive catalysts.With a client retention rate of more than 90%, generating over 75% of the business from uncapped budgets and increasing the total amount of post click sales for clients by 77% last year, which is higher than the revenue of the Criteo, the retargeting solutions offered by the company hold significant value for the clients, which is leading to consistent performance, unlike other Ad Tech names.Positive catalysts - Technology and productsThe company's ability to develop new products faster, taking it to market faster and then getting those adopted faster, which is evident from 80% of the clients using a multi-screen solution within one year of introduction or adoption of the new prediction engine by 95% of the company's clients within a few quarters of the product entering into production, has helped the performance so far. Going forward, mobile, cross device solutions and new channels, like email, hold promise for the current year's top line growth.Mobile, which accounts for almost 30% of global e-commerce, for the company should get a boost from initiatives like mobile native ads on major social platforms, solutions that support performance advertising on Facebook's mobile app, and adding other players that can bring significant mobile inventory to the mix. After delivering the first in-app advertisement on the network in the last quarter, merely scaling up Facebook's in-app inventory can deliver decent growth for mobile. Similarly, further push on email, which is a relatively new channel for the company, should also help the top line growth.The company, being one of the few companies capable of doing exact match, should benefit from the full rollout of cross device matching functionality after releasing the first version in the previous quarter, especially with the increased focus on campaign performance and the proliferation of different types of devices. Prediction technology, after the launch of the new Criteo Engine, is another growth driver for the company with better optimization technology. The technology should help clients with a large assorted range of products.Positive catalysts - Geographical and market expansionGeographically, revenues are heavily skewed towards Europe, but this stands in sharp contrast to the market, approximately 50% of which is based in the North America. Close to a triple digit growth rate in the U.S. should get further help from the planned increased investment in the New York office. Besides catching up in the U.S. market, Asia Pacific and China should benefit from the new sales organization in Japan, the launch of the APAC middle market organization and deals with local RTB platforms in China and Korea.From a market segment standpoint, middle market organizations hold significant promise for the company. Even though the company's penetration in the segment is still small, close to a triple digit revenue growth rate from the middle market segment should help close the gap fast. As the company does more direct deals with the publishers, especially for the premium inventory, it should help maintain the growth momentum within the middle market.Good business at a fair priceTrading at 25-30 times next year's estimated earnings, the business is clearly not for the deep value focused investors, but for all others, there is enough value to deserve a closer look that suggests the ability to live into expectations.Considering the strong revenue trends of the last few years, low market penetration, technical leadership and other developments discussed, estimates of 40-45% revenue growth for this year and 20-30% for next year seem conservative. On top of strong revenue growth rate, there is significant leverage in the model, which should help the earnings grow disproportionately.Earnings to some extent are held up due to a high level of spending, but most of it is growth driven investments, while cash flows are consistent and strong, with free cash flow representing almost 93% of the adjusted EBITDA. Some of the more prominent investments this year are:Investor Presentation CriteoSince the business is more comparable to similar solutions from listed entities like Amazon, EBay and Google, comparing valuation metrics with those players should eliminate any major doubts over valuation, especially in light of the significantly higher growth rate of Criteo. There is hardly any acquisition premium built in the stock, but the business should attract businesses looking to scale or enter into the retargeting business. Past acquisitions in the space, deals like Conversant or the Dotomi acquisition, were done at approximately 3.5-4 times sales, which were growing at a significantly lower rate than Criteo's current growth rate.ConclusionSignificant technological superiority suggests that the current momentum is sustainable. The rollout of cross device functionality, new generation prediction engine and mobile offering, combined with a push into gaining market share in the U.S. and middle market segments, should act as significant positive catalysts. The technical edge enjoyed by the product offerings of the company seems somewhat under-appreciated in the existing investor arguments and deserves a closer inspection, especially in light of the strong relationship with the likes of Facebook, good operating metrics and decent margins. The valuation is somewhat overshadowed by high levels of growth driven investments, while the business has high operating leverage and good free cash flow conversion. The company looks like a good acquisition target, even though little premium is attached to the stock."

1815982,26861,2013-11-07T08:00:37-05:00,,"There has been a lot of focus and publication with respect to the ad-tech market over the past year, especially as 2013 has seen an increase in IPO activity. Much excitement has been made regarding growth trends for companies within the industry, however, not many of these companies are profitable, nor do many even generate positive operating cash flow.Most recent IPOs including Marin Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRIN), Tremor Video, Inc. (TRMR), YuMe, Inc. (NYSE:YUME), and Rocket Fuel (NASDAQ:FUEL) all have led to a public company, which holds a strong cash position post IPO. But for the most part, these companies have been burning cash each quarter. This begs the question, will the IPO infusion of cash lead to a sustainable business, or not? With this week's expectations for Twitter, Inc. (NYSE:TWTR) taking the bar to another level, it will be interesting to see how these companies shape up over a longer-term perspective as many have just begun operating within the last 5-8 years.This brings us to last week's newest public ad-tech company, Criteo S.A. (NASDAQ:CRTO). The company went public on October 30th and closed near $35/share with a market capitalization just over $1.9 billion. Criteo is a French-based ad-tech company that claims to enable e-commerce companies to leverage large volumes of granular data to efficiently engage and convert their customers. The company utilizes proprietary predictive software algorithms incorporating insights into expressed consumer intent and purchasing habits to price and deliver relevant and personalized Internet and mobile display advertisements in real time. The predictive software algorithms and insights is what should catch investor attention as this terminology is similar to how Rocket Fuel describes some of its business characteristics.Using predictive software algorithms and developing automated processes is a natural progression stemming from real-time bidding exchanges, or RTBs, and the continued expectations for exponential growth in product-related data. These automated processes eliminate time-consuming manual structures to more efficiently allow for advertisers to better understand and interpret consumer behavior and to make stronger connections through engagement. Both Criteo and Rocket Fuel have developed technology solutions for these reasons among others.There are some interesting distinctions between Criteo and its ad-tech peers, most notably Rocket Fuel. Discrepancies include customer relationships and factors such as customer growth; revenue trends and geography segment trends; gross margin and operations; operating cash flow; and focus and breadth of technology solutions and integration.From an investment standpoint, we need to dig deeper as to why these discrepancies exist. A couple of important themes present themselves when we do this. The first theme is that the technology solution offered by the two companies is not directly the same. There is definitely a core overlap, but not an equal application despite similar company strategies. The second theme is that each company's execution related to the purchase of advertiser inventory is at complete opposite ends. This is the primary reason for why there is divergence between gross margins.For example, Criteo is spending more money on traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, as a percentage of revenue, than most all other ad-tech peers. Typically, this is not a good trend for the future of an ad-intensive business, however, Criteo has identified that this trend will continue and that it is an important strategy for growing the company's active clients and revenue. Rocket Fuel on the other hand has a much lower TAC as a percentage of revenue. The company utilizes its proprietary technology to match advertiser inventory to demand on a selective and efficient basis. This is notable as Criteo uses its technology to effectively match supply and demand at a much broader scale with its access to thousands of publishers and advertisers through direct relationships.In order to provide market-related context for these themes and discrepancies, the following sections will be examined between Criteo and Rocket Fuel:While the focus will be on comparing Criteo to Rocket Fuel, other pertinent ad-tech companies will be included within the analysis to help add to each section's context. From these sections, investors can begin to understand whether Criteo has any significant competitive advantages or glaring weaknesses.GROWTH AND SCALECustomersRevenue growth for the ad-tech industry is driven by advertising customers or clients. Typically these customers represent brands through major advertising holding companies, advertising agencies, or directly through advertisers. For the ad-tech industry, the four largest advertising holding companies have played a major role in generating customer-related contracts.In the case of Criteo, the company has disclosed that it generates a significant majority of its revenues directly from advertiser client contracts rather than major advertising holding companies. Over the previous three years, the company has maintained over 80% of its active clients through direct advertiser relationships. This translates to roughly 3,300 direct advertiser client relationships as the company had over 4,000 active clients as of June 2013.To put this into perspective, Rocket Fuel has amassed 784 active customers to date, of which the majority are represented by advertising holding companies and agencies. Many other companies in the ad-tech space have stated similarly, that they work mostly through advertising holding companies and their agencies. Regardless, it would appear that not many companies have successfully scaled to the level of Criteo. Marin Software has roughly 584 active advertisers, YuMe has roughly 439 direct advertising customers, and Tremor Video does not list a number, but most likely is in the 500 or so range. Millennial Media, Inc. (NYSE:MM) is another ad-tech business, which does not disclose their number of active advertiser customers.Before we get too excited here, it should be noted that when comparing Criteo to Rocket Fuel there are differences between how these companies define their active customers. Criteo explains that they count specific brands or divisions within the same business as distinct clients so long as those entities have separately signed insertion orders. Rocket Fuel states that they count all advertisers within a single corporate structure as one customer even in cases where multiple brands, branches, or divisions of an organization enter into separate contracts. For clarity an insertion order and a contract should be considered the same. This would indicate that there is not a one to one comparison between the number of disclosed active clients and customers.Active customer growth is an important measure as it allows investors to better get a sense of the key driver for an ad-tech company's growth prospects. The fact that Criteo and Rocket Fuel have contrary active customer definitions places somewhat of a damper on this. The table below provides a snapshot of information comparing advertiser customer growth where data is available.(Click to enlarge)Additionally during 2012, Criteo's largest client represented 5% of revenue, and in 2012 Criteo's largest ten clients represented 17% of revenue in the aggregate. Rocket Fuel states that for the year ended December 2012, no single customer represented more than 10% of the company's revenue. Rocket Fuel also states that at the end of 2012, the company's top 20 customers accounted for 38% of revenue. YuMe states that their top 20 customers in 2012 accounted for approximately 50% of revenue, and that an agency within Omnicom Media Group Holdings Inc. (NYSE:OMC) accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2012. Based on these numbers for Rocket Fuel, the company has stated that they foresee the need to continue to rely on a smaller portion of customers to generate a significant amount of the company's revenue.From this information it is safe to assume that Criteo has established a strong competitive position based on the fact that it has a legitimate connection with direct advertisers. It is interesting that Criteo is the only company to provide a client retention rate in addition to a revenue retention rate. The client retention rate is based on active clients from the previous quarter to the current quarter. All companies on this list decisively place an emphasis on the importance of growing advertiser customers to generate future revenue growth. If an ad-tech company is not able to continue to scale its business, the risk of competition will become increasingly impactful over time. Based on growth trends, Rocket Fuel will most likely grow to 1,300 or so active customers over the next year, while Criteo will most likely be approaching 6,000. While not comparable we need to continue to pay attention to active customer growth based upon each company's definition. We also need to pay attention whether either company adjusts its active customer definition over time.On another note, Rocket Fuel appears to be ahead of Criteo based on market verticals served. Criteo has taken a methodical approach to scale to a significant level within the retail, classifieds, and travel verticals. Criteo expects that it will continue to develop its solutions for other verticals in a similar manner resulting in more opportunities. Both companies rely heavily upon display advertising revenue. One of Rocket Fuel's strategies is to shift towards other channels including social, mobile, and video. With mobile ad exchanges taking form such as the recent partnership between Millennial Media and AppNexus Inc., both companies will naturally target these automated exchanges with their technology solutions.A final note of interest related to advertiser clients is the following risk disclosed by Criteo:Criteo places a high value on maintaining advertiser client relationships directly versus through an intermediary. The company feels that this direct relationship is important for highlighting Criteo's value of technology solution intimately versus clients attributing the value of Criteo to an advertising agency. This is something to think about when there are many other companies out there, which are more dependent upon advertising agencies and their holding companies, including Rocket Fuel.Total Revenue and Revenue Ex-TACSo now that we have an idea of how advertiser customers compare between Criteo, Rocket Fuel, and a few peers, we can shift gears to revenues. Both Criteo and Rocket Fuel have emerged as two of the fastest growing ad-tech companies of late. The table below sets the stage for comparative revenue growth measures.(Click to enlarge)*Costs are not associated with TAC - Facebook cost of revenue is associated with operation of data centers and transaction fees; Marin Software cost of revenue is associated with cloud infrastructure and global services.There are a couple of items of interest when comparing revenue growth for ad-tech companies. First, investors need to understand that TAC is an important component for total revenue growth and revenue ex-TAC growth. Another point is that not all advertising companies include TAC within their cost of revenue. The clearest way to understand this is to consider Google, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB). Google through its AdSense and distribution arrangements provides 25% of its revenues to Google network members' websites. Facebook on the other hand, does not generate revenue off of other websites as it is a primary publisher of advertisements for brands through its own website.For ad-tech companies such as Criteo, the entire premise of their business model revolves around connecting advertiser clients with advertising inventory. As an example, Criteo accesses advertising inventory through various channels, including through direct relationships with publishers, advertising exchange platforms [such as DoubleClick Ad Exchange, Yahoo!'s (YHOO) Right Media, Facebook's Exchange, and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Ad Exchange], and other platforms that aggregate the supply of advertising inventory, such as AppNexus, Admeld Inc., The Rubicon Project, Inc., and PubMatic, Inc. In 2012 and the first half of 2013, Google's and AppNexus's advertising inventory represented over 30% of Criteo's TAC.Other peers similarly spend a significant amount on advertising inventory. Rocket Fuel provides consistent information regarding a broad range of advertising networks and exchanges, including real time advertising exchanges, such as Google's DoubleClick Ad Exchange or AppNexus; suppliers of video and mobile inventory; and social media platforms, such as the Facebook Exchange, known as FBX.What investors need to gather from this information is that Criteo as a percentage of revenue is spending more money on advertising inventory to supply advertiser clients than any other ad-tech company listed; with the exception being Millennial Media. Despite this, Criteo is the only company amongst its closest peers that experiences a decline in growth rate when comparing total revenue growth versus revenue ex-TAC growth in the first half of the year for 2013. For a company creating a ""liquid market,"" it would appear that this approach has resulted in a lower margin business.This observation directly relates to the second theme mentioned in the introduction related to Criteo's focus on purchasing significant amounts of advertising inventory. The company's primary objective is to provide ""deep liquidity of demand and supply."" However, it should strike us that pretty much all other companies are seeing stronger growth for ""net"" revenues, especially in the case of Rocket Fuel. Criteo's explanation is that this is a result of the purchasing of lower margin advertising inventory on an individual impression basis and, to a lesser extent, increased competition.Rocket Fuel has the lowest TAC margin among its closest peers. Rocket Fuel has developed a technology solution, which has the primary objective of matching advertiser customer demand on an impression-by-impression basis to optimize each campaign's objectives. This brings us full-circle to our first theme regarding the application of technology solutions between the two companies.At this point it is also worth mentioning that companies like Criteo, Rocket Fuel, and Millennial Media will always need to increase supply to compensate growth in advertiser customers. Unlike Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and others such as TripAdvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP), there is no other website or ad-related property to offset this infrastructure demand and supply marketplace model.Revenue GeographyRocket Fuel lists one of its key strategies as increasing international revenue. This is an area where Criteo is much further along and potentially presents a substantial competitive threat over time.(Click to enlarge)Criteo's fastest growing geographies in order fall within Japan, the Asia-Pacific excluding Japan, the Americas excluding the U.S., the U.S., and the UK. For Rocket Fuel it appears that the company's North America geography is displaying consistent growth over the first half of 2013. The company's international geography revenue growth has substantially declined over the same period.Despite no clear comparable geography between the two, it is worth reiterating the fact that Criteo seems to be prospering with its direct client advertiser relationships and growing publisher relationships. A clear example of this is the company's strategic relationship with Yahoo! Japan Corporation, which gives Criteo privileged access to its advertising inventory for delivering personalized display advertisements. Japan as a result, is Criteo's most robust growing geography. If Criteo is successful in developing similar strategic relationships, this may further accelerate revenue growth.OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITYBefore we consider Criteo's operations and profitability, it should be highlighted that the company has generated profits the previous few years as well as positive operating cash flow. This is a slight anomaly as one would expect that the company with the highest TAC would find itself in the same no profit and no operating cash flow zone in line with its peers.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)* The first table provides nominal information to be considered against the second table's percentage information. The data in second table compares the first six months of operations for 2013 against the publicly available annual trends.Despite the fact that Criteo has been able to generate profits in the past, the company is beginning to fall in line with its peers as it continues to spend more on sales and marketing or S&M. Aside from Millennial Media's S&M shenanigans (it would appear they have confused S&M with general and administrative or G&A), Criteo does spend significantly less on S&M versus its peers. Rocket Fuel appears to be taking a much more aggressive approach with S&M. Based on the above information, not one of these companies was able to have a profitable operation during the first half of 2013, when considering primary operating expenses (depreciation and amortization are not explicitly included).Criteo's lower S&M costs are a reflection of the company's structure and direct relationship focus with advertisers and publishers. Both Criteo and Rocket Fuel espouse the ""virtuous cycle"" effects of their technology solutions, however, it is quite clear that Rocket Fuel and Criteo's divided approach to achieving similar strategies is evident with their operating expenses as well as revenue ex-TAC.Operating Cash FlowTo date, Criteo has been one of the few companies to generate positive operating cash flow. In fact, the company generated over $15 million during 2012.(Click to enlarge)*DSO is an abbreviation for days sales outstanding and DPO is an abbreviation for days payables outstanding.As Criteo's profits have declined over the past three years, the company's operating cash flow has remained stable and actually is displaying increasing trends for 2012 and the first half of 2013. The leading items generating operating cash flow are amortization, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and trade payables and accrued expenses. Payable and accrued expenses can primarily be attributed to TAC and growing employee expenses.Criteo has a substantially better days sales outstanding, or DSO than its industry peers. Increased TAC-related payables could be cause for concern, but Criteo's days payables outstanding, or DPO, remain near 100 days, in-line with most of its peers. With the company's ability to collect its receivables faster than peers, continued growth in non-cash generating payables should not hamper its business. Despite Criteo's positive operating cash flow, the company still finds itself in the same boat as all public ad-tech companies when it comes to capital expenditures; Criteo has been unable to generate positive free cash flow.Most ad-tech companies are displaying positive trends towards operating cash flow. Criteo's scale may be an indication as well as an example of a revenue level necessary to produce positive operating cash flows, however, it will remain to be seen whether further growth will yield free cash flow.TECHNOLOGYThe technology side of the assessment between Criteo and Rocket Fuel serves as the bridge between the two themes expressed in the introduction and the customer, revenue, and operating characteristics for each company. Within each companies' business overview, significant research reports are relied upon stating expected robust growth for digital advertising categories including search, display, mobile, social, and video. Most of us do not dispute these forecasts, but rather ask that companies like Criteo and Rocket Fuel prove to us that they have legitimate business models, which are sustainable; this is easier said than done. It makes the most sense to get a glimpse of each company's strategies and perceived competitive advantages before getting into their technology solutions.Strategies and Competitive FactorsTo simplify this section a list for strategies and competitive factors for each company is provided.Criteo's strategies:Criteo's competitive strengths:Rocket Fuel's strategies:Rocket Fuel's competitive strengths:For both companies it is very interesting that they basically match each other's strategies almost one for one. However, when considering competitive strengths, we begin to get a sense of Criteo's emphasis on a demand and supply marketplace connected with technology versus Rocket Fuel's more specific technology platform focus.TechnologyBoth companies have sections where they provide their respective explanations of their technology solutions. Rocket Fuel tends to provide a more general overview with a focus on the company's technology platform. Criteo divulges more details regarding how their marketplace structure is integrated into the Criteo Engine. Both company technology platforms provide a similar core solution. Components to this solution include predictive algorithms, recommendation algorithms, automated decision-making technologies, big data processing capabilities, bidding engines or adapters, and validation testing to inform the automated processes.The one area that distinguishes these companies based on their technology is the underlying access to data assets. For instance, Criteo states that for every new client, the company requires the client to place software code on their website to enable Criteo to gather and import data regarding consumer behavior on that website, such as which products or services each visitor to the website has viewed. The company uses cookies and similar tracking technologies, to collect information about the interaction of users with the company's advertisers' and publishers' websites (including, for example, information about the placement of advertisements and users' shopping or other interactions with the company's clients' websites or advertisements).Criteo has access to large volumes of granular data from their clients, which carry consumer intent and are directly relevant to those clients' campaigns. This integration gives Criteo privileged insight into users' behavioral history at the product level for each client, representing a very high-quality data asset. Specific client's data is only used for the benefit of that client. Criteo also utilizes third-party data as part of this process.Rocket Fuel only provides similar information within its risk factor section and states that the company uses ""cookies"" (small text files) to deliver its solution. The company's cookies are known as ""third party cookies"" because they are placed on individual browsers when Internet users visit a website owned by a publisher, advertiser, or other first party that has given Rocket Fuel permission to place cookies. The cookies record non-personal information, such as when an Internet user views an ad, clicks on an ad, or visits one of the company's advertiser's websites through a browser while the cookie is active.Rocket Fuel uses these cookies to help achieve advertisers' campaign goals, to help ensure that the same Internet user does not unintentionally see the same advertisement, to report aggregate information to advertisers regarding the performance of their advertising campaigns, and to detect and prevent fraudulent activity throughout the company's network of inventory. Data from cookies is also used to help decide whether to bid on, and how to price, an opportunity to place an advertisement in a certain location, at a given time, in front of a particular Internet user.In addition to Criteo's access to primary client data, the company has negotiated direct and privileged access with publishers, giving it the opportunity to purchase on an impression by impression basis and in real time, inventory that a publisher might otherwise only sell subject to minimum volume commitments; and/or particular advertising impressions before such impressions are made available to other potential buyers. This is why Criteo is spending more money on TAC than its peers. The company has amassed 3,300 direct client relationships with access to first party data and combined this demand with over 6,000 publisher partners and leading RTB internet display exchanges to create its ""liquid"" automated marketplace.Based on this, it would appear that Criteo has an advantage over Rocket Fuel with respect to advertiser client and publisher relationships. However, Criteo focuses on providing its automated processes and insights for its live advertiser clients who have had users or consumers, who have previously engaged with the advertiser's products or services via its website. Rocket Fuel on the other hand is focused on delivering multiple strategies including reach, frequency, and engagement, brand lift equity, offline sales, for all users and potential consumers, as well as prospecting and retargeting existing users or consumers.Criteo will definitely expand its offerings to capture broader advertiser budgets, and for this reason discloses its potential risk of increasingly depending on advertiser intermediaries. The company is positioned uniquely and will most likely continue in a methodical fashion to attempt to maintain direct advertiser relationships as it expands into new avenues and verticals.CONCLUSIONTo date, Criteo has generated more revenue than any other ad-tech company excluding companies like Google, Facebook, Yahoo, and Twitter, which have significant advertising inventory from their own web properties. Rocket Fuel is definitely growing at a more robust rate and currently has stronger margins after TACs are paid. As each company continues to pursue similar strategies and objectives in their own way, investors should focus on the key drivers. These include active customer growth, revenue growth, and revenue ex-TAC. Profits, operating cash flow, and free cash flow should also be monitored. As an example, Marin Software announced their earnings today and the results were YOY revenue growth of 30%, reduced cash and cash equivalents based on negative earnings, negative operating cash flow, and further cash spend on capital expenditures.Rocket Fuel is focusing on providing a wider breadth of advertising product offerings to most all market verticals. The company's technology solution has been widely adopted over a short time period by some of the largest advertisers. However, Criteo is building a very solid foundation as the infrastructure piece connecting advertisers to publishers on a much larger scale. For the near term, both Criteo and Rocket Fuel will experience significant increases in costs of revenue and operating expenses to pursue their goals.Ad-tech is very much in its early stages, and over time select companies will emerge as the leaders in this space. When considering the information and themes from the introduction, Criteo has a strong advantage with its advertiser client and publisher connections. From this position, the company will possibly be able to better execute its strategies versus a company like Rocket Fuel, which is more dependent upon major advertising holding companies. I will let the modelers argue over which company's technology is better. I'm placing my bet on the company getting cozy with the widest breadth of direct advertiser client data and publisher advertising inventory privileges.Disclosure: I am long CRTO, MM, TRIP.

Moreover, much of the plugin's recent growth comes from the U.S., which still claims an outsized share of online ad spend.A silver lining: Ad-blocker usage isn't nearly as high on mobile browsers as it is on PC browsers, and mobile apps are generally uncovered.Ad-blockers are less of a threat to Google, Facebook, and Twitter than they are to publishers and ad tech firms depending heavily on PC display and video ads.","AdBlock Plus (""ABP""), the most popular ad-blocker of them all, has topped 100M active users. Parent company Eyeo adds much of ABP's recent growth has come from ""countries like"" the U.S. (accounts for a very disproportionate share of global online ad spend) and the U.K. Usage in countries like Germany and France, where ABP saw much of its initial growth - Eyeo is based in Germany - is said to be ""fairly stable.""One caveat: ABP counts each device on which its plugin is used as a separate ""user."" Still, the figure shows the growing pervasiveness of ad-blockers in lucrative developed markets, and helps explain the alarm many online publishers feel about the technology. Some publishers now insist readers disable ad-blocking before being allowed to read their content (results for this tactic have been mixed), and various firms tied to the online ad industry have threatened suing ad-blocking software developers.But mobile provides a relative safe haven for the industry: Ads within mobile apps typically aren't stopped by ad-blockers - it's worth noting here Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) now get a solid majority of their ad revenue from their apps - and while ABP and similar plugins exist for mobile browsers, usage doesn't appear to be nearly as high as it is for PC browsers. iOS 9's support for Mobile Safari ad-blockers produced a lot of headlines last September, but (according to ad tech firm AdRoll) the amount of ad inventory (bid requests) available on Mobile Safari only briefly dipped before continuing to rise. And on Android, ABP is provided for Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) browser and a standalone AdBlock Browser, but not for Google Chrome.In spite of the arrival of Mobile Safari ad-blockers last September, Mobile Safari ad inventory continues growing. Source: AdRoll (via Mashable).Moreover, ABP has placed 700+ entities on a whitelist, after deeming their ads to be ""non-intrusive"" - like many others, Eyeo seems to understand users typically don't object to all ads, but rather ones that seriously affect the user experience. Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) search ads (still easily the company's biggest revenue-generator) are whitelisted by ABP, even as YouTube ads and various Google display ads shown on third-party sites aren't. Digiday reports Google is exploring the creation of its own policy for ""acceptable"" ads that can provide a better user experience and slow down ad-blocking adoption.Rather than Google, Facebook, or Twitter, publishers that still get a large portion of their revenue from PC display and video ads - Demand Media (DMD) and WebMD (NASDAQ:WBMD) come to mind here - may have the most to lose from ad-blocking. Ad tech firms servicing such publishers and/or their advertisers - examples include Rocket Fuel (NASDAQ:FUEL), Criteo (NASDAQ:CRTO), and The Rubicon Project (RUBI) - are also vulnerable. The rise of ABP and its peers makes growing mobile ad sales an even bigger priority for firms in the crosshairs."

The firm will offer 7.2 million shares at an expected price range of $23.00-$26.00. At the midpoint of that range at $24.50 per share, CRTO will command a market value of $1.5 billion.SummaryFounded in late 2005, Criteo is a global technology company that allows companies to use large volumes of granular data to engage customers with specific advertisements. The firm's solution is comprised of the Criteo Engine - a set of proprietary predictive software algorithms - data assets, access to display advertising inventory, and advertiser and publisher platforms. Criteo's solution prices and delivers relevant and personalized internet and mobile display advertisements in real time.Criteo collects massive amounts of data from its clients and other sources in order to enable and improve its engine; the firm observed over $200 billion in sales transactions on our clients' websites in the twelve months ended June 30, 2013 whether or not a consumer saw or clicked on a Criteo advertisement. The firm delivered targeted advertisements that generated approximately 1.5 billion clicks over the same period, leading to over $6.5 billion in post-click sales. As of June 30, 2013, the firm had over 4,000 clients, and in each of the last three years its client retention rate was approximately 90%.ValuationCriteo offers the following figures in its F-1 balance sheet for the six months ending June 30, 2013:ConclusionWe're positive on this IPO if it prices in the $23 to $26 range . Though Criteo wasn't profitable in the first half of 2013, it did turn a small profit for calendar 2012. Ad tech IPOs in general have been a mixed bag in 2013; the success of explosive stars like Rocket Fuel (NASDAQ:FUEL) has been tempered by flops like YuMe Inc (NYSE:YUME) and Tremor Video (TRMR). The market for ad tech in general should continue to grow as the global economy transitions more and more to an online marketplace, but there is no guarantee that ad tech firms will be able to convert a larger market into profit.BusinessCriteo relies on its ability to collect data through web browsers in order to maintain and improve its predictive engine. In order to collect this data it must employ technologies like cookies and similar tracking technologies. However, recent voter pushback against such technologies and ""snooping"" in general has led to proposed and enacted legislation preventing or restricting these technologies both in the EU and the US, which may have a negative impact on Criteo's ability to collect critical data.Large Internet and technology companies like Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), AOL, Inc. (NYSE:AOL), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY), Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Google Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) have the power to alter the internet display advertising marketplace in ways potentially harmful to Criteo, especially in terms of data collection. Apple, for instance, warned iOS developers in August 2011 that it would limit their access to unique device identifiers, or UDIDs, and subsequently instructed developers to make use of other identifiers, such as a new Identifier for Advertising, or IDFA, which was introduced by Apple in Fall 2012. In May 2013, the Apple App Store stopped accepting iOS apps and updates attempting to mine UDID data. While this change was not directly harmful to Criteo, since it did not use UDIDs, similar changes easily could be.ManagementCo-founder, Chairman, and CEO Jean-Baptiste Rudelle, has been with Criteo since its inception in 2005.

Its technology yields excellent results for its clients as seen in the following statement:""Criteo delivered over 2 billion advertisements in June 2013 on Yahoo Japan, up from 500 million at launch in September 2012. Criteo's display ads have performed significantly better than standard display ads shown on the Yahoo Japan sites, with a click-through-rate that is thirty times higher than the average for other banners shown on Yahoo Japan's sites."" (Source: IPO prospectus)2. Rapid revenue growth:The company is showing rapid revenue growth since last few years. Its revenues increased from €65.6 million ($65.6 million US) in 2010 to €143.6 million ($143.6 million) in 2011 and €271.9 million ($271.9 million) in 2012.For the six months ended June 30, 2013 its revenues increased to €194.3 million ($194.3 million) from €113.1 million ($113.1 million) for the six months ended June 30, 2012.3. Customer quality and growth in customer base:The company serves some of the biggest and most demanding clients like Yahoo JAPAN, Expedia Staples, Macy's, etc. The company showed a rapid growth in the number of customers it serves, from 832 in FY 2010 to 4199 during H1 FY 2013 (see the chart below).4. Industry growth rate (explained above).5.

Moreover, it holds a direct relationship with over 76.2% of its advertiser clients.Client retention rate and revenue retention rate both are the measure of client satisfaction and effectiveness of the company's solution.Its client retention rate, in each of 2010, 2011 and 2012, was approximately 90%.For the years ended December 31, 2011, and 2012 and the twelve months ended June 30, 2013, its revenue retention rate was 159%, 155% and 145%, respectively.""We define our revenue retention rate with respect to a given twelve-month period as (1) revenue recognized during such period from clients that contributed to revenue recognized in the prior twelve-month period divided by (2) total revenue recognized in such prior twelve-month period."" (Source: IPO prospectus)6. Infrastructure:Its global infrastructure includes over 3,000 servers and 160-node Hadoop clusters, providing a storage capacity exceeding six petabytes.7. Entry in mobile segment:In the first quarter of 2013, it launched a solution for mobile advertising and further enhances it with its recent acquisition of Ad-X, a technology company that allows businesses to track and optimize mobile display advertising campaigns delivered to smartphones and tablets.8. Geographically diverse operations and global reach:The company generates its revenues from geographically diverse locations (see the chart below). The company has a significant global presence as it operates globally in 37 countries. This geographic spread, to some extent, shall save it from any region specific slowdown.Negatives:1. Highly competitive industry:The market for online display advertisement is highly competitive. Its prominent competitors include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).2. Declining growth rate (see the table below):The company's revenue growth rate is coming down, though some slowdown in the revenue growth rate is acceptable due to the higher base effect. Its gross margins are also coming down due to high traffic acquisition costs which may be a cause of concern.3. Normal business risks:Normal business risks like emergence of new competitors with better product/service offerings, any adverse change in Govt. regulations, any economic slowdown, etc.4. Change in the online customer privacy regulations:Any change in regulations regarding online privacy of customers can limit its ability to collect data and can reduce the effectiveness of its technology significantly.Valuations:At $24.5 (mid range of offer price) the company's valuations stand at $1.3 billion.At $24.5, the company is available at P/S of about 2.9 (""TTM""), without traffic acquisition costs, the company is available at P/S of about 7.21 (""TTM"").Conclusion:The company operates in the rapidly evolving, fragmented and competitive industry where it competes with some of the world's biggest companies, like: Google, Yahoo (YHOO), Amazon and eBay. These companies are much bigger than the company, but the success in the industry is technology driven, not size driven, so even a small company with a better technology can easily compete with much bigger companies. Its past growth and clientele tells a lot about the quality of its solution but on the negative side it has a limited operational historyThe company is in its growth phase so the operating expenses are on the higher side and is expected to increase in the near future, at least in absolute terms. Its recent entry in the mobile space will do well for its future and will accelerate its growth rate. Another thing that will add more sheen to the company is its financial position, its balance-sheet is healthy and its income statement shows profit for the last few years (though the company reported a loss for the latest six months).The company deals in the online advertisement industry and can process big data on a real-time basis. The online advertisement industry and big data processing capabilities both are expected to create lots of enthusiasm among investors due to its future growth potential.Data source: IPO prospectus.Disclaimer: Investments in stock markets carry significant risk, stock prices can rise or fall without any understandable or fundamental reasons.

The price has since seen little change, fluctuating between $29.90 and $32.57.With the ending of the quiet period, the firm's underwriters, including J.P.

The stock closed at $31.92 per share on November 13.Our research work over the past two years, along with recent academic studies, have empirically evidenced a correlation between the quantity and visibility of underwriters and an increase in the price of shares at the close of the quiet period. Prices typically begin to increase several days in advance of the expiration of the quiet period, as experienced investors understand that the underwriters will release exclusively positive information about the stock - they would have little incentive to do otherwise.

Criteo's solution delivers customized internet and mobile display advertisements, and has the ability to price them in real time.Criteo generates huge quantities of data through its clients and through other sources, allowing it to constantly improve the Criteo engine; over the course of the twelve months ending June 30, 2013, the firm took data from over $200 billion in sales transactions on clients' websites. The firm is able to collect data regardless of whether or not the consumer in question clicked on a Criteo-based advertisement.

The firm had in excess of 4,000 clients as of June 30, 2013, and maintained a client retention rate of approximately 90% for the past three years.There is some risk inherent in Criteo's dependence on client website data, given the recent public rejection of the cookies and adware that allow Criteo to collect its data. Legislation has been proposed and in some cases passed to limit the legality of such devices in both the United States and the European Union.CONCLUSIONCRTO has proven very effective in its ad placement, and has proven its ability to be profitable-though the firm posted losses for the first half of 2013, it did turn a small profit for calendar 2012.

(CSGP) is the self-proclaimed “number one provider of information, analytics and online marketplaces to the commercial real estate industry in the United States and the United Kingdom.” Indeed, it has a leading commercial real estate database, research department and operates several online marketplaces for commercial real estate and apartment listings. The company has several brands including “CoStar, LoopNet, Apartments.com, STR, Ten-X, BizBuySell and Lands of America.”What I really like about this company is that it has performed exceptionally well through the pandemic, with Q2 2020 YoY revenue growth of 16% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 17%, similar to pre-pandemic growth. In fact, the company is doing so well that the management has reinstated guidance for the remainder of the year.In some respects, CoStar Group’s business is countercyclical to the general economy. Real estate activities are still a necessity in real estate, even in a bad economy. Many of CoStar Group’s areas of business experienced record levels of traffic as the quarter progressed after a slow start.In addition, the acquisition of auction site Ten-X in late June should be a big plus financially. Ten-X facilitates online auctions of distressed properties which are on the rise in this economy, and the company should be a nice fit strategically:Historically, CoStar Group has a reputation for M&A activity, with more than 30 acquired companies since the company was founded. Companies have been acquired during recessionary periods.After raising capital this summer, CoStar Group now has $3.5 billion in cash waiting to be applied to new acquisitions. The company management has indicated that they are in no hurry but will wait for the best opportunities.Given the company’s apparent resilience to the pandemic and recession, CoStar Group’s stock price has been moving to new all-time highs. This may be a sign of more bullish action to come as Mr. Market gives its two thumbs up.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)The plot below illustrates how CoStar Group stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward EV/Sales versus forward revenue growth. Note: Please refer to a recent article for more information on the scatter plot-relative valuation technique.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)CoStar Group is situated above the best-fit line on the scatter plot, suggesting that the stock is overvalued on a relative basis relative to its peers based on expected future revenue growth and its forward sales multiple.A better valuation technique may be to look at the EV/Gross Profit estimate, substituting this figure for EV/Sales estimate in the above scatter plot. CoStar Group has a better-than-average gross profit margin, giving it a better standing amongst its peers in terms of relative valuation.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)While the stock is still overvalued, it is closer to fair valuation. The question for investors then becomes a matter of whether to assume a higher risk (due to high valuation) versus the likelihood of missing the opportunity. In my estimation, the exceptional company fundamentals (Rule of 40 and cash on hand) plus the countercyclical nature of the business make the risk worth taking. There is a strong possibility that the stock price will never pull back to fair value.The industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to one of my previous articles.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In CoStar Group's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 17% + 31% = 48%CoStar Group scores above the 40% needed to fulfill the Rule of 40, suggesting that it has a healthy balance between growth and profitability. Note that this metric is calculated on a trailing-twelve-month basis.I have prepared another scatter plot that shows the forward-looking Rule of 40 using analysts’ estimates. Analysts usually lowball their estimates and it is more difficult to score 40. The Rule of 40 calculation is referred to as the forward efficiency score in the plot below. Note that the forward earnings margin is used in place of the free cash flow margin.As you can see, CoStar Group still meets the Rule of 40 on a forward-looking basis. This is actually quite a feat, putting the company right up there with Wall street darlings such as Datadog, Inc. (DDOG), Fastly, Inc. (FSLY), and Shopify Inc. (SHOP), but at a considerably lower EV/forward sales multiple.It seems unlikely that we will see a vaccine until at least the spring of 2021 and that depends on everything going well in Phase 3 trials for vaccine candidates. While we wait, the government and the Federal Reserve are being generous with handouts and stimulus. But the stimulus appears to be slowing down and may even stop in the near future. When the handouts stop, I expect that the stock market may become very bearish.We are in the midst of a recession, if not a depression. Government employment statistics do not really capture the true extent of the state of the economy. While the company’s business is countercyclical, an extended economic slowdown could ultimately harm the business.CoStar Group tends to acquire a lot of companies. It is possible that one or more acquisitions could be problematic. Alternatively, the company may overextend itself and have difficulty servicing its debt in an extended economic depression.CoStar Group is a leading provider of commercial real estate analytics and online marketplaces in both the United Kingdom and the United States. The company has performed quite well during the pandemic with Q2 2020 YoY revenue growth of 16% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 17%. The company management has suggested that its business is countercyclical. Although real estate activity slowed at the beginning of the pandemic, activity has picked up and reached new highs as the quarter progressed. The most recent acquisition, Ten-X, should perform well in this environment, as the company specializes in the auction of distressed real estate. There are also expected synergies as Ten-X is assimilated into the rest of the company’s business.CoStar Group has raised capital this summer and is now sitting on $3.5 billion in cash, certainly enough to survive a long recession. The company is known for its M&A activity and it is likely that one or more companies will be acquired during this economic downturn.Given CoStar Group’s strong free cash flow margin of 31% and annual revenue growth of 17%, the company scores well on the Rule of 40. The Rule of 40 is a metric that I use to assess software companies. While the stock is overvalued on a relative basis, I am still bullish based on the positive fundamentals. Mr. Market agrees with my bullishness as the stock is pushing a new all-time high. Therefore, I am giving CoStar Group a Buy rating."
4348354,20599,2020-05-18T02:33:19-04:00,"CoStar Group’s subscription-based revenue model is less immune to seasonal and cyclical variations; operating margins are best-in-class.The company has not had any outstanding debt for the last two years and continues to be an extremely strong cash flow-generating entity.I remain skeptical of significant upsides from current levels, as a lot of supply tends to come in closer to the $700 levels.","CoStar Group Inc. (CSGP) is the leading provider of information, analytics, and online marketplaces to the commercial real estate sector. Their service offering covers all commercial property types including office, retail, industrial, multifamily, commercial land, mixed-use, and hospitality. It operates through its five flagship brands - CoStar, LoopNet, Apartments.com, BizBuySell, and LandsofAmerica - which are all largely internet and mobile-based and not greatly affected by brick-and-mortar related headwinds which have cropped up in this era of social distancing.The stock has been a great wealth compounder for investors over the years and has outperformed the S&P 500 since 2017. I will explain below why this has been a great asset for investors and why the company's revenue and operating model is less immune to current risks in the commercial real estate sector. Notwithstanding these impressive qualities, I also highlight why I think it might be prudent to stay away until the stock corrects to more acceptable levels.Source: Yahoo FinanceI like CSGP’s consistent revenue model, which is somewhat immune to the vagaries of economic cycles. Firstly, do note that the company is the leader in this space, with the largest research department in the industry, a comprehensive commercial real estate database, leading online marketplaces for commercial real estate and apartment listings. It also provides more information, analytics, and marketing services than any of its competitors. From 2015 to 2020, revenue for CSGP had grown at a CAGR of 18%, with annual growth never dipping below 15%. Recently, while CSGP cut its full-year guidance, it stated that it would be looking to deliver 13% YoY revenue growth for Q2. At a time when key market participants portend that US GDP could fall by -40% in Q2, here’s a company guiding towards double-digit revenue growth for the same period. What’s the secret to this general variance, you ask?Well, the company's revenue streams are all largely subscription-based licenses that get renewed automatically with a term of at least 1 year (contract rates though may change during re-negotiations). What I also like is that CSGP charges a fixed monthly amount for its services rather than fees based on usage or number of clicks - this is where its revenue visibility mainly comes from.Then, there are some segments of its revenue profile that may even be counter-cyclical. On the recent Q1 call, CSGP’s management mentioned that when the country was in lockdown mode, search activity on one of its digital brands, Apartments.com, was succeeding pre-outbreak levels and, incidentally, saw its second-best sales month ever in April.Besides, it’s worth bearing in mind that despite the slowdown in consumer sentiment, commercial entities will still need to renew and resign their leases, and CSGP’s clients will continue to earn commissions. The broad commercial real estate industry will still also need services that help it find other investment opportunities, value properties, dispose of properties, analyze markets and also market vacancies. All these factors will continue to put the wind in the sails of CSGP’s revenue model.The company’s margins too are best-in-class, so even though you may not see sizeable benefits of any large volume increase in an economic boom (largely because of its subscription model), this steep margin structure ensures strong flow-through right to the bottom line and operating cash flow levels.Source: Seeking AlphaThe other impressive aspect of CSGP, which lends weight to their premium multiple, is its healthy balance sheet structure and exceptionally strong cash-generating profile. At a time when a lot of companies and countries the world over are taking the rap for being overleveraged, with debt-to-GDP% and net debt-to-EBITDA hitting stratospheric levels, here you have a high-growth company with no outstanding debt (Net cash of $921 million as of December 2019), and ever-growing cash flows (operating cash flows have grown at 35% CAGR, and FCF has grown at 32% CAGR from 2015-2020). Because CSGP margins are at an elite level and it doesn’t have any sizeable interest obligations and can keep working capital in control, a large part of operating profits gets converted into operating cash flow. This has seen the operating profit to operating cash flow conversion ratio (the per dollar operating profit that gets converted to operating cash flow) stay elevated at a rate greater than 1x.Source: Seeking Alpha, CSGP, Self-generatedOn the daily chart, CSGP stock is currently forming a triangle pattern. It has seen some good strength since the March 23rd lows, up c.34%, which is roughly on par with the S&P 500’s performance. This recent momentum has seen the stock bounce back up above its 50-, 100-, and 200-DMA. This is all very well, but it’s also important to consider that it’s very close to the right upper-hand side boundary resistance ($680-700) of the triangle pattern.Source: TradingViewBesides, if we look at things on the larger time frame, i.e., the monthly chart, we can see that levels about $680 have tended to form wicks, indicating strong supply pressure at those levels. Would you want to take a long position at these levels? I know I wouldn’t.Source: TradingViewBased on the monthly chart, my reading of things would be that the $500-700 zone is an area where the stock is likely to see a lot of sideways movement, consolidating here for a while before a decisive move can be made on the upside. You want to be adding long positions at the $500-550 level and not at current levels.CSGP has always traded at a premium multiple to the sector median, but the current % variance across every valuation metric - be it P/E, PEG, EV/EBITDA, EV/sales - is, quite frankly, bonkers! In times like these when one ought to be thrifty, I’m not sure a stock with such steep valuation credentials should be on your shopping list!Source: Seeking AlphaThere’s good reason to believe I’m not the only one who thinks the risk-reward on the CSGP stock at current levels is sub-optimal. Key insiders too think it might be a good time to cash out. Last week, Chairman of CSGP, Michael Klein, sold 6.1% of his stake at $639 for $9.6 million. It's worth noting that there has only been insider selling and no insider buying in the stock for the last 12 months. About 10 months ago, when the stock was trading at similar levels of around $630-ish, the CEO, Andrew Florance, sold significantly, for $15 million. When both your CEO and chairman are divesting their stake in the company at +$620 levels, and the stock is now at +$660 levels you want to tread cautiously.Source: Simply Wall StreetSource: Simply Wall StreetCSGP has a reliable revenue and operating model that will help it cope relatively well in the face of general market weakness. The company also has the balance sheet to survive a downturn and pick up cheap operating assets if the opportunity does come up. That said, now is not the time to be loading up on pricey stocks like this, and hopefully, we will have better opportunities to revisit this.Subscribers of the Lead-Lag Report will note that I expect another round of selling based on the same risk triggers I reference that went risk-off at the end of January. In fact, I had reiterated this point, during my recent interaction with MarketWatch, telling readers that I expect risk-off to return in two waves - first, in the bond space, and then, in stocks. Besides, when the smart money hasn’t really participated in the current rally, it only validates the feeling that something is amiss.The reason I bring all this up is, it’s important to remember that old investment adage which states that great companies don’t always make great investments. Considering that CSGP is up c.34% already from the March lows and likely running into key resistance points, it’s difficult to be gung-ho about significant upsides from current levels. Besides, valuations on all metrics are enormously steep. Given my current broad risk-off thesis for markets in general, I would advise investors to stay on the sidelines and wait for a correction towards support levels of $500-550 before considering an investment in an overbought and pricey asset such as CSGP. I am neutral on CSGP for now.*Like this article? Don't forget to hit the ""Follow"" button above!"

Medium-term shareholder returns can still be in the double digits, even after a valuation compression.","Over the past few weeks, we have covered several REITs, for their reliable income streams and relatively fair valuations. However, one can be invested in the sector, indirectly, without actually owning any of the properties.CoStar (NASDAQ:CSGP) is the market leader when it comes to providing information, analytics, and online marketplaces to the commercial real estate industry in the United States and the United Kingdom. The company owns and operates some of the most prominent websites in the sector, such asThe company dominates the sector, having the largest real estate research department and database in the industry. As a result, its tools and analytics make it the optimal business for industry professionals and consumers of commercial real estate, to continuously interact and execute transactions by efficiently accessing and transacting accurate and standardized real estate-related information.Despite some sub-sector of real estate facing troubles due to COVID-19, such as malls and retail properties, the demand for research tools has only grown further. Following its exceptional Q2 results, the company's shares have skyrocketed to new highs. The question that arises now is if shares have further upside, offering considerable future returns, or if there is little to be gained at their current price.Source: Google FinanceIn this article, we will:The company's financials are genuinely amazing, with revenues being subscription-based, the majority of which have a term of at least one year. As a result, the company's cash flows are incredibly reliable and uncorrelated with the underlying environment of the actual real estate market.To reinforce our point on how safe the company's revenues are, the last time the company reported negative QoQ growth was in 2009, and even then, sales were remarkably stable, as the graph illustrates. As more professionals subscribe to CoStar's services, its revenues should only keep growing, and being an essential tool, canceling the subscription is hardly an option, as the company's past sales during the Great Financial Crisis have proven.Further, since the company's operations are solely digital, not having to deal with the physical asset part of real estate, its margins are very juicy, with lots of room for potential profitability. Gross margins are around 80%, while they are still experiencing a positive, long-term growth trajectory. Net income margins have also been improving over the past few years, currently at around 20%.The combination of continuously increasing revenues and expansion of margins has led to the group's profitability skyrocketing over the past five years. However, as we mentioned earlier, shares have also surged around 36% higher YoY, attaching an LTM (last-twelve-month) P/E ratio of 102. On the one hand, the company's shares have always been ""expensive,"" having never traded below 60X earnings over the past decade. On the other hand, the current valuation of post-100X earnings is on the higher end of the company's historical average. That makes us think that future shareholder returns may be limited if one were to buy the stock at its current price.One aspect that some type of investors may not be fond of is that CoStar offers absolutely none tangible returns. The company has never paid a dividend and has never executed any amount of stock buybacks. If anything, shares outstanding have been gradually increasing due to the company's acquisition-based growth strategy. Since management has not shown any intentions in this changing, investors should only expect their future returns to be in the form of capital gains, based on the future valuation the market will have attached to the stock. Therefore, our concerns emerged, thinking that, if the market decides to price CoStar a lower multiple in the future, investors who bought today may see little to no medium-term returns. Let's put this to the test:Over the past decade, CoStar's revenue CAGR (compound annual growth rate) has been a whopping 33%. The same figure over the past five years remains strong at around 19%.Source: Company filings, AuthorConsensus estimates expect the company to return to its usual EPS growth rate of around 20%, as companies increase their expenditures on research tools post the first wave of COVID-19. EPS is also expected to grow as margins expand further.Source: Seeking AlphaSince the company delivered 17% EPS growth even during COVID-19, we believe that analyst expectation for 20% EPS growth in the medium term, assisted by the company's long-term margin expansion trend, is quite reasonable.Applying this growth rate, future expected EPS should look like the following:Source: AuthorNow, let's put to the test whether anyone's valuation concerns are any valid. Below, we have calculated the potential annualized shareholder returns, if one was to buy CoStar at its current price, based on our EPS growth projections and different future potential valuation multiples.As the table displays, even if the valuation retracts back to the company's decade-low of 60X earnings, investors would still achieve borderline double-digit returns. Further, there is a considerable margin of safety, as the stock would still deliver somewhat positive returns amid a massive valuation compression to around 40X earnings.Source: AuthorAs a result, despite the stock's seemingly ludicrous valuation, shares appear to have considerable room to run in the medium term, powered by robust profitability growth.While we consider the company's revenues to be incredibly reliable, supported by a long-term subscription-based model, some risks remain to be considered.Firstly, despite the company growing its revenues considerably during the COVID-19 economy, while also displaying incredible resilience in times such as the Great Financial Crisis as shown earlier, revenue growth may slow down amid a second COVID-19 wave. If professional real estate management firms shut down due to adverse economic conditions, the company's growth may decelerate, possibly lagging a margin expansion, and thus, its projected EPS growth. In that scenario, analyst estimates would come out as too optimistic, hurting future shareholder returns, which would likely lose their double-digit annualized potential.Further, if adverse economic conditions cause cash-heavy companies to acquire distressed properties, consolidating the market and shutting down management firms, CoStar is likely to see subscription cancelations, as the real estate market contracts. As per the company's last earnings report, there are little to no signs to support such concerns, though a minor risk remains.Finally, the company faces no liquidity risks, with its cash position of $3.55B being a considerable war chest for management to pursue future acquisitions. Long-term debt levels are substantially low at $745M, with a trivial cost of debt of 3.1% and interest expenses being covered by 51 times the company's operating cash flows.CoStar has been an extremely well-managed company, delivering spectacular returns to shareholders over the past decade. If one were to invest $10K exactly ten years ago, shares would now be valued almost 20 times higher today, beating the market by a massive margin.The stock's recent rally has raised the question of whether shares are still worth buying. As we illustrated throughout the article, the company's financials remain robust, while even a considerable valuation contraction would deliver positive returns, based on consensus growth estimates.While we never try to time the market, we are going to prioritize some income-oriented opportunities, for now. However, we will likely initiate a position in the near term, especially if shares see a dip."
4365463,24634,2020-08-06T16:57:21-04:00,"With their latest earnings announcement, CSGP should be considered as a counter-cyclical addition to your REIT portfolio.In an environment with significant headwinds, CoStar Group reported Q2 revenue growth of 16% and provided full year growth guidance of 17%.CoStar Group’s $3.8 billion in cash and $750 million accessible via an untapped revolver, provides fuel for future acquisitions.I'm raising my Best Stocks Now five-year price target for CSGP from $1,096 to $1,500.  We currently hold CSGP in our Gunderson Capital Ultra Growth Portfolio.","CoStar Group (CSGP) put together a solid quarter in a real estate environment that has not been this beaten down since the Great Recession. Shares of CSGP provide a creative and attractive countercyclical addition to any REIT portfolio. Costar's sustainable subscription revenue model and a sizable war chest for acquisitions continue to make it one of our top ranked positions.Last October, I highlighted the sustainability of CoStar’s subscription revenue model, the shares of which have risen over 41% since, while the S&P 500 has returned almost 14%. Our original investment thesis remains in place, with the risk-return trade-off improving markedly since October of 2019. The non-correlation to a large portion of the REIT market make it a fit for both growth and real estate investors. In a time of market turmoil, Costar remains a buyer. The most recent acquisition occurred virtually, with the purchase of Ten-X's commercial real estate division. The acquisition increases CSGP's footprint in the distressed commercial real estate market, an area very likely to rise as the COVID-19 pandemic continues on. Costar's purchase of Ten-X increases the non-cyclical nature of their business.CoStar Group, Inc. continues to stay high atop my rankings, currently sitting at No. 10 out of the 5,300-plus securities we follow. As you can see below, this isn't a recent trend. The shares were ranked No. 9 12-months ago and No. 128 18 months age. We remain ""very bullish"" on the shares. What makes CoStar's ranking so consistent? The primary factor is ""visible and sustainable"" growth. As CSGP's revenue and earnings growth becomes less variable, the company's ranking has risen accordingly. CoStar's subscription based revenue model continues to prove sustainable and more predictable each quarter. In Q2 2020, 82% of sales came in the form of subscription revenue. Renewal rates are a key factor in determining the forward looking visibility and sustainability of revenue growth. The higher they are, the higher the confidence interval we can put around our valuation inputs.CoStar's management initially provided analysts with a 200 basis point drop in renewal rates. However, renewal rates were down only 100 basis points in Q2 2020. A positive sign, given the trying time for the entire sector. CoStar's quarterly renewal rate was 89% and remained at 95% for clients that have been with them for five or more years. In addition to the positive renewal rate beat, the company grew revenues at 16% in the quarter. Management also reinstated full-year 2020 guidance at revenue growth of 17%. Management's history of making good acquisitions continued with huge growth continuing in Apartments.com. Revenues were up 21% with new sales up over 33% in the quarter, driven by the need for landlords to market their properties as demand challenges evolve/persist due to COVID-19. CoStar continues to show the knack for generating sizable ROI gains on acquisitions. We look for this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.During the quarterly call, CoStar management referenced the sizable cash generating financing activities completed in the quarter. After raising $2.7B via equity (2% dilution) and debt offerings, CSGP now has a sizeable war chest of $4.5B for further acquisitions in a distressed space. Something they took advantage of after the Great Recession, with the purchase of LoopNet.The company has grown into a very formidable company, with a market cap pushing $34B and annual sales of over $1.4B. In the past five years, CSGP has grown its earnings at an average annual rate of 42% per year. The consensus analyst estimate for the next five years is currently 20% per year.When I last wrote about this stock back in early October 2019, my five-year price target for the shares was $1,097. Given the current market conditions and CSGP prospects for sustainable growth, I'm now elevating that price target to $1,500. We are giving a 10% discount due to the overall market environment and execution risk involved in business acquisitions.CoStar Group remains a beacon of light in a dark real estate market. The resiliency proven in their most recent Q2 2020 quarterly report, continues to support our investment thesis. We remain ""very bullish"" on the shares of CSGP. As a proven countercyclical play in the real estate space, management is poised to pounce on a distressed market and fuel growth for the next decade.Note: All images, unless otherwise noted, show data from the Best Stocks Now database."

As the leader in the space, CSGP continues to fuel organic growth through acquisitions. Just last week, CoStar announced the $450 million cash acquisition of STR, a global leader in benchmarking & analytics for the Hospitality Industry.History tells us that growth via acquisition is often “unsustainable”, because transactions become less and less accretive to the original business. On the contrary, CoStar Group continues an excellent track record of selecting, integrating, and growing their targeted business investments.CSGP’s acquisition strategy has led to an EPS CAGR of almost 73% over the last three years. For the foreseeable future, quarterly earnings calls will surely be riddled with analysts’ questions on how STR is being integrated into CoStar’s portfolio. If past acquisitions are any indication, analysts and investors will like what they hear.There is no better example of CoStar’s knack for accretive transactions than their purchase of Apartments.com, five years ago. At the time of purchase (2014), Apartments.com had annual revenue of $86MM. As of 2Q 2019, the Apartments.com business unit had TTM revenues of $500MM (a CAGR of 40%) and three consecutive quarters of record sales. Benefiting from the continuing increase of new supply in the “multifamily apartment” sector, 70% of new units built in the last two years are advertising with Apartments.com.In June of 2019, CSGP purchased Off Campus Partners LLC, a leading online market place for student housing in the United States. Seen as a complement to Apartments.com, the purchase provides CoStar with exposure to 17MM college students in need of housing.As the prospects for “sustainable” EPS Growth continue to blossom for CoStar, so does my Best Stocks Now! App Ranking for CSGP shares.As my previous readers know, my Best Stocks Now rankings blend Fundamental and Momentum analysis. I assign a weighting to factors across both disciplines and those stocks scoring the highest make up the upper echelon of my rankings.Historically as an industry, financial analysts have looked at Fundamental and Momentum characteristics of stocks in a vacuum. In my 22+ years of experience, I have found that incorporating both into my models allows me to better avoid “value traps” and “high fliers” with great charts, but no earnings to back them up.CoStar Group continues to climb up my Best Stocks Now rankings over the last year and currently sits at 293 out of 5360 securities included in my app. 12-months ago, CSGP was at #1332 and sat as high as #5 within the last two months. In March of 2019 I purchased CoStar in my Ultra Growth Portfolio (position is up +30%) and also added it to my Premier Growth Portfolio in August of this year.From a “valuation” perspective, a P/E Ratio at 75+ can seem daunting. However, one can easily argue CoStar’s sustained 5 and 3-year EPS Growth Rates of 30% and 72% (respectively) warrant a high (if not higher) valuation. CoStar continues to widen its “economic moat” across all business units.In addition to the potential synergies Apartments.com and Off Campus Partners display, the CoStar and LoopNet offerings boast the largest audience of brokers and commercial real estate listings in the space. The CoStar Suite has 150,000 “individual subscribers”. Reoccurring “subscription-based” revenue accounts for 82% of all revenue, and these revenues grew by 25% over the TTM.The high percentage of CSGP’s overall revenue coming from a subscription-based model provides good visibility for future revenue growth and analyst estimates of a $2 increase in EPS in 2020. At the current multiple of 75, the estimated increase in 2020 EPS would equate to a $150 increase in share price.One large tailwind for growth and source of competitive advantage for CoStar is their sound Balance Sheet. CSGP carries $0 (that’s zero) Long-Term Debt on their books. The most recent acquisition of STR was done via cash ($450MM) and CoStar has another $850MM in cash remaining as “dry powder” to fuel future growth.Contrast this with debt burdened RentPath, one of CoStar’s largest direct competitors. RentPath has almost $500MM in debt, resulting in tens of millions in annaul interest payments. This debt burden has inhibited RentPath’s ability to invest in future technologies, further widening the “economic moat” enjoyed by CoStar Group.As mentioned earlier in the article, “Momentum” also plays heavily into my Best Stocks Now rankings. Since 2012, CoStar has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 in 6 of 8 years. Annually averaging 28.4% more than the S&P 500 over the last three years (39.5% to 11.1%) makes it an Alpha generating addition to any portfolio.In addition to outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 10 years (31.0% to 11.3%), the 2019 chart has also been kind to CoStar Group for a majority of the year. CSGP began a very strong breakout in February, with the 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day moving average in March. The chart began breaking down at the beginning of September, eventually finding support around the $570 level.The new support of $570 for CSGP is a healthy sign from a technical perspective and the stock is poised for another breakout if the price can get above the $604.70 50-day moving average. I am personally watching this one very closely.I remain “Very Bullish” on CoStar Group and am eager to see what their plans are for the STR acquisition. My liking for CSGP is evident by my 5-year price target for the shares. The $1,096 (+76% over the recent closing price) 5-year price target is supported by the belief that CoStar can continue to capitalize on the the competitive advantages setting them apart from their competitors. A strong Balance Sheet coupled with CSGP’s ability to execute accretive acquisitions will continue to drive sustainable EPS growth for the foreseable future."

This company is in the business of big data commercial real estate, providing information, analytics, and online marketplace services.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)If you like the IT sector and the commercial real estate space, then CoStar Group might be a good investment for you. Revenue is up 18% YoY, the company has a strong free cash flow margin of 30% and is aggressively pursuing growth via acquisition and marketing spend. I believe that CoStar Group is a good investment so long as the economy remains strong and interest rates stay low. For these reasons, I am giving CoStar Group a bullish rating.There are some risks involved with an investment in this stock that readers should be aware of. By some measures, the CoStar Group stock price is already very overvalued, making it susceptible to market corrections. In addition, much of this company's success is due to the company's apparent strong capabilities in SEM and other internet-related marketing strategies. Future changes to Alphabet (GOOGL) AdWords algorithm or search engine algorithms could disrupt CoStar Group's search placement which would have a very negative effect on company performance.STR has information and analytics tools for the hotel management industry, including hotel and lodging pricing and occupancy rates. The STR acquisition will lead to new product offerings by CoStar Group as indicated in the 2019 Q3 earnings call:CoStar Group has been conducting experiments on SEM resulting in confirmation that increased spend provides positive results.Based on the results of the SEM experiments described above, CoStar Group has decided to increase its marketing spend by $100 million in 2020. This will reduce margins by approximately 4% but the hope is that the increased spending will translate into strong revenue growth. Here is company management's rationale:When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.CoStar Group's annual sales growth rate is 18.6%, slightly lower than the 5-year growth rate of 22%.(Source: Portfolio123)CoStar Group's free cash flow margin TTM is a very strong 31%.(Source: Portfolio123)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40 - some analysts use EBITDA and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the software company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In CoStar Group's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 18.6% + 31% = 49.6%The calculation comes out much higher than 40%, indicating that CoStar Group has a healthy balance between growth and profits.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated Y-o-Y sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated Y-o-Y sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, CoStar Group is sitting well above the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is higher than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that CoStar Group is valued much higher than the average stock in my digital transformation universe, based on Sales/EV multiple.The Sales/EV multiple gives one perspective, but my value assessment changes when I substitute next year's earnings estimates for forward sales.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The results shown on this second scatter plot suggest that CoStar Group is fairly valued based on next year's earnings estimates. I have to conclude that CoStar Group is fairly valued so long as the company maintains the strong earnings estimated for next year. Note that the company-announced increase in marketing spend for 2020 has been accounted for in company guidance and I believe that has been translated into analysts' estimates. Therefore, the increase in spending should not impact my assessment.While software stock valuations have come down in recent months, they are still high on a historical basis. Uncertainties, such as the rising tension in the Middle East, trade disputes and President Trump's impeachment, could cause a market downturn. Software stocks tend to get hit hard during any market turbulence.Increased marketing expenditure of $100 million for 2020 may not give the desired boost in revenues. Revenues are highly dependent upon SEM techniques and changes to the Google AdWords algorithm may impact performance.A significant change in the economy, either heating up and causing a spike in interest rates, or cooling off and leading to reduced interest in real estate, could impact CoStar Group's future profitability.Failure to meet future earnings estimates could result in a large sell-off of CoStar Group stock.CoStar Group provides a good investment for those interested in both the IT sector and real estate. Both sectors are strong heading into 2020. CoStar Group is growing revenues by a respectable 18% and has a strong free cash flow margin of 31%, resulting in fulfillment of the Rule of 40.Company management is pursuing an aggressive growth strategy by M&A and an increased marketing expenditure of $100 million for 2020. I believe these initiatives will play out well for CoStar Group, provided the economy remains on course.By some measures, CoStar Group is significantly overvalued. The EV/Forward sales multiple is one such measure. On the other hand, the stock is fairly valued if one looks at next year's earnings/EV multiple. There is a significant risk of a reduced valuation if the company fails to meet earnings estimates for next year.I like the fact that CoStar Group stock is on the move and is pushing all-time highs. For all of the above reasons, I am giving this company a bullish rating."

Though the company supports the real estate industry, its advertising and subscription business models have largely been immune to social distancing rules and the economic slowdown brought on by Covid-19.Indeed, even when commercial landlords might still be suffering at the moment, CSGP succeeds because real estate investors still need services to source, value, and sell properties. Such investors also need to find buyers. As such, its subscription- and advertising-based models will continue to prove valuable for the company.According to its Q1 2020 report, LoopNet had its best sales quarter ever and Apartments.com turned in its second-best sales quarter ever.Strong cash position, on an acquisition streakCSGP is sitting on over $1.9B in cash, representing an increase of 56% over the same period for 2019.On May 13, CSGP announced plans to acquire Ten-X for $190 million in cash. Ten-X is a digital platform for brokers to execute transactions and counts all of the top 25 US commercial real estate brokerage firms as its clients.CSGP intends to integrate the Ten-X digital transaction platform—which includes a digital auction process with online escrow—directly into both LoopNet and CoStar, exposing the properties that brokers are selling on the Ten-X platform to millions of potential global buyers. Ten-X’s current database consists of about 400,000 buyers.The acquisition of Ten-X seems logical, but it also represents a departure in business model for CSGP. While CSGP has spent over $1B in research, to build and maintain what is considered the largest database of commercial real estate properties—there are 59 data changes per second—CSGP does not handle transactions between buyers and sellers. CSGP makes introductions via its marketplaces, and does sell analytics and accounting software, but there is no handling of funds—until now.CSGP’s future acquisitions might be in the same digital transaction space, future-proofing its revenue stream and diversifying its revenue models.Additional acquisition opportunities might exist internationally. For Q1 2020, total revenues from international operations—which include the Realla and ShopProperty brands targeting a UK audience—were $14.4M, representing a 57% increase over the same period for 2019.International revenues represent an increasing share of total revenues, jumping from 2.8% in Q1 2019 to 3.7% in Q1 2020.Even before announcing Q1 2020 earnings, CSGP was in acquisition mode. On February 11, the company agreed to acquire RentPath, a network of Internet listing websites including ApartmentGuide.com and Rentals.com, for $588 million in cash. At the time, RentPath was in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process.Issuing more common stock, strong institutional ownershipOn May 19, CSGP announced a public offering of 2,290,076 shares of its common stock for $1.25B, upsizing and pricing it the next day to $1.5B. Less than one week later, on May 26, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 343,511 shares at $655 per share.Why a stock dilution, if the stock is riding high? The cash infusion will most likely be used to fund additional acquisitions.The largest holders of CSGP stock are T. Rowe Price (11.29%), Vanguard (9.29%), Blackrock (8.09%), and BAMCO/Baron (5.72%).Total institutional ownership of CSGP stands at 96.96%. This interest is also higher than at almost any other company in the Internet Software/Services industry, which according to NYU Stern School of Business, stands at 46.60%. This higher institutional ownership generally means that there is a strong belief in the company’s management and financial performance.Based on strong business and financial performance, I predict that the share price of CSGP will hit $800 by January 2021."

That hasn't happened, and some competitors have relied on copying CoStar data to compete.CoStar is expensive, but with 40%+ incremental EBITDA margins and double-digit revenue growth, earnings will grow quickly.","Zillow (Z) has had a meteoric rise this year, but lesser-known CoStar Group (CSGP) has had an even better start to 2017. Both companies are similarly sized, but Zillow remains the more known name, both among retail investors and on the street. While these two do not compete directly, they do operate in complementary spaces: Zillow dominates the residential real estate space, while CoStar Group leads the commercial real estate industry. While rumors have swirled that Zillow would enter the commercial space for years, it seems hesitant to do so. Both companies are similar-sized, and Zillow seems content to continue to grow in the much larger residential real estate market. This leaves CoStar free to continue its stranglehold in the much more fragmented commercial space. Does CoStar have a further runway of opportunity?Business OverviewCoStar provides industry professionals and consumers of commercial real estate and apartments with data to smooth the transaction process between buyers and sellers. Data is delivered via an integrated suite of online service offerings, providing data like space available for lease, comparable sales information, tenant data, internet marketing services, analytics, while also offering online marketplaces for real estate listings and rentals. CoStar has five brands under its umbrella: CoStar, LoopNet, Apartments.com, BizBuySell, and LandsofAmerica. A large chunk of revenue is subscription-based, with data services provided primarily through the CoStar flagship brand.Like in residential, the commercial real estate has a number of parties involved in the process – brokers, property owners/managers, bankers, appraisers – all of which require standardized data and analysis in order to perform their job well. CoStar simply does it better than peers. The short case on CoStar relies heavily on intrusion by competitors, as well as the position that CoStar gets its information in an inefficient manner (manual research versus data scraping). Competition comes from VTS, Hightower, and CompStak, and there has been some pressure, particularly within information services which is seeing negative growth. While this trend is continued to persist through 2017, the integration in the back half of this year, as well as an expansion of cross-selling efforts between LoopNet (commercial real estate listing service) and CoStar (data on nation-wide listings) could drive a bit of incremental growth back into information services.Outside of data, there are no signs of a letup in growth. In the first quarter of 2017, CoStar suite saw 13% growth, bolstered by 22% y/y growth in multi-family revenue. The company had its highest quarterly sales bookings ever, up 18% despite pressure from information services. The sales team has grown 40%, so CoStar has more reach than it ever had in the past. Beyond CoStar, Apartments.com saw 22% growth in unique visitors, now up to 23M/month. Expanding on strength there, in February the company launched Apartamentos.com, a Spanish language version of Apartments.com that is being promoted on Telemundo and Univision, as well as local ad spots in top Hispanic markets. Within two months, the site has over 1M visits, which is a solid value add given there are tens of millions of Hispanics who rent in the United States, or 20% of the overall rental market. Building off ancillary market opportunities like this one, CoStar recently announced the acquisition of LandWatch, an online leader in marketing rural properties and land like timberland, farms, and ranches. This builds off of CoStar’s ownership of LandsofAmerica.com and LandandFarm.com, which gives the company exposure to a multi-trillion dollar real estate asset class here in the United States. Management believes this is a huge area with lots of potential, and CoStar is far and away the leader now in terms of revenue, leads, and search engine optimization (“SEO”) footprint.Framing 2017 Guidance, ValuationAfter the LandWatch acquisition, as well as some solid performance, CoStar raised its revenue guidance to $950M at the mid-point, up $113M from prior year levels. This implies a growth rate of 13.5%, which is a decrease from the five-year compound annual growth rate of 24%, as well as last year’s growth of nearly 18%. Still, this is a healthy rate of growth, particularly given the underlying margins within the consolidated business. Gross margin has expanded 1300bps from fiscal 2012 to 2016, which has led to incremental EBITDA margin expansion as well: 22.3% in 2014 to guidance of 28.5% in 2017. Note this is different than CoStar’s adjusted EBITDA number, which excludes stock-based compensation (I generally include its impact as it’s a real and recurring expense).CoStar had a net cash position of $275M at the end of Q1 2017, and net interest expense is basically non-existent (<$10M annually). This gives it a substantial amount of firepower to continue to pick up smaller market entrants with compelling technology, all while building its portfolio of brands. This has been working well for the company thus far, with online marketplaces (Apartments.com, ApartmentFinder.com, BizBuySell, etc.) growing from 31% of revenue in 2014 to 42% in 2016.CoStar isn’t cheap. Based on 2017 guidance, the company trades at more than 30x EBITDA. While that seems expensive, CoStar hasn’t traded this cheaply at any point in the past five years except for a short period before the start of 2017 (marked the bottom of the 35% rally CoStar has seen this year). Why so expensive? It's really a story of incremental margins, as well as overall balance sheet health. Management has pinned incremental EBITDA margin in the 40% range (i.e., each new dollar of revenue generates $0.40 of EBITDA due to leverage off the fixed cost base), with the potential for more as certain costs related to facility expansion in Richmond, Virginia wind down, as well as slowing litigation costs.Roughly $15M of expenses – not excluded from EBITDA guidance – relates to litigation with Xceligent. According to CoStar Group, Xceligent, now owned by the Daily Mail, told employees to create thousands of CoStar accounts to access data, rotating IP addresses and using proxy services to try to disguise the activity. The goal was to strip information for free and resell it as a supposed competing service. To put the level into context, CoStar found more than 10,000 instances of its copyrighted photos and data on the Xceligent website, and believes its pages have been accessed more than 1.7 million times by Xceligent. If you read CoStar’s public release on the case, it’s actually quite interesting to see the level of effort Xceligent went through to access information from its competitor. I think this statement sums it up quite well:Without these costs, EBITDA would be 5.6% higher next year, putting overall EBITDA growth above 20%. At these growth levels, it won’t take long for CoStar to grow into its valuation. 15-25x EBITDA multiples are not unusual in the SaaS/advertising space, particularly given the low capital expenditures needed to maintain these businesses, as well as general balance sheet health. Zillow makes for an excellent comp, and CoStar actually trades cheaper based on 2017 expectations (Zillow trades at 38x fiscal 2017 EBITDA), as well as having a more proven history of operating profitability and better tailwinds heading into 2018. With the roll-off of litigation and some lighter litigation expense next year, I would not be surprised to see $335M in EBITDA in fiscal 2018, which would put the valuation at the high end of that range. Like usual, you have to pay for quality, particularly in entrenched SaaS companies with fragmented competition, and I think the long case is actually a solid one here compared to alternatives.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

4091257,24157,2017-07-27T10:32:37-04:00,This company is priced like a high-flying Silicon Valley start-up with disruptive new technology.We think expectations for future profit growth embedded in the stock price have moved beyond what the company can reasonably be expected to achieve.CSGP represents a classic poor risk-reward trade off.,"Despite being in business for nearly thirty years, and having a core product dependent on manual human labor, this company is priced like a high-flying Silicon Valley start-up with disruptive new technology. With organic growth slowing and an acquisition strategy picking up the slack, we think expectations for future profit growth embedded in the stock price have moved beyond what the company can reasonably be expected to achieve. We see an unbalanced risk/reward scenario that does not favor investors. CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) is this week’s Danger Zone pick.CoStar Group has grown revenue by 18% compounded annually over the past ten years. Most of this growth (86% in dollar terms) has come over the past five years and has been heavily influenced by the acquisition of four real estate listing websites totaling $1.7 billion in deal value. 90% of the $1.7 billion went to goodwill and other intangible assets. After-tax profits (NOPAT) have grown 26% compounded annually over the past decade due to an increase in NOPAT margins from 6% in 2006 to 12% in 2016.NOPAT margin has recovered from 2015’s deep decline, which was driven by high marketing costs to promote newly acquired brands. CSGP now generates a similar NOPAT margin (12%) on $864 million of TTM revenue as it did on $212 million of revenue in 2008 (11%). This lack of meaningful operating leverage should give investors pause when considering the potential for future margin or return on invested capital (ROIC) improvement. Per Figure 1 below, CSGP has failed to earn the cost of capital for over five years.Figure 1: ROIC Is Below WACC Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsOver the past five years, CSGP has burned through $1.2 billion of cumulative free cash flow (FCF), largely due to the acquisition strategy of rolling up commercial real estate and apartment listing websites. More recently, the pace and size of acquisitions have slowed, and FCF has increased to $126 million over the trailing twelve months. Despite this increase, the stock’s 1% FCF Yield remains below the S&P 500 (2%) and its data/information provider peer group (3%).CSGP’s current 6% ROIC is in fourth-quintile of our coverage universe and is well below the data/information provider peer group (median 12% ROIC) and the S&P 500 (18% ROIC). At first glance, CSGP’s low returns seem counterintuitive given a NOPAT margin (12%) in the top-half of S&P 500 companies and NOPAT growth of 26% compounded annually over the past decade.However, while margins look reasonable, the balance sheet does not. Invested capital has increased by 30% compounded annually over the past decade, from just $124 million in 2006 to $1.7 billion today. The exploding balance sheet makes margin improvement well beyond current levels imperative to value creation. If balance sheet efficiency (e.g. invested capital turns (revenue/invested capital)) declines, then margins have to rise enough to offset that decline; otherwise, ROIC declines even if margins rise.Per Figure 2, CSGP generated a 17% ROIC in 2008 with a NOPAT margin of 11% on 1.5 invested capital turns. However, CSGP’s current NOPAT margin of 12% only translates into a 6% ROIC given the decline in invested capital turns to 0.5. Figure 3 displays the significant disconnect between margins and capital turns since the company began the acquisition campaign in 2012.Figure 2: Decline in Invested Capital Turns Is More Than Rise in NOPAT Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsFigure 3: Paying Too Much For Revenue Destroys Shareholder ValueSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings Per Figure 4, ROIC explains nearly 80% of the valuation difference among the selected data and information provider peer group. Despite CSGP’s relatively low ROIC (6% vs. 12% median for the peer group), the stock trades at a significant premium as shown by CSGP’s position above the trend line in Figure 3. If CSGP stock were at parity with the group, it would trade at $130/share – 54% below the current price.Figure 4: Correlation Between ROIC & ValuationSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsWe know from Figure 3 above, and numerous case studies, that changes in ROIC are directly correlated to changes in market value. Accordingly, we favor executive compensation plans that use ROIC to measure performance to ensure executives’ interests are aligned with shareholders’ interests. Revenue and non-GAAP performance targets can be an incentive to sacrifice profitability for volume, or worse, engage in acquisitions that destroy shareholder value.CSGP executive compensation plans are tied to exceeding their own internal expectations for metrics they define, such as adjusted EBITDA (cash incentives), non-GAAP net income (restricted stock grants) and three-year revenue growth, adjusted for stock price performance (restricted stock grants).When the focus shifts from organic growth to acquisitions and non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, it is time for investors to call out management’s self-serving incentive structure. CSGP’s executive compensation plans incentivizes management to invest capital in sub-optimal ROIC endeavors in order to achieve revenue or non-GAAP earnings targets. Per Figure 5, the implications are clear. CSGP has generated $272 million of negative economic earnings over the past five years, while GAAP earnings have risen considerably.Figure 5: Ten-Year GAAP vs. Economic EarningsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsFirst mover advantage is imperiled by failing to identify and counter new competition. While much attention has been paid to the explosion of financial technology startups, the rise of real estate technology startups has been less noted. Investors allocated over $1 billion to such firms over the past few years and almost half of the top 100 real estate technology companies are less than five years old. This increasing number of real estate technology startups seems likely to challenge CSGP’s market share or at least its margins.Given that significant margin expansion is required for CSGP to drive ROIC improvement, we view the company’s balance sheet dynamics as a meaningful competitive disadvantage. The bloated balance sheet, and resulting low ratio of invested capital turns, will make it more difficult to counter competitive pressures by competing on price or ramping up investment in new product development.Figure 6: Balance Sheet Inefficiency Represents Competitive DisadvantageSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsWhile CSGP is currently generating the highest NOPAT margin (12%) of the past decade, it came one year after posting the lowest (<2%) due to cost containment issues tied to the build out of new initiatives, particularly advertising and promotion costs. Questionable spending continued into 2016, perhaps best characterized by a $5 million Super Bowl ad (featuring rapper Lil Wayne, no less) for a very niche product vs. one with a wide audience. We remain cautious on the level of spending required to maintain revenue momentum, and think market expectations are overly optimistic on potential margin improvement.The Bull Case for CSGP is based on a continuation of solid organic revenue growth in the core commercial real estate (CRE) data business with accelerating revenue growth in the apartment listings business. We are cautious on growth prospects for the core business due to market saturation and are not sold of the long-term prospects of apartment listing websites, a business with naturally low barriers to entry.The market for CRE data is much smaller than the residential side of the market. We believe CSGP has limited upside with the largest CRE firms (C.B. Richard Ellis, Jones Lang LaSalle, etc.) while pricing the product above where many smaller, regional CRE brokerage firms find it an attractive value.The bull case is also predicated on margin expansion due to management’s focus on generating 40% “incremental adjusted EBITDA margins” on new revenue growth. We believe investors should view this flawed metric skeptically and remain focused on NOPAT margins.In order to generate ROIC above the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), CSGP must now generate a higher NOPAT margin than it ever has historically. This challenge requires significant additional revenue without growing expenses or investing significant additional capital. Even if CSGP were to operate at the average NOPAT margin of the five highest performing companies in Figure 4 (a 25% NOPAT margin, over 2x CSGP’s current level), the resulting 13% ROIC would remain well be below the average 24% ROIC generated by the same five companies.The Bear Case for CSGP is based on the combination of extremely high market expectations for future cash flows and the misleading nature of the firm’s GAAP and non-GAAP earnings when compared to economic earnings.In addition, the expectation of increased competition for CSGP’s core CRE data products from new market entrants, slowing growth in the core business due to market saturation and the questionable long-term outcome of investing heavily in apartment listing websites add to the bear case. We believe that all of these concerns have merit, but do not believe any necessarily have to go badly against the company for the stock to underperform.As such, CSGP represents a classic poor risk-reward trade off. We prefer to buy stocks with low expectations, and sell stocks with high expectations. The expectations for revenue growth and margin expansion reflected in expectations for CSGP represent a very high bar for organic growth and management execution, and ignore the various risks and economic profit realities of the company’s acquisition activities to date.The proprietary value of the core product (CoStar Suite, 49% of revenue) is debatable while the digital apartment listing business is crowded and competitive with low barriers to entry. While CSGP does operate an array of well trafficked real estate websites, the real engine behind the core database product (CoStar Suite) is the large department of ~1,600 researchers and contractors engaged in labor intensive data collection and manual entry (cold calling, public records searches, field visits, etc.).While CSGP is the dominant player in CRE data and apartment listings, we do not believe CSGP has the kind of proprietary “tech” value that occasionally results in companies selling at nonsensical multiples to much larger acquirers. Could an S&P Global (SPGI) consider beefing up their commercial real estate data offerings via acquiring CSGP? Yes. Could SPGI make economic sense of acquiring CSGP in anything other than a take-under? The math makes it very unlikely, given that a deal for CSGP at the current price would be very dilutive to SPGI’s ROIC from both a NOPAT margin and balance sheet perspective.To begin, CoStar Group has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest.After adjusting for these liabilities we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, CSGP is not worth the current share price.Figures 7 and 8 show what we think S&P Global should pay for CSGP to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. S&P Global could immediately integrate CoStar’s data to bolster its real estate data offerings and bring increased scale to the business. However, there are limits on how much SPGI would pay for CSGP to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or free cash flows being acquired.Each implied price is based on a ‘goal ROIC’ assuming different levels of revenue growth. In each scenario, the estimated revenue growth rate in year one and two equals 14%, which is the consensus estimate of revenue growth in the next two years. For the subsequent years, we use 14% in scenario one because it represents a continuation of next year’s expectations. We use 18% in scenario two because it assumes a merger with SPGI could create revenue growth through increased sales & marketing efforts and a larger customer base.We conservatively assume that S&P Global can grow CoStar’s revenue and NOPAT without spending anything on working capital or fixed assets beyond the original purchase price. We also assume CoStar immediately achieves a 20% NOPAT margin, which is the average of SPGI and CSGP’s current NOPAT margin. For reference, CoStar’s current NOPAT margin is 12%, so this assumption implies immediate improvement and allows the creation of a truly best-case scenario.Figure 7: Implied Acquisition Prices For SPGI To Achieve 7% ROIC Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 7 shows the ‘goal ROIC’ for SPGI as its weighted average cost of capital or 7%. Even if CoStar can grow revenue by 16% compounded annually with a 20% NOPAT margin for the next five years, the firm is worth less than its current price of $281/share. It’s worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 7% ROIC would be only value neutral and not accretive, as the return on the deal would equal SPGI’s WACC.Figure 8: Implied Acquisition Prices For SPGI To Achieve 25% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. Figure 8 shows the next ‘goal ROIC’ of 25%, which is SPGI’s current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to SPGI shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the most SPGI should pay for CSGP is $45/share (84% downside). Even assuming this best-case scenario, SPGI would destroy over $7 billion by purchasing SPGI at its current valuation. Any scenario assuming less than 16% CAGR in revenue would result in further capital destruction for SPGI.Despite consensus expectations for 2017/2018 revenue and EPS being lower now than one year ago, the stock has outperformed the S&P 500, rising 49% YTD and 37% over the last year. At the current price, we believe CSGP’s valuation embeds a dangerous level of market expectations due to the chasm between historical financial performance and the expected performance implied by its market value.To justify its current price of $281/share, CSGP must maintain current NOPAT margins of 12% and grow NOPAT by 13% compounded annually for the next 23 years. In this scenario, CSGP would be generating over $15 billion in annual revenue, over 2.5x S&P Global’s current revenue. The market for CSGP’s current products is simply not large enough for such a scenario to be plausible.Even if we assume CSGP can more than double its NOPAT margin to 25% (the average of the top 5 performing companies in Figure 4) and grow NOPAT by 17% annually for the next decade, the stock is still worth only $167 today – a 41% downside risk. This scenario assumes CSGP grows revenues to over $2 billion in ten years from $864 million, or ~10% compounded annually.Each of these scenarios assumes CSGP is able to grow revenue, NOPAT and free cash flow without increasing working capital or investing in fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely (particularly in light of Figure 3) but allows us to create very optimistic scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations in the current valuation are.CSGP does not currently pay a cash dividend nor have a buyback program in place. As such, the stock offers none of the downside protection that a solid shareholder yield can provide. Given the level of risk we see in the valuation and forward expectations, this downside protection could be sorely missed.Insiders own 3.7% of outstanding shares, including a 0.5% interest held by CEO Florance. Ownership has been diluted by acquisition issuance over time while insiders have been steady net sellers for well over a decade. Insiders owned 1.8 million shares or 10.3% in 2004 compared to 1.2 million today. We could not find a single open-market purchase by an insider over the same period.

It currently operates two other land and rural data services, Lands of America and Land And Farm.With the addition of LandWatch, CoStar believes it will cement its number one online network of rural real estate marketplace options for buyers and sellers. The combined group will feature 2.8 million listings, with LandWatch contributing 1.4 million listings along with 3.3 million average monthly visits.CoStar will tally more than 7 million monthly visits from the three sites, according to a company forecast.The company also has plans in process to build out the network, stating:Also, CoStar wants to ""transform the land buying experience,"" according to CEO Andrew Florance.By achieving critical mass over its three properties, investments across the network can make more sense due to their greater leverage, further distancing CoStar from any smaller, local competitors or local MLS destinations.If CoStar can streamline and improve both buyer and seller experience, it will be able to add value on top of the value of its three network components.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

In this article, we will first go over historical trends and consensus numbers for key financial metrics. Then, we will go over key topics that management will hopefully discuss in the upcoming earnings release and call.(Unless otherwise noted, all consensus numbers are from FactSet and all historical numbers are from the company.)Revenue for Q2 2018 is expected to be $294M vs $237M a year ago, implying a 23.8% growth rate. This is an acceleration from last quarter's 20.8% y/y growth, and an acceleration from Q2 2017's 14.6% y/y growth. Revenue growth has been accelerating nicely since the September 2016 quarter. Over the past three years (13 quarters), CSGP beat consensus revenue numbers 13 out of 13 quarters, providing fairly consistent top line upside to expectations. Operating Income for Q2 2018 is expected to be $63M vs $48M a year ago, implying a 31.1% growth rate. Margin is expected to hit 21.3% this quarter, up 118 bps from the Q2 2017 quarter. Margins, however, have not made much progress over the past three years. EPS (non-GAAP) for Q2 2018 is expected to be $1.31 vs $0.86 a year ago, implying a 52.3% growth rate. This is a deceleration from last quarter's 57.7% y/y growth, and an acceleration from Q2 2017's -5.5% y/y growth.Like revenue, over the past three years (13 quarters), CSGP beat consensus adjusted EPS numbers 13 out of 13 quarters.The key topics to be discussed during the up coming earnings call is the status of CSGP's LoopNet conversion. Let's go over the background to understand why this is important. LoopNet is a subscription-based online marketplace that enables commercial property owners, landlords, and real estate agents to list properties for sale or for lease. In 2017, CSGP began to transition the LoopNet marketplace to a pure pay-to-list/free-to-search marketing site for commercial real estate, and to convert LoopNet information customers to higher value CoStar Suite information services, which should both increase revenues and earnings over time.In the Q1 earnings call, management noted that they decided ""to accelerate the LoopNet to CoStar upsell conversion process"", which has contributed to revenue and earnings. CSGP's CEO noted that they are in Phase 2 of the LoopNet conversion and $40M in annual incremental contract revenue, and added that ""Phase 2 is expected to last at least 18 months, and I believe it can generate significantly more than $100 million in revenue.""In other words, Phase 2 could add ""significantly more"" than 10% to CSGP's trailing 12 month revenue (~$1B) at presumably high incremental margins, so it a big deal that investors should pay close attention to."
3038096,54942,2015-03-31T09:43:51-04:00,"CoStar has a unique and highly defensible business with strong leverage to the commercial property and apartment rental listing channel.
        A strong focus on investing in the future including revamping the new Apartments.com and LoopNet businesses to tiered pricing appears to be working.
        CoStar should capitalize on the emerging recovery in the commercial real estate markets in Asia and Europe as well as strong continued traction in the US commercial market.","As commercial property values continue to recover, it should only aid the demand for CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP), a software solutions provider for commercial real estate information, analytics, and marketing services. CoStar's product is the premier in the industry- similar to a Bloomberg Terminal for investment professionals. We think the company's revenues are a leveraged play on the improving commercial property market as well as complementary industries related to it.Several Products Producing Strong Revenue Growth DriversClients use the vast and continuously updated database of commercial real estate information to analyze commercial property values as well as gain understanding into current market conditions. They are the 800-pound gorilla of the commercial property information services market and have gained considerable scale and competitive advantage in the industry over the last several years.The company's services are being used by an increasing number of professionals within the commercial real estate realm. They've been able to augment their market opportunity by expanding their scope of potential customers to include mortgage brokers, lenders, appraisers, and even some government agencies. The nature of the business is that there is no single customer that generates a large portion of their revenue (again similar to Bloomberg or Factset).The size of the commercial real estate market is a massive asset class that is roughly the size of the US stock market at $15 trillion. The commercial market is based on closing more deals and streamlining the transaction process. The CoStar database facilitates those transactions by providing clearer insight and better fundamental information. As the technology improves further, we believe that the company will help progress those transactions better actually expanding the commercial property industry on its own. (Think of it the way buying a home was before buyers could search online the houses they wished to see).In addition to the database product, they own and operate two online marketplaces including LoopNet, a multiple listing service for commercial real estate, and Apartments.com, one of the premier apartment rental listing websites. But the core proprietary database service generates approximately two-thirds of their revenue. This revenue generation is highly sticky and recurring providing a steady stream of predictable cash flows, reducing the company's overall volatility and cost of capital. The two new businesses accounted for more than one-third of total revenue in 2014 and are growing well.We like the attractive end markets and solid franchises across the three businesses. Given that the market is largely unexploited with little-to-no strong competition, they should be able to grow unimpeded expanding out their operating margins.Cloud Service Within An Untapped Market OpportunityThe core information service alone has more than a $10 billion market opportunity with very strong margins and a 90%+ renewal rate. The company has built a combination of very difficult to imitate data points within their new web-based application. This $10 billion ignores the potential within the LoopNet and Apartments.com franchises which continue to grow double-digits.In May of last year, they revamped their sales organization hiring a new head of sales expanding out their salesforce to 220 from 140 in 2013. While they may see some near-term disruption as the new sales model is implemented, in our view over the next few years it will help increase customer penetration. The new model allows for higher turnover in their associates but provides significant upside potential to the right candidates.Combine the above with a recovering commercial real estate market, not just in the US, but also emerging signs in Asia and Europe, and you have a strong tailwind to the company's business. CBRE noted in January that the US commercial real estate market continued to gain health across all property types with lower or stable vacancy rates in the office, retail and industrial markets. As these markets continue to improve, benefiting from better positioning within the cycle and the megatrend of greater global urbanization, CoStar should continue to benefit as well.Ongoing Investments And Synergies Look To Provide Strong UpsideThe recent Apartments.com acquisition drove strong top line revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. The acquisition expands CoStar's reach into multi-family lead generation, further increasing the potential market opportunity and allowing the larger sales force to have a broader array of products to offer across the core business, Apartments.com and LoopNet. The company is still in the process of attempting to ""reinvent the space"" with a new renter-centric website with improved mapping and searching tools.Through a comprehensive integration of the site to their platform they should be able to leverage their core competencies of collecting and building content. In doing so, we wouldn't be surprised if they are able to leverage their existing business into building the most comprehensive renting website in Apartments.com in the world. This will then be self-fulfilling and give their paying advertisers the quality leads that they want when they place ads.The company is very early in its synergy generation from the Apartments.com acquisition. The company is showing early signs of success as their new marketing campaign is set to begin. Management noted that the number of unique visits to the site increased 39% since the launch. The new pricing tiers have seen strong rationalization as the diamond-level tier saw 26-times the number of views compared to a free listing.We believe that the company can ratchet-up their growth and adjusted EBITDA margins on the back of these acquisitions. It appears that the company is well on its way to bringing adjusted EBITDA margins back to 35%+ area in the next few quarters as they wring out costs and leverage their new website. Meanwhile, LoopNet has seen strong revenue growth of 20% in 2014. LoopNet will also be moving to a tiered-pricing strategy this year with multiple levels of pricing similar to Apartments.com- another upside catalyst for the shares.Valuation ScenariosMake no mistake, this is no value stock as it trades at an astronomical 48x forward earnings and 39x ttm EV/EBITDA. But we see a clear path towards much higher earnings power over the next five years as the firm's recent investments begin to gain traction and really pay off. The company's core business allows for much lower business risk given the massive moat we feel they operate within. The core business has very high renewal rates, greater than 98% if the client is with them for five years. The proprietary database is one-of-a-kind which we think allows for better pricing power for CoStar to increase prices in any environment.The company earned $1.46 last year but $3.06 adjusted for one-time items associated with their acquisition. The Street believes they can earn $2.10 this year, a 31% decrease in 2015. In 2016, the earnings should rebound strongly and approach $4 per share as they benefit from their recent investments and margins expand significantly. The company has a stated goal of $1 billion in revenue and 40% margins in 2018. But if investors follow the company closely, they know that CoStar has a history of underpromising and overdelivering. We actually believe they can achieve those results in 2017- at least on an annual run-rate basis.At $1 billion and 40% EBITDA margins, the company would generate $400 million in adjusted EBITDA. We actually think the company can generate earnings in excess of $10 per share by 2018 or 2019 through the leverage of their platform. Growth rates are exceptional and its always extraordinarily difficult in pegging when those growth rates will subside. Ntm EV/EBITDA is 45.9x, as the lower margins will mean EBITDA decline in 2015 versus 2014. But as we noted, that should ramp significantly in 2016 and 2017. In our analysis below, we used a mid-twenties multiple which is approximately half of the current rate.(Source: Author's Calculation)ConclusionIf CoStar can generate high teens earnings growth through low double-digit top line growth and EBITDA margins heading to 35% in the next year and 40% over the next three, then the company can grow free cash flow at a mid-20% rate or higher. At that rate, we think the 23x EV/EBITDA multiple is very reasonable. While these very high growth stocks tend to be volatile, this is a rare case where their core business is so defensible and unique that the recurring cash flows are very predictable and fairly secure. In addition, they are now diversifying those revenue streams with new product lines that could further reduce the volatility in the business. As such, we think there is much higher visibility for the company to reach the $10 in earnings by 2018 or even earlier."
3803106,56112,2016-01-12T15:16:58-05:00,"CoStar seems to have a long runway for revenue growth and margin expansion.The company's execution on building a leading position in multifamily marketplaces has been superb.The valuation doesn't look obviously cheap, baking in continued execution, but the business model is solid and it may never come into a range I'd personally feel comfortable with.","I can't help but think of CoStar (NASDAQ:CSGP) as the Bloomberg of commercial real estate. It's not a perfect analogy - as founder/CEO Andy Florance once explained, it is trying to be both the Zillow and Bloomberg of commercial real estate - but it's close enough.We'll start with the obvious: the company is not cheap. Compounding that, it has also shown a penchant to make pretty sizable acquisitions. But to say its execution over the past few years has been ""good"" would be understating things. This may be a stock like Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST), where if you try to wait for a fundamentally justifiable valuation without aggressive assumptions, you may risk being on the sidelines forever. Philosophically, I'm pretty well entrenched in the pure-fundamentals camp - but nonetheless, investors with more of a growth bent who don't mind paying up for a premium asset should do their due diligence on CoStar. The company seems to have a long runway ahead for continued expansion, and the network effects of its platform should grow even more robust as it does so. At the very least, its earnings calls are hilarious - a couple quarters ago, outgoing CFO Brian Radecki called the Goldman Sachs analyst ""Andre 3000"" (since he has the same name as rapper Andre Benjamin) and I'll leave it to you to find the laugh-out-loud moments on the last call.Marketplace Marketing The Headline Issue - And It's WorkingIt's sort of hard to pick what specifics to talk about on the marketplace side; there are a lot of interesting things going on. I'm not even going to be able to fit LoopNet in. Anyway, from a high level, CoStar has been making a big push into multifamily marketplaces. It acquired ApartmentFinder last year (which at a purchase multiple of sub-8 EBITDA is already looking like a steal - more on that momentarily), but the bigger driver of results in the near term has been the big marketing spend on Apartments.com. The company has put $75-80MM of incremental marketing spend to establish it as the premier brand among renters. To give you an idea of scope here, CoStar's reported GAAP operating income was ~$81MM in 2014, and its reported sales and marketing expenditures in 2014 were ~$150MM (for the whole company). So this was a big bet.How has it paid off? Well, on a variety of metrics. The website's unaided brand awareness clocked in at 40% at the end of September - edging out Craigslist as the new number one, and twice the awareness of any other competitor. The site has the highest engagement of any of its competitors, according to all major marketing authorities, and unsurprisingly, Apartments.com's revenues are growing at a very rapid clip (likely high 20s exiting 2015).The integration of ApartmentFinder is also going well, with website traffic up substantially. Perhaps more importantly, CoStar has transitioned the business from print to digital, and eliminated non-core, unprofitable revenue. While Finder is a little earlier on in the process than Apartments.com, which has had the benefit of an additional year under CoStar, it's still a great property and it seems like it will be pretty easy for management to follow the same playbook they're already using with Apartments.com.Going forward, there don't seem to be an external obstacles to growth. The competitive landscape has been ripe for a disruptor for quite some time - Craigslist was the leader not so much because it was good, but because there wasn't much else out there that was trying very hard to be better. With CoStar's data integration from its legacy core, not to mention its new found marketing muscle, it already has clear scale advantages by owning the top two sites besides Craigslist (not to mention a better product offering).There are also big cross-sell opportunities. The data being collected through the two apartments marketplaces feed into CoStar's core information and analytics capabilities, and can be sold to the same clients. As CEO Florance expalined:In The Core, Competition Likely Less Worth Worrying About Than ExecutionFor some time now, publicly-traded competitor Reis (NASDAQ:REIS) has been trash-talking CoStar on its conference calls, calling its advertising campaigns and marketplace focus ""distractions"" and claiming that it's taking share in the core information business. This is unsurprising given the history (CoStar tried to acquire REIS and was rebuffed). Obviously, I strongly disagree with the idea that the multifamily marketplaces are distractions - the cost and revenue synergies here are both very clear, you're taking the same data and generating new revenue streams off it, growing revenues with much lower incremental costs to do so - but as an analyst, it's still my job to evaluate such matters. On its face, the fact that the core information business is still posting low double-digit organic growth, and the fact that attrition rates continue to be minimal, suggests that there's nothing to worry about for CoStar.I will grant REIS that it's harder for me to identify what synergies (whether cost or strategic) are offered by business brokerage platforms BizBuySell and BizQuest, but these are not new - and on the other hand, LoopNet and the multifamily marketplaces make a lot of sense. (REIS, incidentally, has been written up several times by The Enterprising Value Investor - here and here - so you may want to check those out as a comp to CoStar.)On the competition front, there are two primary reasons why I think the CoStar's sales execution is a more meaningful and fruitful area for investors to focus on than competition.1: Real Estate Professionals Want More Data, Not LessThat the general trend of the world is towards, rather than away from, increasing use of technology and data analytics should not be a surprise to anyone who doesn't live under a rock. I scouted around a few real estate forums and other places to try to understand how and why professionals would use products by CoStar and its competitors. One of the more interesting things I found was that many subscribe to multiple services - while this specific post is a couple years old, it's still representative:Source: WallStreetOasisThis suggests that users are looking for more rather than less data - which is good for the industry at large, and specifically the scale player (as I'll get to in the next paragraph). So REIS may not really be ""taking share"" even if it believes it is. It may simply be getting sign-ups from people who use CoStar and other services too.In the longer run, CoStar has substantially greater scale than REIS or any of its private competitors, and due to the way network effects/exponential growth works, this scale advantage will get bigger (rather than smaller) over time unless CoStar does something to screw up. That's not to say that REIS is not a strong competitor (especially at certain price points, per my research) - but it seems to offer less data than CoStar on a variety of metrics, and while I'm sure REIS' management would dispute this, the popular perception appears to be that CoStar is more comprehensive. It clearly has more researchers at its disposal, and over time, I would actually worry about it eating into the few areas where REIS does have an edge rather than the other way around. CoStar's new leading position in multifamily marketplaces, for example, will continually strengthen the quality and quantity of its data in that vertical - an advantage REIS doesn't (and can now never) have.2: Penetration Rather Than Share StoryGoing back to the Bloomberg analogy, the real estate industry is not quite as far along in its adoption of data services. While Bloomberg terminals (or Capital IQ subscriptions) are ubiquitous even among smaller funds, CoStar's penetration is much lower. The following table from the Baron conference in 2013 is a bit dated, but still close enough for mental modeling:The specific numbers are not so important as the general idea that they're well behind the penetration of Bloomberg-and-friends in the securities industry. There's no reason to expect the long-term trajectory to be any different. At some point, it actually becomes pay-to-play; it may not be a competitive edge to have the data but you still have to have it because everyone else does too and you're playing against the house without it.Let's keep it simple with just one example from the perspective of a property owner: CoStar's rent optimization tools are an interesting example of this; small tweaks in occupancy or rental rate at the margin can have a big impact on the profitability of a building, and knowing exactly what comps down the street are renting for (without having to spend time and money ""secret shopping"") is, and will likely become even more, critical to being able to effectively manage your property.Valuation Tough…The company's 2020 target is $1.5B in revenue with 45-50% adjusted EBITDA margins. This obviously calls for continued execution on both the revenue and really good work margin side, but given that results have been blowing it out of the water as of late, there's no clear reason to doubt them. That said, I'm still not ready to believe margins are sustainable at that level until I see it with my own eyes (and if that means I lose out, I'm okay with that.)Also worth noting: the commercial market has been hot and management acknowledges that it's not clear what happens 18-24 months down the road. A temporary lull wouldn't be the end of the world for the company, but it might be a speed bump that the very growthy multiple can't quite afford. While the current valuation is steep, it also still leaves room for upside if the company continues to deliver on its double-digit growth opportunities. The company is obviously quite capital-light, so EBITDA will efficiently convert to FCF that can either be invested in accretive acquisitions like Finder or returned to shareholders.Finally, I would point out that a significant portion of the ""adjustments"" to EBITDA relate to stock-based comp, so if you're going to value the company on this metric, you should probably build in dilution over time.Beyond playing with the obvious numbers, I would note that management's ability to use their existing data and scale to drive significant improvements in acquired businesses is something that's hard to model, but can create significant value for shareholders. I thought this quote on LoopNet from the latest call was great:Wrapping It UpFrequent readers know that I adore founder-CEO stories, and I'm happy for Andy's success (as well as that of outgoing CFO Brian Radecki, who is retiring to spend more time with his family). That said, I'm well aware of the dangers of confirmation bias, and while I do like the CoStar story quite a bit, it's definitely valued for continued success. I would be happy to do due diligence and own it at a bargain basement price, but I'm not optimistic that it's going to get there. While it may be a flat or volatile ride, I wouldn't fault investors who use this dip (or a deeper selloff) to establish a position in a company with solid long-term prospects for revenue growth and margin expansion."

The consolidating federal government sector, however, does provide a drag on the recovery in certain markets.""The recovery in office space was led by the Denver and San Francisco markets, which saw vacancy rates fall 60 and 40 basis points, respectively in the quarter.Fewer vacancies nationally have provided pricing support too. In Q1, CBRE reported class A prices trended higher as owners offered fewer concessions to would-be leasers.Industrial markets also got stronger, with lower vacancy rates in 8 of 12 markets tracked by CBRE.Those findings were echoed by real estate tracking firm Reis (NASDAQ:REIS). Reis reported office vacancy rates fell 10 bps to 17% nationwide in the first quarter. Admittedly, those rates are still pretty high, but they're trending in the right direction.Their tepid recovery has kept a lid on new development as banks continue to prefer build-to-suit deals. The absence of new inventory helped effective rents inch up 0.07% in the quarter -- a 10th consecutive quarter of improvement.Reis also reported a 30 basis point year-over-year drop to 8.3% in mall vacancy; 1.6% lower than its peak in 2011. Strip mall vacancy rates remain high at 10.6%, but they've fallen from their 2011 high of 11.1%. Similar to offices, bank lending continues to keep a lid on new supply. Rates at regional malls are outpacing strip malls; with vacancy dropping 30 bps quarter-over-quarter while asking rents improved 40 bps. That 30 basis point quarterly decline was the biggest since 2003.While office, industrial and mall demand has remained anemic, significant growth has come in multi-family. In Q1, REIS reported apartment vacancy fell to 4.3% last quarter, down from 5% the prior year and well below the 8% peak back in 2009. Effective rents climb 0.5% in the quarter.These positive first quarter trends were reported in CoStar's research too.According to CoStar, commercial real estate pricing improved 10.8% in the past year during April. CoStar reported post recession multifamily strength is starting to spread across other property types, led by office, retail and warehouse. During April, repeat sales transaction volume grew 25% versus Q1 as time-on-market dropped 5.1% from a year ago. At the same time volume has picked up, the gap between asking and sales prices have narrowed 2.2%.CoStar's revenue and profit reflect the improving trends.Importantly, the nascent recovery in commercial markets is supporting CoStar's top and bottom line.In Q1, total sales including LoopNet increased 52% to $104 million. Remove the benefit of LoopNet and organic growth still improved 13%. Growth was led by premium memberships, which increased 16.6%.In addition to organic growth, CoStar is finding success in marketing across the two business segments. It's selling CoStar analysis tools to LoopNet property listers. And, listings to CoStar research clients. That cross-selling has added another $18.4 million in revenue since the LoopNet deal closed. To put that in more perspective, CoStar reported cross-sales had totaled 14.6 million exiting Q4.CoStar has also found cost savings more quickly than hoped. In the quarter, savings climbed above its $20 million forecast a year ahead of schedule.As we go further into the year, CoStar should get additional traction thanks to its March price hikes and a shift in subscriptions at LoopNet. Prior to the acquisition, LoopNet subscribers were overwhelmingly month-to-month. That created significant churn. Post-acquisition, CoStar has focused on converting to annual subscriptions.LoopNet's listings have also improved nicely. The number of paid listings on LoopNet has increased to 38% of total listings, up from 31% last year. This suggests the company is having success converting people from its free entry level platform.Registered LoopNet members -- both basic and premium -- totaled 7.1 million exiting March. That represents 22% more members than the prior year.Even better, the average revenue generated from premium member increased 5% to $69.08 from last year. This suggests the company is monetizing more effectively.And, while most of the company's business is here in the United States, the economic swoon in Europe is creating an opportunity to gain a foothold there before recovery. To that end, CoStar has recently launched products and services for the U.K. market.Across the entire company, CoStar counts 200,000 paying customers and 10 million unique visitors. CoStar added $13.8 million in annualized net new sales during Q1 as more people signed up for the legacy CoStar service. Subscribers to the CoStar research tools hit 100,864 during the quarter, up from 94,956 a year ago.CoStar's forecast suggests additional upside.Costar is guiding for an annualized run rate of $500 million in sales exiting this year and for $428-432 million in FY13 sales; roughly 4 million more than it had projected earlier.More interestingly, during the Q1 conference call CoStar's CFO Brian Radecki indicated he believed revenue could double by the end 2017. ""...we've essentially doubled the size of our business over the past 5 years. Fourth quarter of 2007, we were at about $50 million, and the fourth quarter of last year, which we just closed out, we were at about a $100 million run rate in revenue. Although our revenue base is much larger than it was 5 years ago, I think it's reasonable to believe that we can accomplish the same thing over the next 5 years as far as revenue growth rate goes. This would put us at about a $200 million quarter by the fourth quarter of 2017, or an annualized run rate of about $800 million, or $700 million annualized run rate in 2016.""A doubling of its revenue over the coming few years would be welcome news for shareholders, especially since margins are improving. During Q1, gross margins expanded from 64.6% last year to 67.7%. Taking out the impacts of stock based compensation, EBITDA increased 68% year-over-year. That results in non-GAAP net income of $13 million, or $0.47 per share, up from $8.2 million or $0.20 per share last year.The ability to grow the business and maintain strong margins should help provide additional shareholder friendly moves as cash builds. Currently, CoStar has $5.87 per share in cash and equivalents, or $167 million.How should you approach investing in CoStar?Shares aren't cheap. Value investors will wince at the shares forward price to earnings multiple of 44. Currently, the Street expects CoStar to generate $2.81 per share in 2014, that's up from $2.79 60 days ago. But, even with CoStar beating estimates in each of the past four quarters, it's hard to imagine shares catching value buyer's eyes anytime soon.However, homebuilders had sky high multiples when they bottomed too. It wasn't until analysts got more comfortable with double digit increases in sales that earnings projections accelerated enough to depress PE ratios. Perhaps, we'll see a similar lift occur in commercial real estate related plays.Regardless, investors should approach CoStar with caution. It trades thin at just a bit more than 100,000 shares daily. This means it could trade volatile as investors reposition. Thin liquidity also suggests shares have more running room given days-to-cover held short tops more than 12 days if these sellers cover, shares could move markedly higher.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in CSGP, REIS, CBG over the next 72 hours.

919081,24513,2012-10-11T14:25:05-04:00,,"I think that CoStar (NASDAQ:CSGP) is one of the most interesting opportunities I am currently analyzing. The company has a unique business model that helps real estate brokers to get accurate data and key property analysis that no other company can provide. A combination of strong potential growth, a wide moat, and constructive technical action makes me interested in this company at current levels.CoStar is a ""must have"" tool of information and analytic services for commercial real-estate brokers, developers, investors, and lenders as it's an innovative service provider that serves the industry with vital, up-to-date information on properties and tenants.Todd Lukasik, analyst at Morningstar, explained in his report:In 2009, CoStar acquired two firms that expanded its offerings in terms of research and analysis. Its recent acquisition of LoopNet (the largest commercial real estate listing service online) and smaller acquisitions, are a great mix to CoStar offerings. I think CoStar can create cross-selling strategies and integrate those with the existing platform.Steve McLinden wrote in the August 2011 issue of Shopping Centers Today:When Andrew Florance launched CoStar in 1987, he never imagined the combination of two of the most powerful commercial real estate data and property-listing firms. Today, Florance said that ""CoStar revolutionized how the industry researches commercial real estate and LoopNet revolutionized the way the industry markets commercial real estate.""On June 29, LoopNet announced that it surpassed 5 million registered members. Its website traffic engines record around 1.5 million monthly visitors (source: Google Analytics). With its primary focus on property listings, LoopNet's revenue results are more appealing as a marketing-driven model. As a combined entity (with LoopNet), CoStar Group should provide some economies of scale and the dominating CRE search engine should become more efficient, driving revenues to around $350 million after the first year of integration. Once that unfolds, I expect that CoStar will continue to grow revenues by around 20% and annual net income should hit $40 million by year-end 2012.CoStar generated a high revenue growth last year. The company has a negative three-year EPS growth rate and a low 2.85% ROE, but it reported the highest revenue growth since 2007. I find it attractive that CoStar has exposure to a recovering real estate industry. That, combined with projected top line growth tells me that the company could do great in the near future.Sell-side analysts estimated different scenarios for CoStar shares. Several analysts projected that CoStar could get to $85 in the next 12 months. The mean target is $77.50 based on the company´s historic valuation metrics and future growth. I do not base my investment decisions on analyst targets, but it is important to add them to my complete research routine.According to the company's fillings, its competitors are Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI), IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), AOL (NYSE:AOL), and Reis (NASDAQ:REIS).In conclusion, I think that CoStar trading at 350 times P/E ratio does not represent a value opportunity, but is one of the real estate stories I find most compelling. With five quarters of consecutive revenue growth, record annual revenue growth, strong balance sheet fundamentals (9.17 quick ratio plus only 1,17 of financial leverage), and growing institutional interest, the stock could get to the most optimistic analyst target.Data sourced from Morningstar, Zacks, Barron's, Wall Street Journal, Google, and Bloomberg.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in CSGP over the next 72 hours.

In recent weeks I have written about many of the equity REITs and most have reported growing revenue, strong earnings, and sustainable dividends, all driven by rent checks. In addition, many of the equity REITs have reported improved occupancy levels and increased confidence levels, relative to market driven fundamentals. Like the equity REITs,  many of the “fee-driven“ commercial real estate firms have also reported improved revenue and earnings results.Among the best known sponsors are Jones Lang LaSalle (NYSE:JLL), W.P. Carey (NYSE:WPC), and CB Richard Ellis (CBG). CBRE on July 27 reported an 11.7 % quarterly year-over-year increase as the company’s revenues increased by around 19.5% to $1.59 billion to $1.02 billion – another signal of growing confidence in the fee-driven sector. Jones Lang LaSalle also reported higher profit for the second quarter as revenue showed growth that provides an integrated real estate and investment management platform. As reported on July 26, Jones Lang LaSalle’s revenue rose 25.4% to $849.4 million from the year earlier quarter and the global commercial real estate advisor has enjoyed double-digit year-over-year percentage revenue growth for the past five quarters.As evidenced by the continued improvement in the REIT and commercial real estate sectors, the global recovery is continuing and, as a result, consolidation and expansion are driving forces. With increased investor confidence levels, the recovery process is improving as many smaller REITs and commercial real estate firms are being absorbed into more efficient and well-capitalized investment platforms. As an example, JLL recently announced as part of the company’s Q2 results the successful completion of the King Sturge acquisition. King Sturge is a highly regarded international consulting firm whose 1,600 employees in the UK-based based platform closed on May 31 for $ 319 million. In addition, Jones Lang LaSalle and most of the globally- and domestically-recognized institutional platforms are reporting story acquisition and advisory services pipelines. As Colin Dyer, CEO at Jones Lang LaSalle stated during the company’s Q-2 earnings call, “Our basic view of the market, as I said right from the beginning, is that this global cyclical recovery which normally runs sort of three-, four-, and five-year cycles are only about 18-24 months old. So we’re still in the recovery process …”So the global commercial real estate sector continues in its recovery phase, and as Trump explained the “core” to successful investing is to “improve your business smarts."" As a leader in intelligence, CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) is a leading provider of commercial real estate research and the intelligently innovative CoStar platform is well on its way to being considered what some have described as the “Google of commercial real estate.""Like the REITs and commercial real estate sponsors, CoStar Group is also benefiting from consolidation in the sector. As authored by Steve McLinden in the August 2011 issue of Shopping Centers Today, “If information is king, then the acquisition of LoopNet (NASDAQ:LOOP-OLD) by rival CoStar Group may signal the establishment of a data and property-listing dynasty that could rule the retail real estate realm for decades to come.”  The $860 million pending acquisition was announced in April of this year and the LoopNet shareholders approved (75% of LoopNet’s aggregate voting powers) on July 12.When current CEO Andrew Florance launched CoStar in 1987 from his Princeton dorm room, he never imagined the combination of two of the most powerful commercial real estate data and property-listing firms. And today, as Florance concludes, “CoStar revolutionized how the industry researches commercial real estate and LoopNet revolutionized the way the industry markets commercial real estate.”LoopNet, a San Francisco based provider of CRE marketing and technology solutions announced on June 29 that it surpassed 5 million registered members, including one of the largest membership community of brokers, investors, tenants, appraisers, and other commercial real estate participants. In addition, LoopNet’s website traffic engines record around 1.5 million monthly visitors (source: Google Analytics) and 7.4x the visitor traffic of the next closest website (source: comScore Media Metrix).  With its primary focus on property listings, LoopNet’s revenue results are more appealing as a marketing-driven model. Here are the most recent income results for LoopNet:In addition, LoopNet’s balance sheet has also grown into a cash marketing cow:CoStar Group’s subscriber base is more data-oriented and the LoopNet merger should provide the combined platform with in excess of 2 million active listings. Data research and marketing are highly complimentary platforms and the integration of these two “best in class” companies should create some meaningful opportunities for investors. As Chris Macke, CoStar’s senior real estate strategist, explains, “We’re continuing to enable small and mid-size businesses to compete more effectively, just as we are giving our larger clients more efficiency.”  Recently CoStar Group increased its common stock by 3.75 million new shares priced at $60.00 per share. The proceeds of around $259 million will help fund the contemplated $860 million acquisition cost. CoStar’s stock price climbed to around $73.43 in mid May 2011. Also, CoStar recently announced record revenue as its second quarter revenue increased 11.3% to $62.1 million and it raised its full-year revenue forecast to $250 million. Quarterly earnings decreased from $3.3 million (Q2-11) as a result of the approximate $5 million impact relative to legal and administrative costs associated with the pending LoopNet merger, set to close by year-end 2011. As a research-centric model, CoStar’s revenues are over 3x the size of LoopNet; however, G&A costs are much higher at CoStar as margins are impacted with higher expenses and as evidence by the historical revenue snapshot below:CoStar has become a “must have” tool for many commercial real estate brokers, developers, investors, and lenders. The innovative service provider recently unveiled a highly sophisticated iPad (NASDAQ:AAPL) application. As Chris Macke adds, “We’re basically going to give everyone the mobility of taking 900-plus researchers with them.” This “on the go” tool will be a valuable investment resource and many real estate deal-makers spend a significant amount of time out of the office. As Nick D’Argenzio, Financial Analyst at Faris Lee Investments, describes:Wrapping It UpAs Trump and Warren Buffett have demonstrated, research and business smarts are essential to investment practices. With its upcoming LoopNet acquisition, CoStar Group should continue to expand its marketing and intelligence capabilities and provide its subscribers with valuable, real-time data. By utilizing the resources at CoStar, investors and real estate providers will benefit from the consolidated expertise of over 2,000 employees in markets across the US and UK.As the global recovery unfolds, I expect the commercial real estate sector to continue to perform steadily. As capital investments in the commercial real estate sector convert from pipeline opportunities, investor confidence will continue to grow. As a combined entity (with LoopNet), CoStar Group should provide some economies of scale and the dominating CRE search engine should become more efficient, driving revenues to around $350 million after the first year of integration. Once that unfolds, I expect that CoStar will continue to grow revenues by around 20% and annual net income should hit $40 million by year end 2012. As CoStar’s announced merger with LoopNet integrates, I expect that the company’s stock price will grow to around 20% over the next 12 months. The stock closed on Aug. 11 at $ 48.32.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
244093,24222,2010-12-30T03:46:47-05:00,,"CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP) is the industry leader in commercial real estate data and analytics. It provides a data and analytics package used by practically everyone (brokers, landlords, appraisers, investors, etc.) in the commercial real estate industry.CoStar provides marketing information on buildings available for lease and for sale as well as a large database of comps, many of which have been well researched, as well as many other useful features. I don't think there is a single, serious U.S. CRE professional that is not a subscriber. And therein lies the problem. CoStar is priced for tremendous growth - so much so that investors cannot possibly not be disappointed.Historic revenues are as follows for the past five yearsBelow are estimated and actual EPS.With a market cap of $1.2 B and a share price of $57, trailing P/E is 90x and forward P/E is 54x on consensus expected EPS growth of 70%. To be fair to CoStar, earnings have been depressed in part recently because it has been relocating its headquarters to Washington, DC.CoStar's biggest problem in my mind is that it has been too successful. Everyone in commercial real estate uses it. Therefore, I find its growth prospects to be questionable. Right now a main driver in CoStar's revenue growth has been banks looking to assess their value of their REO portfolios. Once this backlog is sold, it is highly unlikely that these customers will renew.For fun, I did a back of the envelope reasonableness check. Not that I necessarily agree with the analysts but suppose I give them the benefit of the doubt about 2011 EPS, as after all it is in line with historical performance. Now suppose that over a ten year period, EPS grows by 20% per year, every year. EPS in year 10 would then be a healthy $5.52. Smack on a 20x P/E and a very aggressive 10% discount rate and the present value implies a share price of $42.57!Perhaps this is why CSGP has seen a spate of insider selling recently. Not but two weeks ago Andrew Florance, CEO, sold over $1 MM worth of shares at $55 per share. A month before that John Stanfill, SVP of Sales and Customer Service, sold $25 MM worth of shares at $50 per share. I could go on but I don't feel the need to.Growth numbers like what investors anticipate invite competition and although CoStar has barriers to entry with its well established relationships with brokers and database of researched comps, its moat should not be viewed as impenetrable by any means.Right now, CoStar is priced for perfection, and I believe that if disappointing earnings come out, this illusion will be shattered and investors may be burned. I don't necessarily recommend going out and placing a short position on CSGP, because investor enthusiasm clearly still exists. But once the near-term run-up stock prices wears off, CSGP will be very vulnerable. Invest wisely.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
1943731,60011,2014-01-14T06:57:06-05:00,,"Line of BusinessCoStar Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSGP) is a leading provider of information systems, analysis, and marketing services for the commercial real estate industry. The company was founded in the United States in 1987 and has expanded internationally into the UK and France. CoStar uses its proprietary databases and research assets to provide comparable sales information, data analytics, marketing services, and industry news. CoStar's customers include real estate brokers, landlords, appraisers, and financial institutions. In their FY 2012 10-k, CoStar boasts a blue-chip customer base including names such as CB Richard Ellis (CBG), Jones Lang LaSalle (NYSE:JLL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citibank (NYSE:C), JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Prudential (NYSE:PRU), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), and many others.Throughout the company's history, CoStar has grown organically and through a number of acquisitions. In April 2012, CoStar completed its largest acquisition with the purchase of LoopNet. Loopnet operates an online marketplace for both rental and for sale properties. Loopnet was acquired for total consideration of $883.4 million. The acquisition was funded with a combination of cash on hand, borrowings, and an equity offering.Financial PerformanceWhen I began my research on CoStar, I was surprised to see how stable the company's financial results have been over the last five years. While revenues did decline during the financial crisis, the company continued to perform fairly well, even though the real estate industry as a whole suffered greatly. CoStar fared far better than many of their customers did during 2008 and 2009.Source: SEC 10-K and 10-Q filings.Growth returned in 2010, with revenues improving over 60% from 2009 to 2012. The jump of revenues in 2012 and 2013 is primarily a result of the acquisition of LoopNet, although the company does continue to grow organically.Financial ConditionAs a service company, CoStar has few tangible assets. The company's largest assets are their database of real estate information, IT infrastructure, and customer relationships. To fund a portion of the Loopnet acquisition, the company borrowed $175 million in the form of a term loan which has been paid down to $157.5 million as of the most recent quarter end. The company reported cash balances of over $222 million at 09/30/2013 which appears to be more than sufficient to cover any debt payments or working capital needs in the foreseeable future.ValuationFirst, I put together a trailing twelve month analysis from the most recent 10-K and 10-Q. As a result of the recent acquisition, CoStar has a significant amount of non-cash amortization expense which understates Net Income. This makes normal P/E ratio analysis rather useless. Instead, I decided to focus on Enterprise Value to EBITDA multiples.Source: SEC 10-K and 10-Q filings, Yahoo FinanceThe company has a current enterprise value of over $5.1 billion, while EBITDA generation is only on an $85 million annual rate. This results in a sky high 58x EBITDA multiple. While the company's growth history is impressive, in my opinion there is no rational justification for this kind of share price.ConclusionAt their core CoStar is a data company; this comes with both benefits and drawbacks. CoStar has had the benefit of relatively low capital requirements, manageable overhead expenses, and the ability to grow very rapidly. Unfortunately for CoStar, there are relatively few barriers to entry into this type of business. While CoStar does enjoy dominance over their current competition, entrance of new companies into the market could drastically harm the business. Companies like Google, Bloomberg, and others have the access to market information, data collecting capabilities, and strong market reputations.CoStar appears to be a growing, industry leading, well managed company. I believe the company will continue to improve their revenues and profitability, I believe that the organic growth rate of the company will slow as CoStar saturates the market. I do like the company overall, however the current market valuation is simply too high. Good companies do not always make good stocks.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.
